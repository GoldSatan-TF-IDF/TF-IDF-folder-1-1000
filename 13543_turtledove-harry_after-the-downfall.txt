harry turtledove after the downfall dedication in grateful remembrance of dr jorge petronius i berlin was falling falling in ruin falling in fire falling in blood back when the war was new goring said you could call him meyer if a single bomb ever fell on the capital of the reich had anyone held the reichsmarschall to his promise he would have changed his name a million times by now goring never said a word about shells or machine gun bullets back in those triumphant days who could have imagined germany would go to war with russia not needing to worry about russia helped make the destruction of france as easy as it was and who could have imagined that if germany did go to war with russia she wouldnt knock down the slavic untermenschen in six weeks or so who could have imagined that those red subhumans would fight their way back from the gates of moscow back across their own country across poland across eastern germany and into berlin who could have imagined the war was over except for the last orgy of killing and all the fuhrers promised secret weapons hadnt done a thing to hold off germanys inevitable and total defeat captain hasso pemsel and what was left of his company crouched in the ruins of the old museum the space between the spree and the kupfergraben was berlins museum district these days the finest antiquities were in g tower next to the tiergarten people said the massive reinforced concrete antiaircraft tower could hold out for a year after the rest of berlin was lost maybe soon they would get the chance to find out if they were right a russian submachine gun burped bullets behind hasso something shattered with a crash it might have come through two or three thousand years but a curator had decided it wasnt worth taking to g tower nobody would study it any more that was for sure where was the ivan with the burp gun pemsel spotted motion behind a pile of rubble he squeezed off a short burst with his schmeisser then ducked away to find fresh cover a wild scream came from the direction of the heap of bricks and paving stones it didnt lure him into looking the russians were past masters at making you pay if you fell for one of their games like it matters hasso thought youre going to die here any which way sooner or later what difference does it make but discipline held so did a perverse pride he refused to do less than his best even now maybe especially now if the russians wanted his carcass theyd have to pay the butchers bill for it a few meters away his top sergeant was rolling a cigarette with weeds that might have been tobacco and a strip of paper torn from der panzerbar the armored bear was the last german newspaper going in berlin even the nazi partys volkischer beobachter had shut down karl edelsheim was good at making do like hasso hed been in the wehrmacht since before the war and he was still here after almost four years on the eastern front how much longer he or any of the german defenders would be here was a question hasso declined to dwell on instead he said got any more fixings im out if you paid attention to what was right in front of you you could forget about the bigger stuff till you couldnt any more sure captain edelsheim passed him the tobacco pouch and another strip of newspaper hasso rolled his own then leaned close to the feldwebel for a light edelsheim blew out smoke and said were fucked arent we he might have been talking about the weather for all the excitement or worry he showed well now that you mention it yes hasso didnt wail and beat his breast either what was the point what was the use where are we going to go you want to throw down your mauser and surrender to the ivans id sooner make em kill me clean edelsheim said at once the russians were not in a forgiving mood after some of the things hasso had seen and done in the east he knew they had their reasons edelsheim had fought there longer chances were he knew more another burst of submachine gun fire made them both flatten out they might have been ready to die but neither one was eager hasso had seen a few waffenss officers realizing germany could not prevail go out against the russians looking for death almost like japanese suicide pilots he didnt feel that way he wanted to live he just thought his chances were lousy most of the bullets thudded into the wall in back of him one spanged off something instead the sound made hasso turn around the wehrmacht captain saw a stone it was perhaps a meter across of brownish gray granite and looked as if it were dumped there at random but like the other exhibits in the museum it had a sign above it explaining what it was omphalos it said and then in greek letters what was presumably the same thing omao what the devils an omphalos he asked edelsheim a couple of russians scrambled out to drag off a wounded man he didnt fire a minutes worth of truce wouldnt matter beats me the sergeant answered animal vegetable or mineral mineral hasso jerked a thumb over his shoulder edelsheim looked then shrugged id say that honking big rock is what the hell is it its greek to me hasso said but he was curious enough to crawl over to read the smaller print under the heading when the world was falling to pieces around you why not indulge yourself in small ways if you could he wouldnt get the chance for anything bigger that seemed much too clear well the feldwebel asked the omphalos stone from zeus temple at delphi was reputed to be the navel of the world hasso read it was the center and the beginning according to the ancient greeks and also a joining place between this world and others brought to berlin in by herr doktor professor maximilian eugen von heydekampf it has rested here ever since professor von heydekampfs unfortunate disappearance during an imperial reception here two years later has never been completely explained ha edelsheim said what do you want to bet some pretty girl disappeared about the same time wouldnt be surprised but hassos eyes went back to the card and also a joining place between this world and others ill tell you karl this world doesnt look so good right now so plunk your ass down on the rock and see what happens the sergeant advised how could you be worse off no matter where you end up the shooting picked up again someone not far away started screaming on a high shrill note like a saw biting into a nail the shriek went on and on that was no sham that was a desperately hurt man one who would die soon but not soon enough to suit him good question hasso said another world or this same old fucked up place here goes nothing the patched seat of his field gray pants came down on the navelstone sergeant edelsheim turned his head to jeer at the captain while he was on the rock the whole goddamn country was on the rocks now that was pretty funny when you what the one instant captain pemsel was there the next he was gone as if by trick photography in the movies he might never have been in the museum with edelsheim der herr gott im himmel sudden mad hope surged through the sergeant if there was a way out any way out what hed told pemsel was true for himself too wherever he went how could he be worse off he turned and half upright scrambled toward the omphalos half upright turned out to be a little too high a burst from a soviet submachine gun slammed home between his shoulder blades he went down with a groan blood filling his mouth one hand reached for the navelstone reached scrabbled and just short of its goal fell quiet forever and none of the tough russian troopers who overran the museum cared a kopek for an ugly lump of rock they could neither sell nor screw nor even have any fun breaking when the omphalos seemed to stir beneath him hasso pemsel wondered for a heartbeat if he was losing his mind he hadnt really expected anything to happen he hadnt really believed anything could happen but what he believed didnt matter not any more hed mounted the stone with hope in his heart that was enough far more than enough he hung suspended for a timeless moment what did hamlet say o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams that came to hasso only later at the time if time was the word for this flash of existence apart from everything he knew only that whatever else it was it was no dream and then he was back in the world again back in a world anyhow and he was falling he dropped straight down maybe a meter maybe two surely no more than that or he would have hurt himself when he landed or maybe not he came down in a bog that put him in mind of the pripet marshes on the russo polish border training told as soon as he knew he was hitting water and mud his hands went up to keep his weapon dry a schmeisser was a splendid piece when it was clean but it couldnt take as much crud in the works as a soviet ppsh or a british sten he floundered toward the higher ground ahead the setting sun or was it rising flooded the unprepossessing landscape with blood red light and that was one more impossibility because it had been the middle of the day in berlin hasso shrugged and squelched on maybe hed got shot the moment he plopped his can down on the omphalos maybe this was nothing but a mad hallucination before the lights went out for good but he had to act as if it was real hed spent too many years fighting to quit now hed been wounded three times he was damned if hed throw in the sponge for no good reason maybe im damned anyway he muttered he shrugged again if he was he couldnt do anything about that either he hauled himself up onto dry land as he did he realized it was artificial not a natural feature of the swamp at all it was a causeway long and straight and not very wide with a well kept dirt road atop it somebody needed to go from here to there in a hurry and the swamp happened to lie athwart the shortest way somebody badly needed to get from here to there in a hurry this causeway would have taken a devil of a lot of work to build he stooped to examine the road the long shadows the sun cast it was setting definitely setting showed no trace of tire tracks or tread marks from panzers or assault guns they did show footprints and hoofprints some shod others not and there were unmistakable lumps of horse dung hand tools then almost certainly which meant hasso pemsel shrugged one more time he had no idea what the hell it meant it meant he wasnt in kansas anymore hed seen the wizard of oz when it got to germany just before the war started a flash of motion on the road off to the east before hasso consciously realized he needed to do it he slid into cover sprawling on the steeply sloping side of the causeway all the time hed spent fighting the ivans had driven one lesson home down at a level far below thought unexpected motion spelled trouble big trouble ever so cautiously schmeisser at the ready he raised his head for a better look as he did he wondered how many magazines for the machine pistol he had left four or five he thought and what would he do once he used them up he grunted out a syllables worth of mirthless laughter hed damn well do without that was what somebody was running up the road toward him no not somebody several somebodies one in the lead the rest between fifty and a hundred meters behind the leader ran with an athletes long loping strides the others pounded along showing not much form but great determination the dying sun flashed off sharpened metal in their hands they were armed then the man in the lead didnt seem to be a few seconds later as the leader drew closer hasso sucked in a short sharp startled breath that was no man running for his life it was a woman running for hers she was tall and blond and slim and the rags she wore covered enough of her to keep her technically decent but no more if she hadnt been very weary weary unto death she would have left her pursuers in the dust her build and her gait said she was used to running in a way they werent and never would but her sides heaved sweat plastered her fair hair to her face plainly she was at the end of her tether how many kilometers had she run already knowing it would be the end if she faltered even once hassos hackles rose when he got a good look at the men who thudded after her they were short and squat and dark with curly black hair and the shadows of stubble on their cheeks and chins one of them carried a hatchet one a pitchfork and the third what hasso at first took to be a sword but then realized was a stout kitchen carving knife the woman glided past him her head didnt turn his way she must not have seen him dive for cover not surprising not with the sun in her face the way it was she didnt look back to see how close her enemies were all her attention was on the way ahead he admired that even more than he admired her elegantly chiseled features she would go on as long as she could so she proclaimed with every line of her body but her harsh panting said she couldnt go on much longer her pursuers were worn too but not so worn as she they could still talk to one another as they ran their harsh guttural language meant nothing to hasso he didnt think it was russian but then he hadnt really believed these were the pripet marshes either deciding what to do and doing it were quick easy almost automatic just before the three shambling men came abreast of him he rose up a little and gave the leader the one with the pitchfork a short burst in the chest as the fellow crumpled hasso shot the man with the carving knife the swarthy man with the hatchet showed admirable presence of mind he flung the weapon at hasso just before one more burst from the schmeisser caught him in the midsection the wehrmacht captain ducked the hatchet spun past less than half a meter above his head it splashed into the swamp he scrambled to his feet ready to finish off any of the three who still showed fight but they were all dead or dying fast he looked down the road in the direction from which theyd come were more like them trotting along in their wake he didnt see anybody else not for a couple of kilometers slowly he turned toward the woman shed stopped when she heard the gunfire now she was trying to catch her breath her head down her hands on her knees after most of a minute she straightened looking at him with as much curiosity as he felt about her curiosity wasnt the only thing he felt shed seemed striking as she ran past now he saw that striking was much too mild a word she was improbably outrageously beautiful if she was only a product of his wild imaginings in the split second before the pain of a mortal wound seized him he had more imagination than hed ever imagined she said something whatever tongue it was he didnt understand a word of it he didnt care he could have listened to her forever no matter what she said her voice was a honeyed caress but she stopped and waited expectantly he realized he needed to answer im sorry i dont understand he said in german a tiny frown creased the perfect skin between her eyebrows she didnt follow him either he said the same thing in french remembered from school and then in bad russian acquired at the front she shook her head each time she slowly walked toward him little by little he realized what a mess he was filthy unshaven in a wet muddy shabby uniform he would have apologized if only he knew how she pointed to the dead men then to his machine pistol and said something that had to be a question you killed them with thatwhat else could she be asking he nodded ja i did for em all right he stuck to german from then on why not at least hed be sure of what he was saying he jabbed a thumb at his own chest and told her what his name was pemsel hasso pemsel she repeated thoughtfully his name had never sounded so good as it did in her mouth she laid an index finger between her small upstanding breasts velona she said he touched the brim of his coal scuttle helmet echoing velona he couldnt make her name seem nearly so wonderful as she did his pemsel hasso pemsel she said again and then something else that had his name in it when he just stood there she laughed at herself she must have forgotten he couldnt follow what she was saying what she did next didnt need any words she pulled off the torn and tattered shift hasso couldnt come up with a better name for it she was wearing spread it out in the middle of the road and naked lay down on it she beckoned to him to join her his jaw fell he almost dropped the schmeisser what went through his mind was youre a hero pal heres your reward beats the hell out of the knights cross doesnt it even with swords and oak leaves no his imagination definitely didnt work this well hed saved a couple of german women from death or a fate worse than or both together they didnt want to screw him afterwards to say thank you they wanted to go off somewhere and have hysterics that seemed reasonable enough to him but velona was plainly different all kinds of ways she played by way different rules when she spoke again it was with a touch of impatience what are you waiting for big boy come and get it in case he was a congenital idiot she twitched her hips and opened her legs a little he looked up the road again nobody he looked down the road also still nobody the two of them were the only live people for quite a ways it was lay her or jump in the swamp if youre sure he stopped feeling dumb if she wasnt sure she was auditioning for a stag film shed get the part too awkwardly still wary he got down beside her she nodded as if to say its about time when he took off his clothes he was careful to keep himself between her and them and between her and the schmeisser but she wasnt interested in the uniform or the weapon not then her hands roamed him soft and knowing at the same time he stroked her too this all felt more surreal than a max ernst painting but he didnt care if it was a figment of his dying imagination his brains were working overtime he was less and less inclined to believe that though everything was too vividly detailed from the grittiness of the hard packed dirt to the sweaty heat of velonas flesh to the way her breath stirred the hair above his left ear he rapidly discovered that under her curves she had muscles to rival an olympic athletes well the way she ran had already told him that much he was broader through the shoulders and probably outweighed her by twenty kilos but he wasnt sure which of them was the stronger then she kissed him and he stopped caring had he run all that way he thought his mouth would have been dry as dust hers was warm and moist and sweet his hand slid between her legs she was warm and moist there too she made a small sound of pleasure down deep in her throat her hand closed on him he made the same sound only an octave deeper he was disappointed when she broke off the kiss but only for a moment limber as an eel she bent to take him in her mouth he wasnt sure hed ever had a woman do that before without being asked he also wasnt sure how much he could stand without exploding the thought had hardly crossed his mind before she pushed him down and over onto his back and impaled herself on him she rode him like a racehorse she made that pleased noise again when his hands closed on her breasts she teased his nipples too he hadnt thought they were especially sensitive but they were they were as his pleasure rose toward the crest that said he would have to come soon he decided he would rather drive things himself when he rolled the two of them over velona let out a startled yip and then laughed so did he he poised himself above her and thrust home again and again her breath came faster than it had when she was running her face went slack with pleasure she gasped pemsel hasso pemsel she cried in a high shrill voice her nails scored his back a wordless groan escaped him at the same time he drove deep one last time and tried to stay at the peak forever whether he wanted it to or not the world returned the way it always does velona said something to him he couldnt understand it of course but he understood when she mimed pushing him off her he had to be squashing her and that ragged shift wasnt much to protect her from the ground he went back onto his knees she got to her feet and brushed as much of the dirt off her behind as she could before she put the shift back on hasso also stood and did the same thing his clothes were more complicated than hers he took a little longer to dress by the time he finished she was walking back toward the men hed killed she didnt let lovemaking distract her long her gesture could mean only one thing pitch them in the swamp two of them wore rawhide boots he pointed to those and then to her feet did she want them if they fit velona shook her head and looked revolted grenye she said pointing to the corpses grenye to her the word must have explained everything it didnt explain one damn thing to hasso but he wasnt inclined to be critical and velona wasnt fussy about grabbing grenye boots whatever those were only about wearing them into the water and muck went the bodies and the knife and pitchfork the bodies would come back up soon enough hasso knew that all too well if velona also did she didnt care she nodded as at a job well done where now hasso asked her as if she understood and maybe she did for she linked arms with him and started west down the road the same direction shed been going before but not the same killed pace as the sun kissed the western horizon hasso slipped his arm around her waist she smiled and swayed close and rested her head on his shoulder for a moment he had no idea what hed just volunteered for but she made one hell of a recruiter castle svarag struck hasso as well medieval what else would a castle be it had no running water though there was a well it was a long drop from the seat in the garderobe to where the stuff landed but that was as close as the place came to sophisticated plumbing fires and torches and candles and oil lamps gave light after sundown food was either very fresh or else smoked or salted or dried none of velonas people knew anything about canning or refrigeration had hasso fallen into this world in he would have thought it too primitive to bear coming here in hed done without running water and flush toilets and electricity and refrigeration for five and a half years of war he missed them much less than he would have back in the days when he took them for granted and there were compensations hed never had in poland or france or north africa or on the eastern front velona kept coming to his bed she started teaching him the local language and she vouched for him with the castles commander a dour noble hasso thought named mertois hasso wouldnt have wanted mertois angry at him as the commandant was close to a head taller than he was and proportionately broad through the shoulders average men among the lenelli velonas people stood close to two meters tall and some like mertois were considerably bigger than that they had yellow hair blue or green or gray eyes granite cheekbones and chins like cliffs back in the reich hasso had been a big man here he was decidedly short the lenelli had never heard the name of aryan but they exemplified the ideal to all of them but velona the first impression seemed to be that he barely measured up then one a bruiser called sholseth who was almost mertois size picked a fight with him hasso got the idea it was as much to see what he would do as for any real reason except maybe boredom out of what passed for fair play with the lenelli sholseth made sure hasso understood they were fighting before he uncorked a haymaker that would have knocked max schmelings head off it would have had it landed but it didnt unlike max schmeling hasso wasnt in the ring he didnt have to box with sholseth wehrmacht combat instructors taught all sorts of dirty but highly effective techniques action on the russian front was a whole separate education hasso grabbed sholseths arm just behind the wrist half a second later sholseth flew through the air with the greatest of ease the big lenello had time to begin a startled grunt but it cut off abruptly when he slammed down on the rammed earth floor of castle svarags great hall hasso had hoped that would put him out of action but he started to get up the wehrmacht officer kicked him in the ribs and had to skip back in a hurry for a long arm snaked out and almost tripped him up he didnt want to get locked in a grapple with sholseth not even a little bit the boot to the ribcage made the lenello flatten out again hasso darted in and kicked him once more this time in the side of the head not too hard hard enough though sholseth groaned and went limp a pitcher sat on a table a few meters away hasso walked past half a dozen staring lenello warriors picked it up and poured two liters of not very good beer over sholseths head the big man groaned and spluttered his eyes opened he made a horrible face and clutched at his temples the wehrmacht officer nodded to himself concussion sure as hell sholseth wouldnt be worth the paper he was printed on for the next few days another lenello said something to hasso it was probably how the devil did you do that you shrimp with an inward sigh hasso made a gesture inviting him to find out for himself beyond a shadow of a doubt one of these big apes would cream him but how many he smashed up first would go a long way toward showing where he fit in the pecking order he flattened four and had a fifth on the ropes before the fellow landed a blow to his solar plexus that folded him up like an accordion he couldnt do a thing about it either the lenello was groggy but not too groggy to fall on him like a landslide and thump him while he couldnt fight back hasso got paid back for some of what he did to the soldiers friends hed known that would happen too which didnt make it any more enjoyable while it was going on when he could he got up and washed the dirt and blood off his face the lenelli pounded his back which hurt almost as much as getting beaten up had they pressed mug after mug of that indifferent beer into his hand he drank everything they gave him maybe it would numb him a little any which way it was less likely to give him the runs than the local water sholseth asked him something the battered would be tough guy was drinking beer too his head had to be killing him hasso didnt understand the question but it was bound to be something like where did you learn all that stuff another lenello made cut and thrust motions and shook his head as he asked his own question that had to be so how come you cant use a sword worth a damn hasso shrugged nobodyd ever bothered teaching him a weapon like that he had no trouble with a spear if you could fight with a bayoneted rifle and an entrenching tool spear drill was a piece of cake he could use a crossbow too once he figured out how to crank it up to reload its bolts flew flat and straight like bullets the lenelli even had sights to aim along a hunting bow on the other hand to call him hopeless gave him the benefit of the doubt someone in the watchtower winded a horn one long flat note the warriors relaxed that meant more lenelli on the road approaching castle svarag a series of shorter blasts would have been trouble the grenye sneaking around again hasso wasnt sure how things worked around here he hadnt seen enough of this world yet he hadnt seen any of it in fact except for the swamp and the stretch of road between where hed rescued velona and this castle but the lenelli seemed to have untermenschen problems like the reichs in russia here on the frontier and this was the frontier plainly the big blond warriors controlled towns castles and when they traveled in force the roads between them the countryside belonged to the local barbarians shouts came from outside the castle who was who around here was pretty obvious even so the newcomers and guards went through the rigmarole of sign and countersign that made hasso chuckle which hurt his sore stomach and bruised ribs he might be in another world but a lot of army rituals stayed the same what worked one place worked in another people remained people chains rattled and clanked as grenye servants or maybe they were slaves lowered the drawbridge horses hooves thudded on the thick oak timbers faced with iron on the outside to ward against fire as the new arrivals rode in as one man the lenelli in the great hall went out to see what was what they were as eager for news and gossip as any garrison at an isolated post and they didnt have radios everybody turned out to see what was what in fact everybody who was tall and fair anyhow mertois tramped out half a minute or so behind the warriors in the great hall more soldiers came out of the stables velona and other women took places between and in front of the men velona started to smile at hasso but the expression froze when she saw hed been knocked around he nodded as if to tell her it was all right you should see the other bums he thought haifa dozen men had come in five were knights in slightly rusty chainmail they were all stamped from the same mold as the soldiers in the garrison the sixth was something else he rode a unicorn hasso blinked and rubbed his eyes unicorns were the stuff of myth and legend except this one wasnt its horn was silvered so were its hooves they all shone even brighter in the sun than the unicorns pure white coat and mane and tale its lines made the big heavy horses around it look as if they were carved by a sculptor who was earnest well intentioned and more than a bit of a blockhead the rider made the knights seem the same way he wore polished jackboots that would have gladdened the heart of an ss man on parade tight suede breeches and a clinging shirt of shimmering bright green silk that should have looked effeminate but somehow didnt like the unicorns horns and hooves his conical helm was silvered and flashed in the sunlight only his sword a businesslike cross hilted weapon in a battered leather sheath said he wasnt a refugee from the set of a bad movie graceful as a cat he slid down from the unicorn hasso expected him to march up to mertois and start giving orders his harsh handsome features were those of a man used to being obeyed and at once but the stranger strode over to hasso himself he didnt hold out both hands to clasp as the lenelli usually did in greeting instead he sketched a star in the air between them it glowed with gold fire for a moment before fading hassos eyes widened even more than they had when he saw the unicorn unicorns were merely legendary this was flatout impossible but it happened anyway you saw the stranger demanded in lenello yes he spoke his own language but hasso understood as readily as if it were german that was impossible too but as true as the glowing golden star as true as the unicorns switching tail i saw all right how the devil did you do that hasso pemsel answered in german and the man in boots and breeches and silk also understood him magic the fellow said matteroffactly hasso started to get angry before realizing the newcomer wasnt kidding im aderno thirdrank wizard in king botteros service you will be the outlander velona spoke of when she summoned me velona summoned you not mertois hasso wondered whether hed figured out anything at all about what was going on here he didnt even understand the chain of command yes velona of course aderno took it for granted whether hasso did or not now tell me what color did the star seem to you gold hasso answered automatically gold something yes but gold that was enough to shake aderno out of his air of snooty superiority he stared down his long straight nose at the german are you certain why would i lie and what difference does it make anyhow at last somebody who could understand hasso when he said something and the cocksure son of a bitch didnt want to believe him hasso wondered if he could do unto aderno as hed done unto sholseth maybe he could knock sense into that long arrogant head if he couldnt insert it any other way you dont even know that wasnt a question aderno turned away and spoke to velona when he did his words were only gibberish to hasso his magic seemed as sensitive and as adjustable as a radio tuner hasso couldnt follow velonas reply either he sighed and shrugged she was the one he really wanted to be able to talk to and he still couldnt life seemed to work that way aderno gave his attention back to him tell me how you came here that seemed clear enough hasso did he couldnt see any reason why he shouldnt and talking about it at last being able to talk about it was a release and a relief when he finished aderno sketched another sign in the air this one glowed the color of the wizards shirt the truth he said sounding faintly surprised why would i lie hasso asked again for the first time aderno looked at him as if hed said something stupid outlander man from another world there are as many reasons as there are fish in the sea as many reasons as there are leaves on the trees you could have been part of some new wicked plot the grenye have hatched no velona broke in one word of lenello hasso could follow no the wizard agreed but it could have been so which is why i applied the truth test or you could have been one of our evildoers on the run looking to cover your tracks with a tale too wild to be disbelieved or you could have been a disgraced man looking to start over somewhere far from where you were born and using a strange story likewise not too hard to pretend not to understand or speak but no you are not pretending and if you saw gold in the air you still havent said what that means hasso reminded him it means your life and mine and everyone elses get more complicated than any of us might wish aderno said hasso wanted to hit him for talking in circles decking a genuine wizard though didnt strike him as smart aderno went on and it means you cant stay in this miserable backwater post mertois grunted at that aderno ignored him i shall take you to drammen seeing hasso look blank he condescended to explain to the capital ii once the lenelli made up their minds they didnt screw around inside of an hour hasso was on a horse riding west he wore his own short boots trousers and helmet grumbling still mertois doled out a padded shirt a mailshirt to go over it and a thin surcoat to go over that the castle commander also gave hasso a sword he said something as he did for decoration only hasso guessed dont try to use it not if you want to go on breathing he still had his schmeisser as long as his ammunition lasted he was the toughest guy in town even if only velona knew it enough rounds for a few hours against the russians or a few minutes if things got hot how long would it last here longer anyhow because none of these bastards had a weapon to match it not only aderno and his escort accompanied hasso at the wizards urging or more likely command mertois sent along half a dozen of his men and velona rode out of castle svarag too which pleased hasso for all kinds of reasons it wasnt just that they were lovers though that sure didnt hurt but she was his sheet anchor here everything that had happened to him since happened because she ran by right after he squelched up onto the causeway the machine pistol and the extra magazines fascinated aderno hasso made sure he unloaded the schmeisser before he let the wizard handle it otherwise aderno might have killed half the people near him just by clicking the safety off squeezing the trigger and spraying the weapon around the schmeissers cartridges interested aderno even more than the piece itself did he held them up close to his face to examine them much closer than hasso would have been comfortable eyeing them himself he hefted first one then another then another at last reluctantly he nodded and handed them back to hasso your wizards understand the two laws well he said which two laws hasso asked he would rather have told velona what beautiful eyes she had but he didnt know nearly enough lenello for that talking to a wizard about sorcery wasnt the same thing not even close he did succeed in surprising aderno anyhow adernos eyes were almost as blue as velonas but hasso wouldnt have called them beautiful haughty struck him as a much better word do the wizards in your world guard their secrets so closely then aderno asked sounding jealous you dont even know what the laws are you dont get it hasso said we havent got any wizards till i sat down on the omphalos i didnt believe in magic weve got scientists weve got factories he wondered how the translation spell would handle those two words if that were so i would call you as mindblind as the grenye aderno said but you saw gold so i know this cannot be true he frowned studying hasso like an entomologist looking at a new species of flea through a magnifying glass maybe the very laws of your world are different forbidding magic or making it difficult maybe hasso shrugged he neither knew nor cared and he didnt want to go back and experiment an ivan with an evil temper would plug him if he did he glanced over at velona no he didnt have the words yet but one of these days he would in the meantime he was stuck with the wizard tell me about these laws then you truly do not know of the laws aderno asked and hasso shook his head they happened to be riding past a grenye farm the lenello wizard waved towards it without them without being able to use them we would live like that the farm put hasso in mind of what hed seen in russia if anything it was even more backward even more disorderly the man of the family was chopping wood every few strokes he would swig from a jug hasso wouldnt have wanted to get lit up while swinging an axe but the peasant didnt seem to care he paused to bow as the lenelli went by then attacked the wood with fresh ferocity his wife was weeding in the vegetable plot by the shabby thatch roofed farmhouse her butt stuck up in the air aderno mimed swatting it hasso chuckled he and his men had played those games with peasant women some of the gals liked it others well too bad for them a swarm of children from almost grown to barely past toddling worked around the farm a boy with a beard just starting to sprout tended a handful of pigs in a stinking muddy wallow he also bowed to his overlords hasso didnt like the look in his eye when he straightened a girl a year or two younger tossed grain to some chickens she might have been pretty if you fattened her up and scrubbed off a lifetimes worth of dirt would anyone ever bother would it ever occur to anyone that he ought to bother hasso didnt think so you think these are bad you should see the wild ones aderno said these are partway civilized or at least tamed they know better than to yap at their betters anyhow hasso wasnt so sure of that he cared for the way the peasant swung the axe no more than he liked the smoldering fury in the youths eyes they might be cowed but they seemed a long way from tame and those bastards who were chasing velona they were wild wild yes aderno answered without magic without hope of magic too stupid too mindblind to harness the laws of similarity and contagion there hasso finally had names for the two laws names alone didnt help much though what do they mean he asked aderno clucked like a mother hen he really couldnt believe hasso didnt know plainly giving him the benefit of the doubt the wizard said well youre still a stranger here he might have been reminding himself the law of similarity says that an image is similar to its model and if you do something to the image the same thing will happen to the model actually connecting them in a magical way is more complicated but thats the idea do you understand i think so hasso said gypsies and other frauds used the same notions in the world he knew but they didnt really work there here well who could say what was he doing here if magic was nothing but a load of crap and the law of uh contagion an obvious truth that things once in contact remain in contact in a mystical sense of course aderno replied aber naturlich hasso said dryly and if that wasnt real pure one hundred percent bullshit then maybe it was something else little by little we use our magic and our strong right arms to teach the grenye that even dreaming of standing against us is far beyond their feeble abilities aderno said sooner or later they will learn that would probably be good hasso said all the same he wished he had eyes in the back of his head a wish hed also had many times in russia the squat dark men whod been chasing velona hadnt learned their lesson yet he was sure of that and thanks to his schmeisser they never would now later that afternoon they stopped in a peasant village it reminded hasso too much of the hamlets hed gone through in the soviet union oh the details were different and it wasnt just that modern things were missing no phone poles no electric wires no radios no tractors or beat up cars the huts of wattle and daub or of stones chinked with mud didnt look much like their russian counterparts and the grenye looked more like gypsies or jews than slavic peasants but the air of rundown despair pervading the place could have come straight from the ussr much the biggest and finest building in the village was the tavern four or five men sprawled in drunken stupor near the entrance a tipsy man staggered out singing something hasso couldnt understand it sounded like a dirge though another man with a pinched worried face scuttled in if he wasnt on his way to drown his sorrows hasso had never seen anybody who was all the grenye who could stay on their feet bowed to the lenelli across the road from the tavern stood a smithy the front was open to the air the better to let smoke and heat escape the smith wasnt very tall but hasso wouldnt have wanted to tangle with him he was a mass of muscle heavy hammer in his right hand leather apron and gauntlets warding him from sparks he too bent double as his overlords rode past what he thought while he did it was perhaps better not contemplated what would happen if we went into the tavern hasso asked aderno the tapman would serve us the wizard answered if he thought we werent looking he might spit in the beer if he really thought we werent looking he might piss in it but he would serve us is there any way you could make the grenye like you the german asked recalling russia again now aderno laughed in his face certainly outlander we could fall over dead right here we could come down with a plague that makes the flesh drip off our bones we could burst into flames an earthquake could make the ground open up and swallow every last one of us the grenye would like us fine after that why do they feel that way about you hasso knew why the russians felt that way about his own folk the germans in the ussr had earned such feelings since they felt the same way about slavs and acted like it and now stalins hordes were avenging themselves inside the reich something hitler surely never imagined when he hurled the wehrmacht and waffenss at the soviet union in theyre only grenye aderno said who cares why they feel the way they do it doesnt matter not even a counterfeit coppers worth plainly he thought hasso was wasting his time with such questions the wehrmacht officer tried one more how long have you ruled them here a couple of hundred years something like that aderno answered velona would know better than i do long enough to teach them they cant beat us that matters whos strong and who isnt once you know that you know everything you need to know i dare you to tell me its any different in your world well no hasso said the answers arent always what you want though they have been for us aderno said remembering the grinding german retreat across eastern europe remembering the doomed last stand in berlin hasso envied the lenello his certainty instead of stopping in the grenye village the travelers rode on till they came to another lenello garrison castle kalmar was as close to identical to castle svarag as made no difference even the commandant might have been mertois first cousin he was deferential to aderno and even more so to velona because they vouched for hasso the commandant also treated him with tolerable respect velona got the best guestroom in castle kalmar adernos down the hall was only half as big hasso wasnt sure whether the lenelli here thought he was velonas aide or her lover or her pet for that matter he wasnt sure what she thought herself her lover he certainly was hed never even dreamt of a woman like her before brazen as a man strong as a man pretty in a way that made every movie star and chorus girl hed ever seen seem insipid beside her if you could trap fire and high explosives inside a sweetly curved skin that was velona and she gave herself to him and took from him without the slightest reservation heart slowing in the afterglow he asked her why there was another lenello word hed picked up why what velona asked her candied mouth only a few centimeters from his why this hassos wave encompassed everything from castle kalmar as a whole to her naked thigh still splayed over his she smiled when his hand came to rest there he smiled too but at the same time he marveled at the firm power of the muscles under his fingers why not she answered which annoyed him more than it helped then she said something else too fast and complicated for him to follow he shrugged she tried again more slowly this time he caught adernos name and a couple of other words she was asking if he wanted the wizard to translate he shook his head started to realize how very little he wanted that no dammit i need to talk to you he said in german he couldnt put that into her language yet he pointed at her to get the idea across even without words she could understand she grabbed his hand and set it on her breast it tightened automatically her nipple stiffened her breath sighed out she kissed him things went on from there they didnt talk which didnt mean they didnt communicate you could say an amazing number of things with touches and caresses and sighs maybe the things you said that way mattered more than the ones that needed words but hasso was stubborn after they gasped their way to a second completion velona turned her back on him and started to breathe deeply and regularly she even fell asleep afterwards like a man hasso asked why this again she swung toward him again because it feels good because i like it because i like you she said using gestures to eke out the words then she said something else he wasnt sure whether it was are you happy or are you satisfied he was still too perplexed to be perfectly happy he couldnt deny he was satisfied though he mimed limp boneless exhaustion velona laughed and poked him in the ribs then she rolled back onto her other side he got the unmistakable impression she wouldnt be happy if he bothered her again so he didnt he listened to her fall asleep instead it didnt take long and it didnt take long for his own eyes to slide shut either when he woke the next morning his legs ached he moved like an arthritic chimpanzee his thighs werent hardened to riding velona quickly figured out what was wrong with him and he learned how to say saddlesore in lenello breakfast was smoked sausage hard bread cheese onions and sour beer hasso missed coffee or tea or even the nasty ersatz products germany had used since the start of the war he tried to explain what they were like to aderno and ran into a blank wall of incomprehension we make hot infusions from leaves and roots to fight fevers or ease toothache or soothe a sour stomach the wizard said is that what you mean well no hasso answered with a mournful sigh he would have missed his morning jolt of energy even more if he hadnt had to do without it as shortages squeezed the reich beer was all right in its way but it didnt pry his eyelids apart like a big steaming cup of coffee if you can conjure some out of the world from which you came we might be able to use the law of similarity to make more for you aderno said fat chance hasso said im no wizard you may not have the training but the power lies within you aderno sketched the sign hed used when he first came to castle svarag again it glowed gold in the air between them you saw that aderno asked hasso nodded the wizard set a reassuring hand on his shoulder yes the power is there that is what seeing especially seeing gold means you are no mindblind savage like these aderno pointed to a couple of grenye dumping garbage on the midden he might have been talking about a yoke of oxen it may be there but i dont know how to use it even if i did could i reach back into my old world like that hasso asked i dont know aderno admitted if your world is so inimical to sorcery maybe not maybe a wizard in the capital will have a better notion than i do he shook his head he may have a better notion there arent many wizards even among us whether any of them will know of your world and what it is like well who can say the commandant at castle kalmar gave the travelers fresh horses to speed them on their way hasso took that as a mixed blessing hed started getting used to the animal he was riding his new mount seemed more spirited which was the last thing he wanted trucks and cars didnt vary so much he found out that drammen the name of the capital meant something like high and mighty in the lenello language aderno was ready to go on and on about the place but hasso didnt want to listen to him he tried his few words of lenello with velona instead he might not follow her but he enjoyed trying she used gestures to show him drammen was big and opened and closed her hand many times to show him it was populous how many people he asked when they stopped he drew in the dirt with a stick to show her he understood the idea of written numbers to show one was easy five and ten werent hard and fifty and a hundred just took patience velona got excited when she saw what he was doing she called aderno over the wizard was chewing on something the peppery fumes he breathed into hassos face proved it was a chunk of sausage well well he said examining the numbers those arent what we use but youll follow ours all right to the lenelli one was a horizontal slash ten looked like a plus sign a hundred was a square with a horizontal line through the middle if you put the symbol for three three horizontal slashes piled on one another to the left of the symbol for ten it meant thirty if you put it to the right of the symbol for ten it meant thirteen the lenelli didnt use a zero the system struck hasso as better than roman numerals not as good as arabic to show him how many people drammen held aderno needed to teach him one more symbol a square divided into quarters by vertical and horizontal lines the wizard seemed impressed when he didnt boggle at the idea of a thousand drammen by what aderno wrote held somewhere between thirty and forty thousand people with a patronizing smile aderno asked and how many people in the town you come from hasso pemsel hasso had to think about his answer he took the stick from the wizard and wrote the symbol for four and the symbol for a thousand adernos smile got wider then hasso wrote the symbol for a thousand again to the right of the first quartered square velona blinked aderno stopped smiling no that cant be right he said impatiently you have written the numbers for four thousand thousand we would say four million but that is obviously impossible four million ja hasso said thats about how many people there are in berlin at least till the russians get through with it he thought glumly god only knows how many theyll leave alive you cant expect me to believe you aderno said you asked me now you dont like the answer hasso said only a madman would like it the wizard insisted no one could keep four million people fed the idea is ridiculous even if by some miracle you could their filth would pile up in mountains you must be lying hasso swung the schmeissers muzzle toward him what did you say he asked softly you may want to think about what comes out of your mouth aderno had the courage of his convictions do not act as if your honor is threatened if i challenge a clear lie he said it will only make you look more foolish when i use the truth spell ah the truth spell i forgot about that hasso said yes go ahead you really are a crazy man outlander if you want to prove it to the world if you want to prove it to the woman who has taken a fancy to you well we can do that aderno aimed a long lean wizardly forefinger at him tell me again how many people live in this town of yours about four million hasso answered stolidly the wizard sketched a star in the air between them it glowed green velona clapped her hands together and laughed out loud aderno look as if someone had stuck a knife in him but it cant be he protested to whom hasso wasnt sure most likely to the ghost of his own assumptions you can apologize now hasso said or you can kiss my ass i dont much care which aderno had the air of a man whod put out his foot for a step that wasnt there and fallen five meters i think i would rather believe you can fool the truth spell than believe in a city with four thousand thousand people in it he muttered believe whatever you please hasso said you asked me so i told you if you dont like it its no skin off my nose you wanted to brag about how wonderful drammen is and you got a surprise shall we ride now they rode as they went along velona and aderno got into a screaming row every so often one of them would point hassos way so he figured they were arguing about him velona went on laughing so he guessed she believed him whether the wizard did or not hasso heard the words four million more than once maybe it would have been better if aderno hadnt asked him too late to worry about that though hasso wondered what the ordinary lenello troopers thought he couldnt tell those proud faces might have been carved from stone for all they showed ss recruiting posters with men like that on them would have pulled in twice the volunteers or maybe none at all since so many would have despaired of measuring up to that standard still men were men horses were horses pigs were pigs and adernos unicorn was a goddamn unicorn and his magic was without a doubt real live magic hasso didnt know much about this world but he knew it was different from his and his was different from this one and the people here seemed to have more trouble than he did working that out drammen lay on the drammion hasso judged the river more impressive than the spree which ran through berlin but less impressive than the danube or the rhine barges and sailboats came down the river to the city sailboats fought their way up to it against the current no motors anywhere which didnt surprise him he didnt miss the stink of exhaust and if he had there were plenty of other stinks to savor hed grown intimately familiar with horse manure and unwashed humanity during the war the wind wafted those odors from drammen to his nose and with them came the stench of what might have been every sour privy in the world hed seen at the castles that the lenelli didnt have much of a notion of plumbing now approaching a city not a large city by his standards but a city even so he got a real whiff of what that meant no wonder aderno hadnt wanted to imagine the filth from four million berliners catching velonas eye hasso screwed up his face and held his nose she laughed and nodded but then shrugged and spread her hands as if to say what can you do cities always stink aderno said sure they do if theres no running water and horses shit in the streets hasso thought he didnt want to think about the flies in drammen as if to mock him a big shiny one lit on the back of his hand he swatted at it and missed stink or no stink though have you ever seen finer works than the ones protecting drammen aderno had his share of hometown pride and then some artillery could have knocked down the curtain walls around the city in hours the castle on a hill near the center of town would have taken a little longer but not much hasso thought of g tower again that reinforced concrete could hold up against damn near anything it wasnt a fair comparison though and he knew as much theyre very strong he said and by the standards of this world that was bound to be true the wizard looked pleased even smug so he hadnt sounded too sarcastic good a group of grenye leading donkeys were ahead of them at the gate the sad little beasts were piled high with sacks of this and that so high that hasso marveled that their legs didnt collapse under them the grenye seeing lenelli behind them made haste to get out of the way the lenelli accepted that as their due the guard who swaggered out to question aderno had top sergeant written all over him from that rolling bigbellied walk to the double chin and the silver hair frosting gold most officers treated a senior noncom with the respect his position and his years deserved aderno didnt he spoke more brusquely than hasso would have in his shoes whatever the wizard said though had enough oomph to impress the veteran the fellow came to attention saluted with clenched fist over his heart and waved adernos party through when hasso looked up as he rode through the arched gateway he saw more lenelli staring down at him through murder holes in case of trouble what would they pour on attackers boiling water boiling oil red hot sand something anybody in his right mind would rather give than receive he was sure of that the gateway had two stout spiketoothed iron portcullises one near the outer end the other near the inner would even a panzer be enough to smash them down hasso wasnt sure they didnt have to worry about panzers here anyhow inside the wall was a clear space to let troops maneuver that would be prime real estate if the king kept people from building there he had real power he also had real worries or worries that seemed real enough to him otherwise he wouldnt have bothered to keep that area open the houses closest to the wall put hasso in mind of the sorry grenye huts hed seen on the way to drammen and as he and his escorts rode through the narrow stinking streets he discovered that almost all of the people living in those huts were grenye when he saw one obvious lenello sitting on a front stoop with a jug of wine beside him he was so surprised that he pointed to the big blond drunken man two troopers eyes traveled to the sodden lenello as soon as they saw him and recognized him for what he was they looked away pretending that they didnt after a moment hasso realized it went deeper than that the men on horseback werent pretending they were denying were he able to ask them if they saw their compatriot they would have said no and they would have meant it all the way down to the depths of their souls hasso started to ask aderno why that should be so something in the set of the troopers jaws something in the ever so slight narrowing of their eyes told him that might not be a good idea especially when he noticed that same existential disapproval clotting the wizards features aderno must have noted the derelict lenello too how did the british in india react to one of their own who went native how had americans responded to a trader who stayed with the redskins and preferred a squaw to a white woman a lot like this unless hasso missed his guess a dumpy grenye woman came out of the hut and took the jug from the lenello she wasnt trying to keep him sober she wanted a drink for herself the blond man gave her a slack jawed grin and patted her on the ass comparing her to velona and the other lenello women hasso had seen was almost like comparing a gorilla to human beings that fellow could have had one of those but hed ended up with that no wonder he drinks hasso thought shabby shops and taverns and eateries lay within the first ring of huts again all the proprietors and most of the customers were grenye when they bargained they gesticulated and shouted and jumped up and down and did everything but poke each other in the eye they reminded hasso of the jews in the villages in the east that the wehrmacht had overrun when the shouting got especially raucous aderno stuffed his fingers in his ears the racket had to drive him nuts maybe it also damaged his sorcerous sensitivity hasso just found it annoying velona caught his eye she pointed to the schmeisser he wore slung across his back then she pointed to eight or ten grenye one after another and made guttural noises in her throat to suggest many rounds going off and then she laughed and brought a forefinger up to her red lips in a gesture he couldnt misunderstand mischief glinted in her eyes without a word she was saying shooting grenye was the only way to make them shut up a man with an unkempt beard and a mop of curly dark brown hair came over to the lenelli riding past he held up a little jar what was in it salve perfume fish paste and went into a passionate practiced sales pitch no one of the troopers with hasso said the grenye followed still yakking a blue streak no the lenello said again louder this time the grenye had to be used to rejection because he went right on with his spiel coming ever closer as he did no the lenello shouted he lashed out with his right foot with a kick a world cup footballer might have envied he booted the jar out of the grenyes hand and sent it flying into a dungheap six or eight meters away the grenye yelped in surprise and pain all of hassos escorts even aderno laughed at him plainly he was used to that but his own people laughed at him too maybe for pushing too hard maybe for not getting out of the way fast enough his head hung as he trudged over to retrieve the jar from its noisome new home he brightened when he discovered it wasnt broken and wiped it off on his tunic so he could try to sell it to some friendlier customer inside the ring of shops closer to the castle dwelt the lenelli had hasso not already known one glance at their homes would have told him who was on top here and who was on the bottom wide well kept lawns separated one lenello home from another the overlords werent packed cheek by jowl the way their subjects were each lenello home was at least six or eight times as big as a grenye hut the buildings were solidly made of stone or brick they werent built from wattle and daub and whatever scraps a grenye could beg borrow or scrounge they had roofs of red tile or gray or green slate not tired thatch and bits of planking the grenye would have fallen in love with corrugated sheet iron if only theyd heard of it most of the lenello homes could have doubled as fortresses even their stables and other outbuildings were far finer far sturdier than anything the grenye lived in velona saw hasso eyeing the lenellis houses arent they good she said he understood that and nodded yes good he said there was a word you soon learned whenever you picked up a new language lenelli are good velona saidgrenyehasso had already seen she was a good mimic now he discovered she could do an uncanny impersonation of a grunting hog it startled a laugh out of him she pointed ahead and the king lives there she said the gesture was nicely timed theyd just come round a corner an avenue or as close to an avenue as drammen boasted led straight to the royal palace if the avenue was muddy and rutted and odorous well what streets in this world werent the palace was an impressive piece of architecture no two ways about it a moat surrounded the gray stone outer walls soldiers on the walkway atop the outwalls surveyed the city between chest high crenellations hasso had seen the towers of the keep even from outside the city walls a red flag floated from the tallest of them his lips quirked in a mirthless smile he couldnt hold that banner against the lenelli even if hed been fighting one very much like it for almost four years yeah artillery could have breached the walls and knocked down the towers in jig time but he wouldnt have wanted to try taking the place without it they rode down the avenue it wasnt the same as parading under the brandenburg gate after france fell it really wasnt the same as parading under the brandenburg gate would have been after russia fell hasso feared only the red army was parading through berlin these days was anything left of the brandenburg gate he shrugged hed never know and a glance at his comrades said they all thought approaching the royal palace was a pretty big deal even aderno looked like a second lieutenant about to get the knights cross straight from the fuhrer himself what would happen to hitler with berlin falling hasso tried to imagine him in russian captivity the picture didnt want to form the fuhrer would do anything anything at all before he let himself turn into stalins plaything why couldnt england and the usa see that if germany went down the last dam against the spread of bolshevism fell it was as if they thought the reich even worse which struck him as insane he shrugged again he would never know the answer there as soon as his backside touched the omphalos hed put his own world behind him forever he didnt have many answers here either but he could hope he would one of these days velona caught his eye and winked she blew him a kiss you will see the king he will like you she made it sound simple and inevitable she didnt seem so overawed as the wizard and the troopers if you can keep your head when all those about you are losing theirs chances are you dont understand the situation hasso knew too well that he didnt he found out how much he didnt understand in short order another man another wizard rode a unicorn up to the guards at the outer end of the drawbridge just ahead of the group of which the wehrmacht officer was a part the guards talked with him for a moment then stood aside and let him through then hassos group approached when the guards saw them they stiffened to attention and saluted then they bowed themselves almost double and then straightening they saluted again they bawled out some sort of honorific or another hasso didnt understand it but he heard the fervor with which they shouted it ss troopers yelled heil hitler the same way the fuss wasnt for hasso nobody at the castle knew him from the man in the moon it wasnt for aderno hasso had figured out the wizards place in the scheme of things he was hired help he was high class hired help entitled to some respect like a firstrate dentist back in the reich but nobody jumped through hoops for a dentist there and nobody was likely to jump through hoops for aderno here the mounted soldiers they were exactly what they looked like muscle nothing else no the guards were having conniptions because velona was back she said something to them then pointed toward hasso as soon as she did that they saluted him too uneasily he returned the salute hello good day he said a couple of phrases in lenello that couldnt land him in too much trouble good day they chorused and then something he didnt understand what does that mean he asked aderno he wanted to learn lenello on his own if he had the wizard magically translating for him he wouldnt and he didnt like aderno all that much and he didnt think aderno fancied him either put all that together and he didnt want much to do with the wizard once in a while though he needed a shortcut they said good day savior of the priestess aderno told him priestess hasso hadnt known she was one he chuckled no nun hed ever heard of would have said thank you the way she did priestess yes but aderno didnt seem quite happy with the german equivalent hasso offered for what he said you might also think of her as the goddess on earth hasso glanced over at velona she smiled and fluttered her fingers at him priestess goddess on earth what the hell have i got into he wondered but he liked what hed got into just fine along with velona and the escort he rode across the drawbridge and into castle drammen iii after laying a goddess on earth getting presented to a mere king was a piece of cake king bottero was a great big man as so many lenelli seemed to be hasso didnt feel much shorter after he went to his knees in front of the massive blocky throne than he did before the kings guards murmured when bottero rose and set a hand on hassos shoulder maybe he didnt do that for every hans franz and dietrich who got an audience bottero gestured hasso got to his feet even standing the top of his head came up to about the bottom of the kings nose in germany hed got used to looking at the tops of other peoples heads most of the lenelli could do it to him he didnt like that especially since his sandy hair was beginning to thin up there when the king said something hasso had to shrug im sorry your majesty dont speak much lenello yet he said velona had taught him your majesty just before he went into the throne room what was he supposed to call her your divinity she was divine all right but not in the theological sense of the word bottero looked annoyed not at hasso but at himself he said something else then he called adernos name the wizard came up and went to his knees bottero spoke to him impatiently get up get up it had to mean something like that as aderno rose he said his majesty says you look like one of us so he forgot you werent if im a lenello i look like a damn runt hasso thought they couldnt shoot you for thinking not if you kept your big mouth shut not even the gestapo or the nkvd did that tell his majesty im glad to be here im glad to be anywhere i wasnt a good bet to still be breathing now as usual hasso heard the lenello words without understanding them when the wizard spoke to the king he couldnt follow botteros reply either but when aderno spoke to him he heard lenello in his ears and what might as well have been german in his mind his majesty says he is glad to have you all the lenelli are glad to have you since you saved the goddess on earth from the grenye savages i was glad to do it hasso said hed been glad to do it even before velona offered him what maidens not that she was used to call their all after that after that he would have followed her to siam or maybe to the moon what would he have done if she were small and dark and plain jewishlooking went through his mind and the men chasing her were perfect aryans would he have opened up on them anyway or would he have waited to find out what the hell was going on he had no idea king bottero spoke again not half so glad as we were to have it done aderno translated where do we go from here hasso asked hed seen the fuhrer a couple of times but never spoken to him he would have been awed if he had talking to a king didnt awe him a bit talking to this king didnt anyhow if a kaiser still ruled germany or even if hed met george vi of england that might have been different but bottero seemed no more than an ungodly tall man in odd fancy dress who wore a gold circlet with balltopped knobs sticking up from it he did have an impressive bass rumble adernos lighter voice turned his words into ones that made sense to hasso you did us a service i hope you will take service with us i have heard you know fighting tricks we would all do well to learn and i have also heard the power dwells in you hasso started to say he didnt know anything about the power at the last second he clamped down on that the less he gave away the better off he was likely to stay and so all that came out was ill be happy to join you your majesty after the wizard turned that into lenello king botteros iceblue eyes suddenly twinkled a grin pulled up the outer corners of his mouth he set a massive hand on hassos shoulder and said something in what could only be a man to man tone hasso figured out the likely translation even before aderno gave it ill bet you will shes quite a woman isnt she yes your majesty hasso could say that in lenello he would have meant it no matter what language he used then he eyed the kings roguish expression in a different way was he imagining things or did bottero sound as if he knew exactly what he was talking about the wehrmacht officer didnt see any polite way to ask the king maybe he would be able to find a polite way to ask velona or maybe he didnt want to know then bottero spoke again and hasso found out whether he wanted to or not his majesty makes himself remember you are a foreigner and so you are not used to our ways aderno said he waited for hasso to nod then went on he will borrow the goddess for the coming summer solstice as he does each solstice and equinox no doubt he says you have some such customs in your own land no doubt hasso said tonelessly hed heard of pagan fertility rites but hed never dreamt they might matter to him and what the hell was he supposed to say when the king told him hey im going to borrow your girlfriend for a night if he said no youre not chances were hed be shorter by a head and if he said no to velona she was liable to laugh at him if she was the goddess on earth wasnt this part of her job requirement you dont say much king bottero observed through aderno he might be the size of a draft horse but he was no dummy what am i supposed to say hasso made himself shrug if it doesnt bother velona how can i squawk bottero laughed when he heard that i knew you were a sensible fellow he said and gave hasso a slap on the back that almost knocked him sprawling when you get right down to it the women do the deciding ja hasso agreed with a crooked smile pagan fertility rites or not this world and the one hed escaped werent so very different he turned to aderno if i take service here i know whose service im joining whos on the other side a wise question you should always know your foes at least as well as your friends the wizard said the wehrmacht officer grunted hitler should have thought about that before he got into a war against both the usa and the ussr if the fuhrer had hasso wouldnt have been standing here right now aderno went on you would serve his majesty against the other lenello kingdoms except the ones that are allies hasso nodded that makes sense but aderno wasnt done and you would serve him in ensuring that the grenye in his kingdom know their place know it and keep it fair enough if you were going to rule people youd conquered they had to respect you hasso had seen that in russia let them think they were as good as you were and thered be hell to pay the germans had paid it too and now aderno seemed like someone holding his nose against a bad smell that wouldnt go away there is bucovin when king bottero heard the name he made a horrible face too bucovin hasso echoed as he was no doubt meant to do the heart of the grenye infection aderno said grimly he pointed it lies to the east bottero spoke his majesty says the grenye lie all the time and from any direction heh hasso said how close to the border was castle svarag had velona been escaping from bucovin if she had why didnt the people on her heels carry anything better than peasant weapons all kinds of interesting questions but a bigger one occurred to hasso you have magic and the grenye dont certainly aderno drew himself up like an affronted cat we are lenelli after all and they are only grenye when the wizard translated the question for the king botteros big head bobbed up and down right hasso said he hoped the sarcasm wouldnt make it through the translation spell to try to blunt it if it did he went on what i dont understand is if you can work magic and they cant why didnt you beat them a long time ago he thought of the conquistadors with their guns and horses and dogs and iron armor and of the indians whod gone down in windrows before them again aderno turned the question into lenello for his king were getting there bottero said our ships only found this land two centuries ago weve pushed the savages back a long way from the sea but bucovin bucovin is difficult he nodded again seeming pleased hed found the right word hitler would have said that about the russians in and he would have been right much righter than he knew then in fact the reich and the russians were both behind hasso forever now so im in the new world am i he thought bottero didnt look a bit like franklin delano roosevelt and probably nothing like whatshisname roosevelts replacement either none of that brainfuzz mattered a pfennigs worth to the lenelli difficult how hasso asked as any soldier might aderno didnt look happy about translating the question king bottero didnt look happy about answering it either he bit off some harshsounding words when we attacked the grenye there we had a couple of armies come to grief aderno echoed what the king said so hasso could understand we dont know exactly why did they somehow learn magic on their own hasso thought about indians learning to ride horses and shoot guns but the wizard shook his head after he translated the question so did the king this time aderno showed no hesitation in answering on his own it is not possible they are grenye and mindblind there are no wizards among them there never have been there never will be there never can be slavs are untermenschen all we have to do is hit them a good lick and theyll fall over went through the germans mind how much baggage he brought from the world hed fled would he ever escape it how could he it made him what he was something hed seen in this world occurred to him when we rode into drammen do you remember that drunken lenello with the grenye girlfriend we saw by adernos expression he might have stuck pins under the wizards fingernails very unwillingly aderno nodded even more unwillingly he said i remember the king barked a question most unwillingly of all aderno translated hassos question what bottero said after that should have scorched paint off the walls when the king ran down aderno found a question of his own why do you ask in contrast to his sovereigns words his might have been carved off a glacier i was wondering whether some lenello renegade might have made magic for bucovin if the grenye couldnt do it on their own hasso said again king bottero had to ask his wizard for a translation when he got one he did some more cursing but then shook his head and answered the question there was no magic used against us he said flatly none we failed anyhow failed twice failed badly our own magic faltered there other lenello kingdoms have failed too bucovin is difficult we have not sent an army there for a while maybe we will try again before too long there has been talk of it but we will be wary if we do i see hasso wasnt sure he did plainly though the lenelli didnt see what had gone wrong against the difficult bucovin either bottero gave him a crooked grin now that you know my realms old shame outlander will you still take service with me against my enemies whoever they may be what would the king and the wizard do if he said no theyd throw him out on his ear that was what and so would velona and hed deserve it what would happen to him them would he end up a drunken stumblebum in the grenye part of town he hadnt crossed worlds for that he gave bottero his own salute arm thrust out ahead of him yes your majesty the ritual that followed came straight from the middle ages following adernos instructions hasso dropped to both knees again and held out his hands clasped together king bottero enfolded them in his own big mitts i am your man hasso said prompted by aderno i pledge you my full faith against all men who may live and die so help me god a lenello would have sworn by the goddess he supposed he wondered if aderno would correct him but the wizard let it go bottero hauled him to his feet with effortless ease the king wasnt just a big man he was strong too he leaned forward and kissed hasso on both cheeks they were big smacking kisses the kind a russian might have given no french sophistication here you are my man i accept your homage by the goddess i will do nothing to make myself not deserve it bottero said through the wizard i welcome you to my service thank you your majesty hasso felt better because of the oath hed sworn now he had a real place here he belonged he didnt know all of what that place entailed yet but he could find out he wasnt just somebody whod fallen from nowhere he was one of king botteros men all the lenelli would understand that so would the grenye a couple of small dark servants came into the throne room they started sweeping and dusting none of the lenelli paid any attention to them they might have been part of the furniture as they worked they chattered in low voices in a croaking guttural language that sounded nothing like lenello what are they saying hasso asked aderno the wizard shrugged i have no idea it could only matter to another grenye doesnt your translation spell work on their language hasso couldnt imagine why it wouldnt why have a translation spell if you werent going to use it to understand a tongue you didnt speak it would aderno said with the air of a man making a great concession but why would i care to listen to grenye grunting id just as soon listen to what the kings hunting hounds had to say hasso would have been interested to hear what dogs had to say too all the same botteros hounds wont plot to murder you in your bed one fine night he knew the risk of keeping russian servants on the eastern front some germans got by with it a lot of russians hated stalin worse than hitler but hasso had never been tempted it would have been just his luck to draw somebody who was playacting king bottero laughed when the wizard told him what the germans words meant these are also my dogs the king said waving toward the grenye they will not bite he seemed very sure of himself and of his servants hasso glanced at the grenye again they went about their work with their heads down and seemed to pay little more heed to the lenelli than their masters did to them but a certain slight stiffness in the way they moved made hasso sure they understood lenello even if the lenelli didnt bother to understand them goddess on earth hasso asked velona the lenello words strange in his mouth they lay side by side on the bed of his small chamber in castle drammen no matter what velona was he was only a new vassal of ambiguous rank chances were he got a chamber of his own only because she fancied him otherwise he would have drawn a cot or a straw pallet in the common room with the belching farting snoring ordinary soldiers he wouldnt have minded hed done that often enough but this was much much better the bed was small too which meant he and velona touched even when they lay side by side the tip of her breast just brushed the skin of his arm she smelled of clean sweat and cinnamon if she was a goddess she was a very human one she nodded which made shadows swoop across the promontories of her face the only light in the room came from a lamp that sputtered and added the odor of hot mutton fat to the air thats right she said what does it mean hasso asked the question a dozen times a day velona looked surprised when he asked now what it says of course what is that things hasso wanted to say bubbled up inside him how in his world there were no goddesses on earth or even gods how god himself seemed far away if he was there at all how the age of miracles or the age when people believed in miracles was long gone and yet a little miracle or something a hell of a lot like one had brought him here from burning berlin but even if the fuhrer was as close to a god on earth as people knew in these grimly rational days it would have taken more than a little miracle to save the reich from the clutches of the russian bear the american eagle and the british lion speaking german all that would have burst free in a torrent of words in lenello he was limited to questions that made him sound like a dummkopf sooner or later he would understand more hed been through enough to teach him patience the hard way you really dont know velona sounded amazed i really dont know hasso hoped he got the conjugation right she laughed not at him he didnt think the goddess lives in me she said touching the inside of her left breast to show what she meant sometimes i am velona sometimes i am the goddess sometimes i am the goddess and velona at the same time she spoke slowly and simply to give him a chance to understand how to know how i to know which he asked he wondered if she would laugh again but she didnt when i ran out of bucovin the goddess filled me i could not have run like that if she hadnt those grenye you saw chasing me those werent the first ones who came after me i left the others in the dust i understand he said after a bit her explanation wasnt smooth she backed and filled and used different words and gestured and sat up in bed and acted out what she meant he never got tired of watching her goddess or velona she was the most alive person hed ever met and it wasnt even close good her eyes flashed brighter than the feeble rays from that smelly mutton fat lamp should have let them do but even the goddess fills only a woman those churls would have caught me if you hadnt she imitated the noise from the schmeisser again she kissed him thank you happy glad hasso drew her to him big glad she laughed then he asked make love with goddess or make love with velona oh that was me she said and pointed at herself to make sure he got it the goddess went out of me when i didnt need her any more that was one reason i was so worn there for a little while again she worked at what she was saying till she was sure he followed she was a good teacher and learning a language from a lover had incentives a tutor with a mustache and a tweed jacket couldnt hope to match if the goddess possessed her some of the time what was it like when possession ended in his own world he would have taken her talk for metaphor here he kept an open mind hed seen enough strange things to make him unsure where metaphor left off and magic began and if magic worked why couldnt there be a literal goddess no reason he could see no reason at all what about with king bottero he asked he hoped he didnt sound too jealous he didnt feel too jealous but he wasnt altogether easy about it oh with him i am the goddess and me both velona answered matter offactly the seasons need renewing and this is how we do it and he is a man and i am a woman and that is how men and women do it you ought to know she poked him in the ribs well yes he said she made it sound so reasonable the only thing wrong was that what happened between men and women wasnt reasonable no matter how people tried they couldnt make it reasonable either they couldnt in the world he came from anyhow he didnt think the lenelli and grenye were much different velona laughed in fact she said sure enough hed just bumped her belly they started all over again he hadnt thought a man his age could perform the way he did but then he hadnt had inspiration like this either afterwards he wished for a cigarette even the ones the german quartermasters doled out that tasted of hay and horseshit instead of honest tobacco would have been better than nothing but hed had them in the back pocket of his trousers when he landed in the swamp here and they got ruined too damn bad is it better now velona might have been soothing a little boy her methods were different were they ever but not her tone well yes hasso said again and it was too and it would stay that way till the summer solstice or till he thought about the summer solstice or till he ran into king bottero or for a little while anyhow what could he do about it any which way tell the goddess not to do what the goddess did velona would laugh in his face hed be lucky if bottero only laughed he could go from vassal to victim in the time the king took to snap his fingers and so and so what he wondered if he couldnt stand the idea the only thing he could do was break off with velona the king would still keep him around as a soldier as an unarmed combat instructor and maybe in the hope that he could teach the lenelli to make firearms they wouldnt turn out schmeissers any time in the next few hundred years if he could make black powder though they might manage cannons and matchlock muskets and cannons ought to be plenty to win him a field marshals baton or whatever they used here instead of one so he could make his way here without velona if he wanted to he thought so anyhow but did he want to if he did he figured he needed to check his brain for working parts if she had to do what a goddess had to do he figured he could live through it itll be all right he told himself what velona asked and he realized hed spoken not only out loud but in german all good he said in lenello and hoped he meant it the masteratarms at castle drammen was a fellow named orosei he wasnt particularly big for a lenello only a couple of centimeters taller than hasso but he was in perfect shape as they faced each other in the courtyard stripped to the waist the german could see as much he wasnt bad himself but orosei had not a gram of fat and muscles like steel bands soldiers watched the faceoff hasso was starting to understand bits of lenello they figured he was crazy nobody in his right mind messed with orosei eyeing his opponent hasso thought they had a point hed done this at castle svarag but orosei looked like a much rougher customer than sholseth or his buddies this guy didnt just have muscle he had technique too hasso could see that at a glance so you know tricks do you orosei said his gaze went here there everywhere he wouldnt give himself away by eyeing his target before he went after it hasso shrugged maybe a few well lets get on with it orosei said nothing personal you understand i make my living squashing people youre just another one nothing personal hasso agreed if i can beat you i look like a big deal youre in the way like poland they circled warily hasso took it on faith that orosei was good the masteratarms didnt seem inclined to take chances on anybody once things started happening fights could often did end in seconds someone would make a mistake or just move an instant slower than he should have and that would be that did you come here to fight or to dance orosei asked in the middle of the question without warning or even raising his voice he sprang the next few seconds were one of those frantic flurries that happened when two pros went at each other without any rules one of oroseis boots thudded into hassos chest not quite in his solar plexus and not quite hard enough to break ribs the lenellos thumb didnt quite take out hassos left eye either and hasso didnt think he quite broke it when he bent it back he got in some licks of his own too they broke apart again orosei would sport a mouse under one eye and he definitely had hurt that hand he saluted hasso lenello style clenched fist over his heart youre good all right he said we can use you you are good too hasso didnt like plodding through a language he barely spoke but he had no choice they circled some more hasso fired a kick at oroseis knee orosei grabbed his foot and launched him then jumped on him like a starving tiger but hasso had expected to get thrown and greeted him with a boot in the belly it was like kicking planks but it got the masteratarms off him orosei bounced to his feet he saluted again saying youre bloody good show me those flips ive heard about we go slow hasso asked and the masteratarms nodded hasso knew a moments relief that hed proved himself without getting maimed and without wrecking the other guy who was bound to have friends in high places he said come at me not very fast orosei did he made a perfect practice partner hasso grabbed his outthrust arm twisted got him on his hip and flipped him over his shoulder orosei thudded down on his back with a big grin on his face he sprang up thats good by the goddess do it again hasso sent him ass over teakettle a couple of more times at half speed and then at something closer to full speed orosei was a glutton for getting things right if he took some bruises doing it he didnt care let me try he said when he thought he had it half speed hasso said and the masteratarms nodded hasso approached he extended his arm orosei twisted and flipped him smooth as could be hasso hadnt expected anything different this guy was a pro he proved what a pro he was a moment later after hed tossed hasso around three or four times he said that is the move and its very fine what is the counter ah now hasso gave him a german style salute good question right question i come half speed you he mimed doing the flip you see some of the soldiers drifted off when they found that hasso and orosei werent going to ruin each other for their entertainment others crowded closer to watch hasso show the masteratarms how not to get thrown a lot of them wanted to try the moves themselves on one another and on the men who really knew how to do them youre better than i am orosei said after a while i have to think about it and you just do it practice hasso said with another shrug how many times had he done those flips on the other hand me and sword bad he made a face to show how bad but youve got that firespitting pellet crossbow orosei said a pretty good description of a schmeisser from somebody whod never heard of the industrial revolution do all the soldiers where you come from carry those orosei asked when hasso nodded the masteratarms winced you must kill each other before you get close enough for swords mostly hasso nodded again orosei wasnt just a hardnose with quick reflexes he had brains that figured he was more or less a regimental sergeant major so hed better not be a dummy especially right under the kings eye the lenello tossed him a spearshaft with a bundle of rags at the end instead of a point you know what to do with this some hasso answered lets see orosei took a practice pike too and did his best to stick hasso like a pig when hasso showed he could handle himself orosei whacked him on the back yeah youre pretty decent how come when you dont know what to do with a blade as best hasso could he explained about bayonets then he said wait please and hurried back to his chamber he returned with his entrenching tool fight with this too he demonstrated some of the unkind things you could do with the metal blade orosei watched with interest then hefted the entrenching tool himself nice little thing he said with an appreciative nod you dig holes so the pellets dont dig holes in you yes hasso said orosei got it all right and its a fine closein weapon too the masteratarms said handy to have both in the same package he handed the entrenching tool back hasso was beaming as he took it he and orosei didnt have many words in common but they spoke the same language anyway by the time the summer solstice rolled around hasso could read and even write a bit his progress amazed the lame whitehaired lenello who taught him but old dastel was used to teaching people whod never met letters before hasso understood the idea that each sign stood for one sound just fine so what if the lenelli used thirtyfour characters so what if they wrote from right to left like semitic untermenschen as soon as hasso memorized which squiggle sounded like what he could read as well as anybody and better than most because people here had a habit of muttering their words as they read them his biggest problem was his limited vocabulary learning to read helped there too words on a page didnt vanish into thin air the way spoken ones did pages were parchment or something like that words were written by hand with reed pens or goose quills no gutenberg here not yet i could do that too hasso thought or would the wizards get mad at me for unfair competition as the longest day of the year drew close anticipation built in castle dram men and in the city surrounding it in the castle grenye servants lugged casks of wine and barrels of beer up from the cellars the cellarmaster an immensely fat lenello kept a stern eye on things to make sure the casks and barrels didnt get broached too soon more grenye dug trenches in the courtyard and chopped wood to fill them and set up enormous spits to turn roasting carcasses above them the swarthy little natives seemed as excited about the upcoming holiday as their overlords why not theyd be able to get drunk and make pigs of themselves they didnt get to do that very often as the solstice approached hasso got drunk several times he tried giving velona hints that he wasnt happy she had to know why she was nobodys fool but she affected not to understand no doubt thinking that better than a raging brawl and she showed no sign whatever that she didnt intend to lay king bottero some of the lenelli chased grenye women more as the solstice neared the big blond men seemed to do a bit of that all the time the grenye had a hard time saying no and their menfolk took their lives in their hands if they presumed to challenge their superiors the lenelli had the power of law behind them and the power of size and the power of military training and a good many grenye women didnt want to say no hasso had seen that before in france and in russia losers women were often easy sometimes they saw the other sides victorious soldiers as literally meal tickets you could do better for yourself in an occupiers bed than in one where you slept all alone occupiers also had a kind of glamour because they were victorious in stark contrast to your own worthless odds and sods who couldnt defend the country against them sometimes also people fell in love and whod been on which side to start with hardly seemed to matter those were the affairs that turned out best and worst they could lead to marriages despite regulations or they could lead to disaster when a soldier got transferred or when somebody decided who was on which side counted after all hasso wondered what would happen if velona caught him with a little dark grenye actually he didnt wonder she would scream she would break things she would throw things she would throw him out to him her joining bottero seemed as much a betrayal as that would have been but she couldnt see it from his point of view if he tried to tell a catholic woman not to take communion shed spit in his eye and velona wasnt just a woman taking communion she was a priestess giving communion too she was the deity for whom communion was given no wonder she wouldnt listen to him he could see that he hated it anyway much good it did him horns and drums woke him at sunrise welcoming the longest day of the year with a raucous racket he hadnt got too smashed the night before his head didnt hurt or anything but he wasnt thrilled about rising with the birds and he was because he could hear them chirping somewhere not far enough away the alleged music woke velona up too seeing her smile at him from a few centimeters away went a long way toward reconciling him to being awake big day today she said the way anyone back home might have on a holiday morning yes hasso knew he sounded grumpy hell he sounded downright dismal but he couldnt help it velona laughed and poked him i do know whats bothering you she said and then she made damn sure it wouldnt bother him for a while afterwards she kissed him and asked there is it better now yes this time he sounded happier about things velona kissed him again before she got out of bed even so the real answer was yes and no he had that whole long day to brood about her going off to botteros bedchamber but it turned out to be even worse grenye servants set up a bed in the middle of the courtyard they arent going to hasso thought scandalized but they were as sunset neared an enormous crowd gathered around the bed eating and drinking and talking and waiting expectantly bottero came out of the castle and pushed his way through he was naked as the day he was born but much bigger goddess he boomed standing by the bed i summon you goddess velona came out too the crowd cleared by itself for her her golden nakedness might well have been divine it seemed to draw all the fading light to itself i come your majesty she answered i come they lay down on the bed together right there in front of everybody they did and then she did loudly hasso got very drunk iv hasso woke the next morning with a colossal hangover and an inferiority complex the headache did nothing to dispel hed figured bottero would be big large men usually were large all over but that big the king had to have a horse lurking somewhere not too far down his family tree no wonder velona didnt want to miss their date she wasnt in bed with him all things considered that might have been just as well he got out of bed pulled the chamber pot out from under it and took an enormous leak then he put on his clothes and went to the buttery for something to eat and for something to drink to dull the pounding between his ears he wasnt the only one badly the worse for wear that morning passed out lenelli and grenye sprawled together in the courtyard the overlords and their subjects didnt show that kind of camaraderie when they were conscious men who were up and about moved slowly and carefully as if afraid their heads would fall off if they hurried hasso knew just how they felt he felt that way himself a cook standing behind a bubbling pot of porridge was taking pulls at a mug of beer hasso pointed at the pot give me some of that he said then he pointed to the mug and give me some of that barrels over there help yourself the cook gestured with the ladle before filling a cheap earthenware bowl and plopping a horn spoon into it here you go say youre the foreigner who sleeps with the goddess most of the time arent you thats right what about it if this guy was going to tease him about sharing her with the king hasso aimed to clean his clock he was feeling just rotten enough to welcome a fight but the cook only grinned at him youre a lucky dog you are his majesty gets your sloppy seconds hed been worrying about getting botteros he hadnt even thought it worked the other way around too not knowing what to say he didnt say anything he just went over to the beer barrel and dipped out a mug the hair of the dog that bit him took the edge off his headache the porridge he thought it was barley but it might have been oats had bits of greasy salty sausage in it it helped coat his stomach and put some ballast in there he got up and went back for a refill he started feeling human again but still wished he had some aspirin wish for the moon too he thought he was almost done with the second bowl when king bottero walked in along with everybody else sitting on the benches hasso jumped to his feet he didnt hurl himself at the kings throat maybe the remains of a hangover had their uses after all bottero waved the warriors back to their seats as you were men as you were he seemed careful not to talk too loud maybe he was feeling it from the night before too feeling it or not the first thing bottero did was dip himself out a mug of beer and drain it he filled it again before he went up to the cook for some porridge then he ambled over and sat down by hasso your majesty hasso said unwillingly morning bottero said quite a night last night eh do they have holidays like that in the land you come from well no try as he would the german couldnt imagine the fuhrer playing the starring role in a fertility rite goring on the other hand hasso swigged from his mug the reichsmarschall was too damn fat to do it as well as king bottero had the kings eyes were tracked with red but shrewd all the same didnt think so he said velona tells me you arent too happy about the rite i didnt do it to spite you i dont go around stealing my mens women but the rite we need the rite enjoying it is part of the rite i understand your majesty hasso tried not to sound too stiff the king was going out of his way to be decent he could have just ordered this foreigner with the funny ideas knocked over the head hasso didnt think his skill at unarmed combat was keeping him breathing maybe the schmeisser had something to do with it more likely velona really was fond of him and bottero was stretching a point for her sake hope so the king said i dont want that kind of trouble i dont need it he drained the mug again what i need is another beer can i get you one hasso started to tell him no thanks then he realized bottero was honoring him by asking you didnt turn your sovereign down not if he needed to borrow your woman who just happened to be his goddess for a ritual and not if he offered to dip you out a beer with his own big meaty hand thank you your majesty that was the right answer king bottero heaved his bulk up off the bench and went over to the beer barrel everybody watched him when he moved some men had that ability to draw eyes hitler had far more of it than bottero but the king was a long way from going without and everybody watched him fill two mugs and bring them both back with him he set one in front of hasso and raised the other piss in the river he said piss in the river hasso echoed and he also drank americans said mud in your eye this was the same thing people buzzed in the background hasso couldnt make out much of what they were saying but he didnt need to understand them theyd be talking about how bottero was going out of his way to show the weird foreigner favor and about what that might mean courts were courts whether they revolved around a general a petty king or a fuhrer with a continent at his feet or not much later at his throat is it all right then bottero asked in his minds eye hasso saw the king piercing velona saw her face slack with pleasure in the fading twilight it didnt make him happy but it didnt make him want to murder the king either and in another three months bottero would be doing it again of course in another three months velona might have decided she was sick of the weird foreigner herself in that case hasso supposed he would get drunk anyway watching the king lay her and thinking he used to do the same and a different question occurred to him what does the queen say bottero blinked his queen was a valkyrie with a wrestlers build her name was pola and she was the daughter of the king whose realm lay just north of botteros they didnt get on badly but they sure hadnt married for love she couldnt hold a candle to velona not even close with a sour chuckle bottero said she knows we need the ritual what can she do i understand your majesty hasso said i feel the same bucovin king bottero made a fist and slammed it down on the map spread out on the table in front of him by the goddess we really are going to do something about bucovin this time around weve put up with the miserable place too long already blond heads bobbed up and down hassos among them hed got invited to the meeting not because of his own rank but because velona wanted him there with her otherwise he would have been as welcome as as a noaccount wehrmacht captain in the fuhrers bunker he thought yes the comparison was apt enough looking at a map like that even a noaccount wehrmacht captain would have wanted to hang himself how could you make war without decent maps this one didnt have any kind of scale it didnt have any kind of projection as far as he could tell the lenelli had never heard of such things this was just a rough sketch of the lands that centered on drammen there was the marsh where hasso had come into this world pictured with a stippling of dots there was the road on the causeway at least he presumed that was what the thin straight red line meant and there was bucovin to the east the capital was a place called falticeni hasso sounded it out a syllable at a time lenello used one character for a sound that needed four in german had hasso been writing it he would have spelled it faltitscheni one of botteros marshals stabbed a forefinger at the place he was a middleaged fellow named lugo by local standards he was short about hassos height but he was almost twice as wide through the shoulders if you hit him and he decided to notice hed rip your spleen out well burn it and sow salt so nothing grows there again he rumbled his voice half an octave lower than even the kings basso a grenye servant came in set a tray full of mugs of beer and wine and a plate of sausages baked in dough a local delicacy on the table and then strolled out again hasso pointed to him as he went and asked why he listen who sfintu whats wrong with sfintu bottero asked genuine puzzlement in his voice hasso wanted to bang his head against the wall theyd never heard of security they didnt even suspect theyd never heard of it how to spell things out in words of one syllable especially when words of one syllable were almost the only kind he knew sfintu is a grenye he stated the obvious bucovin is grenye if sfintu listens if sfintu talks to someone from bucovin they know what you do before you do it a spy velona got it hes saying sfintu is a spy well sfintu bloody well isnt bottero declared he was born here hes as loyal as the day is long he likes lenelli better than his own grubby kind maybe that was true hasso wouldnt have bet anything he cared about losing on it his neck for instance it wasnt what he wanted to argue about though patiently he said even if sfintu is loyal he can talk to someone not loyal not even know someone he talk to is not loyal but bucovin learn things anyway bottero and velona and lugo and the other big shots in the kingdom of drammen thought about that hasso could almost hear wheels turning and gears meshing the lenelli werent stupid even if they were naive you dont trust anyone do you bottero said no hasso answered war too big too uh important for trust your kingdom must win a lot of wars lugo remarked that hurt too much to laugh and hasso didnt want to cry in front of the lenelli germany had twice astonished the world with what her armies could do and she would have been better off never to have fought at all what would happen to her after this war was finally lost hardly bore thinking about instead of thinking about it hasso said keep secrets better chance tell enemy not better chance he was pretty much stuck in the present indicative sooner or later he would figure out other verb forms he was starting to understand them when he heard them using them himself was a different story king bottero plucked a hair from his beard you know some things we dont plainly how would you like to be in charge of keeping things quiet how would you like to be security minister bottero didnt even have the words to say what he meant how would you like to be heinrich himmler bottero didnt have the name either which probably wasnt the worst thing in the world can i do job hasso asked not know magic several of the marshals sneered at that youd be worrying about the grenye lugo said they dont know any more about magic than pigs know about poetry the reich had learned some bitter lessons about underestimating its enemies operation barbarossa should have knocked the soviet union out of the war by the first winter and it would have too if only the russians had cooperated they hadnt two things he said in his slow bad lenello one thing is if grenye have no magic why lenelli not conquer bucovin before this two thing is lenelli have bucovin for enemy king bottero have uh has also other lenelli for enemy i keep things quiet i keep things quiet from grenye and from other lenelli and lenelli have magic for sure bucovin he turned to velona what has bucovin shed gone in there she must have hoped magic would protect her it hadnt done the job or she wouldnt have been running for her life when hasso splashed into the swamp if whatever gave her away to the grenye in bucovin wasnt magic what the devil was it i dont know what they have there she answered her voice troubled whatever it is it doesnt show the countryside looks like our countryside with the grenye on little farms they keep ducks and partridges they dont have many big animals we brought those here when we landed the ones they do have they mostly stole talk about magic lugo said impatiently uh goddess even if he was impatient he remembered to be polite had he watched bottero screw her or had he been screwing a mere mortal himself right then you cant talk about magic in bucovin without talking about bucovin velona said and then to hasso you have to understand what a funny place it is they have castles like ours along the roads a lot like ours they model theirs after the ones we build her mouth twisted sometimes they have renegades helping them too hasso thought again of the drunken lenello in the grenye section of drammen the one his escorts hadnt wanted to see he wondered if he ought to haul the fellow in and grill him then he wondered something else they have renegade wizards help them several men swore including the king so did velona women here didnt have to speak modestly he got the idea she would have sworn even if women were supposed to stay modest it wasnt just that she was the goddess and could get away with it either it was her style there have been renegade wizards bottero said heavily we make examples of them when we catch them we dont want that kind of nonsense he used a barnyard word instead spreading but they arent the problem not in bucovin no they arent velona agreed its something else i got into suceava where hasso asked she showed him on the map it was the nearest town east of the marsh i might have known he thought their towns now their towns are truly strange theyre more like overgrown villages than proper cities but they arent like that either theyre different one of botteros officers nodded hasso thought his name was nolio ive been into bucovin pretending to be a trader he said they do know something about spying then hasso thought nolio went on you just feel wrong going there out of place like even the walls and the floor are staring at you let alone the people and the people are worse they dont respect you the way grenye are supposed to they think theyre as good as you are the dogs they are free hasso said wild bottero corrected all the lenelli around the table velona included nodded solemnly that was how it looked to them how it looked to the grenye they didnt care and if youve got any brains you wont care either or you wont let on that you care what goes wrong when you visit bucovin hasso asked velona hed tried to ask before but he was getting better at the language now not good enough though what went wrong when i visited you mean she asked that was what he meant he was starting to recognize past tenses when he read them and even when he heard them but they wouldnt come out of his mouth with any reliability but velona sounded as sheepish as she ever did when she said what went wrong everything near enough she threw her hands wide and almost knocked a mug of beer out of nolios hand why how you have magic you are the goddess its like nolio says in bucovin everything watches you the towns the people i dont know what but something there seems to suck the life out of magic it works and then you get deeper in and it doesnt work so well and then it just stops almost makes you think grenye have their own magic but they dont they cant velona said thats so king bottero said when we fight there its us against them spells mostly fail and the more we depend on them the worse the time they pick to fail one of us mounted in armor is worth four five six eight of those stinking churls on foot but theyre starting to use more horsemen and bucovins a big place too he pointed to the map again they have big armies and they dont fight fair they mostly wont give us standup battles they skulk and they raid and they burn our wagons and he broke off an angry flush rising all the way up to his scalp whats so cursed funny sorry your majesty despite the apology hasso had to work to make himself quit laughing it was either laugh or cry which would have surprised the king even more botteros complaints sounded much too familiar how many german generals had said those exact same things about the russians one landser was always worth a couple of ivans sometimes more than that throw enough ivans into the fight though stalin put out a fire by smothering it in corpses if you had enough corpses it worked too picking his words with care hasso said my people fight a war like that too ah the king said with all your tricks and ploys i bet you had better luck than we ever managed to find well hasso said no he bit down hard on the inside of his lower lip tears bubbled very close to the surface he turned back to velona the goddess not help the uh the plain you he hoped she would follow what he meant and she did for she answered even her power seems less there not gone but less to use it to go on i couldnt they sniffed me out as being something that didnt belong there maybe as a danger im not so sure of that when they were going to seize me though when i had to flee then she gave me what i needed her smile almost dazzled him then she led me to you one of botteros officers swore softly hasso knew why any man who wasnt dead or a fairy would want that woman smiling at him that way and saying those things to him and hasso was convinced that even a fairy seeing velona would reconsider seeing her smile that way hearing her talk that way to someone else had to burn like acid so the king said will you help us keep secrets you want help with the wizardry ill give you aderno the proud wizard would no doubt pitch a fit at working for a foreigner whod literally fallen out of the sky hasso liked that idea it wasnt what swayed him though the job needed doing and he could likely do it better than any lenello yes your majesty he said aderno was as thrilled about working under hasso as the wehrmacht officer figured he would be thanks to his translation spell the wizard didnt have to pull any punches either if you werent sleeping with the goddess king bottero never would have given you this post i know hasso said calmly that made the wizards jaw drop still calmly hasso went on if i hadnt rescued the goddess i wouldnt be sleeping with her i didnt see you anywhere around when i did it either so why dont you just shut up i ought to turn you into a aderno broke off most abruptly as any man with a gram of sense would do when somebody aimed a schmeisser at his belly button unlike people from hassos own world he didnt know exactly what the weapon would do but it had killed three grenye after all so he was convinced it would do something dreadful and he wasnt wrong because it would dont mess with me hasso told him if you really cant stand this go talk to the king he gave you the job maybe hell take you off it and assign me somebody civilized instead but if you stay youll do what needs doing and youll do it the right way whatll it be sometimes the lenelli reminded hasso of germanys balkan allies a welltimed show of arrogance would put them in their place for a while i dont want to bother the king aderno said ill do what you ask of me good hasso hid a smile he hadnt even had to threaten to sic velona on the wizard first thing i want to do is talk to that drunk who lives with the grenye aderno blinked why he squawked quite humanly surprised because chances are he knows more about them than any three socalled experts here at the castle hasso answered and hell know things theyd never think to try and find out by the look on adernos face he found that none too wonderful but then he remembered his promise and nodded whatever you want he said with a shrug ill send some soldiers to haul him out of his sty and drag him over here hell likely think we aim to throw him in the dungeon but the scare will serve him right hasso shook his head no i dont want to scare him i want to win him over no hauling no dragging ill go to him into the grenye quarter the wizard looked revolted hasso only nodded why not he said and meant it the lenelli had fleas and lice too the grenye were grubbier but it was a difference of degree not of kind before the war hasso would have hated how grubby he was himself but after what hed been through in the wehrmacht it was just one of those things not to aderno they are grenye he said as if that explained everything velona had been just as thrilled about wearing grenye boots hasso remembered he couldnt have disgusted an ss man more by suggesting a walk through a ghetto he shrugged now the more we learn the better the chance we have when king bottero moves against bucovin would aderno be able to come up with an argument against that hasso would have bet the wizard couldnt and he would have won his bet they plunged into the grenye quarter that very afternoon they went on foot hasso wanted to be as inconspicuous as he could that wasnt very easy he was fairer than any grenye and at least fifteen centimeters taller than most of them and aderno who was both fairer and taller still walked on tiptoe all the way as if afraid he would pollute himself if he planted his feet squarely here in their own district the grenye were bolder and noisier than at castle drammen there they got very quiet whenever any lenelli came into sight part of that was deference part hasso judged was fear among their own kind the short swarthy natives chattered and chaffered both in the lenello tongue and in what sounded like two or three of their own languages hasso stopped in front of a plump man who was selling wickerwork baskets where can i find scanno he asked that was the drunken lenellos name the grenye had been crying his wares in the blond mens tongue hearing the question though he looked elaborately blank what do you say he asked patiently hasso repeated himself the basketseller shrugged a fancy shrug i dont understand you he added something in a language that wasnt lenello and spread his hands as if in apology hes lying aderno said from behind hasso yes hasso agreed because the phrase for no kidding didnt spring to mind i can make him sweat aderno sounded as if he looked forward to it no hasso said lenello could make him laconic he turned back to the grenye by the goddess no harm to scanno where can i find him by the goddess the man said watching his eyes by the goddess hasso said again her name is velona when she dwells in a woman i know the woman ah the grenye said suddenly able to understand him or more willing to admit he did youre that one i wasnt sure before whats that supposed to mean hasso wondered the basketseller went on he mostly drinks at negustors tavern he rattled off directions too fast for hasso to follow turning to the wizard hasso asked you have that i have it aderno said grimly sounding as if he wished he could throw it away we go there were asking to get knocked over the head tell me slow how to go i go by myself then you stay behind hasso said i ought to aderno exclaimed but hasso shamed him into leading the way as hed thought he might when they left the road to the east gate everything got even smellier and dirtier and more crowded than it had before the muddy streets were hardly wide enough to let hasso stretch out his arms without hitting buildings to either side he had to flatten himself against a wall when two grenye led several heavily burdened donkeys up one alley excuse us masters the men said doffing their lumpy brown wool caps the things reminded hasso of cowflops we shouldnt get out of the way for grenye aderno said not do that get out of the way for donkeys hasso said which left his companion scratching his head negustors tavern stood next door to what seemed to be a pawnshop and across the street from what was undoubtedly a brothel a barebreasted grenye woman in an upstairs window shouted an invitation to hasso and aderno then mocked their manhood when they ignored her hasso thought it was a good thing the day was clear had raindrops hit the wizards skin they probably would have burst into steam inside the tavern hasso had to duck his head the ceiling was plenty high for grenye but not for him or aderno it was dark and gloomy and smoky enough to make his eyes sting along with the smoke from the torches the place smelled of stale beer and sour piss hasso looked around grenye drank at the bar and at several tables they were looking at him too and not with anything approaching warmth a new dog in the neighborhood would have got the same kind of onceover he wondered whether somebody would be drunk and angry enough to pick a fight meanwhile there was scanno he wasnt a big lenello which meant he was about hassos size but even sitting down he was noticeably bigger to say nothing of noticeably blonder than the grenye at the table with him and he was also noticeably drunker swaying on his stool as he poured down what was obviously at least one too many large mugs of beer one of his small dark drinking buddies left as soon as hasso and aderno came far enough into the tavern to give him a clear path to the door hasso wondered who wanted him and for what and how badly but that was a question for another day he went up to the grenye behind the counter negustor himself set a small silver coin on the counter and said beer please the tapman blinked had he ever heard please from a lenello even from scanno or from anyone at all he made the coin disappear then dipped up a mug filling it quite full here you go thanks hasso turned want something aderno to get out of here every line of aderno shouted it but the wizard just said wine he set down a coin too the tapman took it and gave him a smaller mug aderno tasted made a sour face and sighed hasso dug out another coin he pointed to scanno one for him too please he needs more beer like a drowning man needs a boulder the tapman said but he dipped out one more mug hasso took it and carried it over to scannos table here he said setting it down in front of the lenello join you hang on scanno drained the mug he already had then he patted the stool to his left that that grenye had hastily vacated anybeery who buys me bods a friend of mine he frowned knowing that wasnt right but fixing it seemed too much trouble aderno disapproval sticking out of him like a porcupines quills perched gingerly on another stool the grenye next to whom he sat down upended his mug and also made a quick exit the one on hassos left stayed where he was innocent curious dangerous ill find out hasso thought scannos eyes had as many red tracks as a railroad map of the reich god only knew when hed last combed his beard he stank of sweat alcohol and stale hops well friend waddaya want he asked slurring his words so hasso could barely understand him you out slumming we want to talk to you hasso answered scanno took a pull from the fresh mug of beer piss in the river he eyed hasso blinking blearily no matter how bleary he was his ears still worked youre no lenello he said ive heard plenty of grenye who talk our lingo bettern you who are you where are you from my name is hasso pemsel and now you know as much as you did before i am from a different world magic i am in king botteros service now that might have been the funniest thing scanno ever heard he laughed till tears ran down his cheeks and into his matted beard you came from another world and you couldnt do any bettern joining up with buttfart the goddess must hate you bad pal aderno audibly ground his teeth hasso kicked him in the ankle under the table he said the goddess does not hate me there at least he could be positive then he asked what is better than to serve the king anything short of an arrow in the ass scanno answered that was plenty for the last grenye at the table who got out while the getting was good scanno went on i mean look at me he jabbed a thumb at his chest i serve myself nobody else im better off than your shadow here any day of the month cause im free your socalled freedom is a recommendation for slavery aderno said icily hush hasso told him the wizard looked not only affronted but alarmed was he wondering whether hasso was about to join the forces of drunken lawlessness it looked that way to the german hed succeeded in surprising scanno too whats with you the renegade said you look like a lenello but you sure dont act like one is better to act like grenye hasso asked that made aderno perk up deciding hasso likely was on king botteros side after all and scanno drunk and hoping hed found a friend wasnt on his guard youre cursed well right it is he said would i be here if it wasnt he drained the mug hasso had bought him hasso signaled to the tapman who carried over another one scanno would have a head that pounded like a dropforging plant when he came down from this bender but that was his worry he seemed to think the fresh beer had got there of its own accord what do you have against your own folk hasso asked him waddaya think scanno said since hasso had no idea he kept quiet and waited scanno got to his feet and staggered over to a corner his gait like a ship at full sail on a rough sea after easing himself he lurched back for a wonder he remembered where hed been going before the interruption ever watch a twelveyearold steal a ripe pear from a kid half his size i know what you mean hasso said and he did the image held a lot of truth aderno looked as if he were about to burst hasso kicked him under the table again adernos idea of gathering intelligence was tearing what you wanted to know out of whoever had it teasing it out seemed beyond his mental horizon well thats what were doing here scanno said by the goddess it is i couldnt stand it anymore so i said a plague on it and here i am what about bucovin hasso said bucovin not so small not so he looked for a word and was glad to find one without needing help from the wizard not so easy bucovin had time to figure things out see scanno said the little grenye kingdoms the ones by the sea they went down bam bam bam like nobodys business they never knew what hit em but bucovin watched and started figuring stuff out like what hasso asked bucovin full of grenye no magic in bucovin how to fight against lenello wizards magic magic scanno spat on the strawstrewn dirt floor that for magic thats about what its worth shall i sing you up a case of boils wretch no aderno wouldnt keep his mouth shut even when he needed to shall i show you what magics worth youve got emerods on your tongue turdface scanno said hasso had spent enough time in lenello barracks to have no trouble with the insult scanno aimed a shaky finger in adernos direction i knew what you were before you started bragging i could smell it i could do your worst youre not such a big pile of shit as you think you are holding aderno back after that would have been impossible hasso didnt even try the wizard snarled his spell plainly one he knew well rather than singing it skin break skin bubble skin burn he cried and aimed his finger the way hasso would have aimed his schmeisser with purpose and with malice transform transform transform and nothing happened aderno stared at scanno who was drunk and surly but not disfigured he stared at his finger as hasso would have stared at the submachine gun after a misfire hasso could hope to clear a jam what did you do when magic misfired the first thing aderno did was try the spell hed used on hasso when they met in the courtyard of castle svarag he sketched a star in the air between himself and scanno hasso saw him do it but didnt see the star glow on its own as it had when the wizard did it with him aderno did some more staring this time at his own index finger he tried the spell with hasso who saw the same golden star he had before after aderno made sure he had the wizard shook his head the magic seems to be in order but it doesnt work hasso finished for him it doesnt work aderno agreed and i dont know why not this miserable sot has no magic used no magic and yet my spell would not bite and i dont know why a german engineer couldnt have sounded any more upset if hed watched a book fall up instead of down told you so knowitall scanno jeered lenello magic from what hasso had heard grew weak and erratic in bucovin scanno was right here but adernos magic didnt want to work against him either what did that mean hasso had no idea plainly neither did aderno v aderno wanted to take scanno back to castle drammen to experiment on him the wizard didnt put it in quite those words but that was what it boiled down to scanno not surprisingly didnt want to go you arent going to play games with me he said its for the good of the lenelli aderno said scanno blew beer fumes in his face as he laughed like i care come on aderno said to hasso we can get him there hasso didnt feel like fighting a drunk who was unlikely even to notice if he got hurt he also didnt want to wreck whatever chance they had of getting voluntary cooperation from scanno forget it he said in lenello so scanno could follow we come back a different time i wouldnt come back here for half the gold in the treasury the wizard exclaimed fine hasso said i come back a different time youre a peculiar one scanno said you belong with me not with this tightarsed twit no hasso let it go there he didnt want to tell the renegade that hed killed grenye he didnt want to tell him he was sleeping with the goddess on earth either if scanno asked around he could hear it for himself hasso got to his feet come on we go the tapman gave him a polite nod as he left he nodded back which seemed to surprise the grenye again out on the street aderno lost his temper what do you think youre doing taking that louts side are you crazy are you a traitor too shut up hasso said in lenello an officers snap in his voice he went on in german knowing the wizard would understand and the grenye all around wouldnt let him think im on his side or i might be let him think that and who knows how much we may learn from him get rough now and we end up with nothing aderno gaped maybe youre playing your own game maybe you think all of us are children you act like it sometimes hasso said that in lenello aderno flushed for he used the secondperson singular not plural a grenye with a pheasant feather stuck in his cap said something about his nice clean sister and pointed to the brothel across the street hasso shook his head the grenye didnt want to take no for an answer he reached out to tug at hassos arm aderno said something too fast for the wehrmacht officer to follow the grenye got it though he disappeared in a hurry if our magic fails against the grenye how are we supposed to conquer bucovin aderno said maybe you do it one bite at a time hasso answered maybe you go on to falticeni and take it away from their king their chief you mean the lenello said scornfully whatever he is it didnt matter to hasso or maybe you decide its too much trouble and you leave them alone we had a big neighbor who we thought would be a pushover too thats why i was fighting in what was left of my own capital if the fuhrer had gone after england instead of trying to knock out russia well things could hardly have turned out worse this whole land is ours it is our destiny if the savages dont bend the knee to us well push them aside like the dirt they are aderno didnt care who was listening to him sometimes disasters followed talk like that hasso had seen as much at first hand but sometimes they didnt the americans hadnt worried about indian raids for a lifetime the aborigines in australia had even less left to them than the redskins in the new world europeans ruled india and africa conquest could work come on hasso said lets get back to the castle aderno went off to commune with a fellow wizard and try to figure out why his magic failed hasso thought about telling king bottero what hed done but decided not to this kingdom was tiny by the standards of the reich but not so tiny that the man at the top would want to hear every little detail chances were hed listen politely once hasso didnt care to burn up his credit like that he asked one of the guards where velona was the fellow shrugged which made his mailshirt clink ever so slightly dont know he answered maybe he really didnt or maybe he didnt care for a jumpedup foreigner his tone wasnt rude enough to be insubordinate hasso asked the same thing of a grenye maidservant carrying a heroic amount of laundry wrapped in a sheet she is in the chapel my lord the woman answered her lenello was fluent but flavored with an accent that said shed be more at home in one of the swarthy natives languages thank you very much hasso said the maidservant looked as startled as the tapman at negustors had lenelli didnt waste much politeness on their social and political inferiors the chapel wasnt so fancy as its name suggested hasso heard it with christian ears which gave him expectations the lenelli didnt have the room was small and simple and spare it had an altar with a low relief of the goddess carved into soft golden limestone the lithe silhouette might have been taken from velonas except that the altar had crossed with early lenello settlers but for the altar and a few stools the chapel was bare maybe christianity needed more in the way of display because in hassos world miracles were hard to come by here with magic working and the goddess taking possession of her mortal acolyte the impossible was as real as a punch in the nose velona had prostrated herself before the altar she didnt notice hasso come in was that a faint radiance hovering around her he wouldnt have sworn it wasnt not after the way she seemed to glow as she strode naked toward bottero on the night of the solstice hasso grimaced not wanting to remember the rest of that night he wondered if he ought to cough or if it would break some kind of spell erring on the side of caution he stood and waited after a couple of minutes velona stood up and turned toward him when she did her eyes flashed fire like a wild animals human eyes didnt do that except hers did hasso had no doubt of what he saw who disturbs the goddess the voice wasnt quite hers it was deeper more reverberant as if it came from deep inside her or maybe from far beyond her either way the hair at the back of hassos neck wanted to stand on end who dares i is sorry he said startled out of his grammar he didnt care to admit even to himself that he was scared out of it she recognized his voice he could tell the moment she did it was the moment her aura died away suddenly she was just a woman just his woman again oh hasso she said and her voice was the one he knew you surprised me sorry he said again now certain to whom and to what he was apologizing not mean to bother its all right you didnt know any better i was almost done communing anyhow she made him feel like a kid whod interrupted something very important that he wasnt big enough to understand the more she pretended it was all right the more certain he got that it wasnt she tried to be brisk well you must have had a reason to come looking for me what was it in his halting lenello he told her about the curse aderno had tried to drop on scanno how hed failed and how despite failing hed seen that no magic protected the renegade i think you need to know this he finished well youre right she said i do thank you the goddess needs to know it too she kissed him for a split second the tingle that shot through him seemed even more than the high voltage velona put into whatever she did imagination in the world he came from he would have thought so here he had no way to know what do you do about it he asked what does goddess do she set a forefinger between her breasts i will take the word to the king it marches too well with what happened to me when i went into bucovin one by one my disguises and wards failed but not for any reason i could find the wizard tell tells he too hasso said no doubt but bottero will take it more seriously from me because i am who i am and what i am velona said as for the goddess hasso could see the deity come forth in her her eyes brightened and focused somewhere not of this world her hair spread and thickened till it reminded him of a lions mane she seemed altogether larger though he still looked down at her he felt as if she were peering down at him from a considerable height she went on the goddess will deal with it in her own way then divinity disappeared and she was velona again what is the goddess way hasso wondered he didnt ask though he didnt have the nerve her gaze sharpened in a merely human way if adernos spell wont bite on this wretch of a scanno what does that say that hes in bucovins service most likely that hes a spy a viper you should have brought him here pins and pincers would tear the truth out of him even if magic failed if the grenye in bucovin couldnt find a better spy than a man busy drinking himself to death they were in more trouble than they knew what to do with but that thought led hasso to another can how you say test grenye if magic works ordinary safe people if magic does not work maybe they have to do with bucovin yes no maybe velona thought about that her eyes glowed in an entirely human fashion the way she showed she liked an idea was more drastic than hed known from any other woman to say nothing of more enjoyable was it sacrilege on a stool in the chapel not he supposed if your panting partner was a parttime goddess what if someone comes in he asked afterwards but only afterwards he didnt worry about that or anything else while she straddled him she only laughed you ask the strangest questions no one would come near the chapel while i was in it no one but you i mean because you dont know our ways oh how big a blunder had he made a good thing she was fond of him or even standing in the doorway might have been dangerous velona had no trouble figuring out what he was thinking dont worry about it you told me things i needed to know i did and the goddess did who knows maybe she even led you here even though hed begun to realize they didnt always fit in this world hasso clung to the rational orderly patterns of thought hed brought from the one that bred him how can she did that if she is here with you if she is here in you he asked by the way velona looked at him the question had never occurred to her the idea that there could be a question had never occurred to her she is the goddess she can do anything she pleases she said as if stating an axiom of geometry how am i supposed to argue with that he wondered and then why do i want to argue with it what would have happened to someone who argued about the virgin birth with a bishop in the tenth century hasso didnt know not in detail but it wouldnt have been pretty he was sure of that all right he said quickly too quickly velona knew he wasnt in the habit of backing down you dont believe it she said i not say that hasso protested i didnt say you said it i said you believed it velona turned toward the altar if the goddess wanted to make that rise up in the air she could it weighed several hundred kilos if it was going to rise up in the air the goddess had to lift it if she didnt nothing this side of a massive block and tackle would hasso was going to make a polite noise of agreement and escape the argument when he realized velona wasnt paying any attention to him again he had the feeling he was standing too close to where lightning had just crashed down power filled her he watched it happen as if he could watch a battery taking a charge she pointed at the altar again this time with an air of command and it rose about half a meter into the air that was impossible hasso knew as much he also knew that what he knew wasnt worth as much as he thought convoluted but true velona lowered her hand and the altar descended too the stones under it creaked as they took up the weight again you see velona said did the goddess still resonate in her voice maybe a little i see hasso agreed did astonishment still resonate in his voice he knew damn well it did fear sweat prickled at his armpits velona was a hell of a highpowered woman all by herself when you added in the other if you see what do you have to say now she sounded like herself again like herself yes but proud of what she and the goddess had done why she not do that to bucovin hasso asked pick up then drop and smash velona started to answer then suddenly stopped she looked very human then human and confused i dont know hasso pemsel she said after that longish pause that is the goddess truth and she keeps it to herself ive prayed all the lenelli have prayed the power to do that doesnt seem to be there maybe she wants us to overcome the challenge on our own some people think so maybe bucovin has a power too he suggested by the way she looked at him hed said something stupid bucovin is full of grenye grenye have no power thats what makes them grenye again it sounded like a geometry lesson why lenelli not beat bucovin by now then hasso asked some of its bad luck velona answered some of it well weve been on this side of the sea a while now the grenye in bucovin have had all that time to learn to fight the way we do and some of it some of it i cant tell you the reason thats why i went to bucovin to try to find out but no luck hasso said well some luck she said i found you didnt i if youre not a gift from the goddess i dont know what you are i am a man hasso said she kissed him i should hope you are sweetheart but youre a gift from the goddess too he wasnt sure he liked that he wanted to count for himself not for any theological reasons by the way she said it though he didnt get a vote king botteros mounted lancers and archers were pretty good hasso enjoyed watching them practice on the meadows outside of drammen the lancers tore bales of straw to shreds the archers pincushioned targets he wondered how he would handle the schmeisser from horseback he could ride but he was no cavalryman lancers tear hole then archers and foot soldiers go through he asked lugo who was also watching the soldiers drill panzers opened the way for infantry in his world he figured knights would do the job here but the lenello didnt understand what he was talking about lancers fight on the line he said archers on the wings to harry the enemy infantry in the rear to try to protect if things go wrong havent they ever heard of the schwerpunkt hasso wondered the french had scattered their panzers all along the line theyd paid for it too when german armored divisions punched through them hasso thought the same thing could work here too why wouldnt it he tried to explain using pebbles and twigs to show what he meant lugo looked at what he was doing looked at him and shook his head this is how weve always fought he said i dont see any reason to change that pissed hasso off you not want to win you not want to beat bucovin you not want to beat other lenello kingdoms why not this is how weve always fought lugo repeated it works fine for ten pfennigs hasso would have blown his brains out assuming he had any to lugo hasso was a noaccount foreigner to be tolerated as the goddess bedwarmer but not taken seriously maybe letting the lenelli think the goddess sent him wasnt such a bad idea after all we see what the king thinks he said if his majesty wants to let you waste his time thats his business the marshal looked down his nose at hasso since he was a short lenello he had to tilt his head back to do it which didnt stop him i hope he listens why not you not win with what you do now maybe you win with a different thing a new thing hasso said and maybe we lose too by the way lugo said it that blew up a mine under the idea right there maybe hasso said and the lenello gaped in amazement that he would admit the possibility he added how are you worse off to lose new way not old way lugo didnt answer him hasso chose to believe that was because he couldnt answer him the marshal took himself off leaving the twigs and pebbles behind like untranslated hieroglyphics hasso wanted to kick him in the ass to speed him in the air but feared giving him a brain concussion if he did what would the lancers think of being used as a breakthrough group only one way to find out he thought and walked over toward them their leader was a captain named nornat captain here more or less equaled lieutenant colonel the lenelli had soldiers and sergeants and lieutenants who were kids getting their feet wet and captains and marshals and that was about it who ranked whom depended far more on prestige than on a table of organization the system caused more friction than hasso liked but he had more urgent things to worry about where he fit himself was an interesting question he was a captain of sorts but only of sorts velonas favor helped surviving against orosei who like a lot of very senior noncoms had more clout than most captains helped more whatever he was he wasnt just someone whod fallen off the turnip wagon nornat led another charge after his line of lancers shredded some more bales of straw he guided his dappled gray up to hasso mail jingled on his shoulders sweat ran down his face from under his conical helm the bar nasal on the helmet didnt protect his face as well as the german would have liked what do you think foreigner nornat asked by the pride in his voice hasso had better not think anything bad strong tough hasso said nornats grin showed a couple of missing front teeth a scar twisted his upper lip no a bar nasal didnt cover everything we shredded polish lancers went through hassos mind you wouldnt have lasted any longer but that didnt matter here hasso cast his line want to be more tougher nornat snapped like a trout how i show you hasso said when nornat saw that he meant it literally he swung down from his mount the animal lowered its head and started cropping grass nornat crouched by hasso the lenello smelled of sweat and leather and iron and horse all familiar military scents hasso made lines of pebbles and twigs then he made a column and aimed it at a line you charge and he stopped waiting to see whether nornat would get it and nornat did his eyes lit up we charge and we smash right through and we tear the guts out of whatevers in our way he straightened up in a single smooth motion which impressed the hell out of hasso that mailshirt wasnt light carsoli sanfrat come over here youve got to take a look at this he yelled carsoli was a big man sanfrat was bigger so big that only a brewerywagon horse could haul him around hasso didnt like feeling like a dink among the lenelli but he didnt know what the devil he could do about it either nornat explained his idea at least as well as he could have himself probably better because nornat was a working cavalry officer with a working cavalry officers appreciation of problems what do you think boys he asked when he finished i dont know carsoli said by his tone he didnt like it but didnt want to stick his neck out either stinking grenye wont be looking for it thats for sure sanfrat said ought to win us a battle or two just from surprise he might be big hell he was enormous but he wasnt slow or stodgy what did marshal lugo have to say you were talking about it with him werent you nornat was quick on the uptake too hasso wished he could lie but knew hed get found out if he tried he does not like it he says the old way to fight is good enough sanfrat snorted im surprised he ever lost his cherry he wouldve said playing with himself was good enough nornat laughed so did hasso hed never known any soldiers who didnt have pungent opinions about their superiors even the ivans joked about their commissars after they got captured carsoli bared his teeth in a sort of a smile but that was all hasso feared the marshal would hear about the gibe in nothing flat how do we hasso gestured get around the marshal just talk to the king nornat answered hell listen to you or i think he will ill talk to him too by the goddess and youre friends with orosei right mm maybe hasso didnt know if he would go that far he and the masteratarms had a strong mutual respect the kind two tough men who knew each could maim the other tended to acquire whether that equaled friendship wasnt so obvious well try him the cavalry captain said he likes your throws i was watching when the two of you tangled i lost some money because i thought hed pound you into the ground but hes game for new things so chances are hed go for this column fighting and i dont care what his rank is he has botteros ear carsoli looked about ready to burst like a man who needed to run for the jakes hasso caught sanfrats eye then flicked his gaze back to the dubious officer sanfrat got it without anything more than that he didnt even nod he just smiled a little crookedly something would keep carsoli from blabbing to lugo right away something immense and muscular and blond most likely hassos smile was as crooked as sanfrats he would have handled things the same way in the wehrmacht yes people were people whether they carried schmeissers or lances rode horses or panzers were the grenye people too hasso hadnt worried about jews in his own world he didnt worry much about the grenye here they were the enemy what more did a soldier need to know about them orosei lifted his mug of beer in salute to hasso who sat across the table from him in the buttery hasso had been using bits of stale bread and raisins to demonstrate his idea i like it orosei told him you can stab right through the line that way and once you do the bastards on the other side wont know what the demon to try next that is how i see it hasso agreed marshal lugo does not think so though lugo doesnt think and thats about the size of it the masteratarms didnt bother lowering his voice if lugo decided he was insulted he would have to challenge here as in the reich the challenged party got to choose the weapons orosei was sudden death on two legs with any weapon or none lugo was brave enough and tough enough but he wasnt in the masteratarms class orosei went on we can do this it wouldnt be hard we really can and we ought to we see things the same way then hasso said orosei drained his mug and waved for a refill a grenye serving girl came over with a pitcher thanks sweetheart orosei said and swatted her on the backside she squeaked but she was smiling as she scurried away chuckling orosei went on lets both talk to his majesty lugos a marshal but he isnt a god the two of us can cancel him out i would love to hasso said youre all right by the goddess you are the masteratarms said i wasnt sure velona knew what she was doing till i got to know you but she did she usually does youve got your head nailed down tight bugger me if you dont hasso would have said orosei had his head on straight but it amounted to the same thing i thank you the wehrmacht officer answered you too well i try orosei said some of the people in this castle dont know enough to squat before they shit if you know what i mean but you arent like that youve got your fancy weapon but it doesnt mean you dont know how to fight i thank you hasso said again praise from a soldier as capable as orosei really meant something to him i dont waste time buttering people up orosei said lifes too short for that crap so well go to the king and see what he says and then well go from there what if he says no hasso asked the masteratarms shrugged then its better luck next time thats all what his majesty says goes but the ideas too good not to try it out it isnt like weve had much luck against bucovin everybody knows how things keep going wrong there maybe this will make them go right instead heres hoping he raised his mug again in the hallway outside the buttery a woman said no no no no no her voice got higher and shriller every time she repeated it hasso didnt wait to hear any more he bounced to his feet and ran out to see what was going on orosei was right behind him aderno was dragging a grenye woman a serving wench along by the wrist she didnt want to come but he was much bigger and much stronger by the goddess wizard cant you find a willing woman orosei didnt bother hiding his scorn i dont want her for that aderno said what then hasso demanded everything about the scene from adernos grip to the womans eyes so wide with fear that you could see white all around the irises looked like a prelude to rape it was your idea aderno answered i want to try that spell on her the one that didnt work on scanno if it doesnt work on her either then bucovins got claws in the palace thats something we need to know orosei relaxed ah all right makes sense hasso didnt cant you use a different spell a spell that doesnt do what the one with scanno would no the wizard shook his head i want everything to be the same except for the person im aiming at a scientific sorcerer hasso thought can you cure the spell once you cast it he asked he didnt like the idea of slagging her face with boils and carbuncles and whatever else aderno would conjure up maybe aderno didnt sound as if he cared or as if he intended to try any which way ill learn something she do something to deserve something bad happen to her hasso asked the grenye woman started shrieking and wailing again now she knew something bad would happen she walked by when i needed somebody thats all that matters aderno replied no let her go hasso said what are you out of your mind id just have to go and catch another one the wizard might have been talking about rabbits let her go hasso repeated find a grenye who does something bad find one who should have it happen he couldnt come up with the word deserve in lenello but he got his meaning across listen hasso take it easy shes only a grenye orosei said in bucovin do they say he is only a lenello hasso asked the masteratarms bristled so did aderno theyd better not orosei growled theyre only grenye sure but theyre not that stupid come on aderno tugged at the woman weve already wasted too much time on this nonsense hasso realized he would have to hurt the wizard maybe kill him to make him stop he hesitated before doing that the way orosei went along with aderno made him hesitate more theyd lived here all their lives they knew how things were supposed to work he hadnt and didnt with a disgusted noise he turned away aderno dragged the grenye woman down the hall as she went she stretched out a hand to hasso you tried lord thank you for trying nobody ever did before then she was gone jesus hasso kicked the wall as hard as he could pain shot up his leg he hadnt thought he could feel any worse and didnt like finding he was wrong what are you throwing a fit for honest puzzlement filled oroseis voice anybodyd think you were laying her or something if you were you shouldve said so the wizard wouldve snagged somebody else but if you were youd better light out for the tall timber starting yesterday on account of the goddess wont be very happy with you not laying her hasso said the masteratarms was right velona wouldnt be happy with him if he were and that was putting it mildly just bad to take advantage of weak why what else are they there for no orosei didnt get it would hasso had he come here flush with victory in he didnt think so defeat was always so much more instructive than victory germany had learned a lot from world war i france next to nothing what would the reich learn this time around not to mess with the goddamn russians thats what he thought not messing with the usa looks like a pretty good idea too and messing with both of them at once is really really dumb things you do sometimes they come back and hasso mimed biting orosei threw his hands in the air oh by the goddess shes only a grenye shes not even a cute grenye im glad youre not screwing her i wouldnt think much of your taste if you were i mean sure pussys pussy but you can do better than that demons you have done better than that way better you think grenye dont remember everything lenelli do to them hasso asked let em remember they cant do anything about it theyre only grenye hasso finished for him how many times had he heard that since finding himself here the lenelli sure believed it did the grenye if they did how come bucovin stayed on its feet thats right thats all theyll ever be orosei thumped him on the back come drink some more beer you look like you could use it youre kind of green around the gills you fit in so well here sometimes i almost forget youre a foreigner with funny notions every once in a while it comes out though no offense a foreigner with funny notions hasso found himself nodding he was that all right back in the reich hed taken things for granted why not they were what hed grown up with here unfairness struck him like a poke in the eye or was it unfairness what if the grenye really were only grenye then wasnt it natural for the lenelli to ride roughshod over them natural or not it was what the lenelli were doing and with his plan for a striking column of lancers it was what he was helping them to do he let orosei steer him back to the buttery a grenye servant brought him more beer the swarthy little curlyhaired man stared at him out of eyes as big and wide and dark as a deers how much of what went on out in the hallway had he heard what kind of gossip would wildfire through the servants in castle drammen by this time tomorrow how much trouble would hasso land in because of it off in the distance but not nearly far enough off in the distance a woman screamed and went on screaming orosei pretended not to hear the way someone whod done a lot of interrogations might pretend not to hear a prisoners screams from the next room hasso tried pretending too but didnt have much luck getting smashed let him forget about the noise and eventually about everything else when he woke up he had no idea how hed got to his own bed velona made a face at him was she worth it the goddess on earth asked a certain malicious glee in her voice things came back in a hurry in spite of hassos headache i dont touch her he said i dont even know her name her name is zadar and i know you didnt touch her or velonas eyes flashed youd be roasting over a slow fire right now hasso didnt think she was using a figure of speech she went on you were stupid even trying to get in adernos way aderno is a beast hasso said he likes hurting people he does it for fun he got out of bed grabbed the chamber pot and pissed and pissed and pissed he didnt bother turning his back the gurgling stream was part of his opinion of aderno too velona understood as much if he hurts our enemies more power to him she said if you get in his way he hurts you too hasso said those perfect blue eyes widened velonas nostrils flared then she relaxed and started to laugh oh i see you mean aderno would hurt anyone who got in his way you didnt mean hed hurt me she didnt believe anyone except the grenye who were beyond the pale of civilized behavior would want to hurt her but hasso shook his head even though it hurt i mean you sweetheart aderno wants what aderno wants anyone who wants something else something bad happens to him or to her the goddess would not allow it velona sounded certain after some of the things hasso had seen he wasnt sure she was wrong but he wasnt sure she was right either the goddess almost lets the grenye catch you he pointed out so she did trouble flicked across velonas face for a moment but then it blew out like a candle in a hurricane instead of letting them catch me though she sent you here you saved me or she saved me through you and now orosei tells me youve got a fine new scheme for smashing bucovin orosei made a pretty fair politician hasso supposed that was part of the masteratarms job too smashing i dont know he shrugged like a frenchman because the lenelli liked overacting i hope we can win some battles with it king bottero has to say yes first oh i think we can arrange that she sounded confident again how would she go about persuading the king if that was what she needed to do do i want to know hasso wondered and needed no more than a heartbeat to decide he didnt vi hasso used coins on a tabletop to show king bottero what he had in mind he didnt do much talking he didnt have to orosei nornat and sanfrat did it for him they were more enthusiastic about his idea than he was seeming filled with converts zeal marshal lugo stood by bottero listening to the cavalry officers bragging about what theyd do to bucovin if the king turned them loose to fight the way they wanted to the marshal looked like a man whod just taken a big bite out of a horsemanure sandwich you can do this bottero asked when the officers finished their excited exposition yes your majesty nornat and sanfrat chorused carsoli wasnt there maybe hed go along if the king ordered it but he was no convert king bottero turned to orosei what do you think its something we havent tried before anyhow the masteratarms answered what we have tried against bucovin hasnt worked real well so why not trot out something different for a change we can use this against lenelli too nornat said once the lancers break the enemy line its like breaking a turtles shell whats inside is meat our meat mm the king plucked at his beard how about you lugo you havent had much to say everything sounds wonderful when youre drinking beer the marshal said how well itll work when we really try it out thats liable to be a different story and not such a pretty one the crack held just enough truth to sting hasso gnawed on his lower lip perhaps noticing him look unhappy bottero asked what do you have to say to that outlander nothing is perfect your majesty some things is uh are better some worse hasso said how good is what you do now bucovin is still here so maybe not so good maybe try something different something new a good answer king bottero replied no not so good lugo cried the foreigner will risk our men risk good lenelli but where will he be someplace safe thats where someplace where he doesnt need to take chances i am no lancer hasso said the marshal sneered hasso held up a hand not done yet i am no lancer but i ride at the front when the column charges he bowed to lugo and clicked his heels the lenelli didnt do that but they recognized the formality of the gesture i ride there yes you ride beside me nornat and sanfrat sucked in their breath together orosei chuckled and then politely tried to pretend he hadnt ill put my money where my mouth is hasso might have said have you got the balls to ride along lugo looked as if he hated him he likely did but he was ruined if he looked like a coward in front of his sovereign if the king orders this foolish scheme to go forward you will not see me hang back he said no miserable outlander will ever say he dares to go where a lenello dares not come with him good hasso ignored the insult we ride together together we crush the grenye nothing else matters you do not have to love me marshal you only have to want to win that is all i want ha lugo said you want to make a big name for yourself to show everyone how smart you are be careful you dont outsmart yourself he wasnt wrong there either no matter how little hasso felt like admitting it the german only shrugged what can i do where can i go this is my land now i want to see king bottero win if the king wins i win if the king loses i lose better for everyone if the king wins that last should have been a subjunctive hasso realized as much after the easier more common indicative came out of his mouth the grammatical error wasnt all bad though it made king botteros triumph sound more nearly inevitable less doubtful than the subjunctive a mood made for showing uncertainty ever could have orosei winked at him maybe the masteratarms thought hed made the mistake on purpose or maybe orosei thought hed said the right thing even if his grammar was bad he could hope so anyhow by the way botteros eyes lit up hasso had said the right thing i am going to win the king boomed the kingdom is going to win we will drive the grenye before us like chaff on the breeze but that seemed to remind him of something else you got silly about some grenye wench not long ago didnt you hasso pemsel except for velona the lenelli mostly used his full name when they werent happy with him the way a parent might have hearing it used that way put his back up silly i dont think so your majesty does aderno treat a horse or a dog bad on purpose not likely why treat a grenye bad on purpose then just make trouble with no need plenty of trouble already yes why make more if you dont have to this will help our folk bottero said in thatsettlesit tones marshal lugo was no fool or at least was not the kind of fool who made a bad courtier yes your majesty he intoned if his tone suggested he would sooner go on the rack than do anything hasso proposed well how could you prove that you couldnt and hasso knew it too bloody well if king bottero found anything wrong with the way his marshal agreed he didnt let on he made a fist and slammed it into his other hand we march against bucovin he declared and that was that the fuhrer could have been no more decisive as botteros realm readied itself for war hasso found himself wondering whether the king might not be too decisive it struck him as late in the year to start a major campaign germany had moved against the ivans on june after delaying six weeks to squash yugoslavia and greece that delay probably kept the wehrmacht from taking moscow and june was right at the summer solstice they were well past it here hasso grimaced when he remembered how theyd celebrated it so much he didnt know about the way things worked here how big exactly was bucovin botteros maps had no reliable scale of distances and how bad were the local winters hasso had no idea hed never been through one he could find out velonas eyes got wide when he asked whether rivers or lakes froze over no she said farther north maybe but not around here do they do that where you come from sometimes too damned often in russia hasso thought then he asked does it snow here only trouble was he didnt know how to say snow in lenello the question came out as does ice fall from the sky he used fluttering fingers to show snowflakes dancing on the breeze velona laughed after she understood what he meant oh yes she said and taught him the words he needed to ask the question the right way she kissed him when he showed he remembered them and could pronounce them if hed got rewards like that in school he figured he would have grown up to be a genius how often does it snow in the winter he asked sometimes velona said with an enchanting shrug dont get too distracted hasso reminded himself she went on it snows every winter sometimes more sometimes less you make war in the wintertime hasso persisted not so much as in the summer but we do velona answered we arent peasants the way the grenye are fighting in the winter is harder for them it takes them away from their farms maybe there was method in botteros madness after all then hasso could hope so anyhow your harvests the past few years are good he asked good enough velona started laughing again this time at him good heavens darling are you going to count every ear of wheat in the granary and every arrow in every horsearchers quiver someone should hasso said stubbornly man for man panzer for panzer the wehrmacht was better than the red army everybody knew that even the ivans but when they could mass five times the men eight times the panzers twenty times the guns quantity took on a quality of its own bucovin wouldnt have that big an edge or he hoped it wouldnt even so lots of grenye too many thats why were going to war it all seemed simple to velona the goddess wants us to rule them she tells you that in hassos world the question would have floated on a sea of sarcasm not here hed seen enough to make him shove sarcasm aside if velona told him the goddess possessed her now and then he couldnt very well argue he had no better name for what happened velona nodded now she wouldnt have led us here if she didnt god wills it the spaniards had believed the same thing and conquered most of two continents before they paused to wonder and the lenelli had a lot more evidence going for them than the spaniards ever had the goddess says bottero beats bucovin this time by now hasso recognized the future and the various past tenses when he heard them before long he would have to start using them himself people understood him when he stayed in the present but he was starting to sound stupid in his own ears she hasnt said one way or the other velona answered but why would she let us go forward if something bad would happen when we did one more question hasso couldnt answer not having been devout back in germany put him at a disadvantage here you could argue about religion in the world he came from not in this one not the same way spiritual things were as real here as wednesday or a poke in the eye in his own world he would have asked if the ambassador from bucovin had been sent packing things worked the same here to a point the lenello kingdoms exchanged envoys among themselves and gave them safeconduct home when they went to war but no lenello kingdom exchanged ambassadors with bucovin recognizing the grenye as equals would have been beneath the lenellis dignity they talked with bucovin when they had to but always unofficially so they could pretend to themselves that it didnt really count he found a different question instead is the eastern border sealed velona looked blank what do you mean hasso wanted to bang his head against the stone outwall of castle drammen being security minister in a kingdom that didnt know anything about security gave him unending frustration things he took for granted had never yet crossed the lenellis minds as patiently as he could he explained grenye go out of drammen they go out of botteros kingdom they go into bucovin they tell the grenye what the king does if we seal the border they cant cross and tell that wouldnt be easy velona said with a frown no not easy hasso agreed but worth trying yes stop some of them from going to bucovin grenye there know less the more we stop the less bucovin finds out i hope velona couldnt issue the orders neither could hasso not by himself the lenelli who knew him personally took him seriously to the ones who didnt he would never be anything but a jumpedup outlander so he took the idea to king bottero the king got it faster than velona had when he did he kissed hasso on both cheeks hed been eating onions so hasso appreciated the sentiment more than the kisses themselves who would have imagined such a thing bottero boomed after releasing hasso from his embrace the goddess knew what she was doing when she sent you to us all right to hassos way of thinking anyone who didnt take those elementary precautions was asking to have his head handed to him were his own fourteenthcentury ancestors this naive if they were it was a miracle any of them lived long enough to reproduce of course the soldiers on both sides must have been equally inept or somebody would have wiped the floor with somebody else ill send the order out to the east by sorcery so we dont waste any more time bottero said yes he did get it not just to the east to the north and south and west too hasso said seal the whole border now the king looked blank grenye can go up or down to another lenello kingdom one without a closed border then they go to bucovin hasso pointed out that got him kissed again you are as slippery as a slug as sneaky as a serpent bottero said hasso supposed those were compliments the king went on i never would have thought of that never i tell you suppose heinrich himmler came from the philippine islands that would probably make him more valuable to the fuhrer not less he would still make a dandy security chief but as a manifest foreigner he could never think of grabbing the topmost job for himself in botteros kingdom hasso was far more foreign than a filipino in berlin another country he was from another world he would never be king not even with the goddess at his side and at his back security minister and technical adviser was as high as he could rise he had the post now he needed to deliver the goods can magic help to find grenye who want to go east he asked grenye who go through the swamp say not by the builtup road grenye who sneak through the swamp bottero tiptoed with his fingers on a tabletop to show what sneak meant hasso nodded his thanks that was a useful verb for a security man to know the king went on im no wizard myself so i cant really tell you aderno could aderno and i we are not happy with each other sometimes hasso came out with phrases hed read they often made people smile in lenello as in german the written language wasnt just the same as the spoken one bottero smiled now for a moment then he looked severe and a man as large and tough as he was could look very severe indeed you serve the kingdom you serve it well aderno was doing the same thing with that grenye wench aderno serves aderno with that grenye wench hasso said stubbornly aderno likes to hurt people fight with grenye gives him a reason he shook his head that wasnt the word he wanted gives him an excuse that was what he wanted to say he serves the kingdom bottero couldnt see anything else hasso shrugged seeing no point in arguing with his sovereign national socialist doctrine shouted that that psychiatrist in vienna was nothing but a crazy damn jew all the same hasso would have bet deutschmarks against dung that aderno had a big old bulge in his pants when he dragged zadar off to what might literally have been a fate worse than death you serve the kingdom too bottero reminded him you and aderno both serve the same goal so you should get along with each other that was logical as far as hasso was concerned it was also next to impossible i would rather kill him than get along with him your majesty he said the king stared at him at first hasso thought hed badly offended bottero then he realized bottero was fighting hard not to laugh the king lost the fight you fell from beyond the moon he said between snorts hasso nodded that wasnt so very different from his own thought of a little while before bottero went on you fell all that way and youre just as touchy and proud as a lenello born a short spit from my palace hasso clicked his heels which showed once more how foreign he was but his words said the opposite i am a man your majesty well velona told me the same thing bottero said what that she is a man dont believe her bottero snorted again if she told me that i wouldnt believe her i know better and so do you he grimaced he must have remembered that his sharing velona didnt make hasso happy before the german could say anything bottero continued no she told me you were a man and its so and youre a man i need thats so too and aderno hasso asked is also a man i need the king said dont try to kill him unless you really have to if you do try you may find that wizards take a deal of killing and sometimes they arent dead even after they die thinking fondly of his schmeisser hasso said i take the chance detachments from west of drammen and from north and south flowed into the capital some by river others by road soldiers camped inside castle drammen and on the wide grounds of the lenello estates around it they swarmed into the grenye districts closer to the walls when they came back most of them were drunk some had unfortunate diseases several got their belt pouches slit a couple of them got their throats slit instead several grenye also ended up dead some in fair fights others by all appearances slaughtered for the sport of it hasso had seen that the grenye districts had plenty of brothels not all the lenelli bothered going to them if some warriors saw a short dark woman whose looks they liked they went and took her if she wasnt a whore she was only a grenye how many times had hasso heard that phrase since coming here more often than he wanted to he knew that he didnt bother taking his worries to bottero the king wouldnt do anything about it instead he talked to velona asking does the goddess like what the soldiers do to women who dont want it or deserve it theyre soldiers she answered with a shrug they act that way because thats how soldiers act what can you do about it me with a sour laugh hasso jabbed a thumb at his own chest i cant do anything i am only a man and only a foreigner at that not only a man quite a man velona purred i thank you hasso hoped shed talked to bottero that way he tried not to let her distract him now it wasnt easy but he managed i cant do anything no but can you you are the goddess does the goddess care for women or not of course she does velona paused i am not the goddess sometimes the goddess is me its not the same thing now hasso shrugged it came close enough for him he knew he would never understand the difference not unless or until a god possessed him he didnt think that was likely it might not be impossible here but even so velona went on if she wants me to do anything about those grenye sluts im sure shell tell me about it some of them werent sluts that was the point hasso kept trying to make the point none of the lenelli wanted to see instead of banging away at it he tried a different tack next time she is in you maybe you should ask her maybe she needs a question to think about it maybe i will velona sounded more as if she was humoring him than as if she really intended to do it but he couldnt do anything about that hed done what he could do if it wasnt enough well when had the grenye ever caught anything close to an even break if they didnt catch one now it wouldnt change the way the world worked very much when enough of his soldiers came into drammen to satisfy him king bottero started east toward the border with bucovin hasso gathered that some units were late and that the king wasnt about to wait for them that made sense to the german despite his own best efforts surprise was bound to be gone all the same you didnt want to waste time on campaign and let the enemy get ready for you the wehrmacht waited around at kursk and how the ivans made them pay fewer men on time were often better than plenty a few days too late plenty of men on time were better still but hasso had realized he couldnt expect too much from the lenelli they knew nothing about germanic efficiency he hoped to teach them but rome wasnt built in a day everything pointed to their being more efficient than the grenye and not just because of magic that would probably do when civilized soldiers attacked barbarians the barbarians usually lost that was how civilization advanced hasso thought of arminius he thought of three roman legions cut to pieces in the teutoberg wald germany stayed outside the roman empire because the barbarians won that time what would his world look like if theyd lost nobody would ever know now hed watched and ridden along when the wehrmacht roared into poland into france into russia because hed done all that watching and riding along when the lenelli moved out of drammen impressed him less than it might have it felt more like a scene from a historical movie with plenty of extras than the start of a real campaign the stinks of sweat and horse manure said it was real enough foot soldiers trudged along in loose order shields and quivers on their backs unstrung bows in their right hands shortswords on their hips almost all of them wore iron helms a few had mailshirts the ones who did wore surcoats to keep the sun from cooking them in their own juice teamsters kept wagons rolling ungreased axles screeched horses and mules strained in the traces choking clouds of dust rose hasso knew all about unpaved roads one more thing the russians had taught him he hoped it wouldnt rain this particular unpaved road would turn to rutted mud and then to glue barges and boats came up the drammion alongside the marching men and noisy wagons moving bulky supplies by water was easier cheaper and faster than it was by land when the river turned to marsh as it would the lenelli would have to unload the vessels in the meantime they took advantage of them companies of mounted archers and lancers rode along as if everything depended on them alone in a way the armored men were right they were the strike force the spearpoint of botteros army they could crack the enemy line the way panzers could in the other world but if the archers ran out of arrows if the lancers were reduced to scattering over the countryside to scrounge for food they wouldnt be able to fight the way they should the lenelli understood that up to a point botteros army had one accompaniment the wehrmacht wouldnt have aderno and six or eight other wizards on unicornback hasso would have preferred stukas and messerschmitts overhead or even a hotair or hydrogenfilled observation balloon he knew he would never get the airplanes they were much too far over the technological horizon a balloon might be possible one of these years his own horse was a good steady gelding he could hope it wouldnt go mad with fear when he started shooting from its back he did envy the wizards the elegance and beauty of their mounts he also envied them the unicorns horns some silvered like adernos others gilded not only were they splendid they looked to be formidable in battle too a pity lancers and archers dont ride unicorns he said when they stopped for supper the first evening out of drammen aderno looked through him since they almost came to blows over the grenye serving woman the wizard barely bothered staying polite for one thing unicorns are rare and so deserving to carry on their backs men with rare talent he said for another they will not suffer men without sorcerous talent to mount them anyone but an ignorant newcomer would know as much it wasnt quite screw you stupid but it came close enough i bet i can ride one hasso said the rest of the wizards laughed till they had to hold their sides you want to be thrown and stomped and gored dont you said one of them a beanpole of a man named flegrei no i want to ride a unicorn hasso reached into a pocket he was wearing his wehrmacht trousers which boasted such refinements and pulled out a goldpiece this says i can do it youre on flegrei shouted and showed off his own shiny coin all the wizards except aderno clamored to bet hasso he had to check whether he had enough money with him to cover them as it turned out he did he thought they really wanted not just his gold but to watch him get thrown and stomped and gored since he figured aderno had more reason to want that than any of the others he asked you too aderno bit his lip yes he wanted to watch the foreigner fail too he just wasnt so sure as the rest of the wizards that hasso would in the end though he nodded yes me too why not hasso turned out not to have one more coin if the unicorn kills me tell velona i say she should pay you he said aderno nodded hasso bowed to the other wizards whose unicorn do i ride you mean whose unicorn dont you ride flegrei jeered you can try with mine once you get what you deserve maybe you wont strut so tall that gibe stung hasso didnt like being short among the lenelli he briefly wondered how the grenye most of whom were much shorter than he was enjoyed looking up to the big blond men from out of the west but then the grenye slipped from his mind he bowed again shorten the stirrup leathers please he told flegrei whose legs were much longer than his flegreis answering bow was scorn personified at your service my prickly little hedgehog he said hasso watched him closely as he adjusted them but he did an honest job of it that had to mean he really didnt believe hasso could stay on the unicorn when flegrei finished he stepped away from the beautiful snowy beast all yours danke sch o n hasso forgot lenello for the moment he walked up to the unicorn it looked at him sidelong out of an eye as blue as velonas a low snort more curious than anything else he hoped came from it the wizards murmured among themselves maybe theyd expected the unicorn to run him through with its horn as soon as he got anywhere near it before he could think about what he was doing he swung up into the saddle the unicorn snorted again this time sounding distinctly surprised it started to buck cut that out he said and went to work calming it as he would have with a restive horse and the unicorn sensing that the new rider though a stranger had some notion of what he was doing up there did calm down he rode it in a slow circle around the staring wizards and halted directly in front of flegrei dismounting he bowed yet again and held out his hand nice animal now pay up you cocksure bastard goggling flegrei paid how did you do that he choked out easy hasso jabbed a thumb at his own chest im magic youre smart you stop screwing with me he went around to the other wizards collecting a goldpiece from each of them he saved aderno for last you too here aderno gave him the coin you are magical or you can be if you saw the gold star you certainly can be but i didnt think potential would satisfy a unicorn which shows i dont know as much as i wish i did there is more to you than meets the eye hasso pemsel how much more keeps surprising me and not always happily back in germany hasso thought id have to be a virgin to ride a unicorn but there were no unicorns in germany and with the russians rampaging through the country all hot with vengeance there probably werent a hell of a lot of virgins left there either the wizards squabbled furiously he saw gold flegrei shouted at aderno why the demon didnt you say so you would have saved us all some money you would have saved us from looking like idiots too another sorcerer said nothing could save some people from looking like idiots aderno could be bitchy you must be one of them the other wizard retorted if he saw gold and you bet against him you deserved to lose by the goddess its not just the talent its the training or i thought it was aderno said but it seems i was wrong yes it seems you were flegrei sounded disgusted and it cost all of us gold and now the goddesscursed foreigner will be more puffed up than ever hasso felt like making his chest swell up and strutting around like a pouter pigeon he decided not to though flegrei was already angry enough at him and aderno said watch your mouth you blockhead whatever the foreigner is hes not goddesscursed velona will put your ears on a necklace if she hears you go around saying he is ha im not afraid of her flegrei declared well if that doesnt prove youre a blockhead i dont know what would aderno said by the way the rest of the wizards stepped back from flegrei they agreed with aderno that was one more sign of the power of the woman hasso had taken up with or rather the woman whod taken up with him as for his own power security minister wasnt bad de facto general staff officer wasnt bad either and showing up a bunch of haughty wizards and making money while he did it was a hell of a lot better than not bad coming back to castle svarag wasnt quite like coming home for hasso he wondered if he would ever feel at home anywhere here he doubted it giving up the sense of home was the emigres curse but hed spent some time at mertois castle and hed got to know a good many of the castellans soldiers he felt less not at home here than he did most other places in this world the convoluted thought made one corner of his mouth quirk up in ironic amusement good to see you little man good to see you sholseth boomed the clout on the back he gave hasso almost knocked him over i hear you and orosei couldnt take each other out after a while we stop trying hasso answered we decide why bother one of us could get hurt bad sholseth nodded makes sense i tell you i felt better when i heard orosei didnt beat you hes as good as weve got i know i cant take him even though im bigger so if youre as good as he is no wonder you knocked me for a loop maybe im just lucky hasso said nah sholseth shook his head youre good when you threw me over your shoulder i thought what the demon am i getting into then i went wham and i pretty much stopped thinking after that he thumped hasso again still goodnaturedly he seemed to take a perverse pride in being the first lenello to discover what a formidable fellow this foreigner could be hasso was glad enough to drink and talk with his old acquaintances but he also found he had serious business at castle svarag mertois was keeping close to a dozen grenye whod got caught slipping east toward bucovin in his dungeon hasso had them brought out one at a time if you lie to me you be sorry he told the first one a stocky man named magar he nodded to aderno and the wizard he knows if you lie i didnt do anything magar said stolidly no one ever does anything hasso answered with a weary sigh everyone is always so innocent it makes you cry why you run off to bucovin i wasnt going to bucovin magar said i had a fight with my woman i was going away when these lenelli on horseback grabbed me and hauled me back here well hasso asked aderno the wizard used the little truth spell hasso had seen before then he frowned im not sure it doesnt say yes or no his head came up and his nostrils twitched he might have been a hunting hound taking a scent this reminds me of how that goddesscursed scanno masked his taste for grenyeloving does it hasso eyed magar where do we go now where else the torturers theyll pull the truth out of him aderno answered magar let out a horrified yowl i didnt do anything he wailed when he found words dont hurt me i didnt do anything aderno waited to see what hasso did next if hasso didnt go along the wizard would suspect him of liking the grenye too well but that wasnt what decided him bucovin was the enemy if magar worked for the grenye there he would know useful things things king bottero needed to find out yes we give him to them hasso said magar howled again ignoring him hasso went on they need to go after truth not to hurt for the fun of hurting they know the difference they know aderno assured him he couldnt help adding i wasnt sure you did oh yes hasso said like any army the wehrmacht squeezed enemy prisoners when it had to so did the waffenss often more enthusiastically sometimes prisoners say anything just to stop hurting he warned have to be careful keep him away from others weigh what he says what they say he used his hands as a set of scales coming into balance yes aderno nodded you do know something about this business i wondered how soft you were because sometimes i think you are a jackass that makes me soft hasso asked aderno blinked hasso went on i know sometimes you think i am a jackass too i do not think that makes you soft he jerked a thumb at magar have them work on him where the ones we question can hear him yell when they hear that they want to tell us everything we need to know yes magar quailed from the wizards smile hasso didnt blame him he would have quailed too were those teeth and that twist of lip aimed his way a good thought outlander yes a very good thought sure enough the grenyes shrieks pierced the interrogation chamber like so many spearthrusts the other little dark men quivered whenever a new one rang out hasso let a couple of them go free after adernos magic showed they really were hunting or fishing when the lenelli scooped them up if you are not king botteros enemy i am not your enemy he told them but if you are the kings enemy my job is to make you sorry i do i will do my job the ones he turned loose blubbered their thanks some of the ones he didnt turn loose went on claiming they had nothing to do with anything adernos spell didnt always prove they were lying it didnt exonerate them either it did nothing the ambiguity the blankness were plenty to make hasso and aderno suspicious those grenye went to the torturer too one peasant sang like a goldfinch his name was lupul and he admitted everything as soon as he heard another grenye yell in torment hasso could almost watch his ballocks crawl up into his belly yes i wanted to tell bucovin what you were doing he gabbled why not my people rule bucovin you blond robbers dont we will aderno said he turned to hasso now what do we do with him he should have a quick end anyway hasso said give him to the headsman lupul wailed hasso felt like wailing himself though he didnt show it if the grenye were still clan against clan tribe against tribe beating them in detail would be easier if they saw the struggle as all of them against the lenelli well it sure didnt help vii king bottero didnt invade bucovin along the causeway road through the swamp he sent soldiers along it but only to hold it against any counterthrusts from the grenye to the east once we drive the savages back we can send supplies and reinforcements up the causeway he said hasso nodded along with botteros marshals the men of bucovin could have blocked an advance along the causeway for a long time with only a handful of men hasso was relieved that the lenelli could see as much for themselves he didnt like having to point out their stupidities and blindnesses to them some of it was necessary hell a lot of it was necessary but he recognized the difference between gadfly and pain in the ass he felt oroseis ironic eye on him the masteratarms was no marshal but bottero would have had a mutiny on his hands if he tried to keep him in the dark did orosei know what hasso was thinking it looked that way to the wehrmacht officer some of the lighter boats could go out into the marsh at least partway the rest unloaded their supplies which went into more wagons that made the army slower and more unwieldy than it had been but hasso didnt know what anybody could do about it you needed things to fight and you needed to haul them to where you fought his horses hooves drummed on the planks of a bridge that took him over the drammion to the south bank grenye farmers looked up from their fields to stare at the lenelli riding by in their dull homespun the peasants seemed hardly more than domestic animals themselves looks could deceive though and probably did in russia the germans hadnt paid much attention to the peasants once the red army was beaten the new overlords would get around to the muzhiks then the partisans started dynamiting railroad lines and sniping from the woods how many of these grenye would try to slip off and let bucovin know which way the lenelli were going too many hasso was sure of that his security cordon had stopped a lot of the natives from succeeding as spies had it stopped all of them could it he knew better he rode up alongside the king pointing out the peasants in the fields he said more spy trouble well well deal with it bottero answered by now were moving as fast as they are they wont get to bucovin much ahead of us yes your majesty hasso said that was true i wished they like lenelli better than they do i dont care what they think about us as long as they dont make trouble they can think whatever they want the king said in a way he made sense that offered the grenye a safety valve in another way though if they think bad things about lenelli maybe they try to do bad things too hasso said let them try well squash them weve done it before we can do it again bottero didnt lack confidence from everything hasso had seen lenelli rarely did but the germans had been sure they would have no trouble ruling russia maybe they wouldnt have had they won the lenelli would be fine too as long as they kept winning so it seemed to hasso anyway if they ever started to lose with magic on their side could they lose were the grenye really forever barred from it what about halfbreeds there had been renegade wizards bottero had spoken of them what if another one arose hasso laughed at himself was he trying to see how much trouble he could borrow the laughter died every time hed done that in the wehrmacht there always turned out to be even more than he thought he had a tent for himself and velona he wondered why shed come along was she a mascot for botteros army did she intend to fight he knew she was strong enough and skilled enough to do that if she wanted to shed gone into bucovin all alone without an army at her back shed gone in alone yes and shed barely come out alive if not for somebody literally falling into the swamp from another world she wouldnt have the grenye would have caught her and killed her what did that say whatever it said she didnt want to talk about it all she wanted to do was joke holding her nose she said you smell like a horse my dear so do you hasso answered she did too but she also smelled like herself better than any other woman hasso had ever known still bantering he went on i love you anyhow that sobered her as effectively as a bucket of cold water in the face be careful hasso pemsel she said her voice altogether serious it is dangerous to love me too much deadly dangerous for a lenello deadly dangerous for you too unless youre much more different from us than i think you are how can anyone help it he asked men cant help it she answered without modesty and also without doubt thats part of what makes it so dangerous only part he kept trying to tease but velonas nod was the next thing to somber yes only part remember i am the goddess too a man a mere man who loves me is like a moth that loves a torch he flies too close and he burns what about king bottero no the night of the summer solstice wouldnt go away and the autumn equinox was coming would bottero and velona and the goddess celebrate it in front of the army if they did hasso expected another drunken night and another painful morning in the dim lamplight velonas eyes went even wider and bigger than they were already by the goddess no she exclaimed he enjoys me i know that but love me hes not so foolish he knows better but i dont is that what you mean hasso didnt try to hide his bitterness some of what i mean velona was nothing if not blunt maybe some of that had to do with the indwelling divinity she carried more though hasso judged came from her own nature she went on the other difference is i like bottero but i really care for you i dont want anything bad to happen to you because of me but it may if you care for someone he stayed away from the explosive word love you worry about things like that i thank you he gave her a gesture that was half a nod half a salute she sighed you dont know what youre talking about youre thinking of a broken heart you can get a broken heart if you fall in love with a milkmaid even a grenye in love with another ugly little grenye can get a broken heart but if the goddess ever has reason to be angry at you she left it there hasso started to ask her what might happen maybe shed already answered him though like a moth that loves a torch in his world it would have been one more figure of speech here he wasnt so sure he wanted to find out have to keep the goddess happy with me then he said and reached for velona even if she does smell like a horse laughing velona kissed him but then she said oh no thats just me he thought about teasing her some more it didnt seem like a good idea making love on the other hand never seemed like a bad idea he blew out the lamp castle pedio hard by the border between botteros kingdom and bucovin was less a fortress than an observation post it had the tallest towers hasso had seen since coming to this new world the reason was simple those towers let the lenelli see as far into bucovin as they could half a kilometer east of castle pedio rose another structure one that looked a lot like it castle galats that one was called the grenye had built it it was clumsier heavier the grenye didnt have the tools or the skills the lenelli did but castle galats served its purpose a signal fire at the top warned bucovin that king bottero was on his way by this route hasso swore when he saw the fire should take that castle by surprise when you decide to go to war he told bottero then signal doesnt go out the king frowned you tell me that now i see it makes sense but why didnt you suggest it before i dont know this castle is here then hasso answered with a shrug why dont you tell me about it everyone must have thought you did know bottero said anybody who knows anything about the border would he stopped and sighed but you dont know anything much about the border do you only what i hear hasso said i dont hear about watchtowers im sorry but this is the first time i am here your majesty i am stranger here this place can still surprise me it still does surprise me every day well you surprise us too mostly in good ways king bottero said except when you show you dont belong here we think you do thank you hasso said even if the king meant you dont seem too barbarous most of the time he pointed toward castle galats do we take that place or do we just mask it mask it bottero said at once the men from castle pedio can do that neither place has a big garrison however you like hasso said i just dont want any nasty surprises when we go by i dont like getting nasty surprises giving is better he pointed toward the beacon fire in the grenye tower we dont give any for a while now sooner or later we will as usual the king sounded confident when the grenye try to face us well make them pay your striking column will help by the goddess i hope so hasso had all kinds of reasons for saying that he wanted to make marshal lugo look like the stickinthemud the french general in lenellos clothing that he was he wanted to make his own stock rise and he wanted to beat bucovin which would help him reach both those other goals the grenye in castle galats jeered at the lenelli as the invaders went by botteros men stayed out of arrow range of the watchtower so hasso couldnt get a close look at the barbarians equipment some of the grenye seemed to be wearing iron while others made do with bronze they know iron when lenelli come here hasso asked aderno yes but they were just learning to use it the wizard looked as if hed just bitten down on a particularly sour pickle theyve learned a lot more since from us they buy as much as they make themselves from us why sell to them some people care more about money than anything else and dont care how they get it aderno replied is it not the same in your world since it was hasso nodded and let it go he looked around so we are inside bucovin now oh yes aderno nodded too cant you see how shabby everything looks to hassos eyes the land on this side of the border seemed no different from the land on the other side the peasants in botteros kingdom were also grenye the thatchroofed cottages here looked the same as the ones farther east to the wehrmacht officer anyway how do you mean he asked aderno made an exasperated noise anyone with eyes to see would know well maybe you dont have eyes to see all right then he started ticking points off on his fingers a lot of their crops here are native weeds they dont grow the fine vegetables and good grains we brought with us from across the sea you can live on millet and sorghum and squashes but why would you want to he made a face were the grenye slobs or was aderno a snob some of both probably hasso judged he and his buddies had sneered at the ivans for eating kasha and sunflower seeds till they gradually realized that sneering at the ivans wasnt such a good idea any which way i see he said slowly do you i hope so aderno said i was just getting started though their livestock is inferior too they had no chickens before we came only ducks miserable things too and halftame quail and partridges their pigs are only a short step up from wild boars the sheep and cattle they breed they stole from us their native horses are barely even ponies and they have no unicorns at all they cant ride them and unicorns also come from across the sea he laid a hand on the side of his mounts white neck europeans would have said the same kinds of things about red indians but how much of what the grenye had was really that much worse than its lenello equivalents and how much just seemed unfamiliar to aderno and his folk hasso didnt know the answer he did know aderno didnt even see the question are you sure the grenye cant ride unicorns he asked an edge came into his voice as he added remember not long ago you say that about me this time aderno might have been sucking on the mother of all lemons i was wrong about you and it cost me i am not wrong about the grenye by the goddess he paused thoughtfully maybe i was wrong when i said they had no unicorns theyve stolen a few from us the way they steal big horses to improve their herds and its possible that theyve bred the unicorns too but no one has ever seen a grenye on unicornback not in all the years since lenelli crossed the sea he sounded positive hasso whod been here a matter of months was in no position to contradict him i see the german said again let aderno make whatever he wanted of that before long hasso saw something else too the first armed grenye hed spotted in the field they werent an army only scouts a handful of men on horseback who kept their eye on king botteros army but stayed as far away from it as they could while still doing their job every so often one of them would ride off no doubt to report to their superiors while another took his place we should catch some of them hasso said we should find out what they know we should find out what they think we should find out if they think aderno said scornfully besides theyll just scurry off into the woods if we chase them you see how close to the trees they stay yes hasso had noticed that cant you bring them in by magic though hed rarely seen any lenello at a loss he did now with aderno by the goddess i dont know the wizard said it would be childs play on the other side of the border here well i can find out back in his own world hasso might have asked a radio technician to find the direction from which a soviet signal was coming aderno set to work with that same kind of unflustered competence he rummaged first in his belt pouches and then in his saddlebags for what he needed he found a chunk of amber a small stone that showed different colors depending on how the sun struck it an opal hasso realized and a smooth rounded pebble that looked thoroughly ordinary what is that hasso asked pointing at it a capons gizzard stone a fiveyearold capons gizzard stone aderno answered with relentless precision it aids in gaining ones desire from any man the other two taken together will make you victorious against your adversaries oh yeah hasso thought back home he wouldnt have believed it though he knew plenty of highranking nazis were gaga for the occult and the supernatural much good that had done them or the reich the way germany was collapsing seemed to him the best argument in the world in that world against sorcery but things were different here on the back of his unicorn aderno started juggling the three stones hasso pemsel thought that was the funniest thing hed ever seen especially when the wizard thrust out his right index finger at a grenye rider while all three stones were in the air at the same time it might have looked ridiculous hell it did look ridiculous that didnt mean it didnt work the grenye from bucovin the wild grenye the lenelli would have called him didnt want to ride up to king botteros army he didnt want to approach the wizard on the unicorn hasso could see that more and more plainly as the fellow rode closer and closer no matter how unwilling he was he did what aderno required of him not what he wanted to do well well aderno sounded pleased with himself isnt that nice isnt that something something yes hasso wasnt sure what he was sure it made his hackles rise but as long as it worked how much did that matter here you are grenye aderno said as the horseman came up alongside him and hasso do you speak lenello yes i speak it the grenyes accent was thicker than hassos but he made himself understood tell me your name aderno said and then in an aside to hasso one more sorcerous hold on him again the grenye didnt want to but found he had no choice i am called nebun he said instead of a lenellostyle conical helm he wore a leather cap strengthened with iron strips his mailshirt showed less skill than the elegant armor lenelli wore his sword though hasso would have guessed a lenello smith forged it for it seemed the same as the ones botteros soldiers carried what had lenin said about capitalists selling the soviet union the rope it would use to hang them no some things didnt change a bit from one world to another what are your orders nebun aderno asked and twisted his fingers in a certain sign again to hasso he added keeps him docile so it did or it seemed to anyhow nebun answered readily enough to spy out your force to see how strong you are tell your superiors we have twice the numbers you really see hasso put in tell them you fear for your land do not let them persuade you of anything else no matter what they say do you follow me yes sir nebun might have been talking to a superior i will obey you as i would obey my own father hasso glanced over to aderno can i rely on that he asked in german so the grenye wouldnt understand adernos magic let him follow the alien tongue he nodded i think so you might almost have set a spell on him he glanced over at nebun for all i know you did you are not without power as my lost goldpiece reminds me the idea that he might be able to work magic made hasso want to laugh the extra gold jingling in his belt pouch was a good reason to take the notion seriously though go nebun he said go back to your chiefs tell them how strong we are tell them we are very strong tell them you see all this with your own eyes go now i go nebun booted his pony up into a walk and then into a trot he wasnt such a smooth rider as most of the lenelli but he got the job done that should confuse them hasso said if they think they know things that are not so they get confused they make mistakes if they think they know aderno raised a wry eyebrow i get confused too finding out what is really so is important hasso said the one who knows that better usually wins inevitably the german invasion of russia came to mind again the wehrmacht thought stalin had far fewer divisions than he proved able to pull out of his hat by the time the first winters fighting was under way the germans had destroyed as many divisions as theyd believed the russians could raise but more ivans kept coming at them and more and still more and now if hasso were magically transported back to berlin it would be a berlin under the hammer and sickle anything was better than that one thing that is really so i already told you we can work magic and the grenye cant aderno said now you see it with your own eyes i see that you can work magic and that that grenye cant hasso halfagreed he said nothing about his own magical abilities if any but if this is so wonderful why dont lenelli take falticeni a long time ago the wizard gave him a dirty look but no answer not even velona had an answer for that or so it seemed if your men are so much better why didnt they take moscow how many times would people throw that in germanys face the surviving veterans would blame the winter the russian t tanks wide tracks the siberian troops brought in to stiffen the soviet line everyone and everything but themselves no some things didnt change a bit from one world to another do the grenye in bucovin worship the goddess hasso asked velona at breakfast the next morning or do they have their own gods the ones they have before you lenelli come here she sipped from a mug of beer hasso still missed coffee and tobacco this was this worlds new world wasnt it why didnt it have tobacco in it whatever the reason it didnt after swallowing velona said some worship the goddess theyve seen she has true power their old gods are just statues of stone or wood some of them look pretty but what do they do she might have been a hebrew prophet mocking the local baals no sooner had that thought crossed hassos mind than he laughed at himself if the prophets had any descendants the reich would have settled most of them once and for all you didnt ask questions about what the einsatzgruppen were up to you didnt really need to ask the big wheels were serious about making sure the lands they ruled were judenfrei but the goddess here wasnt sleepy like the longignored baals of palestine she didnt ignore her worshipers the way the jews god forgot about them she was as real as a river no wonder the grenye started bowing down before her the wonder was that any of them stayed stubborn enough to keep on following whatever gods theyd had before that brought up another question what goed no went curse it wrong when you went into bucovin before hasso asked before answering velona smiled at him your lenello is getting better all the time baptism by total immersion hasso said in german it wouldnt have meant anything to velona even in her language but when he needed to use lenello to talk at all he had the biggest incentive in the world for getting fluent as fast as he could he could have used aderno to translate if he and the wizard didnt rub each other the wrong way all the time hed learned the language faster because he was doing it on his own with an effort he brought his mind back to the business at hand bucovin yes bucovin velona stopped smiling i dont know what went wrong i told you that before i think things stopped working that was all the whole country might have been trying to see through me and finally it did how do you stop it hasso asked if i knew i would tell you she answered once we settle our knights on the land once we have our wizards in the towns things should take care of themselves i hope so anyhow hasso didnt know what to say to that the germans had been sure that once they seized moscow things would take care of themselves then after moscow didnt fall theyd been just as sure that grabbing stalingrad would set everything right then after stalingrad didnt fall hasso forced his mind out of that unhappy groove saddling his horse and getting going did the job the tackle the lenelli used wasnt the same as what hed known in germany the way horses and people were made dictated a lot about bits and reins and saddles and straps and stirrups but not everything he had to think about what he was doing here more than he would have with familiar equipment the land was new too far off to the east he saw mountains against the horizon were they visible from castle svarag if they were he didnt remember them a lenello told him that was the palmorz range what is on the other side of it hasso asked well i dont exactly know the horseman answered not many lenelli have been over it and you know what liars travelers are could be anything he shook his head well i dont think theres mermaids dragons though maybe dragons hasso had seen them on everything from banners to belt buckles but he could have seen them on things like that in germany too are they real i hope to spit the lenello said or words to that effect didnt one burn down a village in king chersos realm three winters back wouldnt he have burned another one if a catapult didnt get lucky and put a bolt through his wing and make him fly away king chersos realm lay well to the north of botteros that was all hasso knew about it no now he knew one thing more it had a dragon problem or had had one three winters back if the catapult missed what would the dragon have done he asked he was starting to get the hang of the subjunctive torn up everything in sight i expect the lenello said thats what dragons do when they get pissed off right i suppose hasso answered a handy phrase that could mean anything or nothing hasso approved of cliches they helped him get his meaning across even when he hardly had one by the way botteros army behaved in bucovin it might have been an angry dragon a lot of grenye farmers fled before it taking as much of their livestock with them as they could the lenelli grabbed everything the locals left behind the pigs and occasional cattle and sheep went into the armys larder so did the ducks and odd chickens and geese so did all the grain the soldiers could find regardless of type the horses and donkeys were mostly too small for lenelli to ride but the invaders took them anyhow to help haul wagons and carts and farmhouse after farmhouse village after village went up in flames botteros soldiers took a childlike delight in arson hasso hadnt known any soldiers germans or russians or poles or frenchmen or british who didnt he would have bet the grenye got hardons watching things burn too but there was more to it than that the way the lenelli went about torching houses and smithies and taverns and shops they might have felt the grenye had no right to build such things no it wasnt that they might have felt the grenye had no right to do it they did feel that way and werent shy about saying so goddesscursed savages a sergeant growled as he touched a burning brand to the overhanging thatch of a farmhouse roof he swore some more when the thatch which was damp sent up a cloud of thick gray smoke without catching the way he wanted it to in the end persistence paid and he got the farmhouse blazing theyve got their nerve pretending to be as good as we are where do you want them to live hasso asked genuinely curious in holes in the ground the sergeant spat theyll be in holes in the ground when were done with em all right only thing is they wont be living bucovin affronted aderno at least as much as it did the underofficer the wizard was more articulate about it or at least mouthier do you know what this land reminds me of he said as the lenelli rode past the funeral pyre of a village no but youre going to tell me arent you hasso said aderno missed the sarcasm yes i am he said and hasso carefully didnt smile youve seen the paintings we do havent you oh yes fine work hasso sounded more enthusiastic than he was some of the canvases hed seen in drammen did show talent but the lenelli were just starting to understand perspective to someone whod admired work by raphael and rembrandt and rubens among many others these people were no better than promising amateurs i should hope so confident of his own folks superiority aderno heard enthusiasm whether it was there or not well the grenye remind me of a twelveyearold trying to copy say tiberos coming ashore you know the painting i mean oh yes hasso said again to his eye the artist had tried to do too much in not enough space ships and heroic lenelli and savage grenye and waves and animals peering from the forest and the naked goddess watching everything next to the sun sometimes art was more about knowing what to leave out than about what all to put in tibero wasnt a bad artist but hed never figured that out well if a child tries to copy a masterpiece all you get is a sorry mess the wizard said and thats what bucovin is a sorry mess hasso nodded and the lenelli were making it a worse mess they didnt care what the grenye thought of them because of their fondness for arson the wehrmacht hadnt cared what the ivans thought when it marched into russia either later later turned out to be too late a lenello died of lockjaw not long after botteros army entered bucovin hasso wondered how the warrior managed to puncture himself with so much manure around a tiny wound was all it took no vaccine or antitoxin here even the idea for them was a universe away hasso hadnt seen or heard of smallpox in this world for which he was duly grateful he did know that cowpox could keep you from coming down with the horrible disease and except for first aid his knowledge of medicine started and stopped right there he wondered when the grenye would try to fight back or would they at all would they try to suck the lenelli into their heartland and let winter deal with them the way the russians did with napoleon how bad were winters here anyway milder than russias anyhow from what velona said cursed grenye are cowardly scuts king bottero said when hasso asked him what the enemy was up to if they can keep from fighting us chances are they will not half an hour after the king said that an excited courier brought word that a grenye scout had popped up from behind a bush shot an arrow into the unarmored leg of a lenello scout and managed to get away in the confusion that followed miserable skulker the man who brought the news sounded furious at the native stinking sneak remembering how the partisans went about their business in germanoccupied russia hasso said teamsters need to be careful outriders need to be careful the grenye may go after people who dont expect to fight only proves theyre cowards the king said if they hurt us how much does that matter hasso asked war is not about being brave not all about that anyway bottero stared at him an uncomprehending gape hed seen too many times what is war about then the king demanded winning hassos oneword answer came without the least hesitation it was the answer of a man whod seen his comrades show more courage than humanly possible in the grinding retreat across russia and poland and germany itself it was the answer of a man whod seen that courage on display in berlin where in the end it would do no good at all winning your majesty the wehrmacht officer repeated in the end nothing else counts king bottero still didnt get it well of course well win he said how we do it counts too hasso saw only one thing to say to that and he said it yes your majesty he didnt believe it for a minute a few lenelli orosei sprang to mind knew better the rest of them were full of chivalric nonsense except when they were pillaging bucovinan farmhouses and firing bucovinan villages that was the small change of war though in battle they could show their style his deep attacking column let the lenelli show their style bottero had probably said he could try it out for just that reason after everything hasso had seen on all the fronts of europe hed given up on style only results mattered the natives seemed to agree with him they dug pits in the road ahead of the advancing lenello army and mounted sharp stakes in the bottom those killed one horse and wounded a rider then botteros men started to be more careful when they saw that the roadway looked suspicious they pulled off into the fields to either side of the dirt track before long the grenye started digging pits in the fields too those were harder to spot than the ones in the road they killed several horses and a couple of lenelli they also infuriated the survivors some of the lenelli wanted to kill all the bucovinans they found from then on to warn the others not to do such things velona was in that camp which worried hasso she did make it plain she was speaking for herself not for the goddess that being so bottero had the nerve to say no after we conquer this country who will till the land if we use up all the peasants he demanded and no one had an answer for him frightfulness hasso had mixed feelings about it the germans had used it widely of course sometimes it intimidated people into behaving other times the hatred it stirred up only made occupied areas boil with resistance you couldnt know which ahead of time frustration and anger built up in botteros army because there were no enemy soldiers to attack and then all at once there were lenello scouts reported a large force of grenye ahead blocking botteros advance deeper into bucovin when the news came back the lenelli burst into cheers now theyll pay for screwing around with us a horseman yelled now well see how well your famous attacking column works marshal lugo told hasso the german had no trouble understanding the words behind the words now well see how smart you really are the marshal meant viii battle came early the next morning the lenelli eagerly pushed forward king bottero didnt have to harangue them to get them moving they wanted to hit the grenye they were champing at the bit for the chance they seemed more enthusiastic about fighting than any wehrmacht or even waffenss troops hasso had ever seen he wondered why arrows and swords werent bullets and shell fragments but they could still dish out some pretty horrendous wounds but nobody in this world looked forward to dying at a ripe old age dying however you did it was commonly slow and painful here the way it had been in europe up until not long before hassos time if you died on the battlefield at least it was over in a hurry that was bound to have something to do with things hasso got a glimpse of the rest when the bucovinan battle line came into sight the natives didnt seem eager for battle they hadnt rushed forward the way the lenelli had they aimed to defend not to attack just seeing them infuriated botteros men it was as if the germans had faced an army of chimpanzees or jews think they can stand against us do they aderno growled well theyd better think twice thats all velona didnt say anything at all she stared out toward the assembled grenye stared and stared and stared her eyes showed white all around the iris her breath rasped in her throat each inhalation made her chest heave and not in any erotically exciting way she looked like a woman about to have or maybe in the throes of an epileptic fit she looks like a woman the goddess is about to possess hasso thought and gooseflesh prickled up on his arms then anticlimax the bucovinans sent a rider forward under sign of truce they didnt use a white flag here instead the horseman carried a leafy branch which he waved over his head he paused right at the edge of bowshot king bottero leaned over to speak to a herald a man whod got his job with leather lungs come ahead and say your say the herald bawled we wont kill you yet the bucovinan envoy rode closer was he here to get a good look at the lenello line of battle hasso had disguised the assault column as well as he could lancers were deployed all along the line and the ones at the front rode with lances raised the men farther back in the column kept their lances down so they would be harder to notice from a distance why have you invaded our land the native asked in good lenello we are not at war go back to your own homes leave us alone leave us at peace how many nations that found themselves suddenly at war made the same agonized request almost all of them chances were hasso had heard that when german invaded russia on june a soviet diplomat plaintively asked what did we do to deserve this the ivans had done plenty no doubt about it but hassos wry amusement lasted no longer than a heartbeat how could it last when things turned out so disastrously different from what the fuhrer had in mind if anyone in his own world asked that question these days it was the germans themselves king bottero had never had to worry about godless russian hordes killing and raping their way through his country because he hadnt he laughed in the bucovinan heralds face this is not your land little man he said it is ours and we have come to take it the natives mouth tightened a flush further darkened his alreadyswarthy cheeks by the standards of the lenelli he was a little man he was at least twenty centimeters shorter than hasso and hasso was a shrimp next to bottero and a lot of his warriors but the grenyes voice remained calm as he answered it is not yours till you take it your majesty if you do bottero laughed again oh we will little man we will tell me your name so that after the fight i can claim you for my personal slave i am called trandafir your majesty the bucovinan replied you need not tell me your name i already know it i will take your words back to my lord he turned his pony and rode off toward his own line bottero stared after him stared and then glared the king needed longer than he should have to realize the native had given him the glove maybe he had trouble believing a grenye would have the nerve to imply hed take bottero as his personal slave by the goddess that wretch will be no bondsman bottero snarled i will make sure he is dead the way i would with any snapping dog and well you should your majesty marshal lugo said he offered you intolerable insult he didnt seem to notice that the king had insulted the herald first the lenelli werent good about noticing such things the germans hadnt been good about noticing them in russia either why bother the ivans were nothing but untermenschen werent they four years earlier the answer to that question would have seemed obvious as a matter of fact it still did but the obvious answer now wasnt the same as it had been in to keep from thinking about that hasso watched trandafir ride back to his line bucovin used banners of dark blue and ocher the wehrmacht officer wasnt surprised to see their envoy ride over to where those banners clustered thickest the grenye king or general or whatever he was would be there passing on botteros reply took only a moment the natives couldnt have expected anything else the lenelli wouldnt have come here in arms intending to turn around and go home again but here as in the world from which hasso came the forms had to be observed horns blared along the bucovinan battle line first in that center group of banners and then up and down its whole length the timbre wasnt quite the same as that of the lenelli horns even summoning men to imminent battle it sounded mournful in hassos ears the horns themselves looked different they had a strange curve to them one that didnt look quite right to the german regardless of whether the horn calls seemed strange to him they did what they were supposed to do they roused the enemy army to defiance the bucovinans shouted their hatred and derision at the oncoming lenelli when they brandished their weapons sunlight and fire seemed to ripple up and down their ranks they might be barbarians but they looked and sounded ready to fight and so were the lenelli their trumpets roared forth familiar notes these tunes werent the ones the wehrmacht used but they were ones the wehrmacht might have used they did the same thing german trumpets would have done they got hasso ready to fight botteros men were ready too the threats they shouted at the grenye would have horrified the men who framed the geneva convention velona rode out ahead of the lenello battle line she pointed toward the grenye forward she bugled forward to victory was she talking or was the goddess speaking through her hasso thought he heard the goddess but he wasnt sure as soon as velona gave the war cry she galloped straight at the bucovinan line the rest of the lenelli and hasso thundered after her a cavalry charge thered been a few even in the war from which hasso had contrived to extract himself hed never imagined he would take part in one though he looked back over his shoulder at the striking column could he really translate panzer tactics into ones knights and swordsmen could use he was going to find out hed hoped the bucovinans would stand there and receive the charge no such luck they knew better theyd been fighting the lenelli for a long time now theyd learned a lot from the invaders from overseas they had armored men on horseback too not a lot but some and sent them forward to blunt the big blonds onslaught and they had a devil of a lot of infantry waiting there behind their horsemen some of the foot soldiers had spears some had swords quite a few carried what looked like scythes and pitchforks most of the men with real weapons wore helmets and carried shields the rest had no more than they would have worn in the fields maybe that would have been enough against other grenye against botteros hardbitten professionals hasso didnt think so the bucovinan knights were a different story they were pros themselves their horses were smaller than the ones the lenelli rode but they knew what to do with them they handled their lances as well as the lenelli did seeing a threemeter toothpick aimed straight at his chest gave hasso the cold horrors he rose in the stirrups and gave the enemy knight a short burst from his submachine gun the grenyes lance went flying he threw up his hands and pitched from the saddle he was probably dead before he hit the ground hasso almost got pitched from the saddle too staid gelding or not his horse didnt like a gun going off right behind its ears but the german had expected that he hadnt ridden much but he knew enough to fight the horse back down onto all fours when it tried to rear he wished hed had enough ammunition to familiarize the beast to the dreadful noise but he didnt once his cartridges were gone they were gone forever hed better get the best use from them he could then he shot the next bucovinan in front of him then he shot one of the natives who was bearing down on velona she rode into battle with a goddess confidence with the goddess confidence that nothing could hurt her that grenye hadnt seem convinced but hasso made as sure as he could that velona stayed right he shot two more lancers in quick succession after that the bucovinans got the idea and stayed away from him which helped open a gap in their line of horsemen come on hasso yelled and rode through it the rest of the striking column followed him he aimed just to the left of the thicket of enemy banners there he pointed thats where well break through the bucovinan foot soldiers saw the column coming they couldnt very well not see it and they couldnt very well not understand what a breakthrough there would mean shouts in that guttural unintelligible at least to hasso language filled the air the natives who had spears lowered them in a desperate effort to hold off the onrushing knights back in the middle ages the swiss hedgehog rank on rank of long pikes a new version of the macedonian phalanx could hold knights at bay the men of bucovin were trying to improvise that kind of defense on the fly it didnt work hasso would have been surprised if they really expected it to work if you were a brave man in a bad spot you did whatever you could and hoped for the best he knew all about that a shouting little man set himself pointing his spear in the general direction of hassos gelding the wehrmacht officer shot him in the face from less than ten meters away the bucovinan didnt even have time to look surprised before he toppled the spear hit the ground before he did but only by a split second hasso shot three more grenye one after the next then he changed magazines on his schmeisser again he was down to his last one the last one in all this world but hed done what he needed to do hed breached the bucovinan line and the lenelli poured into the gap hed made no denying the natives were brave they swarmed toward the lancers trying to spear them to slash them to pull them out of the saddle and stomp them to death they didnt have a chance maybe they didnt realize it maybe they just didnt care the lenelli spitted them like partridges or knocked them over the head with the shafts of their lances or cut them down with long straight swords warhorses smashed dark faces and dashed out brains with ironshod hooves adernos unicorn had blood on its horn where was the king of bucovin or the chief or whatever he called himself hasso looked to the right he saw a man in fancy regalia and fired several shots at him with luck he could decapitate the enemy army the enemy state on the spot and make everything that came afterwards a hell of a lot easier he couldnt tell whether his bullets struck home after a moment not just bucovinans stood between him and the man he thought to be their sovereign hardcharging lenello knights also blocked his view the grenye went on fighting as ferociously as the poles had in the first few days of the war all the ferocity in the world hadnt done the poles one goddamn bit of good the harder they fought the faster they died and all the courage in the world wouldnt help the bucovinans either hasso shot one more man then he let out a wordless whoop were through the savages a lenello shouted all the words that mattered now we swing in hasso called even if he hadnt shot the bucovinan leader king botteros men might capture him that would do the job just about as well swing in he yelled again and pointed to show what he meant the striking column had practiced this maneuver over and over on the meadows outside of drammen the lenelli should have been able to bring it off in their sleep and about half of them did turn in against the enemy center but the other half turned out against the wing theyd cut off hasso screamed abuse at the lenelli he called them every kind of idiot under the sun they paid no attention to him german troops probably wouldnt have screwed up like that if they had their officers would have straightened them out in a hurry here the officers didnt seem to see the problem the fightings good every which way marshal lugo yelled he was there all right and battling hard yes but hasso did some more swearing were they all blind he didnt need long to realize blindness wasnt the problem his own medieval ancestors probably would have fought the same boneheaded way theres the enemy they would have thought lets go bash him over the head and if the battle might have turned out better had they bashed him here instead of there they wouldnt have got all hot and bothered about it they were having a good time fighting any old way and so were the lenelli now the rest of their line had come to grips with the grenye which meant the enemy couldnt turn and give all his attention to the riders whod broken into the rear as hasso had hoped the men of bucovin were getting smashed between hammer and anvil but they werent getting smashed as thoroughly as hed had in mind sure botteros warriors were chewing up that cutoff wing the center though held longer and more stoutly than hed thought it could when people there did start to flee a stubborn rear guard made sure they had an open escape route dont worry well get em a lenello said when hasso swore again see the lords banners are still in place dear god in heaven which side is supposed to be the barbarians hasso wondered the banners are there ja he said with more patience than hed thought he had in him but does that mean the lord is still there under them huh the lenello trooper really was slow on the uptake after much too long he went oh then he got angry not at himself but at the bucovinans why those cursed sneaky sons of whores right hasso said tightly if you expected the enemy to act dumb all the time youd get your head handed to you the ivans had driven that lesson home with a sledgehammer a bucovinan pikeman seeing hasso on a horse without a lance rushed at him shouting something unintelligible that probably wasnt a compliment as so many of the men from bucovin had found out the hard way being without a lance didnt mean he was unarmed he shot the grenye down by now his horse didnt jump out of its skin every time he fired but the schmeisser ran dry just then automatically hasso reached for another clip that was when he remembered he didnt have one he felt much more naked without the submachine gun than he would have without his mailshirt and the wehrmacht helmet with a nasal riveted on he slung the schmeisser over his back even though it was useless now and would be forevermore he couldnt stand to throw it away out came his sword with it in his hand he looked every inch the warrior maybe that would be enough to keep the bucovinans from harrying him after all they couldnt he hoped to god they couldnt tell at a glance what a lousy swordsman he was velonas sword was red with blood scarlet drops flew from the blade as she brandished it her face bore the same intent inward seeking expression it did just before she came was she communing with the goddess or did she really enjoy fighting hasso wondered whether he wanted to know more and more grenye broke away from the battle and made off toward the east some went singly others in knots of five or ten or twenty the men who stuck together and still showed fight had a better chance of getting away in one piece the lenelli were like any soldiers in any world they went after what looked like easy victims first why chance getting hurt when you didnt have to a bucovinan came up to hasso with his helmet hanging on the point of his spear peace he said in halting lenello peace please hasso realized he didnt know the rules for taking prisoners here but that question no sooner formed in his mind than it got answered not ten meters away a lenello tapped a surrendering grenye on the shoulder with his sword in hassos world he might have been knighting the enemy warrior not here here with a doglike grin of relief the grenye threw down his weapons and kissed his captors hand then hands clasped behind his head he shuffled off toward the rear now that hasso knew how to do it he did it the grenye in front of him also looked massively relieved he understood that deciding to give up wasnt the hard part getting the guys on the other side to accept your surrender was plenty of wouldbe pows got killed it wasnt always illwill sometimes the winners were just too busy to bother with prisoners so they disposed of them instead thank you thank you i is your slave the bucovinan said as he fervently kissed hassos hand did he mean that or was he only being polite in his own world hasso would have known the answer here well hed worry about it later he jerked his thumb in the direction the other captive had taken go there he said away the grenye went he too put his hands behind his head it wasnt quite the same as raising them high but it evidently meant the same thing hasso looked around to see if any more fighting was left there wasnt much as he watched a lenello used the broken shaft of his lance to smash in a bucovinans skull no surrendering here was no easier than it was in hassos world the big blond knights with the brutal one laughed and cheered him on lenello foot soldiers and dismounted lancers walked over the field every so often they stooped to plunder or to finish off a wounded bucovinan hassos men had done that with the ivans often enough here a knife across the throat did duty for a bullet in the back of the neck the lenelli also gave the coup de grace to some of their own wounded men those too badly hurt to have any hope of recovering hasso had seen that happen too it happened more often here german doctors could do things nobody here had ever dreamt of he made a note to himself not to get wounded here then he laughed if he knew how to guarantee that somebody slapped him on the back almost hard enough to pitch him off his horse we did it nornat yelled the column worked your scheme worked he sounded overjoyed and surprised at the same time good men make it work hasso said the lenello cavalry captain grinned and bowed in the saddle hasso wouldnt have wanted to try that himself he hadnt been kidding though grinning back he went on commanders get the glory lancers do the hard part and make commanders look good goddess only knows thats the truth nornat said too many marshals cant see it though they think the sun rises and sets on them i could name names but but youd put your ass in a sling if you did hasso thought but if nornat wasnt thinking of brave but hidebound marshal lugo hasso would have been mightily surprised we could do better he said we should do better column should all turn in on center not out on wing he gestured with his hands we do that maybe we catch enemy uh lord he cant get away well yes nornat sounded as if he was humoring him dont get too upset though we walloped the snot out of the savages the way it was somebody a frenchman said the good was the enemy of the best a solid victory satisfied nornat hasso wanted more he wanted to annihilate the enemy the way hannibal annihilated the romans at cannae ever since before the first world war german officers made that battle their model hasso understood why whod ever done better but despite the triumph carthage lost the war how many officers who carefully memorized every detail of hannibals double envelopment remembered that hasso got down from his horse you come here he called to the first foot soldier he saw when the man obeyed hasso tossed him the reins here hold these for me till i get back yes lord the foot soldier said the only possible answer but then he went on what about my chance to loot that was a fair question hasso dug in his belt pouch and pulled out one of the gold coins hed won from the wizards it bore the jowly image of botteros father here you might do better than this but you might not too the lenello made the goldpiece disappear grinning he said you may be a foreigner and you sure talk funny but youre a sport thanks hasso said dryly and began his tour of the battlefield hed walked plenty of fields in his own world wherever victory let him do it the last year and a half of the war he thanked god every time he got away from a battlefield in one piece he hadnt had many chances to look around afterwards not unless he wanted the russians to leave his body there along with too many others wearing feldgrau here though the bucovinans had stood more bravely than hed thought they could even after they had to know they were beaten they went on doing as well as they could for as long as they could they fought like soldiers not like savages fierce in victory who panicked and broke the minute things went wrong a dead native clutched the shaft of the spear that pinned him to the ground the horrible grimace hed worn when he died was relaxing towards a corpses blankness his eyes stared sightlessly up at the sky not far away a dead lenello sprawled in a pool of blood his left hand clutched the stump of his right arm hed lost his right hand and bled to death before a surgeon or a wizard could do anything to help him flies buzzed around the blood a big one landed in the bloodstreaked callused palm of the severed hand you had an easier time telling how hard and how well someone fought on this field than on a lot of them on the russian front artillery and bullets could be nearly random in how they killed and maimed but if a sword or spear went in from the front the dead man faced his foe when he died if he had a wound in the back he was likely trying to run away when he died the grenye killed from behind almost all lay at some distance from where theyd posted their line those were the men whod tried to escape most of them after the fight was irretrievably lost yes theyd fought hard all right king bottero rode up to hasso the king had a cut on the back of his right hand hed been in the thick of the fighting himself the edge of his shield was as notched as a saw blade his horse limped you did what you said youd do bottero declared have you got any idea how unusual that is hasso saluted lenellostyle his fist over his heart your majesty i am a stranger a foreigner at your court i dont dare fail why not my own people do all the time they are your people hasso replied you forgive them because they are but if i go wrong you say he is a foreigner trying to fool us off with his head bottero threw back his head and laughed are you sure you were never a king yourself never hasso pushed away the words with both hands which set bottero laughing again the german went on never want to be a king either youre smart bottero said you dont have everybody below you looking up at you and thinking what an idiot you are not me your majesty hasso said which was plenty to make bottero almost fall off his horse with mirth hasso spoke as innocently as he could with exaggerated innocence in fact he was glad hed amused his new sovereign he was also glad bottero believed him when he said he had no royal ambitions it was true even if it werent he had to act as if it were confessing that you did want to wear a crown was apt to be more hazardous to your life expectancy than a russian armored division find any loot worth keeping bottero asked soldiers here made a big part of their living from booty hasso used to regular pay had to remind himself of that he had picked up one nice dagger with gold chasing on the blade he showed it to the king bottero nodded thats not bad its one of our patterns but it looks to me like a copy by a grenye smith the chasing is very nice i like that dragon but the work on the blade itself is cruder than what wed do hasso didnt have the eye for such fine details hed kept the dagger because of the gold he didnt expect to use it as a weapon he had nothing against war knives he carried one of his own but it was just a tool not a fancy solingen blade like the ones ss men were so proud of where do we go now hasso asked we should push after the bucovinans not let them come back together get ready to fight again he wanted to say regroup but he couldnt come up with the word in lenello he was a lot more fluent than he had been even a month before but talking still sometimes felt like wading through glue you have been eating meat havent you king bottero smiled at him like a father smiling at an adventurous little boy we need to get ready to fight again ourselves you know do you think your striking column will work as well now that they know we use it that was a genuinely shrewd question i dont know your majesty hasso replied you know the bucovinans better than i do so you are a better judge how fast do they learn will they have an assault column of their own in the next battle the possibility hadnt occurred to him till now no the king shook his head they arent that quick but theyll look for ways to stop the column from breaking through and theyll have their own soon you can bet on that when the other lenello kingdoms hear about what were doing theyll start using these columns too defense hasso muttered did he know enough about the swiss hedgehog to teach it to botteros men he had to hope he did because they were going to need it if not at the next battle then before too long he could see that coming all this is worry for another time bottero said you kept your word to me i wont forget and you wont be sorry with the wave of a gauntleted hand he rode off not far away a lenello foot soldier was slitting the throat of a feebly writhing bucovinan still holding the bloody knife he nodded to hasso boy i wish the king would talk to me that way he said everybody had problems the foot soldier thought his were worse than hassos maybe he was even right all the same hasso knew his own werent small he also knew they wouldnt go away any time soon back in germany women prided themselves on how little they ate a birdlike appetite was a sign of femininity after the battle velona ate enough for two troopers maybe three where do you keep it hasso asked he was hungry but not that hungry have you got a hollow leg the joke was old in german but new in lenello velona laughed so hard she almost spat out the swig of beer shed just taken no no no she said you have to understand im eating for two youre going to have a baby hasso took the phrase to mean what it would have in his native tongue the next question that ran through his mind was is it mine he didnt ask that one not least for fear she would up and tell him no but she laughed again this time at him though as far as he could tell without malice no not a baby im sure im not pregnant she said i just stopped flowing a couple of days before the battle remember and im glad i did too what i meant was im eating for me and the goddess both oh feeling like a fool hasso thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand it hurt more than it should have somewhere in the battle hed got a bruise there even if he couldnt remember how or when and he found himself nodding no wonder velona never gained a gram but carrying a goddess around wasnt the sort of diet likely to become popular in berlin or cologne or vienna even if the german women in those towns were free of invaders which they werent how big a toll did the goddess take on a mere mortals metabolism hasso had no idea but velona knew the answer from the inside out her smile he judged held more than a little relief i could feel the goddess power running through me she said the savages could feel it too when i struck and even before that when i bore down on them i could tell i believe you hasso said which was nothing but the truth when the goddess manifested herself in velona she definitely seemed more than human just being near her at such times made your hair prickle up as if lightning had crashed down close by then several beats more slowly than a lenello would have hasso saw what she was driving at here we are in bucovin but the power still runs through you the goddess is still with me velona agreed but then her smile slipped it was like this the last time i came into bucovin too at first it was like this after that it wasnt that the goddess left me or not exactly like that when she tried to speak though i couldnt make out what she was saying the land in these parts was thinking about something else how did she mean that never having had any kind of divinity speak to him or through him hasso couldnt know not the way velona did he thought of a bad telephone connection then he laughed at himself what good did a thought from his own world do him he couldnt make velona or anyone else here understand it what would telephones seem to the lenelli but magic crystal balls now they had crystal balls or something like them wizards can talk back and forth from far away right he asked an idea starting to sprout in his mind yes thats true velona nodded she laid her hand on his in what was he realized a moment later a gesture of sympathy i can guess how strange that must be to you coming from a world with so little magic in it hasso didnt laugh if he started he feared he wouldnt be able to stop stick to business he told himself and so he did all right if we split our army in two the grenye would also have to split their army in two wouldnt they id think so but im no grenye general goddess be praised velona said where are you going with this all at once the sprouted idea flowered and fruited we can keep track of our two armies with magic always know where they are move together thanks to magic we can come back together when we need to and defeat the grenye in detail for once he found the technical term he needed right on the tip of his tongue if that wasnt a good omen what would be would velona get it was it in fact a thought worth getting or was he misunderstanding the way things worked here he waited to see how she responded he started to worry when she didnt answer right away her brow creased in serious thought seeing those tiny wrinkles reminded him she was human as well as divine were these human normal moments the ones jesus followers had cherished most hasso wouldnt have been surprised though none of the gospels talked about anything so completely mundane it could work velona said at last it could well work we didnt need such tricks when we fought the grenye after we first came across the sea we knew so much more than they did the fights were walkovers a ploy like that wouldnt work when lenelli fight lenelli because theres magic on both sides then but against bucovin yes it might be just the thing a slow smile spread across her face and how fitting to turn their mindblindness against them to use it as one of our weapons of war she kissed him it didnt go any further than that not then they were both weary from the fighting hasso stank even in his own nostrils of horse of sweat of fear and of the blood that splashed his mailshirt and his skin he didnt think velona smelled of fear that was a pretty good sign she had the goddess dwelling in her after a battle few people could avoid the sour stink of terror you will tell the king tomorrow she said as if she were an officer giving a common soldier his orders does she have the right to tell me what to do like that hasso wondered in her own person she probably didnt but that was the point as hed realized a moment before she wasnt just in her own person not when she had the goddess for company and the goddess could tell king bottero what to do let alone a newly arrived foreigner like hasso pemsel automatically hassos arm shot out in the salute he was more used to than the one the lenelli used zu befehl he said german tasting strange in his mouth he turned it into lenello at your command well all right velona said i didnt mean it quite like that but for now lets get some sleep there was an order hasso was glad to obey ix i am your slave the grenye prisoner insisted hasso had never expected to see the warrior hed captured again but there the fellow was helping one of the cooks dole out bowls of porridge flavored with salty fennelfilled sausage and onions it wasnt delicious but it filled the belly on campaign that counted for more is he yours sir the cook asked i didnt mean to take him if he really belonged to somebody but you know how it is we can always use an extra pair of hands what is the custom hasso asked in return he did surrender to me yesterday then hes yours if you want him the cook said if you dont ill go on using him he seems willing enough or you can feed him to the water snakes but if you wanted to do that you could have done it when he tried to give up the bucovinan pointed to hasso you spared me i work for you now i am berbec he jabbed a thumb at his own chest you are a great lord yes a great lord sure but you never have man like me before thats what im afraid of hasso said dryly berbec laughed louder than the joke deserved if it was a joke was taking a prisoner as a batman as a valet hell as a slave clasping a water snake to his bosom the cook didnt seem to think so hasso found himself nodding well come on then berbec what can you do for me that i cant do for myself all kinds of things berbec bowed to him then also bowed to the cook for whom hed been working the motion was different from the stiffer one the lenelli and the germans used it might almost have been a move from a dance you dont have any other slaves not right now hasso said berbec clicked his tongue between his teeth you poor fellow he cocked his head to one side eyeing hasso with sparrowish curiosity you look like a lenello but you dont talk like where you from a faraway country the german replied which was true but uninformative he still didnt trust berbec not to disappear the minute he turned his back can you take care of a horse i do that berbec nodded eagerly he might have picked the next thought out of hassos mind for he went on not steal him neither you could kill me but you spare i owe you my life i pay back maybe he meant it some people and some peoples were punctilious about their honor to the point that looked like stupidity to anyone with a less rigid code whether the grenye of bucovin were like that whether berbec himself was i just have to find out hasso thought in the meantime i have to be careful you have funny helmet berbec remarked his hands shaped the flare of the german stahlhelm in the style of my country hasso said the lenelli wore plain conical helms more like those of the normans than any others he knew so did the bucovinans probably in imitation of the blonds from overseas not bad maybe turn sword better berbec might be a little man but he was a warrior but nasal is new not have before he was a warrior with sharp eyes too that nasal was riveted on the lenelli couldnt weld steel and hasso didnt trust solder to hold berbec chattered on why you not have before keep face from getting split open war in my land doesnt usually come down to swordstrokes hasso replied and wasnt that the sad and sorry truth a helmet wouldnt stop a rifle round though it would keep out some shell fragments highvelocity bullets made most body armor more trouble than it was worth only if you were fighting with bayonets or entrenching tools would a nasal matter once in a blue moon in other words german armorers didnt see the point of adding one and who was he to say they were wrong for the kind of war they fought berbec stared at him hasso thought the bucovinan would call him a liar but then berbec thrust out a stubby accusing finger you have the thunderflasher he said that wasnt a word in lenello but it was a pretty good description of a firearm you point it at someone and it goes boom and he falls over all soldiers in your country carry thunderflashers then no he was nobodys fool thats right hasso said the lenelli have all kinds of things they are clever the lenelli maybe berbec felt he could talk freely about them because hasso wasnt one but they dont have thunderflashers he eyed hasso again this time the wehrmacht officer judged apprehensively and why not if the lenelli all carried schmeissers bucovinan resistance would last a minute and a half tops cant make them here hasso wanted the words back as soon as they came out some intelligence officer he was blabbing like a fool velona came up to the two of them as soon as she saw berbec she understood what was going on hes one you caught yourself she asked when hasso nodded she went on good youve been doing too much for yourself she brushed her lips across his and walked on berbec stared after her not as a man will watch a goodlooking woman but more as anyone might stare at a lightning bolt smashing down close by that was the goddess the woman who uh carries the goddess he might be a slave but this was the first time hasso had seen him without his selfpossession yeah hasso nodded she doesnt need a thunderflasher to cut through us berbec said sadly only a sword and herself hasso nodded again not without sympathy what was it like for the grenye without magic of their own to try to stand against velona when the goddess was strong in her like a lone rifleman against a king tiger panzer worse probably because the panzer and the infantryman belonged to the same world the grenye had to feel the very heavens were fighting against them and they wouldnt be so far wrong would they berbecs stare swung back to hasso it was as if he could still see the mark of her kiss glowing on the wehrmacht officers face she is your woman he sounded like someone afraid to be right yes shes my woman hasso felt the irony in his voice berbec might not understand but to the lenello way of thinking hasso was velonas man and not the other way around he succeeded in impressing his new servant anyway i knew you were a great lord i already told you that berbec said but i didnt know you were such a great lord he bowed himself almost double i cry pardon forgive me he wouldnt straighten till hasso touched him on the back its all right forget it i still put on trousers like anybody else i still shit i still piss i still need you to see to my horse thats what you say you do he was getting better with past tenses but he still wasnt good enough to feel comfortable using them i do it berbec said he seemed mostly stuck in the present indicative too for no sensible reason that made hasso feel better king botteros army pressed deeper into bucovin the natives didnt stand and fight again they didnt go away either raiders picked off lenello scouts horsemen attacked the wagons that brought supplies forward and to hassos dismay if not to his surprise flames and clouds of smoke rose up in front of the invaders they burn their own crops he said the russians had scorched the earth in front of the oncoming wehrmacht later moving from east to west instead of from west to east the germans used the same ploy to slow down the red army the ivans screamed about war crimes they hadnt said a word when they used those tactics winners said what they pleased who could call a winner a liar king bottero eyed the smoke and sniffed the breeze hasso couldnt smell the burning not yet maybe the enormous lenello could they think theyll make us too hungry to go on the king said are they right hasso asked not yet bottero said an answer that struck the german as reasonable aderno and the other wizards put their heads together they worked a spell that might have come straight out of macbeth they danced they chanted they incanted dark clouds filled the sky rain came down rain poured down in fact it drenched the fires whether it did the lenelli any good was a different question and one harder to answer the roads got soaked too and turned to mud hasso remembered the first russian rasputitsa the time of rain and muck he remembered motorcycle drivers their mechanized steeds hubdeep sometimes headlightdeep in muck their rubberized greatcoats ten or twenty kilos heavier than they should have been their goggles so splashed that they were almost useless or sometimes worse than useless the eyes behind those goggles gradually growing alarmed as one rider after another began to see it wouldnt be as easy as the high command claimed he remembered boggeddown panzers and artillery pieces halfdrowned horses the sucking goo trying to pull the marching boots off his feet with every step he remembered bonecrushing exhaustion at the end of every day and well before the end too yes the mud slowed down the ivans but they werent trying to go forward not that first autumn anyhow they were just trying to hold back the germans to keep the wehrmacht out of moscow and they did and blitzkrieg turned to grapple and slugging match and hasso found a magical way to escape from burning pulverized berlin but not one the rest of the city would ever be able to use and so he was here in western bucovin listening to the rain patter down soldiers greased their mailshirts every morning and night and draped themselves with cloaks they swore when they found tiny tumors of rust anyhow as of course they did the horses that squelched through the deepening ooze couldnt swear but the men on their backs made up for that and the teamsters who fought to keep supply wagons moving cursed even harder than the knights by the time it had rained for a couple of days hasso began to think the wizards spell might be worse than the scorchedearth disease by the time the rain had poured down for a week he was sure of it he rode up alongside aderno whose unicorn was so splotched and spattered with mud that it looked to have a giraffes hide hasso waved his arms up toward the weeping sky enough he said he waved again like a conductor in white tie and tails pulling a crescendo from a symphony orchestra too much in fact call off your storm adernos answering glance would have looked even hotter than it did had water not dripped from the end of the wizards long pointed nose its not our storm any more he said its just weather now well work another spell and turn it into good weather then hasso said were there any justice in the world the water on adernos nose would have started to steam what do you think weve been trying to do he said pointedly i dont know hasso answered all i know is its still raining adernos gesture was as extravagant as the ones the german had used not long before weather magic is never easy wed do a lot more of it if it were he said and trying it here in bucovin was worse we were glad when we got what we wanted now he broke off when a raindrop hit him in the eye now youve got too much of what you want hasso finished for him the wizard nodded unhappily and you cant close the sluice either hasso said in german it would have been something like and you cant turn it off either the lenelli didnt have enough machinery to make phrases like that a natural part of their language air and sky and land in bucovin dont want to listen to us aderno said hasso would have thought he was making excuses if velona hadnt said the same thing thinking of velona though inspired him as it often did though not in the same direction as usual instead of erotic excess his mind swung toward military pragmatism do the air and sky and land here listen to the goddess he asked sometimes adernos attention sharpened sometimes yes and if the goddess person begs her did velona beg the goddess the last time she went into bucovin what did the goddess do for her then anything hassos first rational inclination was to say no but he realized velona didnt see things that way herself as far as she was concerned the goddess gave her just what she asked for a rescuer from another world one hasso pemsel i speak to her of this hasso said he didnt think of himself as anybodys answered prayer but in this crazy world he might be wrong and he knew it as he made his way through the mud to the tent he shared with velona he reminded himself that he would have to grease his boots if he didnt the leather would turn hard as stone when it dried if it ever dried it would also start to rot the lenelli made boots at least as good as the ones hed worn when he got here but hed got used to the idea of not wasting anything he wondered if he would be wasting his time talking to velona try as he would he didnt have a real feel yet for how things worked here maybe he was only suggesting the obvious maybe his idea wasnt obvious but was stupid or maybe youre a goddamn genius he told himself that made him laugh he sure as hell didnt feel like a genius back in germany he bloody well wasnt but the things he knew from there often made him seem smarter than the locals here dont believe your own press clippings he thought wasnt that one of hitlers big mistakes he was so convinced the ivans were bums he went after them without thinking about what a big bunch of bums they were here heading toward the middle of bucovin hasso could have done without that thought velona took him seriously that a woman like her might take him seriously was just about enough to make him believe in her goddess or at least in miracles when he finished she said i will do what i can i dont know how much that will be the goddess didnt seem to hear me when i was in bucovin before i feared shed abandoned me and then there you were on the causeway there i was hasso agreed was he the answer to velonas prayer or had the omphalos stone sent him here of its own volition or was it just dumb luck with nobody responsible one way or the other the goddess and whatever powered the omphalos might know hasso didnt believe he ever would when velona decided to do something she didnt do it halfway beseeching the goddess proved no exception to the rule she carried a statuette of the deity with her the bronze about a quarter of a meter tall was nothing fancy had hasso seen it in a museum back in berlin he would have walked past it without a second glance velona set it up on the muddy floor of the tent with a candle burning to either side a makeshift altar then she stripped herself naked and prostrated herself before it hassos admiration for her beauty was almost entirely abstract his pleasure at seeing her long smooth length esthetic rather than lustful she seemed as much in the divine world as in the material which had a lot to do with that or maybe she just intimidates the crap out of me he thought not a reflection likely to have crossed his mind for any ordinary woman whatever else you said about velona ordinary she was not hear me she said as if the statuette were an equal hear me hasso wondered whether the bronze image would answer but it didnt at least not so he could hear velona went on enough of rain enough of mud enough of barbarism time for botteros troopers to storm forward hasso wanted to go outside and look at the weather if it wasnt changing right then if it wasnt then velona would have to give the goddess another talkingto one of the candles flared up maybe that was what made the statuettes eyes flash the rational part of hasso could believe it was anyhow that way he didnt have to believe he was watching the goddess response to a petitioner who was fully entitled to treat with her he didnt have to believe that no but believing anything else wasnt easy and velona only made it harder when she said well i should hope so its about time dont you think she might have been talking to a neighbor woman about reining in the neighbors unruly children the bronze goddess eyes flashed again this time hasso didnt notice any candle flare to cause it he tried to convince himself that he didnt see the statuette nod in response to velonas urging he tried but he didnt have much luck his eyes saw what they saw what it meant was probably about what it looked like if he had trouble believing that wasnt it because the god he was used to worshiping was so leery of doling out miracles things were different here with an athletes grace velona got to her feet hasso had never seen such an inspiring votary of any god he tried to imagine her arising naked and beautiful from in front of the altar in a catholic or lutheran church the picture didnt want to form in a way that was hardly surprising however rough her presence would have been on a celibate priest in another way though wasnt the impossibility of such a scene too damn bad if velona didnt make you want to worship werent you already dead inside beaming she said i think that took care of it thank you for giving me a push there any time hasso reached out and cupped her left breast in his right hand a push i said velona tried to sound severe but didnt have much luck what would happen if your slave walked in here right now berbec hed be jealous hasso didnt let go and hed think i was the bravest man in the world for daring to touch you i like it when you touch me velona set her hand on his which made his breath come short but she went on if i didnt like it and you touched me then you would be the bravest man in the world and the stupidest i believe you hasso said men had amused themselves with their enemies women since the beginning of time the germans had done their share of it in france and in russia and now the ivans were paying the wehrmacht back with their trousers down around their ankles things in this world were bound to be the same not all the halfbreeds here had happened because grenye women welcomed lenello men with their legs open but if anyone tried to force velona to do anything she didnt want to do when the goddess was with her hasso didnt know what would happen to a bastard dumb enough to try that he did know he wouldnt care to find out instead of drawing him down to the cot with her she slipped away id better get dressed she said he must have looked like a man whod just bitten down hard on a lemon because she started to laugh not now doesnt mean never my dear she reminded him wagging a finger under his nose we both have other things to worry about though why dont you see what the weathers doing because id rather lay you he thought grumpily but after what hed been thinking he couldnt very well say that and if a woman decided you only wanted her for her twat you were in trouble big trouble if a woman like velona decided that if that happened what the two of them had was dead and if it was dead hasso figured his own chances of ending up literally dead got a lot higher the lenelli cut him extra slack because he was the goddess boyfriend if anybody picked a fight with him with swords though he was in big trouble hed got a lot better with a blade since coming here but he knew enough to understand the difference between better and good since he didnt want to worry about that he stepped outside the rain was gone a brisk breeze blew the dark clouds across the sky in the west the sun poured wet buttery light across the landscape a slow smile spread across hassos face the lenello wizards had started the rain now the goddess had ended it and the bucovinans would have a tough time setting their fields aflame for a while things would be too wet to catch easily if the roads dried out enough to keep foot soldiers and horses and wagons from bogging down king botteros army could press a lot deeper into bucovin then what hasso wondered the question wouldnt have occurred to the lenelli but the lenelli had never tried invading the soviet union hasso looked around their encampment and slowly shook his head goddamn lucky bastards botteros army did push deeper into the barbarians country a day and a half after velona and the goddess persuaded the rain to clear out hasso had no other explanation for what happened there aderno rode up to him and asked have you seen flegrei no hasso shook his head which meant the same thing to the lenelli as it did in germany should i see him well i was hoping somebody had aderno didnt sound happy i wanted to ask him something nobodys set eyes on him since not long after we got moving this morning hes a wizard he rides a unicorn he should be easy to spot hasso said i know aderno answered and hasso realized he was working hard not to show how worried he was he should be but he isnt im afraid somethings happened to him scheisse hasso muttered he could swear in lenello to let the people around him know he was pissed off but he got no satisfaction from it himself for that he still needed his native speech do you think the grenye used to ambush him he muttered to himself again that was the wrong form of the past tense and he knew it now too late he knew it aderno was too rattled to sneer though im afraid they did im afraid they must have the wizard replied we need to take enough men down our trail so we can be sure we dont get bushwhacked looking for him scheisse hasso repeated louder this time the word wouldnt mean anything to aderno unless he had his translating spell working but the tone was bound to get through hasso added a few more choice opinions auf deutsch but aderno was right they needed to find out what had happened to flegrei if the grenye suddenly had a wizard working for them maybe with a knife at his throat but even so the lenelli needed to know about that and if the knife had gone into flegrei instead the invaders needed to know that too hasso had enough clout to pull a troop of horsemen out of the line of march on his own hook and start them back the wrong way a couple of captains asked him what the demon he thought he was doing when he told them he was looking for a missing wizard they did some swearing of their own you shouldnt let some of those people run loose one lenello opined they just get into trouble aderno looked highly affronted he might have had more to say to the soldier if traveling in opposite directions hadnt swept them apart later hasso shook his head hed worry about that later by god look for the unicorn he told the men with him we have a better chance of spotting the animal than we do of spotting the wizard the troopers nodded aderno looked surprised as if that hadnt occurred to him maybe it hadnt he didnt always operate within the restrictive confines of the real world himself after a moment he added the grenye may have taken flegrei away too its possible that they can get him to do what they want if they hurt him enough but no grenye can ride a unicorn so theyd likely kill it first they cant deal with it any other way that made sense to hasso who gave the wizard a mental apology he didnt waste time on a spoken one he was too busy trying to look every which way at once out away from the lenello army he felt the way he had behind the front in the soviet union every tree every rock every bush was liable to be dangerous and youd never know which one till too late how many eyes were watching him and his comrades right now how many bucovinan fists tightened on weapons hasso couldnt see anybody but that didnt mean nobody could see him oh no but would the men of bucovin have enough soldiers back here to take on so many lenelli he could hope not anyhow the farther from the security of botteros main force he got the more he worried the more his head swiveled back and forth back and forth he watched the lenelli with him the big blond knights also seemed to be trying to grow eyes in the backs of their heads i wouldnt want to do this when the sun was going down not for all the beer in bari one of them said several others nodded hasso had no idea where bari was but he understood the sentiment just fine not far from the road a farmhouse was charred wreckage had the lenelli torched it or did the retreating bucovinans do it themselves whatever the answer was would that matter to the peasants whose home was only a ruin hasso had trouble making himself believe it fire had also run through the fields which inclined him to believe the incendiarism was bucovinan work king botteros men would have taken the nearly ripe millet for themselves if they had the time and if flames from the burning buildings hadnt got loose so hard to be sure about anything you didnt see for yourself too damned often it was hard to be sure about things you did see a lenello stabbed out a pointing forefinger whats that behind the barn there something white i think hasso hadnt noticed it till the soldier pointed it out it wasnt much more than a flash the barn hid it pretty well that made him apprehensive so did the fruit trees within easy bowshot of the barn all the same he said we have to check it out the knights nodded with the air of men who knew they were liable to be sticking their dicks in a meat grinder and also knew they had no choice or did they hasso turned to aderno do you sense an ambush after a few passes and a murmured versicle the wizard shook his head i sense no enemies close by he said but he didnt sound happy about his own judgment either for he added if we were in lenelloruled land i would be surer it wasnt magic the lenelli swore it wasnt anyway but the countryside of bucovin liked the grenye better than it liked their foes the blonds had been grumbling about that ever since they crossed the border we go like we expect an attack hasso said nobody quarreled with him one knight said you may be a foreigner but youve got your head nailed on tight by the goddess that made hasso feel good that good feeling didnt last long only till he got a closer look at the flash of white the alert lenello had spotted it was a unicorn it was on the ground and it was dead blood marred the pristine perfection of its coat blood from at least a score of wounds hasso saw some that came from arrows others from spears and a few sword cuts as well the unicorns silvered horn wasnt bloodied the beast hadnt had the chance to fight back you hate to see them hurt aderno said hasso found himself nodding seeing a unicorn brought down that way was like looking at the corpse of a beautiful woman caught in a bomb blast hasso had had to do that more often than he cared to remember in a way this was even worse a beautiful woman could be a deadly enemy the poor unicorn didnt know anything about the war between lenelli and grenye somehow hasso didnt think the grenye of bucovin would have appreciated the distinction heres the wizard a lenello knight called pointing into the woods hasso swung down from his horse and tossed the reins to another lenello there didnt seem to be any bucovinans close by he drew his sword anyway because of the unicorn the smell of blood was already thick in his nostrils it got thicker he walked around a scrubby oak sapling and got a good look at what the enemy had done to flegrei he swore softly in lenello and then in german hed seen such things on the eastern front when the ivans got hold of some germans hed seen his countrymen do the like to russians they caught it jolted him here all the same the men who started seeing how clever they could be with their knives always aimed to make their foes afraid if they aimed at anything past a little sport and revenge they commonly made those foes more determined than they would have been otherwise the first thing that came out of his mouth was well now we know now we know aderno agreed in a voice like ashes i hope he was dead before they did some of that anyway yes hasso nodded flegrei couldnt have lived through everything the bucovinans did to him could he hasso didnt like to think the wizard had been alive when they he didnt cross his hands in front of his crotch but he had to make himself hold still he is a wizard he said how do they do this why doesnt he hit them with spells if they tied his hands he wouldnt have been able to make passes maybe he was stunned when the unicorn went down aderno said and then after that of course he pointed to one of the creative things the grenye had done yes after that hasso wanted to look away but he didnt he couldnt remember the ivans coming up with that particular mutilation and insult if the bucovinans were more inventive than stalins soldiers he wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes he didnt like believing it now they arent usually this bad a knight said of course i dont suppose they catch a wizard very often i wonder what made poor flegrei ride back of that farmhouse aderno said maybe he just wanted to ease himself away from everybody else whatever it was he should have known better do lenelli do this to grenye too hasso asked to avenge him we will the knight answered those bastards have to know they cant get away with this crap we havent done anything this bad in a while and they had it coming then would they have thought so hasso wondered but that was a pointless question he found one that wasnt what do we do with him two choices i see the knight answered either we burn him here or we take back the pieces so the king and the army find out what kind of war were fighting hasso couldnt see anything else to do either he didnt feel the call was his to make even if he held the highest rank here as a foreigner he would be missing too many nuances he turned to aderno you follow the same craft he said what would he want the wizard plucked at his neatly trimmed beard i dont think he would want to be a spectacle not the way he is he answered better we make a pyre for him here all right we do that then hasso waved at the forest plenty of branches as long as we cut them can we get them dry enough to burn well i know a spell for that aderno said its mostly used to get enough wood for campfires but i can make it bigger hasso started hacking at branches with his sword lets get to work then the lenelli joined in maybe they wouldnt have done it of their own accord like the knights of medieval germany or france they thought a lot of physical labor was beneath their dignity but seeing the man set over them go to work without hesitation brought them around if he didnt hold back how could they they got enough for a pyre in less than an hour aderno murmured and swayed in front of the pile steam rose from the rainsoaked wood when it stopped the wizard nodded to hasso this magic worked anyhow we can burn him now lay him on the pyre me hasso hoped he didnt squeak too much of course aderno said you command here who else hasso had dealt with enough corpses that one more didnt really faze him but it wasnt a duty he would have wanted he had to make sure he had all of flegrei the lenelli wouldnt have liked it had he left any of the cutoff bits behind after he finished he scrubbed his hands on wet grass that got most of the blood off but not all of it the knights gathered around the pyre nodded to one another they would have done the same thing then they would have forgotten about it hasso still wanted to get his hands really clean which showed he came from a different world may the life to come prove kinder to flegrei than this one did aderno said so may it be the knights intoned may he have joy of all his friends to come and overcome all his foes the wizard went on so may it be this time hasso joined the chorus it wasnt the funeral service a german chaplain would have read but it wasnt so very different either may the goddess avenge him against the barbarians who wickedly stole his life so may it be as the smoke of the pyre rises to the sky so may flegreis spirit rise to the heavens beyond the sky so may it be one of the knights had used flint and steel to get a small fire going the lenelli carried their firestarters the way wehrmacht men carried matches and cigarette lighters aderno lit a small branch and used it to touch off the pyre his magic had done what it needed to do the flames took hold with no trouble hasso smelled wood smoke and then the stink of burning meat flegrei might have been was a bastard but they were on the same side you never wanted to see one of your guys get it that reminded you your number might come up next you knew anyway sure but who needed reminding x stories were enough to get out the word about how flegrei died before long everybody in botteros army seemed to be talking about it not all the stories had much to do with what really happened hasso heard lenelli talking about how a squadron of sorcerers had been ground up in a mill and fed to grenye hogs you gonna quit eating spare ribs one knight asked another his friend thought about it but not for long nah he said they probably wont be from the same pigs and if they are well shit if they are i wont think they are so thats jake sounds right the first knight agreed and they rode on since they were arguing about the shadow of an ass that wasnt there hasso didnt waste his time trying to set them straight crazy rumors were part and parcel of war some of the stories hed heard on the russian front there they didnt talk about feeding dead germans to pigs they talked about ivans eating german corpses and their own hed believed those yarns too as a matter of fact he still did believe some of them if you got hungry enough you were liable to do anything if you got mean enough you were liable to do anything too three days after flegreis untimely and unpleasant demise the lenelli came to a place big enough to show up on their map it was called muresh and it was bigger than a village even if it didnt make much of a town behind it a bridge spanned the oltet river the bridge was probably the reason muresh had been founded and the reason it had grown the place didnt boast a wall it did have a bucovinan garrison in a small sad imitation of a lenello castle just in front of the bridge the soldiers in there couldnt have held the place more than a few hours against everything king bottero had to throw at them they werent idiots they could see that for themselves so they got out they hurried across the bridge tipping its timbers into the oltet as they went another castle none too big and none too stronglooking stood on the far bank the lenelli wouldnt have a whole lot of trouble repairing the bridge till they came within bowshot of that other castle then things wouldnt be so much fun fixing bridges while the bastards on the other side took potshots at you was nobodys idea of fun not in any army a few ordinary bucovinans escaped from muresh too fleeing with the men who were there to guard the bridge and not them most of the locals stayed where they were though either because they couldnt get away or because they didnt think anything bad would happen to them most of the time they would have been right the lenelli hadnt struck hasso as wantonly cruel maybe he just hadnt watched enough maybe he hadnt seen them when their blood was up king bottero looked at the peasants and craftsmen of muresh at the women and children he folded his thick arms across his broad chest boys these stinking bucovinans killed flegrei filthy he shouted to his men i want you to go in there and pay the bastards back the soldiers roared a deep baying sound that put hasso in mind of the wolves hed heard in russian woods the locals knew what a noise like that meant they made a noise of their own then a cry of horror and despair some of them tried to run away laughing at the joke the knights rode after the running men and women and speared them from behind then they swarmed into muresh and things got worse some of the grenye went down on their knees and begged for their lives most of them were on the whole lucky the lenelli killed them quickly what happened to the men who tried to fight back no one could say the lenelli didnt have imagination a graybearded cook had used a big twopronged fork and a knife to try to keep them out of his tavern it didnt work the lenelli laughed as they beat down his unskilled defense one of botteros soldiers smeared cooking oil into the bucovinans beard while three more knights held him the native snapped like a dog which only made the lenelli laugh harder then the fellow whod used the oil lit a stick at the taverns cookfire the bucovinan must have known what was coming next hasso feared he did too no the cook howled it might have been the only word of lenello he knew no no no his howls did him no more good than his tries at biting had stretching out the moment enjoying every bit of it the lenello slowly brought the flame closer to the oilsoaked beard then he set the cooks face on fire fight us will you you stinking scrawny savage he shouted the men who had been holding the grenye didnt just let go of him they shoved him away so that he ran down the streets of muresh screaming and beating at his burning hair and skin the lenelli thought he was the funniest thing they ever saw look at him go they yelled maybe hell burn this lousetrap down one of them added serve them right if he does another said serve them all right if he does by the goddess in the sack and massacre that followed hasso might as well have been aman from another world he didnt hate the bucovinans enough to want to kill them for the fun of it though hed done that to russians a time or two but he knew the lenelli wouldnt listen to him if he tried to stop them and so he walked through the narrow stinking muddy streets of muresh as if he were a camera all the lenelli who saw the cook with the burning beard liked the idea they set the faces of several other bucovinans on fire one of them torched a womans hair her shrieks were even higher and shriller than those of the men some of botteros troopers laughed at that but others shook their heads waste of pussy one of them declared still plenty to go around said a knight who thought the woman with her hair ablaze was funny he wasnt wrong even more than the germans in russia the lenelli in bucovin lived by the law of the jungle winners did whatever they wanted and the enemys women were fair game the lenelli raped with the practiced efficiency of men who took it for granted a gang of them would catch a woman throw her down on the ground force her legs apart and hold her arms and then mount her one after another roughly in order of rank some of them let the women shriek maybe they thought the noise added spice to the game others used rough gags of cloth or leather to cut down the din sometimes when they were finished they would send the woman off with a pat on the backside or even a coin sometimes they would get a final thrill by cutting her throat and leaving her there to die in the mud one lenello tried to gag a screaming woman with his member instead of a crumpled rag a moment later he was screaming himself and pouring blood she bit down hard it did her no good of course another blond soldier thrust his sword up where he and his friends had taken their pleasure she died slowly and agonizingly while they tried to bandage their wounded buddy velona watched the rapes as she might have watched animals rutting in the farmyard what does the goddess think of this hasso asked her for a moment the incomprehension with which she greeted the question made him wonder if hed asked it in german by mistake but no hed spoken lenello even if he had velona didnt understand him why should the goddess care about grenye she said a potbellied lenello missing half his left ear flung himself onto a wailing grenye woman spreadeagled on the ground in front of them and started pumping away his heavy buttocks rising and falling does the goddess care about women hasso asked she is one yes in a way she is a lenello woman velona set a finger between her breasts she is some of the time this lenello woman and the grenye are only grenye when i say she doesnt care about them i know what im talking about all right i only wonder wondered hasso didnt feel like quarreling if she did care anything about the natives she might have done something about the sack the soldiers would have listened to her if they didnt the goddess might have come to her and it would have taken a bold and a foolish lenello to gainsay her when the goddess made herself manifest he looked across the river the bucovinan soldiers in the castle on the other side of the oltet had to be watching and listening to the ruination of muresh did they have wives or sweethearts or sisters in the town what were they thinking hasso knew too well the bitter mix of fury and despair and impotence that descended on the wehrmacht as the ivans started raping their way through germany were the little swarthy men draining that cup to the dregs right now how could they be doing anything else the lenello sergeant or whatever he was grunted and pulled out of the grenye woman a last few thick drops of semen trickled from the head of his cock as he did up his trousers again a younger lenello took his place and began to thrust like a man possessed somebody handed hasso a big jar of beer he drank and drank and drank that way he didnt have to think and maybe just maybe hed forget some of the things hed seen come morning he wasnt sure whether king botteros men had deliberately torched muresh or the fires they set got out of hand what difference did it make anyhow the place was just as gone either way he woke with a bursting bladder a pounding headache and a mouth that tasted like the bottom of a latrine trench the stink of smoke and burnt flesh assailed his nose when he left the tent he shared with velona to ease himself he looked around for the cookfires maybe porridge would settle his sour stomach he didnt see them anywhere though the cooks still had to be sleeping off the previous days orgy of slaughter and lust he looked across the oltet again the bucovinans had men on the battlements of their keep the place would be easy to take even so once the army got across the river with the planking down from the bridge that might not be so easy he shrugged and winced wishing again for aspirin as far as the lenelli were concerned what theyd done was all part of a days work they hardly looked at the smoldering ruins of muresh instead they started yelling for the cooks burning the place and massacring the people only seemed to have given them an appetite they hadnt killed everybody a few bucovinan men survived as slaves a few women as hasso supposed playthings some of the locals had the dazed look of people whod lost everything in a natural disaster but somehow come through alive others seemed more calculating perhaps trying to figure out how to make the best of what had happened to them seeing that thoughtful gleam in some of the womens eyes made hasso want to cry and swear at the same time berbec clung close to him close enough to be annoying like a dog that always stayed at his heel why dont you get lost hasso snapped when hed had enough if i leave you master i am lost the captive replied i think someone will do for me he hacked at his throat with the edge of his hand to leave no doubt about what he meant and he was right enough to embarrass the german all right stay with me then hasso said roughly enough killing too much killing berbec said king bottero took matters into his own hands or rather used his own foot he booted the cooks out of their cots and bedrolls they grumbled but they came when the king woke you up you either got to work or tried to assassinate him none of the cooks seemed ready for anything that drastic across the river the bucovinans in their castle would be eating breakfast too they had to know the lenelli would try to cross the oltet as soon as they could they also had to know that if botteros men made it across the river their own chances werent good hasso had seen and joined in more rearguard actions than he liked to remember recruiting sergeants with medals and campaign ribbons all over their chests didnt talk about that kind of soldiering he was spooning up porridge when bottero came over to him berbec tried to disappear without moving a muscle he neednt have worried the king either truly didnt notice him or affected not to it amounted to the same thing either way to hasso bottero came straight to the point do you know any easy way to get across the oltet is there a ford close by hasso asked bottero shook his big head no the wehrmacht would have used rubber rafts to seize a bridgehead no such items were part of the lenello logistics train have we got boats can we make rafts we dont have boats how could we carry them along bottero said with oxdrawn wagons as his main supply vehicles he had a point building rafts would take too cursed long the weather wont get better i want to hit the grenye again just as soon as i can that made good sense even if the winter here wouldnt turn russian it wouldnt be a delight either hasso shrugged sorry your majesty then we have to do it the hard way or can your wizards knock down that castle for you what did the americans call that passing the buck thats what it was king bottero who had been scowling brightened ill find out he said and stomped off hasso carefully didnt smile even if the wizards told bottero no hed get angry at them not at his military adviser whod fallen out of the sky that suited hasso just fine berbec might have tried to disappear but hed kept his ears open he sketched a salute you are not just a bold warrior my master he said you are sly too danke schon hasso said perhaps with less irony than hed intended he studied the grenye hed vanquished and then acquired how much of that did berbec mean and how much was the grease job any slave with a gram of sense gave his master some of each the german judged the best flattery held a grain of truth that made all of it more likely to be believed what do you say berbec scratched his head over the sounds of a language only one man in this world would ever speak i say thank you hasso answered and then how do you say that in your language berbec told him when hasso pronounced the words berbecs dark eyebrows twitched so the german judged hed made a hash of things tell me when i am wrong he said i want to say it right repeat for me please hed had plenty of practice saying that in lenello you sure you want me to say you are wrong berbec understood the dangers inherent in that all right but hasso nodded by the goddess i do i am angrier if i make mistake than if you tell me i make mistake hmm the natives eyebrows were very expressive frenchmen had eyebrows like that so did jews in poland and russia their eyebrows hadnt done them any good neither had anything else berbecs made hasso smile anyway well we see the bucovinan still seemed anything but convinced if you tell me sweet lies and i find out i make you sorry hasso tried to sound as fierce as as what as a lenello whod just sacked a town in bucovin that was what yes that would do and then some it would if it convinced berbec anyhow hmm he repeated next to the lenelli maybe im not such a tough guy after all hed spent five and a half years in the biggest war in the history of the world most of the last four on the russian front and in spite of everything hed seen and done he was still a softie next to botteros knights and foot soldiers maybe that said something good about the civilization that had blown itself to smithereens from the atlantic to the volga he smacked berbec on the back not too hard you listen to me you hear you are my master you could have killed me and you didnt of course i listen to you berbec said something in his deepset dark eyes added if i feel like it hasso did him a favor he pretended not to see that he just laughed and slapped the bucovinan on the back again and got ready for another day of warfare for all the world as if there hadnt been a sack and a slaughter here the day before hed done that kind of thing back in his own world too king botteros artisans started gathering lumber from what was left of muresh to resurface to bridge across the oltet that told hasso the kings wizards hadnt come up with any brilliant ideas on their own the artisans had to do considerable scrounging too because not much was left of muresh orosei came over to hasso as the wehrmacht man watched the artisans at work you didnt have any sneaky schemes for getting across the masteratarms asked hasso shrugged and spread his hands no miracles in my pockets no ford no boats i think we have to do it the hard way oh well orosei shrugged too i told the king to ask you it was worth a try so youre to blame eh hasso made a joke of it orosei might have been doing him a favor thats me orosei grinned either he wasnt trying to screw hasso or he had more guile in him than the german guessed i say to king bottero try the wizards hasso shrugged they have no miracles in their pockets either too bad orosei said they talk big id like em better if they delivered on more of their promises though that poor bastard the bucovinans caught if he was hot stuff why didnt he turn em into a bunch of trout before they got to work on him swords are faster than spells hasso said so everybody had told him like a lot of things everybody said it must have held some truth or flegrei would still be around hasso suspected it wasnt the last word though botteros masteratarms let out a sour chuckle yeah they are a good thing too or clowns like you and med be out of work when kings wanted to fight wars they wouldnt use anybody but those unicornriding nancy boys he spat in the mud to show what he thought of wizards hasso had seen his share of homos in the wehrmacht and maybe more than his share in the waffenss where they seemed to gravitate yeah sometimes you could blackmail them but when they fought they fought at least as well as anybody else some of them in fact made uncommonly ferocious soldiers because they didnt seem to give a damn whether they lived or died more boards thudded onto the stone framework of the bridge across the oltet the bucovinans in the keep on the far bank watched the lenelli work without trying to interfere till botteros men replanked about half of the bridge that brought them into archery range and the grenye started shooting as if arrows were going to be banned day after tomorrow a lenello shot through the throat clutched at himself and tumbled into the turbid green water five meters below he wore a heavy mailshirt he wouldnt have lasted long even without a mortal wound another big blond warrior came back cussing a blue streak an arrow clean through his forearm youre lucky somebody told the wounded man now they can get it out easy they wont have to push it through bugger you with a pinecone you stinking fool the bleeding lenello retorted if i was lucky this goddesscursed thing wouldve missed good grammar would have called for a subjunctive there none of the soldiers seemed to miss it like any language lenello spoken informally was a different beast from the one the schoolmasters taught hasso smiled reminiscently remembering all the german dialects hed coped with he wouldnt have to worry about that any more the archery on the bridge was a different story other lenelli fell a few dead more wounded some of the hurt men made it back under their own power others needed buddies help every soldier who helped a wounded friend was a soldier who wasnt retimbering the bridge that work slowed to a crawl bottero sent archers out onto the span to shoot back they were bigger stronger men than the bucovinans in the castle but most of their arrows fell short the natives shooting down from a height had gravity on their side working against it was a losing proposition the lenelli didnt need long to see as much they quit shooting at the grenye and brought a troop of men with shields forward to protect the soldiers moving the planking forward that wasnt perfect but it worked well enough meter by meter the planking advanced as it neared the east bank of the oltet the bucovinans in the castle tried something new they stopped shooting at the men setting the planks in place and sent volley after volley of fire arrows at the lumber itself some of the long shafts with burning tow and tallow attached near the tip fell into the river and hissed out but the lenelli had to stomp out lots of others or drench them with buckets of water dipped up from below one soldier in a display of bravado dropped his trousers and pissed a flame into oblivion here and there though the fire arrows started blazes before the lenelli could suppress them if those had spread they might have driven king botteros men from the bridge but some of the wood the lenelli used was wet which slowed down the flames and the blonds managed to keep ahead of the fires in spite of everything their enemies could do when it became clear that the lenelli were going to make it over the oltet the bucovinans in the castle fled as theyd abandoned muresh they left bottero nothing he could use not long after they abandoned the tower smoke started pouring from it theyd fired whatever was left inside miserable bastards orosei grumbled good soldiers hasso said they do their job then they pull out they hurt us they delay us they deny us the tower good soldiers theyve got no business being good soldiers the masteratarms said theyre nothing but a pack of grenye savages he sounded personally affronted that the enemy should do anything right some germans in russia had sounded the same way about the ivans in after that such expressions of amazement came a lot less often the wehrmacht was the best army in the world which meant the red army had the best schoolmasters in the world the same was bound to be true here how much do the bucovinans learn from you hasso asked too bloody much if you want to know what i think no orosei didnt want to take them seriously after the defenders fled replanking the last bit of bridge went fast with typical lenello swagger an officer leaped from the bridge onto the riverbank he leaped and he vanished a moment later a shriek rang out that hasso could hear all the way across the river what the he said orosei spread his hands and shrugged as baffled as the man from another world before long the story came back across the bridge so did the officers body the bucovinans had dug themselves a mantrap on the riverbank a cunningly concealed pit with upwardpointing spikes set in the bottom they knew their foes habits all right they made the trap and the lenello jumped into it ive heard of them doing things like that before orosei said youve got to watch out for the spikes they use they smear shit on them to poison the wounds they make no matter here hasso said hed got a look at the dead officer one of those spikes had gone through his chest another through his throat hed bled like a stuck pig which he might as well have been his wounds wouldnt have time to fester more lenelli stepped onto the eastern bank of the oltet they moved more cautiously than that first luckless officer had and probed the ground in front of them with spears they found another mantrap a few meters farther in from the waters edge the grenye had used the night well indeed hasso wondered whether watchers would be waiting to harass the lenelli as they filled in the pits but the natives seemed to think theyd done everything they could to slow down botteros men here the lenelli crossed the oltet with no further trouble orosei pointed to smoke rising up in the east theyre burning things again he said do they really think that will slow us down yes hasso answered theyre liable to be right too wheres the wagon train that should be here yesterday should have been you talk funny you know that the masteratarms said i dont know where the miserable wagons are we cant detach enough men to cover all of them i know hasso said do you think the bucovinans dont know too without the wagons without foraging on the country what do we eat orosei looked around mud rocks he rubbed his belly yum he startled a laugh out of hasso all right you have me there but what do we do when we get hungry eat the goddesscursed bucovinans for all i care the lenello answered for all hasso knew he meant it the germans thought the ivans were untermenschen the lenelli thought the same thing about the natives here only more so did they think the grenye were far enough down the scale to do duty as meat animals hasso decided he didnt want to find out he didnt want to let go of his own worries either if the bucovinans burn their crops what do they eat their seed grain orosei answered then they starve along with us but they take longer bucovin was a big place hasso remembered the maps bottero used they werent anywhere near so good as the ones the wehrmacht used but they showed that well enough could the natives bring in enough food from places where they werent burning it to supply the ones where they were he had no idea when he asked orosei the masteratarms only shrugged his broad shoulders beats me he said youre the spymaster right youre the one whos supposed to find out stuff like that right right hasso said tightly orosei made intelligence work sound easy which only proved hed never done any by the end of the germans were sure theyd knocked out as many divisions as the red army had at the start of the war but the russians werent within a million kilometers of quitting or of running out of men king bottero sent out raiding parties to the north and south of his main line of march they drove some pigs and a few cattle and sheep back to the army and a few horses and donkeys as well those were riding or draft animals but you could eat them if you had to though not a frenchman who did it by choice hasso had chewed gluey horseflesh plenty of times on the russian front hed been glad to get it then if the lenello cooks served it up hed eat it again now the raiders also brought back some grain the grenye had already harvested it didnt make up for the wagons that werent going to get to the army though had the bucovinans burned that grain or captured it only they knew but they left no doubt about what had happened to the lenello teamsters they left a bloated foulsmelling blond head in the road in front of botteros oncoming army someone had written a message in lenello on a sheet of bark and put it by the head even hasso had no trouble sounding out the two words you next when king bottero saw that hasso thought he would have a stroke hitlers rages were the stuff of legend in germany botteros fury now matched any fit the fuhrer could have pitched for a little while the german didnt understand just why the king was going off like a grenade yes the warning in the road was grisly but it was no worse than a hundred things the lenelli had done when they sacked muresh but then bottero roared my horse my horse i tell you has more business pushing me around than these goddesscursed mindblind souldead grenye theyll pay oh how theyll pay that made the wehrmacht officer nod to himself it came down to the business of who were untermenschen again bottero really would have taken it better had his horse tried to tell him to go back to his own kingdom for the bucovinans to assume equality with the invaders even an equality of terror was a slap in the face to everything the lenello kingdoms stood for and it wasnt just bottero all the lenelli who saw the head and even more important who could read the crude threat by it quivered with outrage velona was quieter than the king krakatoa erupting might have been noisier than bottero but hasso couldnt think of anything else that would but no less angry they dare she whispered as if speaking louder might make her burst they truly dare to try conclusions with us do they well his majesty has the right of it well teach them a lesson theyll remember for the next hundred years the ones we leave alive will anyhow germans had talked like that in poland in and in russia in poles and russians by the millions had died too the germans had expected nothing less those deaths were reckoned a prerequisite for clearing the lebensraum germans needed in the fertile croplands of the east what the germans hadnt expected was how many of their own number would die the slavs were uncommonly stubborn about refusing to be cleared and now hassos folk fled before them instead of driving them away could that happen here he had trouble believing it the bucovinans were brave and there were lots of them but they were outclassed in ways the ivans hadnt been still that head and the warning by it spoke of more implacable purpose than hasso had looked to see from the natives they spoke of such things to him anyhow king bottero took another message from them burn the head he commanded in a voice like iron his soul will ascend to the heavens he looked around had he spotted any bucovinans he probably would have ordered them sacrificed to serve the lenello teamster in the world to come his face had that kind of intense purposeful stare anyhow but since he didnt he pointed to the bark with the writing dig a hole and throw that in dont cover it over yet though by the goddess his men sprang to obey him that was partly their own anger working and partly their fear anyone who tried standing against bottero in that moment would have been a dead man in the next the dirt by the side of the road was soft and easy to dig up one of the lenelli picked up the piece of bark with his fingertips as if it were unclean after he dropped it into the hole he scrubbed his hands on the dead grass and then spat after it spitting wasnt enough to satisfy bottero he dismounted from his great warhorse walked over to the hole undid his trousers and took the most furious and majestic leak hasso had ever imagined let alone seen even that didnt suffice not for the king he gestured to the leaders around him hasso didnt care one way or the other about pissing on an offensive sign if bottero wanted him to he would the king did and so he did other officers efforts made a pretty fair puddle in the hole in the ground hasso was taken aback when bottero waved velona up to the hole he could see why bottero wanted to show the goddess utter contempt for the bucovinan warning but velona didnt seem embarrassed she just squatted and pissed if it didnt bother her hasso told himself it shouldnt bother him either after that the lenelli shoveled in some dirt too the army rode on velona looked maybe unhappy maybe just distant you dont like what you just did hasso asked guiding his horse up alongside hers oh she said in some surprise as if recalled to herself no it isnt that the natives deserve what we gave them but i wish he hadnt buried it thats all the earth here fights for bucovin shed said that before about her last visit to the grenye land what did it mean here did even she know hasso thought about asking and then thought again xi bucovinan raiders hit harder at botteros scouts and supply wagons once the lenelli got over the oltet they didnt stop the kings army but they harassed it and slowed it down the last thing it needed as fall moved on toward winter falticeni the capital of bucovin lay somewhere up ahead anyhow as winter snow came down a few german units fought their way into the suburbs of moscow and in the distance got a glimpse of the kremlin then the ivans threw them back and they never came so close again hasso wished he hadnt thought of that even if the weather here was milder the kings temper frayed he gathered his generals and wizards together so he could shout at them all at the same time why arent you keeping the outriders safe curse you bottero bellowed were doing everything we know how to do your majesty an officer named nuoro had charge of the supply train but there arent enough of us and there are too stinking many bucovinans things go wrong sometimes thats all thats all he says king bottero rolled his eyes if things go on like this well be eating our belts and our boots before too long he exaggerated by how much hasso wasnt sure nuoro gave him a stiff almost wooden salute what would you have me do your majesty push the supplies through dont let the teamsters get massacred how hard is that bottero demanded in a land full of raiders and bushwhackers sire its not so easy how many more soldiers will you give me to keep the wagons safe nuoro asked well maybe a few the king said i cant give you too many more we need them to beat the savages back thats what were here for you know maybe we havent got enough soldiers for everything we need to do sire nuoro said how many times had the germans worked through the same agonizing choices in the vastnesses of the soviet union how much good did their agonizing do them not bloody much but bottero had options that werent available to the wehrmacht he turned to his wizards if i string you out along the route back to the border you can smell out ambushes right you can stop them well yes your majesty aderno said but then we wont be here with the striking force in case of battle what now bottero looked and sounded highly offended so much so that he might almost have struck a pose people in a position to know said the fuhrer did stuff like that acting had to be one of the things that went into ruling still offended the king went on you think we cant beat the barbarians by ourselves that question had only one possible answer and aderno gave it of course you can your majesty we might make it a little easier for you thats all by the goddess well manage on our own bottero said but if you cant conjure up the grub we need to keep going and it doesnt look like you can do that the next best thing for you is to make sure the plain old ordinary grub from our own kingdom gets here safe how does that sound aderno saluted as you wish it your majesty so shall it be a german would have shot out his arm and said heil hitler an ivan no doubt would have nodded and said yes comrade general secretary it all amounted to the same thing in the end then hasso had a disconcerting thought stalin had almost led his country right off a cliff in the early days of war on the russian front but the ivans went right on saying yes comrade general secretary and the fuhrer damn well had led the reich off a cliff as the war ground on but the germans went right on saying heil hitler obedience was all very well but didnt it have limits somewhere somewhere certainly here no bottero had given a reasonable order it might not work out but chances were it would and hasso also thought the lenelli could beat whatever bucovin threw at them the natives were brave but all the courage in the world didnt matter when it ran into technique so the wehrmacht taught anyhow but who wasnt in moscow and who was in berlin so what if one german was worth three ivans if every landser knocked down his three russians and then a fourth russian showed up and a fifth exactly how big was bucovin how many swarthy little men did it hold swarthy little men who didnt want to live under a big blond king who could roar like a lion enough for their numbers to cancel out the huge advantage in weapons and skill the lenelli had hasso didnt know he hoped like hell bottero did off rode the wizards on their gleaming unicorns hasso was sorry to see them go not so much because hed miss them they were a contentious badtempered lot but because hed miss their mounts the unicorns were marvelous and beautiful without them the army seemed only an army its glamour was gone well almost velona still rode with bottero and his soldiers her glamour was of a different sort from the unicorns which didnt make it any less real most of the time she was just herself not a woman in whom the goddess dwelt even as herself she was striking of course but there was more to it than that she held the memory of the goddess whether touched by the deity or not hasso sometimes wondered if he was imagining that but never for long he knew better that doubt was just the sputtering of his rational mind here in a world where rationality mattered so much less than it did in the one where he grew to manhood as if to prove as much two wagon trains in a row made it through to king botteros army the teamsters were full of praise for what the wizards had done to help them on the way they sent them savages running with lightning singeing the hair off their balls one driver said enthusiastically ill buy those bastards a beer any day of the week twice on sundays weeks here had ten days and sundays were feast days instead but hasso tried to turn lenello into idiomatic german inside his head most of the time he did pretty well every once in a while every once in a while he might as well have been in another world funny how that works he thought with a sour smile things didnt get better the next day the lenelli were marching near a river the aryesh it was called that ran north and east it should have shielded their left from any trouble from the bucovinans it should have but it didnt somehow a raiding party appeared at dawn where no raiding party had any business being the enemy soldiers shot volleys of arrows into the startled lenello infantry then galloped off before king botteros horsemen could harry them bottero predictably was furious they have no business doing that he shouted they have no right to do that how did they get there they came out of nowhere they must have crossed the river your majesty said the infantry commander a stolid soldier named friddi brilliant the king was savagely sarcastic and how did they do that no bridge in these parts and its too deep to ford maybe they had catapults fling them across maybe magic flung them across sire friddi said dont be any dumber than you can help bottero said theyre grenye by the goddess they cant do that and we dont think theyve got any renegades doing it for them if they do those bastardsll be a long hard time dying i promise you that hasso thought of scanno back in drammen scanno liked grenye better than his own folk and made no bones about it dammit we never did pick him up and grill him about how he beat adernos spell he thought there was something that slipped through the cracks as the campaign revved up but he was a drunk a ruin of his former self he wouldnt make a wizard if he lived to be a thousand and hasso wouldnt have bet on him to last another five years stubbornly friddi said well your majesty unless it was wizardry i dont know how the demon they got there however the men of bucovin managed to cross the aryesh they threw the lenello army into enough confusion to make it halt for the day hasso hunted up orosei you know some men who are good trackers he asked oh i might i just might the masteratarms eyes gleamed youve got an idea oh i might i just might hasso mimicked oroseis tone well enough to send the lenello into gales of laughter the halfdozen soldiers orosei told off had the look of hunters or more likely poachers you do what our foreign friend says orosei told them weve got some tricks he doesnt know about but i expect hes got some we dont know about too whats on your mind lord by one trackers tone of voice he was suspicious of hasso on general principles first then because the german was trying to order him around take me to where the bucovinans cross the river track them back to there for me hasso said if they did cross it the lenello said if they didnt just show up like i dont suppose grenye can do magic but you never can tell now can you he seemed a lot less convinced than king bottero what that meant well who the hell knew what that meant hasso had more urgent things to worry about track them back he said then we see till we try to find out we cant really know that was true in his world here it had better be true here he thought you dont need us for this another tracker said as they all set out a blind man could follow these hoofprints a blind man nothing still another lenello put in a dead man could fine pretend i am blind pretend i am dead hasso said but remember one thing please if you make a mistake i haunt you that got some grins from the men orosei had picked and one or two nervous chuckles back in germany he would have been joking here as the first lenello tracker said you never could tell back through the bushes and saplings the train led back to the aryesh the trackers were right hasso could have done this himself he shrugged he hadnt known ahead of time but now he had witnesses if his hunch turned out to be right and if it turned out to be wrong they would see him looking like a jerk he shrugged again if youre going to try things sometimes you damn well will look like a jerk thats all the aryesh was muddy and foamy it looked almost like viennese coffee hasso sighed along with tobacco that was something he would never enjoy again nothing he could do about it no there was one thing he could do without he unsheathed his belt knife and trimmed a sapling into a pole about a meter and a half long nice blade one of the trackers said whered you get it i have it with me when i come from my world hasso answered how about that the lenello said and then in a low voice to one of his pals never seen one like it before almost makes you believe that cockandbull story doesnt it hasso didnt think he was supposed to overhear that but he did whats he going to do now the other tracker said his voce also not quite sotto enough dowse with that stick we already know where the cursed river is hasso hadnt even thought of dowsing in germany that was an old wives tale it probably wasnt here if any kind of magic was practical finding water fit the bill but as the tracker said he already knew where the water was here he was after something else he thrust the pole into the aryesh he wasnt enormously surprised when only the first twentyfive or thirty centimeters went in after that it hit an obstruction his grin was two parts satisfaction and one part relief orosei was only confused whats going on he asked instead of answering with words hasso probed with the pole again then he stepped out into or onto the river walking on the water he felt like jesus the aryesh didnt come up to the tops of his boots he strode forward probing as he went what the one of the trackers exclaimed they dont put their bridge where we can see it hasso said turning back toward the lenelli they build it underwater build it sneaky so they can use it and we dont know well fuck me the tracker said if that wasnt his version of coming to attention and saluting hasso didnt know what would be i dont know not till i see hasso answered but i think maybe in my world the enemies of my land use this trick the russians used every trick in the book and then wrote a new book for all the tricks that werent in the old one the wehrmacht used this one too a bridge that was hard to spot was a bridge artillery wouldnt knock out in a hurry artillery couldnt knock this one out no artillery here hasso looked across the aryesh he didnt see anybody which was all to the good what we need to do is we need to pull up ten or fifteen cubits of this tonight he said he almost said five or six meters but that wouldnt have meant anything to the blonds with him they used fingers and palms and cubits and weights that were even more cumbersome what could you do since he couldnt do anything he went on then the bucovinans ride across go splash orosei grinned at him if that doesnt make those bastards turn up their toes i dont know what would thats the idea isnt it hasso said even the trackers who had been dubious about him laughed and nudged one another hes not so dumb after all is he one of them said not so dumb another agreed which struck hasso as praising with faint damn but he would take what he could get he made the trackers love him even more when he said you stay here and keep an eye on things orosei and i we go back to the king and let him know what needs doing what if the savages come across the river at us now a tracker demanded not likely not in the daytime they want to keep this a secret right hasso said before the trackers could answer or complain he added but if they do then you bug out they couldnt very well bitch about that and they didnt an underwater bridge king bottero said when hasso brought him the news how the demon did they do that when hasso hesitated orosei took over the germans lenello wasnt up to technical discussions of pilings and planking botteros masteratarms finished i never would have thought of it i didnt know what to think when i saw him walking on the water yes that was funny though only hasso in all this world knew why but he says they use this trick in war where he comes from so he was ready for it nice to know orosei doesnt try to hog credit hasso thought or not when the guy who deserves it is around to hear him anyway what do we do about it the king asked hasso told him what he had in mind bottero stroked his beard a slow smile stole over his heavyfeatured face i like that fry me if i dont well do it tonight and well watch the grenye go sploot hasso didnt think sploot was a word in lenello but he had no trouble figuring out what it meant send a goodsized band of men your majesty orosei suggested if the barbarians decide to bring more raiders across tonight they might swamp a little party of artisans hasso hadnt thought of that plainly neither had king bottero he nodded youre right ill do it he turned and shouted orders to the officers who would take charge of that then he nodded again there ive dealt with something anyhow a frown spread across his face like rain clouds or have i have the bucovinans built more of these underwater bridges ones we dont know about yet a wizard could hasso broke off feeling stupid all the wizards were scattered along the armys long supply line now that the main force needed one it didnt have any then he noticed that bottero was eyeing him didnt aderno say you had some of the talent the king rumbled he says it but i dont know if i believe it hassos voice broke as if he were one of the fifteenyearolds to whom the volkssturm gave a rifle and a good luck as they sent them off to try to slow down the red army and even if its true i dont know how to use it about time you find out then isnt it bottero said if you can do it youll give us a big hand but but hasso spluttered his majestys right orosei said magic isnt a common gift if youve got it you shouldnt let it lie idle the goddess wouldnt like that did he mean velona or the deity who sometimes inhabited her hasso didnt know and wondered whether the lenello did but but he said again he hated sounding like a broken record but he didnt know what else to say the king slapped him on the back which almost knocked him out of the saddle if hed fallen off the horse and landed on his head it would have been a relief talk to velona bottero said shell give you some pointers and you can go from there it doesnt sound like the kind of magic that can kill you if you dont do it right give it your best shot hasso hadnt even thought about the consequences of a spell gone wrong he wished his new sovereign hadnt reminded him of such things too but what were his choices here he saw only two say no and get a name for cowardice the last thing he needed or give it his best shot hed long since decided that a big part of courage was nothing more than a reluctance to look like a coward in front of people who mattered to him and so reluctantly he said yes your majesty velona came up and kissed him which was a hell of a distraction for somebody contemplating his very first conjuration you can do it she said her voice was full of confidence and perhaps some warm promise too im sure you can do it the goddess wouldnt have brought you here to let you fail he didnt know why the goddess had brought him here he didnt even know that the goddess had brought him here king bottero had a point though velona knew a lot more about magic than he did christ my horse knows more about magic than i do he thought between her suggestions and his own few feeble ideas hed come up with what might be a spell it turned dowsing upside down and inside out he wasnt trying to find water flowing underground he was looking for unmoving objects concealed beneath running water if everything went exactly right the forked stick in his hands would rise when he pointed it at a submerged bridge the notquitedowsing stick was carved from one of the timbers the lenelli had torn from the first underwater bridge velona said that would give it a mystic affinity with the other bridges if there were others the idea seemed reasonable in an unreasonable kind of way even so he let his worry show if i find no bridges does that mean there are no bridges or does it mean i cant find them if i am no wizard casting a spell does not help will not help he remembered how to make the future tense he didnt need to worry about the future though he was tense right now cast the spell then see what happens velona said that also seemed reasonable if your view of reason included spells in the first place hassos didnt or rather it hadnt fighting not to show his fear he started to chant velona had come up with a lot of the spell hasso would never make a poet in lenello come to that hed made a lousy poet auf deutsch what he had to remember here was to get the words right he understood what the magic ought to do even if he didnt perfectly follow all the phrases in the charm poetry was supposed to be challenging wasnt it velona gestured that reminded him to move the notdowsing rod he swung it slowly from southwest to northeast paralleling the course of the aryesh all of a sudden it jerked upwards in his hands he almost dropped it he was so surprised hed no more thought he could truly work magic than that he could fly there velona said go back hasso pemsel go back and get the exact direction so the artisans can find the hidden bridge he did and damned if the rod didnt rise again his own rod rose too he remembered how shed called him by his full name when they met there on the causeway through the swamp he remembered what theyd done right afterwards too and he wanted to do it again his thoughts must have shown on his face for velona laughed softly and throatily soon she promised but then she tempered that adding but not yet first we see where the savages can sneak across the river oh all right hasso knew he sounded like a petulant little boy who couldnt have what he wanted just when he wanted it quite a bit like the fuhrer in fact he thought velona who knew nothing about hitler except that he was the man who ruled the country hasso came from laughed again this time with rich amusement in her voice hasso wished he had a compass to give him a precise bearing on where that bridge lurked under the water nobody here had any idea what a compass was if he could float an iron needle in a bowl of water but he had too many other things to worry about right now velona marked off the bearing as best she could hasso decided it would probably serve they werent very far from the aryesh go on she urged him see if there are any more he wished she were urging him on while they were doing something else but he saw the need for continuing with this that need might not delight him but he did see it and working magic had a fascination and an astonishment all its own he didnt think hed been so delightfully surprised since the first time he played with himself and ill be a son of a bitch he muttered damned if the rod didnt jerk up in his hand again chanting the charm over and over he fixed the precise direction again velona marked it he found one more bridge after that or thought he did part of him a good bit of him still wondered whether this wasnt some kind of delusion but even in his world dowsers could or claimed they could find water maybe there was something to it velona had no doubts as soon as the spell was done she plastered herself against him tighter than a coat of paint and gave him a kiss that curled his ears and made steam come out of his hair before he could sling her over his shoulder and carry her off to their tent the first thing that occurred to him even if she didnt weigh that much less than he did she broke free and called for the artisans after a moment regretfully so did hasso the men came up with astonishing haste hasso didnt flatter himself that his shouts had much to do with it when your goddess yelled for you you went to her first and then wondered why she wanted you hasso sometimes wondered why velona still wanted him but in a much more pleasant way follow these bearings to the river one by one she said pointing at the lines shed laid out when you get there probe under the surface youll find hidden bridges in each place tear them up they saluted clenched fists over their hearts well do it they said and hurried off hasso hoped they werent going off for nothing not least because he would look like a jerk if they were they must have found what they were looking for because that evening king bottero summoned hasso to dine with him he hadnt done that since hassos striking column slammed through the bucovinans in the first and so far only big battle the two sides had fought bottero poured wine for hasso with his own hand you see he said expansively i told you you could do it yes your majesty hasso said which was an answer as useful here as jawohl mein fuhrer had been back in the reich and it wasnt even a lie this time around bottero did say so and he was right why did you have any doubts the king asked if aderno said you had the power you did aderno may be a pain in the fundament sometimes but he knows the difference between a snake and its cast skin no magic in the world i come from hasso said hard for me to believe anyone has it he jabbed a thumb at his own chest extra hard to believe i have it well you do bottero said get used to it the artisans came back all excited about how you knew exactly where to send them they said you made their work easy one of them asked why our regular wizards couldnt do so well hasso winced they shouldnt say that he didnt want the regular wizards angry at him maybe he could work a little magic however crazy that seemed but he wasnt a pro and he knew it if somebody who was a pro decided to turn him into a prawn he didnt know how to defend himself or fight back a pretty young grenye woman brought in a platter of pork ribs and roasted parsnips the robe she wore was so thin it wouldnt have kept her warm long outside the king ran his hand up her leg was her smile forced or real was she glad to be getting off as easy as this or did she hate him for groping her and no doubt for taking her too hasso had no way to know which might have been surely was just as well he concentrated on the food after a while he asked how far to falticeni your majesty were getting there bottero answered pretty soon the savages will have to fight us again well whip them and then well go on and take the place the woman stood by the king waiting for anything he might want for anything at all plainly should you talk with her here hasso asked why not bottero asked she knows how to say yes in lenello and thats about it and shes not going anywhere anyhow shes hot enough to keep around for a while he fondled her again then asked you want her to suck you off shes good hasso might have enjoyed that if hed found the girl himself with bottero watching as he plainly intended to do no thanks your majesty i just came from velona ah the king leered she can wear anybody out yes hasso left it at that and hoped bottero would he wasnt lying velona had helped him celebrate his successful sorcery he also feared being unfaithful to her as a woman no not so much though she would be incandescent enough if scorned but as a woman with the goddess indwelling the last thing hasso wanted to do was face an irate deity he didnt say that to king bottero it didnt seem manly then bottero said youre pretty smart if she found out about you and some chit shed fry your nuts off i bet forget i asked you so the king respected if that was the right word velona too well he would he really believed in the goddess believed in his belly and his balls hasso tried not to think of his belly on velona his balls slapping the inside of her thighs to hasso belief like that came much harder no matter what hed seen here how do we make the bucovinans fight us hasso asked if they stand we can beat them yes wed better bottero said thats what im trying to do take a big bite out of them instead theyve been nibbling on us and i dont mean like sfinti here he swatted the bucovinan woman on the backside she smiled at him again again hasso wondered what went on behind her eyes but only for a moment he had other things to think about the wehrmacht had wanted to get the red army to stand and fight too instead the russians traded space for time drawing the germans on till they got overextended and then hitting back the bucovinans looked to be playing the same game against bottero would it work here if the lenelli took falticeni obviously not otherwise hasso shrugged he was too much a stranger here to be sure of much hell he hadnt even been sure he could do magic he still had trouble believing it he didnt want to think about that now he gnawed on ribs and drank beer and tried not to watch bottero pawing sfinti it wasnt that he hadnt seen plenty worse most recently at muresh but the way she just stood there and let the king do what he wanted raised hassos hackles he wouldnt have wanted to sleep with her not literally even if she kept on smiling wouldnt you be much too likely to wake up slightly dead the next morning king bottero didnt seem to worry about it bottero didnt seem to worry about much of anything the rest of the lenello kingdoms will be so jealous of us once weve cut off bucovins head he boasted jealous enough to gang up on you hasso asked that would be all bottero needed getting through one war only to end up in another that was worse against other lenelli he wouldnt have any special edge dont think so no the king didnt worry about much what it will do though is itll draw us more people from across the sea theyll know well have lands to hand out lands with plenty of grenye on em to work and to have fun with he pulled sfinti down onto his lap hasso got to his feet maybe id better go your majesty he said king bottero didnt tell him no he bowed his way out of the tent as the flap fell bottero laughed and the bucovinan woman giggled the guards outside grinned and nudged one another one of them winked at hasso he had to make himself grin and wink back he also had to make himself hope bottero knew what he was doing in there the king pretty obviously thought so were the bucovinans smart enough to leave a pretty assassin behind to be captured or would an ordinary grenye woman pull out a knife if she saw the chance and even if the answer to both those questions was no what would happen to botteros kingdom after this campaign hitlers biggest mistake was thinking he could take on almost the entire rest of the world was the local king doing the same stupid thing again hasso had to shrug he didnt know enough to judge just enough to worry youre back sooner than i expected velona remarked when he ducked into the tent they shared his majesty has other things on his mind hasso shaped an hourglass in the air with his hands the lenelli didnt use that gesture and velona needed a moment to realize what it meant when she did she laughed for a moment he didnt want to share with you she asked ominously he could to his own relief answer with the exact truth i dont want to share with him i have better here he wasnt afraid of facing the bucovinans in battle he wasnt afraid of trying to work magic either though maybe he needed to be now that hed discovered he could do it but facing an angry velona that scared him green he would rather have jumped on a russian grenade her eyes flashed as she inspected him it wasnt just a figure of speech the spark in them seemed to light up the gloom inside the tent maybe he was imagining things but he didnt think so her gaze didnt probe him the same way a wizards would have which was not to say it didnt probe him at last grudgingly she nodded all right i believe you but if you ever waste your seed with a grenye woman she didnt go on not with words she did create the strong impression that that wouldnt be a good idea and captain hasso pemsel veteran of five and a half years of war in europe and a campaign seasons worth in this strange new world shivered in his boots he didnt shiver only because velona intimidated him he tried not to admit to himself that she did he tried for a good second and a half and then gave it up as a bad job it was bloody cold in there winter was coming on and the tent walls were about as good at keeping the chill out as they would have been on the eastern front he threw more charcoal on the brazier which might have raised the temperature half a degree from arctic all the way up to frigid he breathed easier when velona relented enough to ask does the king think he can make the bucovinans stand and fight he wants to hasso was glad to talk about the campaign instead of anything that had to do with sfmtis charms cant conquer them unless they stand or unless they let us walk into falticeni they wont velona said flatly and hasso nodded he didnt think the bucovinans would either they were fighting the lenelli every way they knew how and they had sense enough to see that pitched battles werent the best way to do it her gaze went far away it wont be easy her voice might have been coming from beyond too was that prophecy could there be such a thing in this world once more hasso didnt know he did know his shiver this time had nothing to do with the cold outside xii two mornings later a bucovinan noble approached the army to parley he did it formally with an escort of a dozen or so horsemen with armor as good as any hasso had seen on a bucovinan as usual they carried greenery in lieu of the white flags that served as truce signs in hassos world some of the lenelli muttered at that who do they think they are acting like civilized men marshal lugo grumbled we ought to run this beggar off just to teach him proper manners better to hear him hasso said let us find out what he and his master have in mind hortatory subjunctive he thought pleased with himself he hadnt needed to come out with one of those since he was taking latin a hell of a long time ago bring him here bottero decided listening to him doesnt cost us anything and we can always run him off later if we dont like what he says the bucovinan envoy bowed in the saddle to the king i am otset your majesty he said in excellent lenello i bring you the words of zgomot lord of bucovin he didnt claim zgomot was a king any lenello sovereign would have either laughed or got furious at such presumption hear my lords words and marvel at how generous and full of forbearance he is king botteros face turned the color of brick dust do you want us to horsewhip you home little man you sound like you do otset bit his lip he wasnt very big especially when measured against the enormous lenelli but he answered calmly enough if someone invaded your kingdom your majesty would you greet him with cheers and flowers and bread and salt when the wehrmacht rolled into the ukraine in some of the locals had greeted the germans just like that if the germans had treated them better the ukrainians and other soviet subjects might have stayed friendly which would have made an enormous difference in the war the measure of stalins damnation was that close to a million of his citizens fought on hitlers side in spite of everything and the measure of hitlers damnation was that almost the whole goddamn world fought on stalins side in spite of everything bottero rumbled deep down in his chest he could not and would not see any grenye ruler as an equal with the air of one making a great concession to a churl who didnt come close to deserving it he said well say your worthless say and then you can go and get lost thank you so much for your gracious kindness your majesty otset said deadpan he might be a shrimp but he had nerve bottero rumbled some more but he didnt seem to realize hed been oneupped the ambassador or herald or whatever he was went on lord zgomot says you have his leave to return to your own realm his brave armies will not harry you if you turn around and go home that set not only bottero but most of the high officers who rode at the fore with him laughing their heads off what a generous worm your socalled lord is the king said we thought we didnt see your armies because they didnt have the nerve to stand against us he mockingly bowed in the saddle so thanks for telling us theyre brave without you we never would have known most of the lenelli went right on laughing hasso didnt bottero was pushing it and had to know he was the bucovinan army the lenelli had beaten didnt fight badly the grenye had no magic working for them and theyd never had a striking column shatter their line before under those circumstances no wonder they lost but they didnt disgrace themselves otset only shrugged his narrow shoulders he wore a dark blue woolen cloak with a hood over a linen shirt brightened with embroidery his breath smoked as he replied plenty of other lenello armies have come into bucovin out of the west we still stand we will go on standing after you have to leave our land too king bottero went brickred again by the goddess little man you will not he shouted well burn falticeni around your heads savage and when we catch you well throw you on the fire now get away from me before i kill you on the spot for spewing shit at your betters word of your charm has preceded you your majesty otset said this time bottero did recognize the sarcasm he bellowed wordless fury like a bull otset took no notice of it but continued the folk of bucovin will fight you the land of bucovin will fight you too and the last time the goddess visited us she barely got free with her life he nodded to velona who rode not far from the king he knew her for what she was if you persist if she persists luck may be different this time bottero bellowed again hasso paid him little heed but eyed velona instead she jerked in the saddle as if taking a wound then pretended not quite well enough that shed done no such thing you may mock me she said but you scorn the goddess at your peril otset shook his head i do no such thing lady but this is not the goddess land better for you to go back to places she has taken for her own she will take this land too velona said she will take all this land however far it reaches it will be hers it is hers and her folk will settle it lebensraum hasso thought not for the first time velona put it differently from the way the fuhrer had but it amounted to the same thing the only trouble was the ivans had the lebensraum now and the germans damn well didnt all kinds of things were different here though chances were that one would be too you say it lady but saying it does not make it so otset sketched a salute to velona a courtesy he omitted with king bottero he spoke to his escort they turned their horses and rode off in the direction from which theyd come several lenelli nocked arrows ready to shoot otset and the rest of the bucovinan riders out of the saddle bottero did not a thing to stop them but velona her face troubled raised a hand and none of the big blond men let fly the goddess would not want us to slay an envoy she said even an envoy who knows her not marshal lugo sounded scandalized he knows her velonas voice was troubled but he denies she has power here it is up to us to prove him wrong that stirred the king right he shouted well smash them how the lenelli cheered after otsets warning about the land hasso more than half expected blizzards to start roaring down out of the north hed been through that in russia in and had a frozen meat medal to prove it not many of the old sweats whod earned that one were still in one piece he was as those things went lucky when he worried about blizzards out loud the lenelli laughed at him we dont get weather like that goddess be praised orosei said even if we did the stinking grenye couldnt bring em down on us king bottero added and they turned out to be right no stormwinds full of snow blew in the advancing soldiers faces but that didnt mean the lenelli advanced very far or very fast no snow came no but rain fell in buckets barrels hogsheads the muddy road turned to swamp the invaders started getting hungry too because they couldnt forage widely and the supply wagons had even more trouble moving than did men mounted or afoot we whipped the weather once bottero told hasso why dont you cast a spell so we can do it again why dont i hasso thought wildly because i dont have the faintest idea how thats why he tried to put that less blatantly your majesty i work one spell my whole life you want me to get rid of this he looked up at the gray gloomy sky and got a faceful of rain for his trouble but the king only nodded yes thats what i want youre what ive got im going to use you or else use you up a wehrmacht colonel ordering a platoon to stay behind as a rear guard so the rest of the regiment could get away from the ivans couldnt have been more brutally blunt soldiering was soldiering no matter which world you wound up in sometimes you got the shitty end of the stick that was all hasso found himself holding it here he saluted i do my best your majesty never mind your best just do what i tell you sure as hell bottero thought like a king rain rain go away come again some other day that was the only charm hasso knew along those lines just on the off chance he chanted it up at the heavens first in german and then in lenello the rain kept right on falling he hadnt expected anything different he sighed it would have been nice if things were simple since they werent he went to talk with velona she wore a thick wool cloak with a hood not very different from otsets it smelled powerfully of sheep and so was probably good and greasy better than the one he had on anyhow she heard him out her face getting graver and graver as he went on then she said well you can try whats that supposed to mean hasso asked weather magic is never easy she answered her tone as somber as her expression and weather magic in bucovin will be harder yet that wretch of an otset wasnt wrong ive seen it for myself and ive spoken of it with you there is a bond between the grenye and the land here it isnt magic i dont know what the right name for it is but it is real what can i do about it how can i beat it she shrugged which made water bead up and run down the cloak do the best you can hasso pemsel i will pray to the goddess to grant you favor and lend strength to your spell back in our own lands i am sure she would hearken to me here velona shrugged again and spread her hands raindrops splashed off her palms which did nothing to encourage hasso he scratched his beard by now he was used to wearing it it had got long enough not to itch any more back in the wehrmacht hed had to shave it off when he found the chance the only problem with it was that it gave lice more room to roam when he got infested what was the opposite of rain sunshine brilliant hasso he told himself he couldnt pull the sun out of a pouch on his belt he could he supposed make a fire and use that to symbolize the sun maybe it would serve if he could get a fire going in this dripping puddlefilled land and the opposite of wet was dry if he could find a dry sponge or even a dry cloth to symbolize soaking up the rainwater he could try his magic maybe it would work even if it didnt king bottero would know hed tried sometimes making the effort counted as much as succeeding or failing the germans had put in plenty of pointless attacks against the russians to keep hitler happy and then gone back to what really needed doing hasso understood how that game was played as she had with his first spell velona helped him here he was convinced he had even fewer poetic gifts in lenello than in german but she nodded as they worked together youve got a good notion of how magic is supposed to work she told him you say the sweetest things darling hasso answered deadpan velonas face lit up like a flashbulb a comparison that in all this world would have occurred to him alone he added if only it were true the subjunctive was for talking about conditions contrary to fact he used it here without the slightest hesitation botteros army slogged and sloshed forward not going anywhere very fast in russia even tracked vehicles bogged down in mud like this the ivans had light wagons with enormous wheels wagons that almost doubled as boats that could navigate such slop every german outfit tried to lay hold of a few of them hasso hadnt seen anything like them here he could describe them to lenello wainwrights but they wouldnt get built in time to do any good on this campaign and so so i get to work magic he thought again he waited till the army stopped to encamp for the evening that was in midafternoon not only because darkness came even earlier with the clouds but also because the lenelli needed extra time to set up an elaborate web of sentries the bucovinans liked to sneak in a few marauders to hamstring horses and murder men in their tents if the raiders died instead that might discourage them it would certainly discourage the ones who got killed youre ready are you bottero boomed good thats good hasso i dont know how good it is your majesty the german answered i can try thats all youll do fine you did before the king didnt lack for confidence maybe i will hasso thought he hadnt dreamt he would be able to divine where the bucovinans underwater bridges lay no matter what he hadnt dreamt hed done it why shouldnt i do it again no reason at all after poland and france and the balkan campaign that kind of reasoning took the fuhrer into the soviet union the german gamble there almost paid off the wehrmacht came so close to knocking the ivans out of the fight but what did they say close only counted with horseshoes and hand grenades hasso wished he had a few potatomashers on his belt they wouldnt help with his rain magic but they made a damn fine lifeinsurance policy but he didnt and he didnt like to dwell on things he didnt have velona had warned him more than once that you had to pay attention when you cast a spell if you didnt the magic could turn and bite you hasso wished she hadnt told him that the magic could also turn and bite you if you screwed up your chant for somebody with a still uncertain grasp of lenello that was also less than encouraging news velona chose that moment to ask him are you ready no he answered honestly she blinked that wasnt what shed expected to hear he went on but i dont get i wont get any readier if i wait so i try the spell we see what happens she kissed him which was distracting in a much more pleasant way than his own gloomy and uncertain thoughts you can do it ive seen that you can maybe shed been listening to bottero well i hope so he got a little fire going in the bottom of a pot that he put under an awning made of tent cloth he set another pot upside down under the awning and put the dry cloth under it he couldnt help thinking that a real wizard would have used far more elaborate preparations aderno probably would have laughed his ass off at what hasso was doing but aderno wasnt here and hasso damn well was like those kids who found themselves in the volkssturm he had to do the best he could he wished he hadnt thought of it like that the ivans and the amis and the tommies slaughtered the poor damned kids in the volkssturm in carload lots a few lived long enough to learn how to soldier most got wounded or killed before they could was that true of wizards too there was another cheerful notion no time for it now give me the parchment he told velona she did and held her cloak over it so the rain wouldnt wash away the words before he could chant them he called on the goddess he called on the heavens he called on the sun and the clouds once when he stumbled over a word the fabric of the world seemed to stretch very tight sudden frightening heat built up inside him he got the next word right and the one after that and found his rhythm again the heat receded his fear didnt he wondered if it ever would yeah you could blow yourself up with this stuff if you didnt know what you were doing and he didnt worse he knew he didnt recognizing his own ignorance made him want to race through the spell to get it over with as fast as he could that probably wasnt smart it made him more likely to screw up tortoise he told himself not hare tortoise you have to do it right thats more important than doing it fast making himself believe it wasnt easy at last he got through it he didnt burst into flames or explode from water buildup inside him or dry out as if hed been stuck in the sahara for a million years or do any of the other interesting and horrible things his overactive imagination came up with he just said so may it be one more time and slumped down exhausted was that rain soaking him or sweat did it matter velona straightened him up she had strength for two or maybe for an army there she said you did it you did everything a man could do but i already knew you did everything a man can do to leave him in no possible doubt of what she meant she kissed him again he was sure she would have taken him to bed if hed shown even the slightest interest just then though he was so weary he didnt think he could have got it up with a crane wine he croaked or beer anyhow velona didnt get angry which had to make her a princess no a goddess among women ill get you some she said but she didnt instead she shouted for berbec the captured bucovinan obeyed her faster than he followed hassos orders and with less back talk by the standards of this world hasso was probably a softy he shrugged he couldnt do much about that and he was too damn tired to care right now anyway berbec came back with wine hasso wondered where hed got it from the kings cooks maybe if berbec said the goddess wanted something who would have the nerve to tell him no even bottero would think twice before he did that the wine was thick and sweet like all the vintages here anybody with a sophisticated palate would have thrown up his hands in despair hasso didnt give a damn the alcohol gave him a jolt and the sugar gave him another one by the time hed downed a big mug hed improved all the way up to elderly velona drank some too then she kissed him one more time he didnt know about kisses sweeter than wine but kisses sweetened with wine were pretty nice and he remembered berbec and the line in the bible about not binding the mouths of the cattle that thresh the grain he sloshed the wine jar it was almost empty but not quite he gave it to the bucovinan here he said finish this me berbec sounded astonished velona looked even more astonished and angry too hasso nodded pretending he didnt see the storm on her brow berbec gulped hastily then gave a sort of halfbow much obliged master he said and scurried away before that storm burst it did as soon as he was gone keeping slaves content is one thing wasting wine on them is something else velona said pointedly so im a crappy master the world wont end hasso said i dont have it in me to fight right now either lets see how the magic turns out all right he wondered if a soft answer would turn away wrath velona followed her own road first last and always if you werent heading in that direction you were commonly smart to stay out of her way but she just said ill try to talk sense into you later then if those werent words of love hasso didnt think hed ever heard any come morning he looked up into the sky it was still cloudy it wasnt exactly raining but it wasnt exactly not raining either a fine mist got his face wet he had the feeling someone was watching him he looked around but the only person he saw was berbec the servant had his tunic off he was getting lice and their eggs out of the seams hasso wondered how many times hed done that since more than he wanted to remember anyhow you never got ahead of the goddamn bugs you had a bastard of a time staying even are you watching me hasso asked were you watching me yes pasts and futures were starting to come berbec paused after crushing something between his thumbnails he said i try to keep an eye on you see what you want he had a mat of hair on his chest and belly he also had some impressive muscles he might be a runt but he was a wellbuilt runt and he and hasso were talking past each other no the wehrmacht officer said i mean were you watching me just now not me berbec shook his head i was paying attention to these lousy things he looked surprised then started to laugh his lenello was also imperfect and hed made the joke by accident all right maybe it isnt wasnt you then hasso looked around again he still didnt see anyone else close enough to have given him the willies that way he looked up into the sky again the mist kept coming down but it was no more than mist and the feeling that he was being watched got worse he remembered the bucovinan envoy and he remembered how velona felt when she got deep into bucovin the land wasnt on the lenellis side here did the land include the sky he didnt know how could he he was more foreign in these parts than the lenelli were a million times more foreign his sorcery might not have stopped the rain but did seem to have slowed it down would that be enough to get the countryside pissed off at him if it was how worried did he need to be he was still chewing on that and not liking the taste of it very much when king bottero strode over to him the king paused every few steps to kick mud off his boots berbec saw him coming too and unobtrusively got lost botteros smile almost made a substitute for sunshine you see i knew you could do it he said did i do it hasso shrugged i dont know your majesty still some rain he blinked as a drop got him in the eye not bloody much king bottero was inclined to look on the bright side of things it was coming down like pig piss which was what the lenelli said when they meant it was raining cats and dogs but now weve only got this drizzle we can cope with this the other that was pretty bad i dont know if this is because of me hasso repeated if it starts raining hard again in that case youll work your magic again and slow it down the king didnt have to listen to anybody if he didnt feel like it the fuhrer hadnt had to either hitler was still in berlin when hasso disappeared from that world if he was lucky now he was dead if he wasnt so lucky stalin had him hasso had trouble thinking of anything worse than getting caught by uncle joe and stalin didnt have to listen to anybody either its still muddy bottero kicked glop off his boots again but if it doesnt get any worse than this well manage its on to falticeni i hope so your majesty hasso meant that anyway the king slapped him on the back you can do it we can do it and you will do it and so will we off he went pausing every now and then to clear those boots when the army set out of course the ground was still muddy from all the rain that had fallen before that meant the lenelli still had to move slowly hassos horse probably felt like doing what bottero had done no matter what it felt like it kept slogging forward one bit of good news with all that rain the bucovinans couldnt burn everything in the path of the kings army they did dig more camouflaged pits in the roadway as they had when the lenelli forced their way across the oltet a few unwary scouts rode their horses into them the sharp stakes set up at the bottom of the pits pierced men and horses alike bottero fumed when supplies didnt come up fast enough to suit him what are our wizards doing back there he complained are they too busy screwing little brown women to pay attention to their proper business he was screwing little brown women himself or at least one little brown woman no one seemed to want to mention sfinti to him hasso a nearstranger in these ranks found discretion the better part of valor orosei did remark its muddy behind us too your majesty well yes bottero said but we need the food curse it jumping up and down about what you cant help wont make it any better the masteratarms said hasso would have liked to tell king bottero the same thing but didnt know how the monarch would take it from him orosei more at ease in a society where hed belonged since birth didnt hesitate and the king did take it from him a sheepish grin spread across botteros face it makes me feel better he said hurrah orosei wasnt afraid to be sarcastic to his sovereign either and king bottero laughed out loud for all the world as if the soldier were kidding somewhere up ahead lay falticeni over the next set of hills past the next forest around the next bend in the road the germans had looked for moscow like that in the winter of and they knew exactly where it was half the time the lenelli seemed to think falticeni lay somewhere over the rainbow with the maps they had who could blame them they knew its direction but not where along that line it was and the farther east they went the worse the rain got again hasso worked his amateur spell once more he was smoother at it the second time around he didnt come close to cooking himself in his own juices the way he had the first try but he couldnt see that the magic did much to the weather this time were deeper into bucovin now velona said in what had to be meant for consolation the land does work against spells here why isnt that magic hasso asked irritably it screws magic up its like trying to fight a battle in the rain and mud she answered it screws up everything its just the way things are here if the grenye worked magic theyd have trouble with it too but the natives didnt couldnt work magic the lenelli sneered at them for that and made them out to be well untermenschen on account of it if the big blonds big advantage faded though the farther east they went we just have to do it the hard way thats all velona declared we can do that too were better warriors than those scrawny little buggers ever dreamt of being and speaking of doing it the hard way she looked at him sidelong that turned out to be better consolation than all the words in the world the bucovinans didnt seem to know they couldnt stand up against botteros army raiding parties tangled with his scouts no mystery about where these bands came from they rode down from the northeast shot arrows at the lenelli or pitched into them when enjoying the advantage of numbers and then rode off again bottero thought about sending hasso forward with the scouts a wizard could remind the little bastards why were better than they are the king said i dont know how much i can do on this ground hasso left it there anymore and he would have looked bad well save you bottero decided after some thought you go up with just a few of our men along something stupid can happen dont want that not when theres bound to be a big battle ahead chances are well need you more then whatever you say your majesty hasso was more relieved than he let on the prospect of combat didnt faze him after everything hed been through he had its measure no what did make him sigh unobtrusively he hoped was the good sense king bottero showed he didnt throw away the potential of a large gain later for some small one or the potential of that small one now the striking column of lenello knights practiced whenever it could it had won a battle for the army so even marshal lugo wasnt complaining about it anymore the big blonds did like to fight aggressively the idea fit them well enough once they got used to it punch a hole in the other fellows line then pour on through what could be better than that nothing as long as it worked this time the bucovinans likely expect us to do something with the column hasso warned a surprise is only a surprise once we need to watch their line see where the weakness is then we hit there he slammed his right fist into his left palm captain nornat got the idea theyll give us a hole to go through sure as sure he predicted theyre nothing but grenye after all they always make sloppy mistakes like that its one of the reasons we keep thrashing them you dont want to have to count on the other guy doing something dumb hasso said you want to be able to beat him even if he does everything as well as he can well sure the lenello officer said but when he does screw up you want to make him sorry hasso nodded he couldnt very well disagree in russia you could bet the ivans wouldnt move as fast as they should have lieutenants didnt dare do much on their own they had to get authorization from higher up the chain of command for that matter so did colonels again and again the germans made them pay for being slow hassos laugh was so bitter nornat raised a questioning eyebrow nothing hasso said which was an outandout lie the wehrmacht had taken advantage of the russians time and again sure and in the end so what stalin won the goddamn war anyhow the bucovinans faults were different from the russians these guys were still trying to figure out how the lenelli fought they didnt have enough practice to be as good as the invaders from across the sea no wonder they screwed up every once in a while they fall to pieces when we take falticeni hasso asked theyd better nornat said we grab their stupid king or lord or whatever they call him we hold his toes to the fire theyll spread their legs for us never you fear good that was what hasso wanted to hear he remembered how skorzenys paratroopers had stolen mussolini what if some of those guys had managed to grab uncle joe wouldnt that have been something the reich would have got what it wanted then by god or would it would some other moscow bureaucrat have grabbed the reins instead and gone on fighting how could you know with russians stalin was a strong leader but he didnt personify things the way hitler did in germany you couldnt imagine the reich without the fuhrer russia might be able to go on without the tough bastard from georgia what about bucovin which was the only enemy that mattered to hasso nowadays whats the lord in falticeni like he asked can they find somebody to take over if we get our hands on him hes a grenye nornat said he kind of pretends to be like a lenello king but its just pretend the savages used to think their lords were gods like that was before they found out we knew about the real gods and we could work magic on account of it now the poor stupid bastards dont know what the demon to think his snort held more scorn than sympathy magic here was like gunpowder in america it not only gave the invaders an edge it gave them a big scary edge but the grenye were closer to the lenelli than the american indians had been to the spaniards they knew how to work iron and they had had plenty of real kingdoms of their own if the lenelli had guns as well as wizardry that thought had gone through hassos mind before but it was one for another time another war bottero wouldnt let him fool around with sulfur and saltpeter and charcoal now or stand by while he tried to show local smiths how to make cannon that wouldnt blow up nornat hadnt said anything about whether the bucovinans could get along without their lord that probably meant he didnt know if the grenye had decided their kings werent gods after all they had a better chance of doing without them i hope we get to find out thats all hasso thought the bucovinans hadnt given up they didnt seem afraid of the lenelli either even if they couldnt fully match them the raiding bands they sent out against botteros army got bigger and bolder and slowed the armys advance several times the king had to send reinforcements forward to keep his scouts from getting overwhelmed and in spite of all of hassos magic the rain got worse again he waited for bottero to scream at him to his surprise the king kept quiet velona explained why i reminded him how deep inside bucovin we are we cant expect things like that to go our way here we just have to win anyway maybe the grenye didnt think their rulers were gods any more king bottero had no doubt velona was at least part goddess and that what she said went after some of the things hasso had seen he didnt have many doubts along those lines either and then the rain blew away hasso would have taken credit for it if hed worked a spell any time recently since he hadnt he just accepted it along with the lenelli the weather stayed cool it was november after all or something close to it but it was crisp and sunny the kind of weather that made having seasons worthwhile it seemed as if he could see for a thousand kilometers one of the things he could see was a smudge of smoke on the horizon ahead a smudge big enough to mark a goodsized city or a really big camp is that falticeni he asked velona pointing are we there yet she shook her head i dont think so it looks like the grenye are going to fight us again after all it sure does hasso said it looks like theyre going to throw the whole goddamn world at us too velona looked at that differently well beat them here and they wont be able to stop us again if the goddess said it didnt that make it true xiii no matter what velona or maybe the goddess speaking through her said the bucovinans didnt think they were bound to lose king botteros army found that out midway through the next morning when they came upon their foes drawn up in line of battle ahead of them they pick their ground well anyhow hasso said to orosei trees protected both sides of the enemy line and the field in front of them sloped upward toward their position a few bushes and a lot of calfhigh dead grass covered the field hasso didnt think the grenye could find enough cover there for ambushes even if they do they arent very smart its like i told you look a little to the left of their center the masteratarms didnt point in that direction he didnt want to show the foe hed spotted anything out of the ordinary see that outlander theyve left a gap between a couple of knots of horsemen its not a big gap but we can pour through there hasso finished excitement rising in him orosei nodded a smug grin on his face hed spotted it and hasso damn well hadnt fine then let him take the credit hasso said we need to tell the king the striking column goes in there just what i was thinking orosei agreed theyre standing there waiting for us to hit them arent they you bet they are the lenello said whenever they try to take the lead in a big battle we clobber em even worse than we do this way theyve figured that much out i bet theyre just trying to slow us down waiting for snow to make even more trouble for us i wouldnt be surprised hasso said tactics like that didnt surprise anybody whod won the frozen meat medal hasso and orosei rode over to bottero hasso let the masteratarms take the lead in showing the king the gap in the bucovinan line orosei still didnt point king bottero needed longer to spot the opening than hasso had which made the wehrmacht officer feel good when bottero did a predatory grin spread across his face theyre ours he cried the goddess has delivered them into our hands he sounded like an old testament prophet for a moment that thought cheered hasso then he frowned wondering whether it should after all what were the old testament prophets but a bunch of damn jews hasso hadnt done anything to jews himself not directly but he had no great use for them and hed made sure to look the other way when the ss cleaned them out of polish and russian villages like the priest and the levite hed passed by on the other side of the road well he didnt have to worry about jews here things were simple there was his side and there was the other side and that was it the guys on the other side were feeling pretty cocky too even if the grenye stood on the defensive they waved their weapons and yelled what had to be insults at the oncoming lenelli they wanted botteros men to think they were plenty ready for a fight anyway orosei turned to the king again by your leave your majesty he murmured oh yes bottero said by all means leave for what hasso wondered he understood all the words but still had no idea what was going on he supposed he ought to be glad that didnt happen to him more often here orosei didnt leave him in the dark for long the masteratarms rode out into the open space between the two armies he brandished his lance and shouted in the direction of the bucovinans challenging their champion to come out and meet him in single combat hasso whistled softly there was a grand madness to this war in his own world had lost that personal touch you seldom saw the men you fought you didnt want them to see you either if they did theyd shoot you before you knew they were around this was a different kind of warfare it was personal would any of the bucovinans dare to meet orosei if they were smart from hassos point of view theyd send out half a dozen guys at once and try to finish him off nothing degraded the idea of military honor like years on the russian front but a single lancer rode out from the line waiting ahead the natives cheered him like men possessed he stopped a few meters out in front of them turned in the saddle to wave and then turned back and gave orosei a formal salute damned if the masteratarms didnt return it then they spurred their horses straight at each other riding downhill give the bucovinan a little edge he could go faster and build more momentum if that bothered orosei he didnt let on he bent low over his horses neck his lance aimed straight for his opponents short ribs the other guy was aiming at his too but that didnt faze him a bit from what hasso had seen nothing that had to do with battle fazed orosei clang both lances struck home both riders went off their horses and crashed to the ground and both riders were up with swords drawn faster than their comrades could cheer and groan at the same time as lancers the two champions proved evenly matched as swordsmen orosei towered head and shoulders above his foe who was goodsized for a grenye but nothing much against a big lenello oroseis arm was longer and so was his blade if the bucovinan turned out to be fast as a striking cobra he might have a chance otherwise hasso guessed he was in over his head literally and figuratively and he was he had no quit in him he ran straight at orosei probably figuring his best chance was to get in close and see what he could do iron belled on iron as they hacked away at each other orosei had no trouble holding off the bucovinan champion they were both well armored so getting through with wounds that mattered took a while the one that did the grenye in never got through his mailshirt it didnt matter that stroke had to break ribs even through chainmail and padding the bucovinan staggered back and sagged to one knee he kept on trying to fight though he must have known it was hopeless orosei approached him like a stalking tiger the masteratarms was a professional he didnt take anything for granted sure as hell the grenye jumped up for a last charge with his side so battered though he couldnt use the sword the way he wanted to after a sharp exchange it flew from his hand ha oroseis shout of triumph echoed over the field the bucovinan went to both knees this time and bowed his head how much chivalry was there here would orosei send him back to his own side especially since he couldnt fight in the battle ahead the lenellos sword rose then fell with a flash of sunlight on the blade blood spouted the body convulsed orosei picked up the head by the hair and turned to show it to the enemy still carrying his trophy he went over to his horse which was cropping dead grass not far away the stink of blood made the beast snort and sidestep but he grabbed the reins and swung up into the saddle he rode back toward the lenello line botteros men cheered wildly the bucovinans stood silent as the tomb toss me another lance somebody orosei called as he drew near mine cracked when i hit this bastard he held up the head again use mine king bottero said ill take another one now theyve seen victory will belong to us so may it be velona shouted so may it be the lenelli echoed if the embodiment of their goddess said so they thought it had to be true hasso peered up the slight slope toward the bucovinan line i dont see any striking column there he said to nornat who rode beside him at the head of the one king bottero would hurl against his foes neither do i nornat said they havent put one together yet i guess they copy things from us all the time but they need a while to work out what to do with them and how they go they arent real big and they arent real bright bottero rode out in front of his army not to challenge the enemy as orosei had done but to harangue his own soldiers one more fight boys he said one more fight and then its on to falticeni then we take over bucovin and all the other lenello kings turn green with envy and die and we all get rich and we all get estates and we all get lots of slaves and we all get plenty of pretty grenye women to screw the soldiers cheered like maniacs hasso yelled along with everybody else no german officers speech had ever been so direct but this was what war was all about wasnt it you killed the other guys and you took away what they had whether you talked about estates and slaves and women or about lebensraum it boiled down to the same thing all right then king bottero yelled lets go get em the goddess is with us the goddess is with us the lenelli shouted hasso looked over to velona she blew him a kiss he sent one back to her bottero waved to the trumpeters they blared out the charge the lenelli and hasso set spur to their horses they thundered forward the striking column aimed straight for the little gap orosei had noted in the bucovinan line break through there and theyd cut the enemy army in half while bottero heartened his men some bucovinan bigwig or another was doing the same with the small swarthy natives theyd shouted too but the lusty cheers of the lenelli all but drowned them out as hasso galloped toward the bucovinans battle line he knew the same feeling of invincibility of playing on the winning team hed felt in france in and in russia in the summer of once hed been dead right to feel that way once to his surprise the waiting bucovinans just held their ground they didnt gallop forward to meet the lenelli with impetus of their own the way they had the first time the armies met that went dead against everything he thought hed learned about cavalry are they going to stand there and take a charge he shouted to nornat trying to pitch his voice to carry through the drumroll of hoofbeats all around them looks that way the cursed fools the lenello answered they should have found out they couldnt do that a hundred years ago well if they need a fresh lesson well give em one below the bar nasal of his helmet his lips skinned back in a predatory grin closer closer along with the thuds of the horses hooves the lenelli were howling like wolves both to nerve themselves for the collision and to scare the living piss out of the bucovinans would the natives break and run if this kind of charge were bearing down on hasso he knew damn well he would think hard about running himself here and there along the enemy line archers started shooting at botteros soldiers beside hasso nornat laughed what had to be the most scornful laugh the german had ever heard do they think theyll even slow us down like that he said one or two riders clutched at themselves and slid from the saddle one or two horses crashed to the ground one or two more fell over them spilling their riders the rest of the charge rolled on bucovinan foot soldiers set themselves spears thrust forward in a forest of iron points to withstand the oncoming lancers did they really believe they could make the lenelli stop that way could they possibly be so stupid hasso had trouble believing it for a moment he simply accepted that all right he had trouble believing the bucovinans could be so stupid then what only at that point did alarm bells start clanging in his mind the natives had to know the lenelli thought they were stupid and inept if they could play on that take advantage of it somethings wrong hasso shouted to nornat theyre trying to fool us what nornat yelled back before hasso could say it again the first lenello horses fell into the lovingly concealed pits the bucovinans had dug in front of their line the horses screamed so did the men on top of them hasso and nornat werent in the very first rank of the charge anymore men on swifter horses had got a little ways ahead of them but they were close too close hasso reined in frantically his horse saw the danger too and tried to swerve but it was too near the edge in it went in and down hasso wasnt ashamed to scream either then another falling horses hoof caught him in the side of the head blackness swooped down on him how the fight went from there he had no idea he came back to himself a little at a time he was hearing things before he realized he was hearing them he thought he made out words but he didnt understand any of them had whatever happened to him he didnt remember what it was not yet scrambled his wits for fair lenello he had to think of lenello not just german he felt more than a little pride at recalling that but it didnt help he thought he could understand lenello if he heard it whatever this was it wasnt lenello he felt as if hed been dropped on his head from about five kilometers up concussion he thought dully hed had a couple facing the russians those damn katyushas could pick you up and throw you around like nobodys business he didnt think hed ever had a headache like this one though he didnt want to open his eyes he feared his head would fall off if he did this was much much worse than any hangover hed ever known and he was afraid to open them for another reason he feared he might not see anything at all or might see only hellfire he wasnt a hundred percent sure he was alive and when he forced himself to pull his eyelids apart what he did see made him wonder and made him even more afraid darkness shot through by the flickering flames of torches if this wasnt hell what was it were those demons gabbing not nearly far enough away what language did demons speak hebrew maybe that was the scariest thought yet but when hasso sucked in a big breath of air that might have come out as a shriek he calmed down instead of turning it loose he smelled blood and shit and horses and unwashed men that was the smell of a battlefield not of the infernal regions then he remembered charging forward with the lenelli he remembered going into the pit good god he said those little bastards did fool us the bucovinans must have won their battle too because those sure werent lenelli prowling through the pits right now what happened to orosei and to nornat and to king bottero sweet suffering jesus what happened to velona sweet suffering jesus whats going to happen to me a couple of torches were coming closer the figures they illuminated werent redfaced demons with horns and spiked tails they were bucovinans in tunics and baggy trousers and calfhigh boots that wasnt necessarily reassuring the little swarthy men carried the torches upraised in their left hands and long knives dripping blood in their right one of them stooped to cut a horses throat the beast sighed almost as a man might have and died a moment later the other one stooped too only the throat he cut belonged to a lenello the mans dying sound was on a slightly higher note than the horses they were getting closer hasso thought about fighting them for about a second and a half the way he felt he couldnt have fought off a puppy that wanted to lick his face he wasnt even sure he could twist free of the dead horses that squeezed him luckily without quite squashing him what would they do if he played dead out of barely open eyes he watched them finish another lenello chances were theyd slit his throat on general principles that seemed to be what they were here for could he surrender he hadnt wanted to give up to the ivans for fear of what they did to prisoners and because of all he knew about what the wehrmacht did to russian pows he knew some of the charming things the lenelli did to bucovinans they caught how did lord zgomots men return the favor do i want to find out if he wanted to keep breathing he did the bucovinans working their way through the pit killed another lenello they werent especially malicious about it which didnt mean they hesitated and they were getting awful goddamn close now what have i got to lose hasso thought if i just lie here theyll cut me a new grin any minute now the best defense is a good offense i hope please jesus do you speak lenello he asked croaked really the little men started violently one of them said something that had to be cussing they both came toward him he didnt like the smiles on their faces maybe just getting his throat cut was the best he could have hoped for at least it was over in a hurry then so many other interesting possibilities interesting right i speak your language man out of the western sea answered the native who hadnt sworn he spoke it better than hasso did which still wasnt saying much tell me your name so my gods can spit on it when they bury you in dung in the world to come he plainly still believed in their oldtime religion even if the lenello goddess had given some grenye different ideas and he wanted to use hassos name to curse him the wehrmacht officer might have lied if hed thought a grenye curse would bite he was sure he would have lied to aderno but he was also sure the natives couldnt work that kind of magic and so he gave the fellow the truth i call myself hasso pemsel it didnt mean anything to the one whod asked for his name the other one though said something else incendiary in his own guttural language the two of them palavered waving their arms and those damn snickersnees finally the one who admitted to speaking lenello came back to that language we have orders to take you alive if we can do you yield yourself to us do i have a choice hasso asked you always have a choice the bucovinan answered you can yield or you can die right now what happens if i yield whatever we want the native wasnt helping but then he didnt have to hasso sighed i yield his head hurt too much for him to argue he tried to twist out from between the dead horses and discovered he couldnt he couldnt have put up a fight even if hed wanted to help me out please the bucovinan laughed none too pleasantly now i know you are the stranger we want no lenello would ever say please not to the likes of us resentment hatred simmered in his voice he went back and forth with his buddy in their language the other man gestured a fierce warning with his knife before going over to hasso they didnt believe in taking chances in their boots hasso wouldnt have either he took the grenyes hand grunting the native put his shoulder against the corpse of the horse pinning hassos legs and shoved with some help from the native hasso managed to wriggle free he discovered he couldnt have run either his legs were asleep though small the local was strong he dragged hasso out of the pit and laid him on the ground there he relieved him of his belt knife the other bucovinan the one who spoke lenello came over and peered down at him you have a holdout weapon the fellow asked adding if you say no and we find it you wont like that i promise my left boot hasso said and under my left arm they took the knives youre full of tricks arent you the one who spoke lenello remarked oh yes what am i doing here then hasso said with a bitter laugh breathing the bucovinan replied which echoed hassos own thoughts much too closely you want to keep doing it he didnt wait for an answer but nudged hasso in the ribs with a boot can you stand up now i think so the german sandbagged a little he wanted to seem weaker and more harmless than he was but he would have swayed on his pins any which way the bucovinans didnt instantly shove him into motion more teams of little swarthy men with torches were moving over the battlefield in the pits theyd dug and around them every so often a native would stoop and that presumably would be that for some luckless lenello do you uh did you get the king hasso asked no curse it the grenye sounded unmistakably disgusted he fought his way clear but he wont be going forward any more by lavtrig he and the other bucovinan swirled their torches clockwise when he named the deity the rest of you big blond bastards wont either im not one of those big blond bastards hasso thought but he was blond and he was big by grenye standards and hed fought for king bottero keeping his mouth shut looked like a real good idea keeping his mouth shut about that did anyhow he couldnt help asking what about velona who the native who spoke lenello gave him a blank look the goddess hasso said oh her the bucovinan spoke to his buddy they both swirled their torches again this time counterclockwise what was that supposed to mean reverence fear warding all of the above the native went on no we werent too sorry when she got away if we could have killed her fine but how would we keep her prisoner it would be like keeping the sun in a roomful of kindling he wasnt far wrong not from what hasso knew of velona no god or goddess possessed him but he was a wizard of sorts maybe that would do him some good maybe the land here wouldnt let him work magic hed have to see come on the native shoved him move hasso moved slowly but he moved they fed him they gave him something that tasted like beer brewed from rye which was just about as bad as that sounded the native who spoke lenello stuck with him as they took him to falticeni hasso found out the fellows name was rautat and that hed worked in drammen for several years before going home to bucovin why did you go hasso asked why did you come back i had to see the bucovinan answered they were standing next to a couple of trees by the side of the road easing themselves three soldiers in leather jerkins aimed arrows at hassos kidneys in case he tried to get away the persuasion worked remarkably well yes i had to see rautat repeated as he laced up his trousers you lenelli can do all kinds of things we dont know how to do you can make all kinds of things we dont know how to make i worked for a smith i wasnt even a prentice i pumped the bellows i carried things i banged with a hammer and i watched my uncle is a smith so i knew something about it the way we do it anyhow now i know a lot of your tricks too and i use them and i teach them to other people who want to learn them other grenye i mean my people he jabbed a forefinger at his own chest you were a spy hasso realized buttoning his own fly rautat watched that with interest he watched everything hasso did with interest the lenelli didnt use a fly fastening hasso had on his old wehrmacht trousers as they stepped away from the trees the german nodded to himself rautat had been just as much a spy as an abwehr agent who tried to steal the secrets of some fancy new british steelmanufacturing process the only difference was the lenelli didnt seem to know their processes were worth guarding and i didnt think of it either he reminded himself as he swung up onto the scrubby little horse they were letting him ride he muttered angrily in german hed been botteros spymaster and hed been better at the job than any lenello ever born but he hadnt been good enough how many just like rautat were there in all the lenello kingdoms hundreds thousands what is that tongue you used its not lenello rautat said how many of those grenye were as sharp as he was probably very few no its my own language hasso answered im not a lenello you look like one rautat told him hasso shrugged the dark little man plucked at his curly beard you dont sound like one i will say he took a scrap of parchment a reed pen and a little clay flask of ink from a belt pouch and scribbled a note to himself seeing hassos eyes on him he said i learned your letters when i was in drammen too we mostly use them now yes i know that hasso said the crude warning the bucovinans posted had used lenello characters and indeed the lenello language we had writing of our own before you big blond bastards came rautat sounded like a man anxious to prove he wasnt a savage and half afraid he was in spite of everything your way is a lot quicker to pick up though its mostly the priests who still write the old characters they take years to learn and who else has the time how had the natives written in the old days hieroglyphics things like chinese characters some slow clumsy cumbersome system anyhow one of these days chances were even the priests wouldnt use it any more and then who would be able to read the accumulated wisdom of bucovin assuming there was any rautat cocked his head to one side and eyed hasso like a curious sparrow so youre not a lenello eh where are you from then some other kingdom across the sea i suppose no farther away than that hasso told how hed come to this world what would the bucovinan make of it hasso knew what a german feldwebel for he took rautat to be a top sergeant more or less would have made of it even if the fellow had worked in cleveland for a while the feld would have laughed his ass off and said bullshit hearing a story like that hasso would have said the same thing himself but this was a different place rautat frowned it wasnt that he disbelieved he was trying to figure out how the pieces fit together well hasso had been doing that ever since he splashed down into the marsh he didnt have all the answers yet and he would have bet anything that rautat wouldnt either the native pointed at him so youre the whoreson who spat thunder and lightning at us in the first big battle thats why we worked so hard to find your name ja thats me hasso said and then ja means yes no wonder they want you in falticeni rautat said can you do that some more no my weapon needs cartridges again a word came out in german it had to they come with me from my world the lenelli know more tricks of making things than you people do yes well the folk of my world know more than the lenelli do the lenelli cant make these cartridges no one here can ah as a wily feldwebel would rautat had a good poker face he sounded almost artistically casual as he asked can you teach us any of what you know and the lenelli dont i dont know hasso answered trying to keep worry out of his own voice im not sure he could show the natives this and that he could show them most of the same things he would have shown to bottero and velona he could yes but should he he knew what he thought of field marshal paulus whod surrendered to the russians at stalingrad and then got on the radio for them telling the germans they couldnt win and had better give up while they still had the chance maybe paulus did persuade a few landsers to desert to hasso and the rest though he was nothing but a goddamn traitor of course maybe the nkvd held paulus feet to the fire before he started broadcasting and maybe the bucovinans will hold my feet to the fire what do i do then hasso had an iron cross first class if youd lived through the whole war it was hard not to have one hed been put up for the knights cross but it didnt go through for some dumb reason or another he didnt much care hed never thought of himself as heroic he wanted to live would he have plomped his butt down on the omphalos stone if he were bound and determined to die for the vaterlandl he also wanted to be able to go on looking at himself in the mirror even if mirrors in this world were sorry things of polished bronze hed taken service with bottero who could have carved a stranger into strips and fed him to his hounds and hed fallen in love with velona even if the word scared him and her both if any place in this world was botteros kingdom was his country now ill escape if i can hasso told himself even under the geneva convention thats my duty the ivans hadnt signed the geneva convention the lenelli and the bucovinans had never heard of it never even imagined it rautat took out a little knife and started cleaning under his nails with the tip the watery lateautumn sun flashed off the sharp edge what else could that knife do anything the bastard holding it wanted it to that was what the day wasnt too cold hasso shivered anyway he wasnt the only captive heading back to falticeni every so often he passed other big blond men on the road with large guard contingents they traveled on foot in small groups hands tied behind them and left legs bound one to another they eyed him as he rode past rautat wouldnt let him talk with them he didnt suppose he could blame the bucovinan things being as they were what do you do with these men he asked after his mounted party went by another group of lenello prisoners use them rautat answered they work for us they teach us things if they settle down and behave they live better with us than they would in their own kingdom at the price of exile of course still when the other choice was getting your throat cut or worse but hasso also remembered scanno who even in drammen preferred the company of grenye to his own folk scanno wouldnt be the only lenello who thought that way either there might not be many but there were bound to be some and hasso also thought about japan after the western powers made it open up in the nineteenth century what did the world look like to the japanese then the little yellow men had to acquire all the skills they lacked and in a hurry too or else go under like the indians and africans and they did it they smashed the russians in which made hasso jealous and they were giving the americans all they wanted now the grenye of bucovin were in the same boat but the japanese could acquire all the tricks the americans and british and russians and french and germans knew the grenye found themselves behind the eightball in a way the japanese didnt have you got any lenello wizards in falticeni hasso asked not least to see if he could make rautat twitch he didnt the native just shook his head not right now for us wizards are like holding a sword by the blade we can cut ourselves not just the enemy somebody who can make spells is liable to try to rule us not to do what we want its happened before obviously it hadnt worked how do you how did you stop that hasso inquired genuinely curious rautat shrugged we killed them not easy not cheap but we did it even a wizard has to sleep some of the time er right hasso said the man who would be king hed read the kipling tale in translation didnt have an easy time of it no matter who the natives were one of you lots of them as long as they dont believe youre a god they can get you and even if they start out thinking you are pretty soon theyll change their minds what can you do for us rautat asked dont know yet hasso answered uncomfortably i need to see what you can already do before i say rautat grunted and left it there that was a relief if the natives decided hasso couldnt do anything useful wouldnt they just knock him over the head but if he did show them things he knew about gunpowder say hed betray bottero and velona he had to think their meeting on the causeway meant something for him for her for the lenelli for this whole world could he turn his back on that and help these swarthy little bastards against the folk who were bringing civilization kultur to this whole continent how if he wanted to be able to live with himself afterwards well if he didnt give the bucovinans a hand odds were he wouldnt live with himself afterwards for very long smoke smudged the horizon to the northeast pointing to it he asked is that falticeni if he thought about the landscape he wouldnt have to worry about himself not so much anyway that is falticeni rautat said proudly soon you will see it with your own eyes you will not king bottero he runs away like a beaten dog back in after the wehrmachts drive on moscow faltered in the face of blizzards and siberian troops and the men and panzers had to fall back the russians jeered about winter fritz a poor freezing starveling who was hardly worth the effort it took to shoot him rautat naturally had never heard of winter fritz but he got the idea all the same hassos escort stopped at a farmhouse a few kilometers outside of town the farmer turned out to speak a little lenello hed never been to drammen but hed visited castle svarag closer to the border he gave hasso a bowl of stewed turnips and cheese a chunk of black bread and a mug of rye beer it wasnt wonderful but it filled the belly and it was no worse than what his family ate at rautats order hasso slept in the farmhouse that wasnt for the sake of comfort but to make it harder for him to get away the farmer and his wife and sons and daughters all snored hasso might have stayed awake an extra fifteen seconds because of it maybe even thirty breakfast the next morning was the same as supper had been and after breakfast it was on to falticeni xiv something old something new something borrowed something blue hasso had heard that somewhere but damned if he could remember where his first good look at falticeni even before he got inside the town called the jingle to mind again the lower courses of stonework on the walls of bucovins capital looked half as old as time the stones werent shaped into neat square blocks the idea didnt seem to have crossed the minds of the grenye whod put them there the big gray masses of granite or whatever the rock was had just been trimmed to fit together and they did despite the lichen and moss that had been growing on them for god only knew how many years they looked sturdy and solid then suddenly the wall got five or six meters taller these stones were squared off they looked much like the ones that formed the walls around drammen and other towns in botteros kingdom plainly the bucovinans had realized the wall they had wasnt good enough to keep lenelli out just as plainly theyd learned from the men from overseas that squarish stones were a lot easier to handle than ones left in their original shapes and the towers that projected out from the wall might have been copied straight from lenello fortifications they gave defenders more places from which to shoot at attackers and to drop heavy things or hot things or pointed things on their unfortunate heads even the crenelated battlements were lifted from works farther west the soldiers pacing those battlements though were indubitably bucovinans it is a great city yes rautat said proudly it is a great city yes hasso made it a point never to disagree with anybody who could order him chopped into cats meat it certainly was a big city anyway to his surprise it looked at least twice the size of king botteros capital its entryway boasted a stout iron portcullis like the towers that was an obviously modern addition like all the entryways hasso had seen here and like all the ones hed seen at castles in europe falticenis had a dogleg to the right that made attackers trying to swarm through expose their left sides the side on which their hearts lay to whatever the defenders could do to them hasso glanced up no murder hole in the ceiling the natives hadnt thought of such a thing when the entryway was built and excavating one out of solid stone would have been too much work he couldnt deny the position was plenty strong without one had botteros army reached falticeni it wouldnt have had such an easy time breaking in rautat and the other bucovinans escorting hasso went back and forth with the guards at the entryway the wehrmacht officer understood not a word of what they said their language of course was no more related to lenello than cherokee was to english he sighed mournfully just when he started getting fluent he had to start over yes some of these people spoke lenello some russians spoke german too that didnt mean they enjoyed doing it rautat pointed to him and gave a pretty good impression of a schmeisser going off hes the guy or maybe hes the son of a bitch with the thunderstick hasso could guess what the commentary meant even if he didnt know words or grammar the gate guards looked and sounded suitably impressed sure they were natives but they were also people he could read their expressions and their tone of voice and a whole fat lot of good that may do me too i take you to the palace rautat told him the lord will want to talk to you hasso made himself nod made himself seem calm but do i want to talk to him that would have been funny if only it were funny do i have a choice he had the choice the native named when capturing him he could die he didnt want to do that of course the bucovinans hadnt got to work on him yet either the guards stepped aside waving hasso and his escorts around the last kink in the entryway and into falticeni not without pride rautat gave a wave of his own this is our city he said at first it looked a lot like the grenye districts in drammen streets were narrow and winding and muddy and they stank most of the houses and shops hasso could see were of wattle and daub with thatched roofs big ones sat next to small ones with no order hasso could find none seemed to be more than two stories high that meant hasso could see what had to be the royal palace in the middle of town as the reconstructed wall aped lenello fortifications so the palace imitated lenello castles even the red clay semicylindrical roof tiles copied the ones the lenelli used the local lord might have been saying see all the modern conveniences we can do this stuff too getting there was less than half the fun nobody already in the streets wanted to let newcomers by scrawny dogs yapped and snarled and made as if to bite the horses fetlocks scrawny children of all sizes from toddlers on up raced around like maniacs some wailing others yelling at the top of their lungs a few paused to stare at the spectacle of a big blond captive going through their streets hasso didnt think the things they shouted were endearments one kid bent to scoop up a handful of mud or maybe manure and throw it at him hasso ducked the stuff flew over his head and splatted against a wall across the street rautat yelled at the kid the brat bent over and showed off his bare backside which was as skinny as the rest of him rautat made as if to kick it he couldnt come close not without dismounting the kid scampered off thanks hasso said oh i didnt do it for you the bucovinan replied i just want to make sure youre in one piece when i deliver you so they can get the answers they need youre nothing to me but an interesting piece of meat that was daunting but if hasso werent an interesting piece of meat rautat would have slit his throat and gone on to the next one in the pit well thanks anyhow hasso said rautat gave him a long look youve got nerve anyway he said grudgingly hasso shrugged big deal you talk like a soldier the native remarked i am i was a soldier before i came here in a bigger war than this world ever saw hasso answered the tools of the trade were different the life isnt not very much outside a tavern a drunk in ragged clothes sprawled in the street snoring a jug clutched tight to his chest hasso could have seen hell he had seen the like in any number of russian villages and yes in some german ones as well people were people in his own world or here lenelli or grenye rautat scowled at the sot and rode a little faster to get by him hasso hid a smile the native was selfconscious about his folks shortcomings as almost anyone from any folk would have been they rode past a brothel too with a couple of naked women displaying themselves in secondstory windows hasso thought they were more likely to catch pneumonia than customers they gaped at him for a moment startled out of their cockedhip bosomthrusting poses one of them called something to rautat he laughed and shook his head turning to hasso he said she wants to know if youre really big hasso was made like a man he said but you think all lenelli are big pricks the joke worked in lenello the same as it did in german odds were it worked in most languages rautat laughed and laughed youre a funny fellow all right pretty soon youll find out whether it does you any good ja hasso didnt like the sound of that in drammen the lenello nobles had their fine houses in the center of town near the royal palace broad lawns separated those mansions from the streets and from the lesser dwellings of hoi polloi again the bucovinans imitated the newcomers to a point their prominent people did have large houses sometimes the buildings even had stone ground floors but the second story was invariably timber or wattle and daub and almost all the roofs were thatched only a handful had tiles like the palace almost all of them though had a garden rather than a lawn or if they did have grass a cow or a couple of sheep grazed on it under a herdsmans watchful eyes the idea of bare ground for the sake of decoration or swank didnt seem to have got here from the west a plump man in a tunic with extrafancy embroidery took a chicken from someone who looked poorer than he was he wrung the chickens neck and cast the carcass onto a brazier heaped high with glowing charcoal whats he doing hasso asked hes a priest making a thanksoffering or a sinoffering for that fellow rautat gave him a curious look dont your priests do that hasso thought of the last wehrmacht chaplain hed talked to a dour lutheran who didnt even smoke and once again the longing for a cigarette sneaked up and bit him in the ass he tried to imagine klaus frisch sacrificing a chicken to propitiate an angry jehovah well he said no how do you know your gods pay any attention to you then rautat persisted good question hasso said and then counterattacking how do you know your gods do why dont you follow the goddess even riding through the streets of his own capital with the wehrmacht officer a helpless prisoner rautat looked scared shitless the goddess hears lenelli first he said she wouldnt listen to the likes of me from what hasso had seen that might well be true and yet plenty of grenye in king botteros realm worship her the most scornful majordomo in two worlds couldnt have let out a sniffier sniff than rautats there are grenye who want to be lenelli he saidi dont thank you very much he spoke fluent lenello he wore lenellostyle armor his city had lenellostyle fortifications grafted onto its older works his sovereigns palace even had lenellostyle roof tiles and he said he didnt want to be a lenello well maybe he didnt the japanese wore westernstyle clothes they had westernstyle industries and a westernstyle military too but did they want to turn into americans or englishmen or germans hasso didnt think so they used western techniques to let them stay what they already were japanese maybe the bucovinans could pull off the same stunt here but if they couldnt work magic and the lenelli damn well could the odds were against them still affronted rautat went on besides who knows what mongrel clans those grenye come from were better people than that we are once more hasso carefully didnt smile had the plains indians looked down their noses like that at the coastal indians who quickly succumbed to the english colonizers they probably had till it was their turn when hasso got a close look at lord zgomots palace he decided he wouldnt want to try to take it without heavy artillery yes maybe bottero was lucky he didnt make it to falticeni he might have thrown away a lot more men here than he did in the lost battle or the goddess might have manifested herself through velona and knocked the capital of bucovin flat if you had magic if the gods really did take part in what happened on earth maybe you didnt need s and s after all joshua knocked down jerichos walls without them every time hasso thought about anybody from the old testament he started to look around nervously no dummy he thought nobody from the gestapos going to haul you away not here you can let a jew cross your mind every now and then rautat shouted to the sentries in their own language they yelled back hasso couldnt understand a word of it his mind went back to wandering if the goddess could come through here why didnt she do it a long time ago the land fights for them velona wasnt the only one whod said it what did it mean it wasnt magic the lenelli insisted on that but it was something one of the guards yelled some more and gestured rautat and the other bucovinan soldiers dismounted a moment later hasso did the same grooms came out to take charge of the horses hassos captors escorted him into the palace the palace was gloomy it was drafty it didnt smell very good of course you could have said the same things about king botteros establishment everything here though seemed just a little worse a little sloppier than it had back in drammen and hasso found one danger here that he hadnt had to worry about there doorways lots of lenelli were taller than he was their lintels were high the bucovinans on the other hand mostly came up to his chin and he banged his forehead twice in quick succession before realizing he had to watch and duck every goddamn time getting one no two right above the eyes did nothing for the headaches that still plagued him he wished his head would come off inconsiderate thing that it was it stayed attached and hurt rautat spoke with a court official whose spiffy embroidery probably meant he was a big wheel the fellow with the gaudy tunic looked hasso over him his glance said well hasso didnt think he cut a very fancy figure just then either the palace functionary asked rautat a couple of questions hassos captor answered with emphasis jabbing a forefinger at the other mans chest with a sigh the official yielded he said something to hasso in bucovinan i am sorry i do not speak your language hasso answered in lenello he wasnt astonished when the native turned out to know that tongue come with me the fellow said your name is on a list lord zgomot wanted to see certain folk if we captured them here you are so he will see you here i am hasso agreed so mournfully that rautat laughed and the court official smiled a most unpleasant smile they led him down a hallway decorated with art of a sort he didnt think hed ever seen before for lack of a better name he thought of the pieces as feather paintings some of them were quite realistic others bands or swirling lines of color they must have taken enormous labor to create first in finding the feathers and then in arranging them nice work hasso pointed at one a picture of the palace done all in feathers very pretty rautat and the functionary both stared at him then started to laugh by lavtrig now i know youre no ordinary big blond bastard they all think featherwork is stupid and ugly and foolish because they dont do it themselves rautat said he spoke in bucovinan to the soldiers escorting the wehrmacht officer they gaped at hasso too hasso couldnt remember any lenelli ever talking about featherwork it really must have been beneath their notice he wondered why it sure looked good to him then they led him past what he first took to be a small elephants tusk but it was shaped more like a sword blade and had a formidable point on the end what is that what beast does it come from he asked a dragon rautat answered matteroffactly that is the greatest fang of the dragon of mizil which we slew when bucovin was young his bones lie under the walls of falticeni and under the palace here a dragon what does a dragon look like hasso asked they went on a little farther then the court functionary pointed to a big featherwork on the wall behold the dragon of mizil he said hasso beheld it he wondered from which birds the natives had got those iridescent green and bronze feathers or the yellow and orange and red ones that showed the fire it breathed he also wondered whether the artists had actually seen the dragon or limned it from the stories of those who came before them and he wondered how do you kill something like that together rautat and the court official burst into something between verse and song after a moment the rest of hassos guards joined in germans might have launched into deutschland uber alles or the ode to joy with as much ease and as little selfconsciousness everybody in falticeni had to know the story of the dragon of mizil everybody but me hasso thought and he didnt understand a word of bucovinan can you translate please he said to his surprise rautat shook his head not this the soldier answered this is ours this is special this is not for lenello dogfeet he must have translated one of his own words literally for he corrected himself a moment later scoundrels the palace flunky nodded agreement hasso only shrugged he was in no position to argue with them they hadnt killed him except for when he went into the pit they hadnt even hurt him yet all things considered he had to figure he was ahead of the game they turned a last corner there was the throne room there on what looked like a diningroom chair wrapped in gold leaf sat lord zgomot the court official poked hasso in the ribs with an elbow bow he said again hasso was in no position to argue bow he did as he straightened he sized up the ruler of bucovin king bottero had put him in mind of hermann goring goring the way he had been before defeat and drugs diminished him big bold swaggering flamboyant enjoying to the hilt the power that had landed in his lap zgomot by contrast wore a mink coat that would have made marlene dietrich jealous but still looked like nothing so much as the druggist in a small romanian town he was small himself and skinny with a pinched face a beak of a nose and a black beard streaked with gray his eyebrows were thick and black too and almost met in the middle the dark eyes under them though seemed disconcertingly shrewd he was taking hassos measure as hasso studied him so you are the strange one the one from nowhere of whom we have heard unlike rautats or the functionarys zgomots lenello was almost perfect the only hint that he wasnt a native speaker was the extremely precise way in which he expressed himself he wasnt at ease in the language as bottero or velona or orosei would have been poor orosei hasso thought he was glad the king and the goddess the king and his lover had got away he wished like hell hed got away himself but he damn well hadnt and now he had to deal with this native who was no doubt trying to figure out how to deal with him yes lord he said he was who zgomot claimed he was the lord of bucovin pursed his lips he didnt look like a happy man the way bottero usually did he had the air of someone whose stomach pained him are you as dangerous as people say you are he asked i dont know your majesty how dangerous do people say i am hasso answered dont you be insolent the palace official snapped he is not being insolent zgomot said most people never know what others say about them behind their back so there hasso thought he got the idea lying to zgomot wouldnt be smart not if you had any chance of getting caught later on lord i dont know how dangerous i am after i come here i try to serve king bottero as best i can thats all he said you had the thunder weapon yes zgomot said you almost killed me with it in the first fight yes yes hasso admitted and youre the one who came up with the column to strike with yes the lord of bucovin persisted yes hasso said again wondering if he was cooking his own goose then youre dangerous zgomot spoke in tones that brooked no contradiction he eyed hasso if youd come here to this place in bucovin instead of where you did would you have served me as best you could instead of that big pig of a bottero you wouldnt have had velona to persuade me persuade ha thats a word but if id come down by falticeni i wouldnt have known anything about velona and what a shame that would have been the thoughts flickered through hassos mind in a fraction of a second i dont know lord probably he replied aloud unless your people kill me for being a lenello i mean chance you take when youre big and blond zgomot observed his smile thin to the point of starvation how big an inferiority complex did the grenye carry how could you blame them if it was about the size of the dragon whose fang they so proudly displayed the lord of bucovin went on since you are here now will you serve me the way you served bottero even though he didnt deserve you this time hasso didnt answer right away the easiest thing to do was say yes and then do his best to get away or minimize his contributions but he remembered again what he thought of field marshal paulus and he knew what wehrmacht troops thought of the russians who fought for the reich you might use them you might use them up but youd never ever trust them slowly he said lord i am king botteros sworn man how can i serve his enemy he wondered if hed just written his own obituary a good many lenelli have no trouble at all zgomots voice was dryer than a sandstorm in the sahara we do keep an eye on them but theyre mostly so happy to stay alive that they show us whatever they can weve learned a lot from them would you let one of them do anything really important hasso asked now the lord of bucovin hesitated mm maybe not he said at last then maybe you understand sir king bottero lets me do those things you dont you wont you wouldnt suppose your other choice is the chopper suppose it is hasso hoped he sounded more nonchalant and less frightened than he felt how do you trust anything you chop out of me oh we have ways that wasnt the lord of bucovin that was rautat the practical noncom he sounded very sure of himself and probably with good reason zgomot said something in bucovinan rautat answered in the same language hasso didnt like it when people hashed out his fate in a tongue he couldnt understand who would have well nothing is going to happen right away zgomot said returning to lenello maybe we can show you you made a mistake taking service with bottero or maybe if we decide youre too dangerous to keep alive well have to kill you to make sure you dont go back well just have to see whatever you say lord at least its not the chopper right away whatever i say zgomots laugh was hardly more than a token effort well stranger youve never ruled have you prison it was about the most hasso could have expected but it was nothing to get excited about he had a room with a window much too narrow to give him any chance to escape through it he had a cot and a slops bucket the bucket did boast a cover for such refinements he was grateful the door was too sturdy to break down the bar was on the outside guards always stood in the corridor he could hear them talking every now and again they fed him twice a day the food wasnt especially good but there was plenty of it he didnt need to worry about going hungry and by the way soldiers with swords and bows glowered at him whenever the door opened to admit the servant with the tray he didnt need to worry about escaping either he wasnt going anywhere till zgomot decided to let him out he didnt have a torch or a lamp when the sun went down which it did very early at this time of year he sat and lay in darkness till at last it rose again grimly he made the most of the few light hours he did pushups and situps and other calisthenics he ran in place he paced around and around the cell which was about three meters square hed got used to short days and long nights in russia this wasnt as bad as that they didnt give him a brazier but he had plenty of blankets and it wasnt as cold here as it had been there nowhere close after hed been in there for eight days he thought it was eight but it could have been seven or nine the door opened at an unexpected time ice ran through him he knew enough about being a prisoner to suspect any change in routine was this the day when theyd sacrifice him to the great god mumbojumbo er lavtrig in walked the usual guards with the usual cutlery in with them walked someone else she couldnt have been much more than a meter and a half tall she didnt come up to the top of hassos shoulder but she carried herself like a queen no more like a dancer with a straight back and long graceful strides that made her skirt swirl around her ankles as if she belonged to a flamenco troupe you are the man from a far land who took service with bottero she said in a clear contralto her accent was much better than hassos it might even have been better than lord zgomots she lacked the fussy precision that informed his speech thats right hasso nodded who are you my name is drepteaza she made four syllables of it she waited hasso repeated the name she corrected him he tried again she nodded thats close enough she said i am here to teach you to talk like a human being that was how it came out in lenello in spite of everything hasso smiled what am i doing now talking like a western wolf drepteaza answered seriously the bucovinans loved the lenelli no more than the lenelli cared for them up till now hasso hadnt had to worry about that any more than hed worried about what jews felt about germans that would only have mattered to him if hed got captured by a band of jewish partisans now in effect he had been and what the natives felt about the lenelli and about one hasso pemsel could literally be a matter of life and death he bowed to drepteaza i am at your service my lady you are a prettier teacher than rautat would be thats for sure and so she was she was probably somewhere between twentyfive and thirty with strong cheekbones fine dark eyes and an elegant blade of a nose he would have bet she had a nice shape under that baggy tunic and skirt though maybe her elegant gait was what made him think so she looked at him with as much warmth as if hed got poured out of the slops bucket so much for flattery hasso thought one of the guards turned out to understand lenello hefting his sword he growled watch your mouth with the holy priestess sorry hasso said maybe ninety seconds after meeting a goddess hed started screwing her brains out plainly the bucovinans did things differently hasso bowed to drepteaza again this time in apology he told her sorry too and hoped she believed he was sincere i suppose you meant no harm she said but murmansk winter still chilled her voice to be sorry in our language is intristare she waited as she had before he said the word she corrected him he tried again the s was a long hiss the r closer to a french than a german one but not quite like that either she corrected him once more at least she didnt expect him to get it right away he gave it another try she nodded satisfied at last how do you say i am sorry he asked she told him before he could try it she added that is how a man says it the form for a woman is hasso winced and hoped it didnt show somebodyd told him polish had masculine and feminine verb forms to him that proved it wasnt a civilized language oh well he thought he repeated the masculine form as well as he remembered it this time drepteaza nodded right away hasso felt absurdly pleased with himself as if he were a dog that had won a scrap of meat for a trick then the guard said you better learn that one you need it a lot you he said something in bucovinan that the priestess didnt translate hasso doubted it was an endearment she taught him a few more words he asked may i have pen and parchment please to write them down she raised a dark eyebrow the lenelli taught you their letters yes but i have my own letters before i probably use those i am more used to them your own letters drepteaza murmured i had not thought of that but you are supposed to know all sorts of curious things arent you yes you may have parchment and pen and ink i dont think you can use them to get away neither do i hasso said i wish i did the guard who spoke lenello chuckled drepteaza didnt she was a hard sell but she did unbend enough to speak to the guards in bucovinan one of them touched a bent forefinger to his forehead the salute wasnt in the least military but was respectful the guard hurried away he came back a few minutes later with writing supplies drepteaza taught hasso their names in her language he wrote them down drepteaza looked at the way he did it that is not lenello she said is it your script ja he said absently and then yes is it easier to learn than lenello he had to think about that about the same i suppose lenello has more characters but that is good and bad each sound has its own characters with lenello with my writing you need more than one letter for some sounds he showed her some examples sch and ei and ch she caught on fast better to stick with lenello writing she said after some thought of her own then we can still read what the blonds do that make sense hasso agreed say the words you know write them too drepteaza told him she had to remind him of some hed forgotten he was just glad she didnt punish him for forgetting she said memorize what you know i will come back we will go on from there do we have a bargain do i have a choice he asked as rautat had she said there is always a choice do i have a choice besides dying right away if you dont care to learn our tongue and show us some of what you know lord zgomot will decide youre more trouble than youre worth hell probably kill you to make sure you dont go back to the lenelli and their goddess was that scorn or fear in drepteazas voice or maybe both at once and did she know about him and velona he wouldnt have thought so till this moment she resumed he may just break your legs so you cant escape is that better or worse i dont know its pretty bad hasso said yes learn what i teach you then ill see you later drepteaza left the cell so did her guards she didnt say what she would do to him if he didnt learn though that warning about zgomots wrath certainly gave him food for thought but he wanted to have something to do in his cell besides calisthenics he would have tried to learn even if she told him not to he smiled crookedly to himself he might have learned better had she told him not to she gave him a couple of days to digest what shed taught or maybe since she was a priestess she had enough other things to do that she couldnt bother with him for a couple of days that crooked smile came back what is hasso that thou art mindful of him she returned not long after breakfast a growling belly wouldnt distract him anyhow he bowed to her good day he said in the best bucovinan he could command drepteaza and the little swarthy soldiers with her all started to laugh she corrected his pronunciation explaining in lenello when you say it the way you did it means purple day oh hasso walked to the slit window and looked out he couldnt see much but what he could see wasnt purple no i guess not a couple of the guards smiled but drepteaza was harder to amuse say it the way it should be she said in lenello then she added something in bucovinan she returned to lenello that means the same thing in my tongue listen she repeated it you will hear it a lot i think are you just a cool customer or a cold fish hasso wondered she seemed interested in hasso pemsel the curiosity hasso pemsel the possible font of knowledge hasso pemsel the man she might have been dealing with a talking mule if she had been dealing with a talking mule before long it would have been talking in bucovinan she knew how to teach do you teach lenelli to speak before he asked he carefully didnt say other lenelli he wanted her to think of him as something different whether she would or not she nodded now yes ive done that she answered we try to learn what we can from you invaders the more we learn the better our chances king bottero is not the first to try to invade us he wont be the last that struck hasso as likely too if i learn good do you let me out of this cell lord zgomot will decide that i wont drepteaza showed that the bucovinans knew how to pass the buck if you ask him will he listen if you tell him i am safe will he believe hasso trotted out future tenses in lenello sooner or later hed have to do it in bucovinan are you safe should anybody believe that drepteaza asked and then went back to the language lesson xv little by little hasso learned to speak bucovinan hed started feeling at home in lenello which didnt work too differently from german bucovinan was another story conjugating verbs with separate masculine and feminine forms was the least of the strangenesses bucovinan had long vowels and short vowels some words had the one some the other none had both except a few borrowed from lenello which drepteaza called bastard words bucovinan didnt have real past tenses only tenses that showed whether an action was completed or not and bucovinan had more trills and chirps than lenello and german put together how am i doing hasso asked after a while it probably came out more like how i doesing is the only thing he was sure he had right was the evin at the start of the question a little word that warned the listener it was a question you could also put evin at the end of the sentence then it was still a question but a sarcastic or rhetorical one ive heard blonds speak worse drepteaza was relentlessly honest about such things from everything hasso had seen she was relentlessly honest all the time maybe it was because she was a priestess maybe it was just because she was who she was hasso bowed thank you that had a particle that went with it too if you put it at the start it meant thank you very much and you meant what you were saying if you put it at the end it meant thanks a lot and you didnt hasso put it at the end drepteaza smiled see many lenelli would never know to do that but your pronunciation is terrible i am not a lenello hasso said for what seemed like the ten millionth time i have seen that drepteaza said or maybe it was something more like i am seeing that you make different mistakes the verb form she used wasnt one for completed actions hasso was still making those mistakes sorry he muttered she was a good teacher he was trying to learn something that was difficult for him and he wasnt having an easy time of it at least she understood that and didnt get too angry at him for his errors she dropped into lenello which she still did sometimes when she wanted to make sure he got what she was saying king bottero has asked lord zgomot to send you back to him he offers a large ransom ah hasso tried to keep his voice neutral and what does lord zgomot say he made himself ask the question in bucovinan he says no drepteazas verb form meant zgomot wasnt done saying no and would go right on saying it the priestess went on lenelli ransom captives from one another they hardly ever ransom them from us i see again hasso did his best to sound noncommittal the bucovinans had to resent not being treated as equals by the lenelli and they had to get suspicious when a lenello king did treat them that way what did hasso know that bottero didnt want them to find out another message also came from drammen drepteaza seemed to be working to sound neutral too her voice came out as empty of everything as if it emerged from a machines throat evin hasso said by itself the particle meant yes or what is it from the woman in whom the goddess dwells drepteaza said that in lenello and saying it the priestess didnt sound noncommittal any more she couldnt come close to hiding her scorn or her fear evin hasso said again how much did drepteaza know about velona and him some certainly even rautat knew some and she would have talked to him what did she think of what she knew nothing good from all the signs she wants you back too said the priestess of lavtrig a deity who didnt come to take possession of her a deity who probably didnt do any more than all the many gods of the world from which hasso came a distinct curl to her lip drepteaza went on all the more reason to keep you here hasso had wondered whether she and lord zgomot would feel that way in lenello he asked you arent afraid the goddess is angry if you say no why should we be drepteaza asked the only reason the blonds goddess ever notices us is to hurt us she will do that anyway but you you may teach us things we need to know so she cant hurt us so badly she was bound to be right about the goddess about hasso still using lenello he wanted to make sure she followed him he said how can i show you anything if you keep me locked in this cursed cell all the time he expected her to say no or to say she couldnt decide anything by herself asking her sovereign would let her stall for a couple of days keep hassos hopes up and let him down easy when lord zgomot told him he had to stay locked up but drepteaza asked will you give your parole not to try to escape you believe me if i do that yes she answered switching from her tongue to lenello to add you may even swear by the goddess if you like hasso considered that he needed no more than a heartbeat to decide it was a bad idea i will give it if saying isnt good enough for you why should swearing be better he asked also in lenello he wanted to be as sure as he could of saying just what he meant and he judged drepteaza and presumably lord zgomot as well aright the priestess looked pleased which didnt happen every day most of the time she was all business well said she told him in bucovinan come then if you care to may i please wash first he asked still in lenello she nodded yes you should be fit to go out in public we will take you to the baths the baths were public and mixed partly like ancient rome and partly like japan you rubbed yourself in a small hot pool with a root that smelled something like licorice it did a pretty good job of getting rid of dirt and grease then you rinsed off in a larger cooler communal pool perhaps a dozen little pools surrounded the big one communal meant what it said men and women bathed together their relaxed attitude among themselves showed the difference between nudity and nakedness hasso by contrast drew startled stares and whispers he understood why too a swan couldnt have been more conspicuous at a conclave of crows even the tallest natives hardly came up to the bottom of his chin he wasnt a shrimp any more as he had been among the lenelli that felt good the hair on his body like that on his head was yellow not dark or grizzled his skin was pink rather than olive even his battle marks were strange bullets left round puckered scars not the long thin traces of knife and sword wounds some of his guards had stripped with him others wore mailshirts and helms and kept weapons parole or no parole they were being careful one of the bathing guards pointed to a bullet wound on hassos leg and asked what did this an arrow he sounded as if he didnt believe it and it wasnt true shaking his head hasso answered no they were speaking bucovinan so he kept things as simple as he could he imitated the noise of the submachine gun he got back a blank look the guard must not have been at the battle where he used up the last of his schmeisser ammo from the next pool over drepteaza spoke too fast for hasso to follow shed also taken off her clothes and started bathing her figure was even sweeter and riper than hasso had guessed he looked at her only in glances out of the corner of his eye hed gone a long time without a woman and didnt think the natives would appreciate a bathhouse hardon whatever she said it seemed to ease the guards mind so you are a warrior then and not a he said dont understand last word hasso said a wizard drepteaza told him in lenello yes warrior hasso said hastily not what is word the guard repeated it hasso added it to his vocabulary no not wizard he repeated only warrior he didnt want the grenye to think he could work magic that would only make what was already bad worse and he didnt much want to think he was a wizard either did he protest too much was that what drepteazas raised eyebrow meant well better a raised eyebrow than a raised hasso managed to walk from the warm pool to the cooler one without embarrassing himself worse than he was already he felt like a new man once hed bathed the new man was chilly the natives heated the pools yeah but the building that housed them was drafty and it was winter outside and he wrinkled his nose when he redonned the outfit hed been wearing since he was captured can wash clothes too he asked drepteaza first she corrected his grammar and pronunciation then she put on her own clothes he sighed mentally when those darktipped breasts vanished under her tunic theyd given him something to think about during lessons besides grammar and pronunciation then she said yes why not you can wear ours while we wash yours hasso didnt think the bucovinans would be able to find anything to fit him but they gave him breeches and an embroidered tunic that were if anything on the big side then he remembered they had lenello prisoners and also lenello renegades those people had to wear something too when he remarked to drepteaza that he hadnt met any of them she said no and you wont either not for a while we dont know how far we can trust you we dont know how far we can trust all of them either some we know we cant trust too far her face clouded some lenelli here want to rule us not help us the natives were in a bind they needed help from the lenelli who knew too many things they didnt but the lenelli even the ones here were imperfectly disinterested how much were they out to help bucovin and how much themselves how often had the grenye not just in bucovin but farther west too got burned quite a few times by drepteazas tone how do i look innocent how do i sound innocent am i innocent hasso wondered those were all damn good questions he wished he knew the answers once the bucovinans decided he wouldnt sprout feathers and fly away they let him out of his cell more often he always had an escort though several unsmiling soldiers swordsmen pikemen and archers and drepteaza the priestess went with him most of the time anyhow when she couldnt for whatever reason rautat did you ought to thank me hasso told the veteran underofficer one day if not for me you wouldnt have soft duty at the palace id thank you more if you hadnt scragged so many of my buddies rautat answered he sounded like a sergeant even speaking lenello aiming a blunt forefinger at hassos middle he continued now go back to bucovinan youre supposed to be learning my language remember right hasso said in bucovinan rautat grinned hasso came to attention and clicked his heels whats that nonsense all about rautat also fell back into his own tongue shows hasso had no idea how to say respect or anything like it like this he said and saluted my people do pretty silly if you ask me rautat was short all grenye were short next to hasso but he was feisty he gestured with his thumb cmon they actually left the palace the first time theyd let hasso do that since he came to falticeni he wore a heavy sheepskin jacket but the cold wind still started to freeze his nose it wasnt leningrad or moscow winter but it sure as hell wasnt a holiday on the riviera either bundledup bucovinans gaped at him the way hed eyed tigers in the zoo when he was a kid fascination mixed with dread but he wasnt behind stout iron bars even if he did have guards along see the monster is loose what else were the natives going to think after everything that had happened since the lenelli landed on their shores somebody yelled something at him he didnt understand all of it but he heard something about his mother and something about his dog englishmen called somebody they didnt like a son of a bitch whatever this endearment was it seemed based on the same principle hasso pointed to a tavern a mug of beer to me please he said for me you mean rautat said he spoke to the troopers with them a pikeman went over and stuck his head into the tavern no he said when he came back one of those big blond buggers is already in there swilling drepteaza would rautat spook too fast for hasso to follow when he said so the underofficer slowed down she would murder me if i let you gab with another lenello there you got that yes but i am no lenello hasso said one more time rautat looked up at him up and up close enough buddy hasso didnt find any answer for that the ivans wouldnt care that a man they captured from the wiking ss panzer division was born in norway rather than germany theyd knock the poor bastard over the head anyhow he reminded himself again that he ought to thank god or maybe the goddess the bucovinans hadnt done that to him am another tavern not far from he asked i have thirsty you talk as bad as a lenello would too rautat said laughing but he knew where the next closest tavern stood hasso hadnt expected anything else rautat struck him as the sort who would know such things like any old soldier the native had the knack for making himself at home wherever he went ducking to get through the low door hasso found himself in what was plainly a soldiers dive a considerable silence fell when he went in again rautat talked too fast for hasso to follow whatever he said it must have worked because the men in there didnt leap up and go for the wehrmacht officer and a good many of them had plainly wanted to do just that then rautat talked to the tapman beer for him and beer for me too that hasso understood it was important after all the tapman held out his hand palm up rautat crossed it with copper lenello coins were pretty crude at least by the standards hasso was used to bucovinan coins being cruder imitations of crude originals but as long as the natives didnt fuss it wasnt his worry here rautat perched on a stool by an empty table he waved hasso to another one a couple of the germans watchdogs also sat down the rest hovered over him like the rest of the men in here they probably would have been happier to kill him than to guard him but they followed orders if they intimidated him while he drank chances were they didnt mind a barmaid brought the beers she smiled at rautat and looked at hasso yes as if he were a tiger out of its cage the rest of the guards ordered beer too except for one who chose mead instead the barmaid seemed glad to get away to your health rautat said to hasso raising his mug to your health hasso echoed returning the gesture they both drank the beer was better than what theyd given him in his cell but not much to somebody used to good german beer what the lenelli and the bucovinans made mostly tasted like sour horsepiss you could drink it if you had to though so he did drink water here as in russia and you begged for dysentery why didnt the damn wizards do something about that hassos guess was that if they tried theyd be too busy to do anything else one of the soldiers already in the tavern came up to hasso and unloaded a torrent of gibberish on him sorry not understand he said and then to rautat what does he say nothing you want to hear the underofficer answered in lenello what a rotten dog you are and how hed like to carve chunks off your liver and eat them raw tell him im insulted hasso said in the same language tell him the least he could do is cook them first rautat translated that hasso wondered whether he would get a laugh or start a fight he outweighed the native by close to thirty kilos so brawling didnt seem fair but he didnt intend to let the bucovinan pound on him without hitting back the soldier stared at rautat then stared at him he said that the man said hasso had no trouble at all following him then the fellow started to chuckle and he said something the wehrmacht officer didnt understand before going back to his own table what was that hasso asked rautat in lenello rautat answered he said you may be a big blond bastard but you may almost be a human being too thank you hasso said deadpan putting the polite particle at the end rautat broke up hasso took another pull at his mug of beer the grenye were recognizable human beings too even if they couldnt work magic maybe especially because they couldnt when rautat and the rest of the guards brought hasso back to the palace he got a surprise while he was gone the servants had cleaned up his cell and taken out the nasty straw pallet replacing it with a woolstuffed mattress on a wooden frame with leather lashings theyd given him a stool and a basin and pitcher and a brazier to fight the freezing breezes that howled in through the window now it was a real room almost he bowed to rautat thank you he said again this time with the polite particle in front to show he was sincere dont it wasnt my idea rautat repeated himself till hasso understood then added if you want to thank anybody thank the priestess shes in charge of stuff like this again he doubled back till the german got it i do that hasso said he didnt get a chance till late in the afternoon he spent some of the time in between asleep on the nice new mattress all too soon it would be full of bugs as the old one had been he didnt like that but after more than five years of war in europe he didnt think it was the end of the world either hed been lousy and fleabitten and bedbugbedeviled before you itched you scratched you killed what you could and you got on with your life when drepteaza came in accompanied as usual by tough little bucovinan guards he bowed lower to her than he had to rautat i thank you he said the polite particle properly in front and waved to show why he was thanking her the native soldiers laughed at him drepteaza smiled you say i thank you she told him using the feminine form of the pronoun hasso swore in german which made him feel better and didnt offend anybody here and thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand too goddamn much stuff to remember drepteaza went on and i say that you are welcome you will be here a while you may as well be comfortable he doubted he would ever be comfortable in this world the twentieth century had too much that simply didnt exist here electricity hot and cold running water refrigeration glazed windows phonographs and photographs radios cars but again hed done without most of that stuff for years you didnt have to have it the way so many people thought you did life was nicer with it sure but you could manage without and youll earn these things the priestess said we do expect to learn from you you know she repeated herself in lenello so he could have no doubt about what she meant i understand he answered which wasnt the same as promising to deliver whatever he gave the bucovinans would hurt the lenelli the hope that he would give them things that would hurt the lenelli was the only reason the natives hadnt murdered him instead of taking him prisoner drepteaza eyed him shrewdly you understand but you dont want to do it plenty of real lenelli do and you arent one youre just as foreign there as you are here so why not help us that was what she meant all right she wasnt quite right though hasso felt more at home among the lenelli than he did here and he doubted things would have been different had he landed here first the lenelli came closer to thinking the way he did they were conquerors they were winners bucovin was a land trying to figure out how not to lose it wasnt the same he couldnt say that to drepteaza without insulting her so he said something simpler i swear swore an oath to king bottero ive heard about it the swarthy little priestess looked at him how much would your oath matter if you werent sleeping with that blond cow velonas no cow hasso exclaimed the first thought that sprang into his head you could call her all kinds of things but cow if you called her a cow youd never met her and you had no notion no notion at all what she was like drepteaza gave him the native equivalent of a curtsy it looked more like a dance step excuse me she said with wintry politeness that blond serpent should i call her that blond wolfbitch those both came closer still hasso said i dont insult you or your folk this time drepteaza looked through him the lenelli are not your folk you said so yourself and he had again and again but he began but what the priestess sounded genuinely confused then her eyes widened she said something in bucovinan that he didnt get she must have seen he didnt for she went back to lenello you really love her she couldnt have seemed more appalled had she accused him of breakfasting on grenye babies he remembered that velona had sounded just as horrified herself when she realized the same thing well what if i do he said roughly doing his best to forget that moths fly into torch flames because they must do they love them when they do drepteaza said the exact figure velona had used hassos ears heated i dont know im not a moth he said no youre not which only makes it worse you have a choice and you choose to be a fool drepteaza told him the more she argued with him the more she put his back up what am i supposed to do tell my heart no he asked you would if you had any sense if you had any sense drepteaza broke off and threw her hands in the air oh whats the use if you could show a fool his folly he wouldnt be a fool anymore she turned and spoke to the guards in bucovinan come on its hopeless hes hopeless hasso understood that just fine yes she was a good teacher she just didnt want to teach him anymore the closing door and the thud of the bar on the outside falling back into place had a dreadfully final sound he wondered whether the bucovinans would take away his small comforts again and remind him he was a prisoner for that matter he wondered whether he would find out how ingenious the local torturer was if you told your captors things they didnt want to hear you had to expect to pay the price drepteaza really hadnt wanted to hear that he loved velona for that matter neither had velona it would have been funny if it hadnt put his ass in a sling hell it was pretty funny anyhow they went on feeding him and the food stayed better than the prison slop hed had before somebody maybe drepteaza maybe lord zgomot maybe just rautat was in a merciful mood at least as far as that went not expecting any mercies hasso was grateful even for small ones he spent the next several days wondering whether small ones were the only ones hed get the natives who brought him food didnt speak to him and didnt answer when he tried to speak to them neither did the ones who emptied his chamber pot and nobody else showed up drepteaza didnt come in to teach him more bucovinan rautat didnt come in with guards to escort him around falticeni they let him stew in his own juices instead im not going to stop feeling what i feel about velona he thought im not going to forget my oath to bottero some more time went by i hope im not anyway he did what hed done before he slept as much as he could the long cold winter nights lent themselves to that to sleep perchance to dream if he wasnt too hungry and he wasnt too cold why not he couldnt turn on the radio or even curl up with a good book at first he didnt dream much or didnt remember what he dreamt if he did hed never paid a whole lot of attention to his dreams so that didnt worry him and even if he had been the clout in the head hed taken might have scrambled his brains worse than he knew when he did start noticing what he dreamt that was enough to make him sit up and wonder what the hell was going on all the dreams had the same theme somebody was looking for him trying to talk to him he had no idea who or why the dreams didnt seem threatening that was as much as he was willing to say about them even to himself when after a couple of weeks drepteaza did start giving him lessons again he mentioned them to her he tried first in his very basic very bad bucovinan when that failed he switched to lenello she heard him out with her usual thoughtful air once he finished she said i will pray and see if that does anything it didnt not as far as hasso could tell she listened gravely when he told her so then promised to speak to rautat about it the veteran underofficer came up to hasso and winked at him i know what you need he said do you hasso said i dont rautat thought that was the funniest thing hed ever heard hasso found out why a couple of nights later when a reasonably goodlooking bucovinan woman came into his room without any guards escorting her my name is leneshul she said in fair lenello they say you have been without pleasure too long i can give you some as matteroffactly as if she were going to wash dishes she pulled her top off over her head and tugged her skirt and drawers down to the floor do i suit you she asked standing naked and she was naked not nude before him you can have someone else if i dont part of him wanted to tell her to leave and not to ask anyone else to come in her place but he was almost painfully aware of how very long hed gone without it didnt have to mean anything just relief and as shed said some momentary pleasure youll do he told her and got out of his own clothes he wasnt sure she enjoyed it but he wasnt sure she didnt she was certainly limber and uninhibited he rode her the first time after they finished she sucked him hard again and straddled him he squeezed her small firm breasts as she bucked up and down she threw back her head and groaned if she came it was right then he knew he did a moment later there she said leaning down to brush her lips across his is that better oh yes he said she laughed throatily he slept without dreams that night drepteaza asked him about it at their language lesson the next morning she seemed pleased at his answer rautat was clever she said more clever than i was you may have leneshul any night you please or another woman if youd rather what about you hasso wondered drepteaza was cool almost cold as if she had no idea how pretty she was that made the prospect of heating her all the more exciting but she looked at him as if he were a side of beef if he offended her she could do anything she wanted to him he kept his big mouth shut about that anyway leneshul is all right he told her then she will come to you again drepteaza said briskly and leneshul did two or three nights a week on those nights hasso never had any of the dreams that disturbed him he had them less often on other nights too but when they did come on other nights they seemed more urgent as if whatever was behind them felt itself thwarted and so tried harder than ever to break through that alarmed him he felt pursued he used the solace of leneshuls compliant body as often as he could no matter what he did he couldnt get it up every single night he wished he were ten years younger then he might have but when he was ten years younger the future stretched out before him with a broad and shining path the fuhrer was turning the tiny reichswehr into the wehrmacht restoring german pride restoring german power what could stand in the way of a proud resurgent nation well hed found out what could all right and here he was in a strange world older and more scarred and screwing his head off not for love or even lust but out of fear that helped wear him out too one night he fell asleep right after supper if leneshul came to his room that evening she quietly left again and he never knew it and so he dreamt and whatever had chased him for so long finally caught up with him hasso he heard his own name echoing as if down a long windy corridor hasso pemsel he didnt want to answer he didnt want to acknowledge the harder he fled though the more his name pursued him names had power so the wizards said and here he was a wizard of sorts at last hounded he stood and turned at bay what he shouted back into the void time passed a minute an hour it was a dream he couldnt be sure time that was all he knew then dimly a face appeared in the void a face he knew adernos face he realized by the goddess ive had a demon of a time raising you the wizard said when he named the goddess hasso seemed to see the cult statue floating beside him the german also seemed to see velonas face instead or perhaps as well he had trouble being sure which but what difference did it make it was only a dream wasnt it well here i am hasso said aderno nodded we heard youd lived he said we werent sure but it seems to be true that was why bottero tried to ransom you yes im still around they take me to falticeni hasso said even in a dream he stuck to the present tense as much as he could when speaking lenello youre not telling them anything are you aderno sounded more anxious than perhaps he thought he did maybe covering up was harder in a dream or was aderno dreaming so much hasso didnt know no i dont say anything he replied you are well bottero is well velona is well mertois is well he asked after people he knew he didnt waste time asking after orosei he knew the masteratarms was dead mertois has a broken leg he will limp ever after aderno said the rest of us are well enough bottero and velona are wild for revenge against the savages the grenye cant do that to real men and expect to get away with it the first few times the ivans gave the wehrmacht a good clout german soldiers felt the same way poland and the west and the balkans had been easy nothing came easy in russia not even the victories and as year followed year those got harder and harder to find sorry aderno you dont get walkovers forever no matter how much you wish you did or maybe you did with magic the lenelli sure thought so theyd stripped themselves thin of wizards before the latest battle what theyd had was hasso in fact but nobodyd suggested that he try a spell to see if the bucovinans were up to any funny business nobodyd imagined they could be so much for understanding the enemy when hasso didnt answer right away aderno said we can do it by the goddess outlander we can when he called on the goddess again the cult statue grew more distinct so did velonas face were they two sides of the same coin hasso was no damn good at such things the doctrine of the trinity and the notion of transubstantiation only made his head ache it wasnt the goddess voice that called to him though it was velonas are you all right hasso pemsel hello sweetheart yes im doing well enough i guess hasso answered i hope you are i miss you she said i didnt think i would but i do i want to get you back if i have to burn down all of bucovin to do it and kill all the stinking grenye savages in the way i will not even the fuhrer was that blunt hasso didnt doubt she meant every word of it whatever else you said about velona shed never once made the acquaintance of hypocrisy have they tried to trick you into doing things for them have they given you sluts to try to make you forget me she asked i dont do anything for them and i can never forget you you know that hasso didnt answer all of the last question he had to share velona with the king how could she get mad at him for somebody like leneshul maybe you couldnt keep secrets in a dream whether he told her or not she knew and she didnt like it for beans i am a goddess i do what i have to do she cried you youre only a man how dare you take some smelly little blackhaired twat how dare you much too late he remembered she hadnt wanted him sniffing around grenye serving girls back in drammen either what could he say that he had no idea whether hed ever get away from falticeni she should have been able to see it for herself if she could she didnt care she was playing the woman scorned right up to the hilt aderno she cried center my power while i smite this wretch hasso was a wizard of sorts an ordinary man might well not have escaped the goddess wrath he could feel it building like heat lightning on a hot summer day in the southern ukraine how to flee how to get away he screamed himself awake xvi he must have done some impressive shrieking next thing he knew three guards were in the room with him each man with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other their shadows swooped around and behind them like something out of a scary movie nobody in this whole goddamn world knows what that means hasso thought miserably nobody but me what happened the first guard asked why did you yell said the second did somebody try to do something to you asked the third dont be stupid elyash the first guard said nobody in here but him and us anybody who wants to get at him has to come through us right nobody did right it wasnt necessarily so hasso wished it were princess drepteaza come see me he asked in his rudimentary bucovinan the guards looked at one another they didnt want to bother her in the middle of the night it wasnt quite the raw fear that would have made flunkies hesitate before disturbing velona that could be dangerous in all kinds of ways including physically drepteaza wouldnt couldnt blast you where you stood that didnt make the little swarthy men eager to wake her up but the second guard said that shriek he let out maybe wed better we can blame it on him hasso didnt think he was supposed to catch that he held his face still knowing more of the language than they thought he did couldnt hurt after a little more guttural wrangling the trooper called elyash went off to see if drepteaza would come one of the others used his torch to light a lamp for hasso then they withdrew from the room leaving him alone in the dim flickering light he could have gone back to sleep if hed had the nerve how many times during the war had he heard a bullet crack past him more than he could count he knew that his scars spoke of times that hadnt been misses but he wasnt thinking about those he was thinking he might have dodged something worse than a bullet something on the order of a mm shell and unlike a it might still be waiting for him if he lay down and closed his eyes will i ever be able to sleep again he wondered soldiers on the russian front always talked about sleeping with one eye open so the ivans couldnt sneak up and cut their throats but what happened when somebody could sneak up on you from inside your own head hasso shivered nothing good that was what velona he whispered sadly why couldnt she understand about leneshul even a little bit but the answer to that formed as fast as the question because she was who and what she was that was why she wouldnt let a native girl upstage her even if she wasnt there to be upstaged what did they call using a woman to get information out of a prisoner a honey trap the bucovinans could have been tearing his toenails out they could still start any time they pleased too bless them the fools theyd given him a woman instead and he hadnt even told leneshul anything hed just used her as a nicely rounded sleeping pill to evade bad dreams the door opened in came drepteaza her hair all awry and her face twisted from fighting against a yawn more trouble in the night she asked in lenello ja hasso said she nodded shed come to understand that he wished he could go on in german even in lenello he couldnt speak smoothly but german like memories of movies was his alone here lenello then those dreams in the night now i know what makes them and drepteaza waited for him to tell her what she needed to know the feeble lamplight left her eyes enormous a wizard from botteros kingdom sends to me in my sleep hasso said her jaw set as if she were taking a blow she hoped she was braced for i wondered whether that was so she said softly as much to herself hasso judged as to him she made herself stand straight and what does the wizard want to get me back for the lenelli hasso answered with the truth that was what aderno had wanted anyway till velona found out hasso was laying a grenye woman now they probably both wanted him trussed and roasted and served up with an apple in his mouth like a suckling pig they think you know things drepteaza remarked hasso kept quiet which struck him as the safest thing he could do just then not that anything seemed very safe at the moment the priestess eyed him but these are bad dreams for you elyash said you screamed tonight screamed like a man over hot coals he told me and how did elyash know what a man sounded like when he hung over hot coals better not to inquire chances were this is a bad dream tonight yes hasso said why drepteaza asked hasso wondered whether he ought to evade that question as much as velona didnt like native women drepteaza didnt like velona the lenello woman had already tried to fry his brains from the inside out what would the bucovinan woman do did he want to find out on the other hand what exactly did he scream when he woke up did the guards hear it did it have velonas name in it if he lied and drepteaza found out what would she do then again did he want to find out he decided he didnt hell had no fury like a woman scorned how about a woman hoodwinked and so carefully he said velona is was in this dream oh really no the bucovinan priestess didnt like that not even a little bit she didnt like anything that had anything to do with velona but her frown was more one of concentration than of fury hasso hoped so anyhow you like velona though you love velona drepteaza made it sound indescribably perverse why do you say seeing her was bad and why did she appear in the dream in the first place drepteaza might be a native woman who only came halfway up hassos chest that didnt mean she was a fool oh no on the contrary how many people in hassos world had come to grief by equating the two the fuhrer had in russia the wehrmacht officer hoped he wouldnt make the same mistake himself not when shed picked two vital questions he answered them in the opposite order from which shed asked them she appears because she wants wanted to get me back to drammen the past tense mattered here he kept using it and seeing her was bad because she got angry because of leneshul she did did she drepteaza laughed thats the funniest thing i ever heard what does she expect you to do when youre here and not with her and you wont be going back to her sit around and play with your dick all the time hasso didnt care for the sound of and you wont be going back to her nothing he could do about it though and velona probably did expect him to do just that or else to live in the glorious memories of her life didnt work that way but he thought it was what she expected maybe drepteaza did too for she shook her head and exclaimed the nerve of that woman she really did sound indignant sorry to bother you hasso said dont worry about it i wouldnt have missed this for the world drepteaza paused just when hasso thought she would get in her last little dig and go back to bed maybe it was only a trick of the dim unreliable lamplight but suddenly she looked much older and much more worried in a voice that tried to stay casual but didnt quite succeed she asked you dont have anything to do with magic do you rautat had asked him that before but this time the question took him by surprise if hed been expecting it he could have said of course not and that would have been that but what came out of his mouth was again the exact and literal truth i can do a little but i dont know much about it you can do a little he never forgot how drepteaza spaced out the words or how enormous her eyes seemed that was also partly a trick of the light yes but it seemed somehow more she stabbed out a finger at him why didnt you say so before what good does it do you you cant trust me even if you could trust me im not a quarter trained im not a quarter of a quarter trained what i know is this hasso held his thumb and index finger close together what the lenelli know is this he threw his arms wide drepteazas eyes narrowed now narrowed dangerously she didnt believe him but they wouldnt care about you if you didnt know things we dont neither would you he pointed out of course we wouldnt are we fools she didnt waste time denying it but if they want you back so much that means she broke off hasso could fill in the blank that means youre worth something after all if he denied it theyd knock him over the head no more leneshul it would be toenailtearing time in the world i come from there is no magic hasso said what i know has nothing to do with magic it has to do with uh arts and craft no way to say technology or engineering in lenello so we could use it as well as the blonds drepteaza said hasso didnt say yes or no she went on you had better show us some of this you know why i dont i have an oath to king bottero hasso liked the lenelli he felt he could almost become one of them if he stayed here long enough and got used to their ways in bucovin his looks if nothing else would leave him a stranger the rest of his life he would be as bad off as a jew in germany maybe worse some jews looked like aryans he sure as hell didnt look like a grenye a good thing they took oaths more seriously here than in his own world velona tried to harm you yes drepteaza said the wizard tried to harm you yes what is your oath to their king worth to you if its worth nothing to them or do you think they struck at you without his knowledge without his let i dont know hasso said slowly i have to think about that it was worth thinking about too priestesses were supposed to have answers werent they he didnt know whether drepteaza did she sure had some good questions though we have to think about you too she said you cant do much oh lavtrig preserve us she walked out of the room shaking her head when hasso got breakfast the next morning the serving girl who gave him his tray looked at him as if he had horns and a tail and she thought hed start breathing fire any minute the morning before shed laughed and joked with him shed taken him for granted she didnt any more he knew what that had to mean only i he said knowing hed botched the bucovinan grammar as soon as the words were out of his mouth but jiril didnt speak lenello or at least shed never let on that she did she might have just found a scorpion in her sock wizard she said and aimed at him a pronged gesture that couldnt possibly do her any good he sighed either drepteaza had blabbed which didnt seem likely but wasnt even close to impossible or the guards had overheard and started running their mouths it made no real difference any which way the cat was out of the bag the lenelli admitted that some of their renegades had used magic for the natives the bucovinans had said the same thing theyd also talked about the trouble they had keeping lenello wizards using the magic for them and not to rule them or worse hasso thought if the ss had had magic to help it clear out the ghettos in poland and russia wouldnt it have used every spell it could in a heartbeat hasso had no doubts about that at all what could he do he muttered to himself what he could do and what he might do were two different creatures could he run a panzer without training not bloody likely so why should he expect to work magic without learning how but the bucovinans probably thought he could all they knew about magic was that they couldnt work any that might be useful or it might get him killed if they decided it made him too dangerous to leave alive and he couldnt do a damn thing about it some wizard that made him how jiril looked at him wasnt the only sign that things had changed nobody else came in all morning the guards didnt want to let him out either he was half surprised that they didnt come in and take away his furniture the maid who brought him lunch seemed less frightened than jiril had but she also wasnt easy with him no sign of leneshul at all dammit drepteaza didnt visit till late afternoon when she did a full complement of toughlooking guards came in with her the natives hadnt bothered with that for a while they looked ready to ventilate him if he breathed funny too maybe not back to square one but square two it seemed that way worse luck drepteaza didnt act afraid but she didnt act even halfway friendly any more either what did her expression mean something on the order of more in sorrow than in anger hasso judged and sure enough the first words out of her mouth were what are we supposed to do with you hasso pemsel the way she used his full name reminded him of velona a sudden stab he really didnt need just then she spoke in her own language but he answered in lenello priestess you should set me free and give me a big estate and servants and plenty of gold and silver to pay for them she blinked whatever shed expected that wasnt it one of the guards glowered at him another one laughed they knew lenello then after a moment drepteaza said maybe that would keep us safe from you if we were sure it would it might be worthwhile killing you is surer and cheaper she wasnt kidding she didnt joke very often and he always knew when she did much too conscious that he was talking for his life he said i am a captive for some time now you could kill me whenever you want before we knew you were a snake now we know you are a viper drepteaza said you can do more and worse to us than we thought or i can do more and better for you hasso said maybe you can but you still have your famous oath to king bottero bottero the invader bottero the robber bottero the murderer bottero the torturer no drepteaza wasnt joking the goddess who does not care what a man is the wizard who tries to slay his own lords sworn man do they deserve your oath hasso pemsel that was a different way of asking what shed asked the night before unhappily hasso said theyre worried about what i can do what i know so are you remember there is a difference drepteaza said what hasso asked she gave him a look that said he was either disingenuous or very very stupid you already helped them that attacking column you showed them and whatever magic you worked for bottero not to mention rescuing velona hasso thought the bucovinans didnt know about that which was a good thing for him he uncomfortably recalled the spell hed made to find the underwater bridges the natives didnt know about that either and hasso wasnt a bit sorry they didnt in my world a prisoner only has to give his name his rank and his pay number to his enemies he said never mind that people broke the rules all the time when they needed to squeeze something out of somebody the rules were what they were you give your soldiers numbers drepteaza frowned why arent names enough we have more soldiers than we have names many more hasso answered when he told her how many men the wehrmacht held she didnt want to believe him neither had the lenelli when he talked about such things unlike the lenelli who usually thought they knew it all drepteaza didnt argue with him she just said well let that be as it may and went on you are not in your world now hasso pemsel you are here and you have to live by our rules dont i know it he exclaimed we could have killed you we could have killed you the width of a millet grain at a time we could have sent you to the mines a living death did we do any of that no we treated you well dont you want that to go on of course i do but you dont do it for me you do it for you hasso said and bottero helped you just because he liked you the priestess could be formidably sarcastic hasso didnt know what to say so he kept his big mouth shut drepteaza looked through him so you still need to think do you if you must you can do that for a little while anyway out she went nothing much changed for the next few days one thing did though leneshul stopped coming to him he knew what that meant the bucovinans werent going to let anything stand in the way of whatever magic aderno and velona aimed at him whose clever idea was that drepteazas lord zgomots the trouble was it was clever if the people he called his friends kept trying to kill him how long would he could he stay friendly to them if they did kill him not very long if they didnt hasso hoped drepteaza was counting on his living through whatever the lenelli aimed at him he hoped so yes but he couldnt be sure since he didnt have a woman he took matters into his own hands so to speak but as hed found with leneshul he couldnt get it up every day the spirit was willing but the flesh was older than that dammit had he been twentyone one night he fell asleep unshielded by selfabuse hed seen velona in his dreams before but not the way he had when she and aderno assailed him hed had dreams the past few nights that made him think he would have company when he slept unwarded by pleasure of any sort dreams that reminded him of someone knocking on a distant door tonight the door wasnt distant tonight aderno didnt bother to knock he just walked on in ah there you are he said as if he and hasso were picking up a conversation after breaking off to eat lunch hasso suggested that the wizard and his unicorn enjoyed a relationship different from mount and rider it was a male unicorn naughty naughty aderno said his voice surprisingly mild that was a a misunderstanding you might say you might say hasso retorted the only thing that misses is i dont end up dead yes he went right on sticking to the present tense when he could it was a misunderstanding i tell you aderno seemed to look back over his shoulder isnt that right velona she hadnt been there before she was now dreams could do some crazy things hasso knew that seeing her strongly sculpted features sent a lance of pain through his heart i am sorry she said i was upset when i found out but it makes sense where you are she sounded like someone having trouble getting an apology out hasso didnt think she sounded like someone who had to lie to get an apology out but when you got right down to it so what shed done her level best to kill him and it damn near turned out to be good enough if he werent some sort of halfassed wizard himself chances were hed be holding up a lily right now thanks a lot he told her as sardonically as he could he watched adernos dreamprojection of her blush she got the message all right unless aderno was playing with her image to fool him the only thing hasso was sure of was that he couldnt trust anybody he had no one to watch his back he had had the lenelli but no more now he was what the loneliest man in the world that was what lots of people said that for him in this world it was literally true no doubt it had been ever since he got here but he hadnt wanted to look at it for quite a while he hadnt had to now he saw no other choice we worried about you velona said for a while we didnt know if you were alive or dead then we got word the savages had you in falticeni we didnt know what they were doing to you so you decide to do it yourself in case they dont do a good enough job hasso broke in no velona said but hasso noted she didnt say by the goddess no she took swearing by the goddess seriously she wouldnt do it if she didnt mean it since the goddess as it were kept a flat inside her head that made sense the absence of the oath saddened hasso without much surprising him velona went on we think we can bring you out of there bring you back to drammen by magic oh was that hope inside hasso or suspicion why dont you do that before instead of trying to boil my brain i was angry velona said simply the first thing hasso heard from her he was sure he believed i thought the grenye would use their sluts to seduce you away from the cause of civilization and i wanted you all for myself by the goddess i still do she meant that then it was flattering no doubt about it she was one hell of a woman she was one hell of a hellcat too i think we can do it hasso aderno said before the wehrmacht officer could answer her if you open your will to mine no hasso said at once if he opened himself to aderno he left himself vulnerable to the lenello sorcerer he might be a halfassed wizard but he could see that much and if you left yourself vulnerable to somebody whod just tried to do you in well how big a fool were you if you did that a bigger fool than i am hasso thought you dont trust me aderno sounded affronted bet your balls i dont hasso said the fuhrer had got an awful lot of mileage out of making promises he didnt mean to keep anyone who watched him in action had to wonder about promises forever after words after all were worth their weight in gold would you trust me sweetheart velonas dreamimage looked almost or maybe not just almost supernaturally beautiful was she calling the goddess into herself to overwhelm his senses but for what shed done a few nights earlier it likely would have worked now he was inoculated against such things i dont trust anybody any more he said how can i even in the dream he saw he startled her would anybody from this world have been able to resist her when she did something like that he wouldnt have been surprised if the answer was no but he wasnt from here he knew there was something to the goddess hed seen as much but he didnt automatically accept her as his deity after velonas amazement anger came back and it wasnt just hers it was also the goddess would you turn your face against me hasso pemsel velona asked only something more rang in her voice i dont want to turn against anybody he said i just want people to leave me alone for a while he might as well not have spoken you will pay velona intoned or rather the goddess intoned through her you will pay and bucovin will pay for harboring you do you think you can thwart my will well the bucovinans are still doing it hasso said if anyone had talked to hitler that way after operation barbarossa failed the fuhrer would have handed him his head but it might have done the reich some good velona didnt want to listen any more than hitler would have hasso might have known hell he had known she wouldnt people obviously werent in the habit of telling the goddess no insolent mortal if you would sooner live among swine than men you deserve the choice you made she hit him with something that made what aderno and velona did the last time seem a love tap by comparison it wasnt quite enough to do him in though because he woke up screaming again drepteaza eyed hasso god only knew what in her eyes this could grow tedious she said in stern lenello and then yawned i dont like it any better than you do the wehrmacht officer mumbled less i bet hed already summarized his latest encounter with velona and aderno the bucovinan priestess sighed well leneshul can come back to your bed if that makes you any happier she may do you some good anyhow hasso inclined his head i thank you he said in bucovinan thinking id rather go to bed with you not for the first time he wondered how smart no how dumb he was his goddessfilled lover had just tried to do him in twice so now he wanted to sleep with a priestess instead maybe he ought to have his head examined to see if it held any working parts drepteaza nodded absently i do this more for us than for you she said whatever you know the lenelli dont want you showing it to us that seems plain enough doesnt it i suppose so hasso figured that was part of it too but he would have bet marks against mud pies that velonas rage weighed more in the scales but of course you dont want to show it to us either whatever it is drepteaza said you have sworn an oath to the people who want to kill you and it counts for more than anything else that was irony honed to a point sharp enough to slip between the ribs pierce the heart and leave behind hardly a drop of blood hassos ears heated i try to be loyal he said loyalty is a wonderful thing it is also a road people travel in both directions or it should be drepteaza said if you are loyal and your lord is not what had bottero promised when hasso swore homage to him hed vowed he would do nothing that made him not deserve it had he kept his half of the oath when you got right down to it no hes forsworn all right i can do whatever i want and do it with a clear conscience the thought made hasso no happier he didnt want to take service with the grenye to pledge allegiance to lord zgomot of bucovin it reminded him too much of wehrmacht men joining the red army and going to war against their old comrades some few had done it he knew and great swarms of russians fought for the swastika and against the hammer and sickle yes they did and hasso knew what he thought of them you can use a turncoat he said miserably you can use him but you can never like him or trust him or respect him you do have honor drepteaza sounded surprised when she said it somehow that seemed the most unkindest cut of all after a moment she went on tell me this hasso pemsel do the lenelli like you or trust you or respect you they did hasso made himself pause and use the past tense the present wasnt true however much he wished it were they did yes when you were useful to them then they threw you away like a bone with the meat gnawed off it drepteaza said so why hold back now dont you want your revenge dont you deserve it hasso didnt answer right away he had to look inside himself to find where the truth lay when he did it only made him even more uneasy and here he hadnt thought he could be joining bucovin joining the grenye wasnt like going over to the slavic untermenschen no it was worse than that every time he looked at them he thought of jews a whole great country full of grasping swarthy jews and he slept with leneshul and he wanted to sleep with drepteaza but that was his sport helping this folk against the aryanseeming warriors from across the sea i dont know he whispered i just dont know well you had better make up your mind hasso pemsel drepteaza didnt know what was bothering him he didnt think he could explain it either not so it made sense to her youd better make up your mind she repeated and youd better hurry up about it too you dont have much time left and away she went taking with her the captors privilege of the last word somebody pounded on hassos door much too early in the morning next to the wehrmacht officer leneshul groaned whos that she muttered why doesnt he go away shall i find out hasso asked leneshul only shrugged and pulled the blankets over her head not that that did any good against the racket whoever was out there was bound and determined to come in yawning and cursing in german hasso pulled on his trousers and walked to the door he threw it open then stopped in surprise that wasnt a dark little bucovinan out there but a blond taller than himself and he realized a heartbeat later someone he knew too scanno he exclaimed what the demon are you doing here i could ask you the same question buddy the lenello from drammen answered they wanted me to come here and talk some sense into your pointed head thats why im here nechemats cursed glad to get away from all the lenelli too nechemat hasso gathered was scannos grenye wife or lover the german had seen her but never met her but youre a lenello he pointed out on the outside sure scanno breathed beer fumes into hassos face whether in drammen or falticeni he liked to drink he liked to talk too i dont act like those dumb buggers though you think grenye arent people just on account of theyre mindblind shit im mindblind most lenelli are whats the big deal he eyed hasso with more shrewdness than the wehrmacht officer would have thought he owned i hear youre not that could be a big deal and you know other stuff whatever the demon it is so could that they tell you everything hasso asked back in drammen they tell you everything all kinds of crap goes on under botteros big pointy beak said scanno who had a big pointy beak himself a little harder to slip away than it used to be i bet thats your fault huh i suppose so hasso hadnt had time to do a really good job of training the lenelli in security and counterespionage if the likes of scanno could beat his setup he knew what that meant botteros men hadnt had time to figure it all out and make it their own yet they were doing it because hed told them to not because they saw all the benefits and ins and outs for themselves hasso made himself ask how is the king scanno laughed a big booming laugh that made the bucovinan guards stare well its not like he invites me to the palace for roast duck and wine with sugar in it the lenello renegade said if he knows who i am at all he figures im that drunken stumblebum whod sooner slum it with the grenye than stick to my own kind and hes right too he said that even as the same thought formed in hassos mind if scanno could see himself so clearly the rest of what he said carried more weight but anyway botteros not happy right now i dont need to eat his duck and drink his sugarwine to know that scanno went on any time one of the kings loses to bucovin hes ready to spit nails its embarrassing thats what it is and hes got to worry that his loving neighbors will jump on his back he took a real licking this time you took a licking whats this strike column i heard about briefly hasso explained scanno grunted thats pretty sly all right but it didnt work this time no it didnt hasso agreed so why do you throw in with the grenye and not your own folk i like em better scanno answered i mean pussys pussy who cares if the hair on its yellow or brown and the grenye they dont brag and strut and carry on all the stinking time theyre people you can get along with besides isnt it about time somebody gave the poor sorry cocksuckers a fair shake scanno bragged and strutted and carried on as much as any lenello hasso had ever known maybe he didnt know himself so well as the german had thought he did or maybe his size and his noise and his yellow hair made him stand out more among the natives than he ever would among his own people maybe he liked that if he did well so what what did it mean that he was human who wasnt but that question had another answer one it wouldnt have had in hassos old world scanno plainly had never gone to bed with velona or anybody like her true the difference wasnt that she was a blonde not a brunette the difference was the goddess yes and the other difference is that she wants you dead now hasso reminded himself details details here ive got another question for you scanno said were you at that place called what the demon was the name of it muresh that was it the one where botteros boys went hog wild yes i was there did you play their games no hasso didnt say hed seen such things before in russia hed played those games then the ivans were enemies he hated unlike the bucovinans who were foes merely in a professional sense and the russians had taken their revenge once the red army crossed the reichs borders oh hadnt they just scanno grunted again didnt think so bucovin doesnt massacre for the fun of it either bucovin isnt strong enough to hasso thought the guys chasing velona sure werent out to play skat with her scanno went on why dont you throw in with the bucovinans theyre a better mob than the ones out west he jerked a thumb in the direction of drammen that might or might not be true hasso sighed he really didnt have an answer not one scanno would get they look like a bunch of filthy kikes dammit he sighed again i dont know why dont i xvii scanno seemed to be an important fellow in falticeni the bucovinans respected him even if his own folk didnt when he told lord zgomot that hasso might play along zgomot summoned the wehrmacht officer in nothing flat hasso bowed to the dark little man from some things the natives had said a lot of lenelli even renegades had trouble bringing themselves to do that hasso didnt why should he hitler was a dark little man too even if he did have blue eyes and plenty of germans these days were bowing down before stalin who by all accounts was even smaller and darker than zgomot among the lord of bucovins courtiers stood scanno and drepteaza and rautat they all looked expectant scanno also looked almost indecently pleased with himself he was a rogue no doubt about it but he likely did bucovin more good than half a dozen more staid fellows would have zgomot came straight to the point asking in lenello so you will show us what you know i try to show you some of it yes lord hasso picked his words with care he wasnt sure he could make gunpowder even if he could he wasnt sure it would work in this world and even if it did he was a long way from sure he wanted it to work for the bucovinans if you do what we hope you can do you will not lack for anything we can give you zgomot said if things turn out otherwise if things turn out otherwise we will treat you the way you deserve do you understand me i do lord hasso answered if he performed he would get anything he wanted except velona if he didnt he would get the chopper that seemed fair enough to someone whose neck wasnt on the line hasso had to fight the impulse to rub at his nape zgomots eyes might be dark and pouchy but they were also uncommonly shrewd i understand that you do not love us hasso pemsel this is not a bargain about love we have treated you well when we did not need to we hope you will repay us for our kindness i hope you do too lord hasso had to fight even harder to keep that hand away from the back of his neck he hoped this would be it and he could see if he could get his hands on saltpeter and charcoal and sulfur if he couldnt he was not to put too fine a point on it screwed but the lord of bucovin wasnt quite done with him yet the holy priestess he pointed toward drepteaza with his chin tells me you have somewhat of the wizards blood in you hasso nodded to zgomot so it would seem lord though i am not trained in magic i will give you a piece of advice some lenelli zgomot didnt say some other lenelli which was a kindness of sorts would have done well to heed we have no magic you know that but if you use it against us here in falticeni it will do you less good than you think do you hear me some lenelli tell me the same thing lord hasso answered even velonas goddessgiven powers had weakened though they hadnt failed as she neared the capital of bucovin she didnt know why but she knew it was so the lenelli dont like it when we have a wizard in our midst they think he makes us more dangerous to them zgomot said but we dont always like it either because a wizard in our midst is dangerous to us so far though no lenello wizard has managed to hold on to bucovin longer than a month or so even wizards we find cant watch everyone all the time he was small and swarthy and dumpy he was also clever and cynical and probably made a damn good king if he was considerate enough to warn hasso the german decided he ought to take that as a compliment bowing he said i understand lord i never want to be a king or even a lord myself few men do at the beginning they find the ambition grows on them after a while though zgomot had a formidable deadpan hasso wouldnt have cared to play cards against him he went on its sad but most of those men dont come to a good end you wouldnt want to see that happen to yourself would you now that you mention it no hasso tried to match dry for dry he must have succeeded because one corner of zgomots mouth twitched upward before the lord of bucovin could pull his face straight again all right the native said do what you can do and we will see what it is with that less than ringing endorsement he dismissed hasso from his presence charcoal was easy sulfur was manageable anyhow hasso didnt know the lenello name for it but he described it well enough to let drepteaza recognize it we use it in medicine and we burn it to fumigate she said it stinks it sure does hasso agreed how do you say fumigate in bucovinan they still used lenello most of the time he was more fluent in it and he needed to be as precise as he could here for that matter he hadnt known how to say fumigate in lenello till she told him but context was clear there she told him literally the word meant something like burntostinkoutpests german could paste small words together to make big ones bucovinan did it all the time it also pasted on particles that werent words in themselves but that changed statements to questions or commands showed past present or future showed complete or incomplete action and did lots of other things german would have handled with cases and verb endings the language struck hasso as clumsy but it got the job done he preferred lenello not only because he knew it better it also worked more like german even in lenello he had a devil of a time getting across the idea of saltpeter in the old days in europe it had been a medicine to keep young men from getting horny it probably worked as badly as any other medicine from the old days but that was what people used it for before they found out about gunpowder and afterwards too in europe neither the lenelli nor the bucovinans seemed to know about that and hasso didnt know what the stuff looked like in the wild so to speak he got frustrated so did drepteaza if you dont know how it looks or where to find it how do you expect me to she asked pointedly scheisse hasso muttered swearing in german still gave him far more relief than either lenello or bucovinan but saying shit made him remember one of the few things he did know about saltpeter dungheaps you find it in dungheaps you know the crystals you find at the bottom of them sometimes thats saltpeter he had to cast about several times before he got drepteaza to understand crystals too when she did though she nodded all right now at least i know what youre talking about i dont know how to say it in lenello in my language its the bucovinan word meant shitflowers hasso grinned and nodded i remember that one i promise he said do you have any of it i dont think so she answered it isnt good for anything she paused not for anything we know anyway can you get me some he asked i suppose so some temple servant will think ive gone mad when i tell him to fork up a dunghill but i suppose so how much do you need if he remembered right black powder was threequarters saltpeter a tenth sulfur and the rest charcoal if he didnt remember right or somewhere close to right he was dead meat if this works as much as i can get to show it works say this much he put both fists close together youll have it drepteaza looked bemused and amused too who would have thought anybody wanted shitflowers what else will you need a good balance to weigh things on and grinders stone or wood not metal why not metal if i strike a spark well i dont want to strike a spark if he was going into the gunpowder business in a big way he wouldnt be able to do it all himself he would have to make sure the natives didnt do anything stupid or careless or theyd go skyhigh even in modern europe munitions plants blew up every once in a while but hed finally found one good thing about the absence of tobacco anyhow nobodyd drop a smoldering cigar butt into a powder barrel then he had a really scary thought could a lenello wizard touch off gunpowder from a distance would he have to figure out a spell to keep that from happening if he did if he could would he be able to take the spell off again to use the powder on the battlefield his head started to hurt this was all a hell of a lot more complicated than it would have been in germany in say what he was thinking must have shown on his face is something wrong drepteaza asked i hope not hasso answered for a while lenello wizards wouldnt be able to figure out what he was doing he hadnt gone into any great detail about gunpowder back in botteros kingdom one of the people he had talked with was orosei and the masteratarms was too dead to give much away now is it something to do with magic she asked hasso jumped he couldnt help it how do you know that his poker face wasnt as good as lord zgomots but he didnt like to think anybody let alone a native could read him so well drepteazas smile lifted only one corner of her mouth when we worry about things going wrong we worry about magic why should you be any different it always worked against her folk the lenelli didnt look at things the same way but then magic worked for them maybe i should teach you fighting tricks you can use right away and not this hasso said this takes some time before it turns into anything when it does it will be important wont it i hope so hasso answered trying not to think about wizards wreaking havoc on gunpowder once hed made it then do this drepteaza said firmly do the other too but do this i dont know what it will be but i want to find out i have the charcoal i have the sulfur i am just waiting for the shitflowers hasso enjoyed the word drepteaza took it for granted both the lenelli and the bucovinans were earthier folk than germans they didnt flush bodily wastes down the drain they had to deal with them in the field so did hasso hed covered up like a cat when he could and just left things where they were when he couldnt but a city full of people couldnt very well do that not unless it wanted to get buried in waste he supposed the crystals the natives gave him were saltpeter they certainly stank of the dungheap but if the locals gave him something else by mistake or to test him he wouldnt have known the difference he washed the crystals and got rid of the filthy scummy stuff that floated on top of the water but he also discovered he was getting rid of a lot of the saltpeter because it dissolved in water so he couldnt just pour out the water he had to skim off the scum and then boil the water to get back what had gone away drepteaza watched in fascination as he worked were you ever an apothecary she asked you have the touch hasso shook his head it would be nice then i would have a better idea of what im doing if you dont know no one does thats what im afraid of he answered he ground a little of the saltpeter the charcoal and the sulfur very fine and mixed them together then touched them off with a flame they burned enthusiastically but not so well as hed hoped he mixed up another small batch wet it and kneaded the mixture into a paste then he let it dry and ground it again being very careful not to do anything that could make a spark once he finished he had enough powder to fill a fat firecracker the only problem was the natives didnt have cardboard to make a firecracker casing neither did the lenelli after some thought hasso asked for thin leather drepteaza had trouble containing her amusement as she watched him struggle to put together the case you may make a good apothecary but you were never a glover or anything like that shakespeares father was a glover hasso didnt know how he knew that but he did knowing it was useless back in his old world and worse than useless here he gave drepteaza an irritated look and so and so you ought to have someone else do the work instead of trying to do it all yourself she answered you know what you want to do let other people do what they know how to do he was flabbergasted not least because she was so obviously right he knew lots of things the bucovinans didnt hed let that blind him to an obvious truth they knew lots of things he didnt too one of their artisans would have taken twenty minutes to deal with what was costing him a days worth of work and turning out crappy maybe drepteaza knew a fine leatherworker herself maybe she asked one of lord zgomots servants for a name however she did it she found a grenye with a nearsighted squint who was miraculously capable with a knife and a needle drepteaza translated for hasso explaining exactly what he wanted ill do it the glover said hasso understood that bit of bucovinan just fine it took the man longer than twenty minutes but not much his stitches were as tiny and as close together and as perfectly matched as a sewing machines might have been the glover watched with interest as hasso used a clay funnel from the kitchens to fill the case with powder after the wehrmacht officer had done that he told drepteaza now he can sew up almost all of the opening at the top why not all of it the glover asked then he brightened finding an answer of his own is this thing a suppository drepteaza translated the question with a straight face if you stuck it up there and touched it off it would get rid of your hemorrhoids all right assuming it worked imagining that hasso started to giggle he couldnt explain why none of the natives had seen gunpowder in action just tell him no he replied as matteroffactly as he could how will you make it do whatever it does without hurting yourself drepteaza asked after she told the glover no she might not have seen gunpowder but she had a good eye for the possibilities i need to make a fuse hasso said the key word necessarily came out in german if gunpowder caught on here and if i live long enough he thought the technical terms would be in a very foreign language in the wehrmacht fuses came in two flavors timed which burned at about a meter a minute and instantaneous which burned at about forty meters a second you could improvise a fuse with powder and cord but it would burn pretty damn quick hasso didnt know how to make timed fuse he didnt think the bucovinans would let him spend very long experimenting either he wouldnt have if he were lord zgomot and so he did some more improvising he rubbed gunpowder into about a meter of cord and put the end of that into the leather case holding the rest of his charge then he attached the other end to a length of candle wick which would have to do duty for timed fuse he borrowed a toy wagon and a couple of little wooden soldiers and set them near the charge everything sat on the bare rammedearth floor of a palace storeroom lord zgomot drepteaza and rautat were the only witnesses when hasso lit the wick and hastily stepped out of the room it makes a loud bang dont be afraid he said i hope like hell it does theyll hang me up by the balls if it doesnt rautat nodded you can say that again if its like your thunder weapon itll go blam blam blam only once hasso said thunder weapon is all used up cant make anything like that too hard too hard for lenelli too they boom the explosion interrupted him rautat flinched lord zgomot jumped drepteaza opened her mouth but she didnt let out a squeak neither did the two men the bucovinans had nerve all right lets see what it does hasso said before they could several servants came running up to find out what the demon had happened theyd never heard a boom like that before lord zgomot sent them away hasso couldnt follow most of what he said but it sounded reassuring he seemed to have a knack for giving people what they needed after the servants went away hasso and his comrades walked into the storeroom rautat wrinkled his nose smells like devils he said hasso thought the brimstone reek smelled like fireworks it didnt smell like war to him the odor of smokeless powder was different sharper the toy wagon lay on its side near one wall one of the wooden dolls wasnt far away the other one was in pieces on the other side of the room only a couple of tattered scraps were left of the leather sack that had held the gunpowder a pot full of this could smash real people and real wagons the same way yes lord zgomot asked yes lord thats the idea hasso said that was one of the ideas anyway the bucovinans had catapults theyd borrowed the idea from the lenelli catapults could fling pots full of gunpowder at charging lenello knights the big blonds wouldnt like that neither would their horses or their wizards unicorns wizards wizards went on worrying hasso what could they do to gunpowder how soon would they figure it out and how soon would he have to go into the cannonfounding business cannon could easily outrange catapults but he didnt know how to make them oh he had an idea you needed a hollow tube with a touchhole at the end opposite the muzzle but how thick did it have to be if it blew up instead of sending a cannonball at the enemy he wouldnt make himself popular in bucovin what kind of carriage should it have sure one with wheels that covered a lot of ground though ground he knew nothing about one firecracker was a tiny start no more no this wouldnt be easy lord zgomot wanted weapons to sweep away the lenelli who could blame him hasso couldnt give him those weapons with a snap of the fingers it wasnt that easy and wholl blame me because i cant he knew the answer to that everybody hasso didnt trust the bucovinans to make gunpowder not yet they didnt know enough to be careful after they watched him for a while they probably would after they watched him and after they saw some explosions you had to respect the stuff or you had no business working with it at drepteazas suggestion rautat started learning the craft from him the veteran underofficer had seen what firearms could do if he didnt respect gunpowder what bucovinan would hasso needed a while to realize that question had two possible answers the one he wanted was that the bucovinans would do fine after they got the hang of things but the other one was also there maybe they wouldnt get the hang of it at all maybe they were too primitive the lenelli were somewhere close to the level where europeans had been when they started making guns the bucovinans the bucovinans were trying to pull themselves up to that level by their own bootstraps how far below it had their severaltimesgreatgrandparents been when the lenelli first landed on these shores a thousand years below two thousand years something like that theyd started working iron and theyd had kingdoms of sorts the lenelli had smashed a lot of them to confetti bucovin survived because it lay farther east it had had more time to absorb what the lenelli brought with them before they actually bumped up against its borders and for whatever reason magic didnt work so well near falticeni hasso scratched his head he wondered why that was so but he had more urgent things to worry about this isnt just like the thunder weapon you had before rautat remarked it sure isnt hasso agreed with a couple of dozen schmeissers and enough ammo he could have gone through all the lenello kingdoms and bucovin without breaking a sweat but he didnt have them so no point getting wistful about it i know you say you cant make anything like that rautat said hasso nodded the bucovinan went on well how close can you come not very with a lot of work hasso figured he could eventually make a smoothbore matchlock musket that wouldnt happen soon it also wouldnt be that much more deadly than a bow and arrow though it would be a lot easier to learn too bad the underofficer said and then youd better not be holding out on us im not curse it hasso said why would i show you this much and not the rest if i could do the rest it makes no sense rautat fingered the graying tendrils of his beard i guess so he said but he didnt sound a hundred percent convinced wonderful just what i need hasso thought even the guys who work closest with me dont trust me but hed had that unhappy thought before nobody trusted someone who changed sides you got what you could from a turncoat but trust him hed already thrown away one loyalty why would he worry about another and hasso knew he would go back to botteros kingdom in a flash if he got the chance the bucovinans had to know it too because they made sure he never got a chance they didnt go into the garderobe with him when he needed to take a leak not usually anyhow but that was about the only time he wasnt watched except when he was alone in his room lord zgomot didnt get watched over the way hasso did well why should he zgomot had no reason to light out for the tall timber hasso damn well did would velona take him back he could hope so anyhow and even if she decided he was a racial traitor bottero would still think he was useful wouldnt he sure he would hasso found himself grinding his teeth which wasnt the smartest thing he could do in a country where the dentists had never heard of laughing gas yeah bottero would think he was useful but the lenello king wouldnt fully trust him anymore either hed worked for bucovin for the contemptible grenye he was screwed any way you looked at it a couple of evenings later he told leneshul not to bother coming back any more all right she said and left with no more ceremony than that shed given him what he wanted but she hadnt wanted anything from him to her he was just a job now she could go do something else the next morning drepteaza said shall i find another woman for you in a while maybe not right now hasso answered she frowned even if you get no more bad dreams its not healthy for a man to go without a woman too long youll get grumpy and grouchy if i have a woman i dont care about its not much better than no woman at all hasso said im sorry leneshul didnt please you as much as i hoped she would drepteaza said but i dont know what to do about that you could hasso broke off what nothing its nothing hasso buried his nose in a mug of beer me and my goddamn big mouth he thought what is it drepteaza persisted if it is anything reasonable we will do it for you you do seem to be helping us we pay our debts reasonable that was funny or would have been if only he were laughing he took another pull at the beer even in wartime germany it would have been pretty bad by local standards it was pretty good if only i knew something about brewing if only i knew something about anything nothing hasso said again drepteaza looked severe you say it is nothing then you will get angry because we cant guess what it is and deliver it to you without being asked we know how these things go weve seen them before she wasnt going to leave him alone he could see that coming like a rash or like a salvo of katyusha rockets from a stalin organ well maybe the truth would shut her up she couldnt get too mad he hoped not when shed asked for it if i wanted any woman in my bed it would be you any bucovinan woman yes he had to make the reservation even after velona tried to kill him if that didnt say he had it bad what would he didnt shock the priestess to his immense relief he saw that right away he saw no answering spark flash though damn it is a compliment i ought to thank you for it i do thank you for it she said slowly but hasso packed a world two worlds of bitterness into one word yes but drepteaza did him the courtesy of not misunderstanding and of not beating around the bush the way he had i am very sorry hasso pemsel but when i look at you i see a lenello i dont know what else to say i dont think anything else needs saying do you the lenelli looked down their noses at grenye that the grenye might look up their noses at the lenelli they werent tall enough to look down them hadnt crossed hassos mind the lenelli after all looked like aryans of course they were better than these little swarthy people werent they didnt he himself want to sleep with drepteaza more in spite of her looks than because of them well yes and no yes she was small and dark but she was also very pretty and as he knew from the baths made just the way a woman ought to be maybe she was built no better than leneshul even so she was a hundred times as interesting which had nothing to do with looks you dont say anything drepteaza remarked what am i supposed to say i already say too much hasso answered she sent him a wry smile youre no lenello regardless of how you look if you were you would be telling me how wonderful you were and what an honor it would be for me to open my legs for you hassos ears felt on fire wellbred women in germany didnt talk about opening their legs even after you propositioned them they might do it but they didnt talk about it so baldly he tried to match her tone if you dont already know i am wonderful what can i say to make you believe it probably nothing few german women had drepteazas devastating honesty either she went on i look at you and i see things like muresh i see a countryside full of massacres like that from here all the way west to the seacoast and i should be honored to sleep with you she shuddered she might as well be a jew looking at an ss man hasso thought he did some shuddering of his own the ss was bound to be out of business now the jews who were left in europe and the jews from america and russia were having their turn hasso didnt couldnt know what was going on in the reich now in the aftermath of a lost war but he wasnt sorry not to be there to see it hard times he was sure of that and if the jews were taking revenge could the grenye of bucovin do the same the jews hadnt had to worry about magic oh some of the nazi bigwigs dabbled in the occult but it sure didnt do them a pfennigs worth of good it was real here though no doubt about it and im helping these dark little mindblind if i want to keep on living i am besides no matter what i look like i am not a lenello hasso said carefully yes so you keep insisting and it seems to be true but you still look like one so it helps you less than you think even if it is the skin at the corners of drepteazas eyes crinkled the ends of her mouth turned up the tiniest bit and we both know a man will say anything at all to coax a woman into bed with him what hasso did his best to look comically astonished it must have worked drepteaza burst out laughing which didnt happen every day or every week either she wagged a finger at him you are a wicked man wicked i tell you most of her was kidding she made that plain enough but down underneath at some level she had to mean it and so hasso couldnt just go on with the joke and say something like at your service instead he said well the lenelli think so too yes the priestess sent him a hooded look and it could be couldnt it that all of us are right a blizzard roared in that afternoon if anything it came as a relief to hasso it took his mind off the foot hed stuck in his mouth anyway listening to the wind wail watching it blow snow past almost horizontally reminded him there were bigger things in the world than his own foolishness for a while that morning he hadnt been so sure then his nose started to freeze so he quit watching the blowing snow it wasnt anything he hadnt seen before that was for damn sure next to some of the blizzards hed seen in russia and poland this one was no more than a plucky amateur he wondered how soon hed regret telling leneshul to get lost then he didnt wonder any more hed regret it as soon as he got horny again that was as plain as the chilly nose on his face but dammit she wasnt what he wanted yeah any pussy was better than none but he missed velona there was a woman and a half well more than a woman and a half when you got right down to it a woman and a goddess drepteaza wasnt a woman and a half she was so short she hardly seemed one whole woman but she was and then some and so so she didnt want him i cant win he muttered maybe she was a lousy lay maybe shed think he was a lousy lay maybe they just wouldnt work maybe im trying to tell myself the grapes are sour because i dont get to taste them aesop was no dummy he knew how things worked all right a lenello woman came in with his supper mutton stew it smelled like and heavy on the garlic he didnt much care for garlic but the bucovinans put it in everything this side of beer the pitcher of beer wouldnt be anything to write home about either as if he could write home from here then again the natives could have boiled him in beer and shoved garlic cloves up his ass so how could he complain good day the serving girl said in lenello good day hasso answered in his bad bucovinan you have heard about the trouble she asked most of the people who dealt with him here knew more lenello than he did back when the german tribes bumped up against rome how many goths and franks would have spoken latin quite a few probably no what trouble hasso stuck to bucovinan he needed the practice he was also out of the gossip loop no surprise he was a foreigner who didnt speak any known language very well still in lenello the serving woman said your people attack our border villages again much burning much killing my people i have no people here hasso said she looked at him as if he were an idiot that had to be what she was thinking too king botteros people she said speaking slowly and plainly you are from king botteros kingdom yes hasso couldnt even say no that had been his local address till the bucovinans captured him even so he told the serving woman the same thing hed told drepteaza i am not a lenello drepteaza listened to him drepteaza appreciated subtleties even rautat recognized the possibility that he might be different from the rest of botteros men the serving woman just sniffed you look like a lenello you come from botteros kingdom what are you supposed to be a parsnip she walked out of the room without giving him a chance to answer ja a goddamn parsnip he said in german what am i supposed to be god i wish i knew he poured beer from the pitcher into a mug she hadnt given him enough to get drunk on the grenye of bucovin didnt get smashed every chance they could the way so many grenye in the lenello kingdoms seemed to these natives didnt have to measure themselves against the big blond magicusing invaders every hour of the day every day of the week they still kept some sense of their own worth he ate the stew damned if it didnt have parsnips in it so now he was part parsnip anyhow he put more charcoal on the brazier crawled under his furs and blankets and went to bed what else did he have to do when he wasnt making gunpowder he hadnt taken a woman not leneshul not drepteaza not even this snippy servant he hoped aderno and velona wouldnt hound him in his dreams after everything else today that would have been too much even if he lived through it they didnt he got a full nights sleep or most of one anyway somebody banged on his door before the sun came up the next morning when he opened it rautat stood in the hallway can you use your gunpowder against the lenelli he asked the german word sounded odd in his mouth have you got enough do i have a choice hasso said if i do id rather not rautat scowled you better talk to lord zgomot he sent me xviii people who ran stuff didnt like you to tell them no it didnt matter whether you called them lord or king or fuhrer they still didnt like it for beans stories about hitlers tantrums even his carpetchewing made the whispered rounds in germany when you said no to bottero he could look as if he wanted to pinch your head off and as for lord zgomot well he just looked mournful we have some of this thing it is for once a thing the lenelli have not got why not use it against them then lord if you order i use it hasso said he didnt want to push his luck too far but this is not the best time they are on our land again zgomot said they are killing and raping and robbing the way they do why is this a bad time his tone said hasso had better have himself some goddamn good reasons and hasso thought he did he ticked them off on his fingers as he spoke first lord not much gunpowder yet we have more later the lord of bucovin nodded impatiently he knew that hasso went on second thing is better not to let lenelli know what you have too soon yes these are raids yes better to use gunpowder in big fight get big win not let them see what it does till too late he wished he could talk better even in lenello he sounded like a jerk to himself why should zgomot take him seriously if he sounded like a jerk and it was a good thing he didnt have to try to speak bucovinan he was better at it than he had been when he got to falticeni which meant dismayingly little when you came right down to it he still needed to go some to get to sound like a jerk in bucovinan lord zgomot sat lonely on his throne thinking things over torches crackled as they burned in their sconces fat candles glowed to either side of the high seat all the same in the predawn stillness the throne room was a cold dark drafty place torches and candles couldnt push darkness back the way lightbulbs did at last the lord of bucovin sighed it was cold enough in there to let hasso see his breath smoke you make more sense than i wish you did he said speaking slowly and carefully hasso remembered lenello was a foreign language for him too let it be as you say i will move against the bandits with ordinary soldiers as we have already begun to do hasso bowed you are wise lord am i zgomots tone was as bleak and wintry as the air inside the throne room you know i do not trust you completely or even very far you know i wonder if you do not want to use the gunpowder because you fear it will hurt the lenelli and you are still loyal to them in your heart he was uncommonly blunt scarily blunt in fact the dagger of ice that went up hassos back had nothing to do with the cold in here it is not so the wehrmacht officer insisted i want to hurt them more i am sorry it needs to be later this is not a big enough field to do it the good way the uh right way so you say zgomot leaned forward a little to eye him more closely so you say when you lay with the lenello goddess and our priestess does not care to lie with you never mind that you are tall and fair and they are tall and fair and we are not so tall and not so fair woman trouble will turn a man towards one side and against the other as easily as anything else more easily than a lot of things hasso thought of helen of troy and of brunhilde zgomot wasnt wrong not speaking generally and hasso longed for velona the way the tongue longs for a tooth after it got pulled never mind that it was hurting you the tongue still wanted it to be there wanted things to go on as they always had it wont happen tongue hasso thought velona tries to kill me now twice in my dreams he told the lord of bucovin so you say yes lord so i say if i am a liar about this i am a liar about everything that thought has also crossed my mind zgomots voice grew more wintry than ever and what about drepteaza hasso pemsel why ask me why not ask her hasso spread his hands a woman who does it but doesnt want to not much fun in that i think its a shame that is no lie but what can i do no you are not a lenello zgomot said as several bucovinans had before him hasso waited to find out why the sovereign didnt think so he didnt have to wait long zgomot continued most of the big blond bastards excuse me force our women for the fun of it we have seen that i daresay you have seen it too yes i see that hasso admitted what he could scarcely deny he might have argued that it wasnt true of most lenelli but he knew it was true of enough to make zgomots point for him maybe in this snow we can ambush a raiding party careful and methodical the lord of bucovin started making plans to deal with the enemy even if he couldnt do it the way hed wanted the lenelli didnt understand why they had trouble beating bucovin when so many other grenye kingdoms fell at the first shove hasso wondered whether zgomots father and grandfather were as clever as he was that might go a long way towards explaining things and why did magic have more trouble the closer you got to falticeni hasso didnt know neither did the lenelli obviously neither did the bucovinans there had to be a reason how would you go about finding out a real wizard might know hasso hadnt the faintest idea maybe he was lucky such things didnt work so well here maybe that had helped keep velona and aderno from cooking his brains in his dream he had no idea how to go about learning whether that was so either lord zgomot seemed to remember he was there you may go hasso pemsel for better or worse you persuaded me you persuaded me you arent deliberately lying to help botteros men anyhow i am not sure you are right but i am not sure you are wrong either so i will take your advice king bottero might or might not have listened to him whether he did or not he wouldnt have analyzed things so carefully hitler telling hitler no wasnt a good idea of course telling him yes might not be a good idea either because he often demanded the impossible hasso got out of the throne room as inconspicuously as he could when you were a big blond in a land full of squat brunets that wasnt very lord zgomots guards and his courtiers all followed him with their eyes till he was gone one thing zgomot hadnt asked him to do once gunpowder was out of the picture he hadnt asked him to go to bucovins western marches and either fight against the lenelli or use his magic against them why not an obvious question with an only too obvious answer he doesnt trust me that far he said so himself he almost turned back and volunteered to go fight the lenelli with bare hands if need be but he knew zgomot would turn him down and for reasons other than mistrust the wehrmacht wouldnt have handed a top panzer engineer a schmeisser and sent him out against the ivans he was more useful making better panzers and no corporal plucked from the ranks could replace him at that here hasso might be able to stand in for a bucovinan horseman but no native could stand in for him no lenello wizard could stand in for him either im unique he thought if hed known he would be so alone after he sat down on the omphalos he would have damn well done it anyway whatever his troubles were in this new world they beat the hell out of getting shot in berlin or enduring the red armys not so tender mercies whenever he felt bad about the way things were going he needed to remember that and he needed to remember that the difference between bad and worse was a lot bigger than the difference between good and better rautat ran into him in the hallway surely not by accident well the underofficer asked did you talk the lord out of using gunpowder yes i do that did that hasso answered his lenello wouldnt get any better in falticeni pretty soon hed have a bucovinan accent to go with the german accent hed never be able to help then hed sound really funny to somebody from drammen well well rautat didnt even try to hide his surprise you dont change zgomots mind every day he laughed at himself i never change his mind if not for you he wouldnt know who the demon i am life would be easier that way too life is never easy it has teeth hasso pointed to the dragons fang that had been here since before the lenelli crossed the ocean and found this new land for themselves rautat eyed the formidable fang most of the time i hope not such sharp ones hasso wouldnt have wanted anything with teeth like that crunching down on him either dragons live in the north he asked pointing in that direction yes of course everybody knows that rautat caught himself everybody but you i guess no dragons in the place you come from only mothersinlaw hasso answered it wasnt much of a joke he didnt think so anyhow rautat blushed like a scandalized schoolgirl though and giggled like one too we dont usually talk about those people he said you startled me when you did like dragons oh my he started giggling again he not only didnt like to talk about mothersinlaw he wouldnt even name them hasso wondered how big a taboo hed just violated not a small one not by rautats reaction how often do dragons come down here hasso asked maybe he could find out more about the motherinlaw business from drepteaza it might give him something to talk about with her that wasnt too dangerously intimate anyhow can you make them go one way or another he persisted vague thoughts of siccing a dragon on the lenelli flitted through his mind dragons come when they want to come you cant do anything about it we were lucky to kill even one rautat said we thought it was a miracle we thought we were wonderful then the big blonds came out of the west and we found out we werent so wonderful as we thought the way his eyes traveled hassos long frame said the german was still about ninetyeight percent lenello to him too maybe ninetynine percent since he felt much more lenello than grenye here himself and since those were the only choices he had in this world how could he blame rautat or drepteaza for seeing him that way lord zgomot gave whatever orders he gave hasso stayed in the palace in falticeni eventually he supposed after everyone else did he would find out what happened in the meantime he could keep on fiddling on with gunpowder getting ready for the real war he and zgomot and the rest of bucovin knew was coming he wondered how big a fool he was should he have promised the lord of bucovin the sun and moon and little stars gone off toward the western border and tried to get back to the lenelli back to botteros kingdom magic worked better in the west he might have put one over on the natives and slipped away without their being the wiser yes and then what he asked himself would bottero welcome him back with open arms after hed given bucovin the secret of gunpowder he hadnt even given that to the lenelli when was there time besides after rescuing velona he wasnt in such desperate need of another trick to keep himself alive among them and they were more willing to take him at face value unhappily he nodded to himself that was the phrase all right the lenelli wanted to accept him because he looked like them the grenye didnt because to them he was guilty of being a lenello till proved innocent and probably after that too his thoughts drifted back to the escape he hadnt made hadnt even tried what about velona would she welcome him back with open arms even more to the point would she welcome him back with open legs not by what hed seen in his dreams he hadnt just betrayed the lenelli not to the goddess on earth hed betrayed her personally when he lay down with leneshul that was how she saw it anyway she was good at an awful lot of things was she good at forgiving hasso didnt think so god damn it to hell he muttered there in the loneliness of his room i am fucked i am really fucked when he came out into the wider loneliness of the palace he felt the same way how could he help it he had trouble getting excited about working on the gunpowder he stayed careful and attentive with that because he didnt want to blow himself up with less urgent items like language lessons he had trouble meeting even a lesser standard drepteaza noticed right away shall i find you another tutor she asked are you so angry that i dont want to go to bed with you that you dont want anything else to do with me anymore i can understand how you might be it seems petty to me but maybe it doesnt to you no it is not you to emphasize that hasso spoke in bucovinan as best he could it is everything his wave took in not only the room not only the palace not only falticeni or bucovin but the whole world i do not belong here i never belong here never i think you are wrong i think you must be wrong the priestess said seriously you told me how you came here how you sat on the stone in your world and then suddenly you found yourself in this one yes and so hasso said the first thing i did when i got here was shoot myself some grenye the next thing i did was screw the lenello goddess on earth once upon a time hed thought that meant something important now now he had to do some new thinking but drepteaza insisted it must mean something hasso pemsel things dont just happen they happen for a reason what about the lenelli hasso asked she winced but she had the courage of her convictions even the lenelli came here for a reason she said then her mouth quirked in one of her wry grins to rob to kill to rape to enslave but she shook her head that is not what i mean they are part of the larger purpose too whose purpose hasso asked the purpose of your gods the purpose of the lenello goddess he didnt bother naming the god hed left behind in the ruins of berlin once upon a time hed been a believing christian how you could go on being a believing christian after five and a half years of war well he hadnt so what point worrying about that and they already had plenty of deities running around loose here what did they need with another one imported by the only man whod once believed in him i dont know drepteaza answered with another of those disarming grins the goddess is real that is plain we believe lavtrig and our other gods are real too though they are quieter in the way they poke the world with their fingers whether something larger lies behind all that well who can say but the wicked do not triumph forever nothing can make me believe that then why did the reds beat germany hasso wondered why wouldnt the usa and england see that stalin was more dangerous than hitler ever could be maybe god was out having a few drinks with the lenello goddess and the bucovinan gods that made as much or as little sense to hasso as anything else he spread his hands i have no answers priestess you would scare me if you said you did drepteaza said you would scare me worse if you made me believe you she eyed him more than most people you would make me wonder if you did say something like that me all im trying to do here is stay alive hasso said youve seen another world you must have had a god or maybe gods of your own there ja i was just thinking about him in fact he doesnt answer then why are you here now he shrugged it was a damn good question but again i dont know did the omphalos have anything to do with the god who was also father son and holy spirit the ancient greeks wouldnt have said so whether they were right again hasso didnt know drepteaza didnt want to leave it alone and she continued you spent all that time with the goddess on earth if you dont know more about such things than most people who does i know a good bit about velona what a lover can know in the time we were together a lover who has to learn a language first i mean hasso corrected himself about the goddess all i know about the goddess is that she frightens me shes bigger than i am well yes drepteaza said of course thats what makes her a goddess whether shes big enough to eat bucovin she thinks she is so far shes proved wrong but she keeps trying thinking you were bigger than you really were was one of the worst mistakes you could make not even hitler could argue with that not any more if you got into a war with the two biggest countries with the two strongest economies in the world mm chances were you wouldnt be happy with the way things turned out and chances were hitler wasnt if he was still alive is that all you need to be a god hasso asked to be strong he hadnt thought about it in those terms before back in his own world hed taken for granted the answers other people gave him he had more trouble doing that here because he was hearing different things from different people maybe theyre all wrong he thought but how can i know how do i make up my mind hed never imagined there could be such a thing as too much freedom but maybe there was and drepteaza looked at him in surprise what else is there hasso pemsel another alarmingly keen question hitler and stalin ruled their countries as virtual gods because they were strong some people would say one of them was good and some the other but who would say they both were nobody maybe it was true for beings genuinely supernatural too why wouldnt it be one reason occurred to him a god should be good too yes that to him needed to count more for real gods than for the selfmade variety what is good drepteaza asked and like pilate asking about truth she didnt wait around for the answer reports about the lenello raiders came back from the west they plundered and killed and then they withdrew how much bucovinan harassment had to do with that hasso couldnt tell he couldnt tell how much good his gunpowder would have done either he took another lover a woman named gishte he didnt think she was any more excited about him than leneshul was but she was more polite about it that would do for a while anyhow he made damn sure he never took another bath with drepteaza it wouldnt have meant anything to her that wasnt the point it would have meant much too much to him as things were he played back memories of her nakedness as if hed been a frontline signal cameraman filming it on the spot all sorts of crazy thoughts went through his head what would happen if he got enough gunpowder to blow up the castle here falticeni and bucovin would never be the same of course he would also blow himself up and he didnt want to do that if he were suicidal he never would have sat on the omphalos he would have fought on till he got killed it probably wouldnt have taken long rautat made sure he had plenty of beer and mead and even wine gishte liked that she got lit up whenever she saw the chance that told hasso some of what she really thought of him though she didnt slip even when she was drunk what good does drunk do you he asked her one morning before she started drinking hard what good does sober do me gishte returned a counterquestion for which like so many here he had no good answer he did hope she wasnt drinking because she was going to bed with a lenello or somebody who looked like one when he came right out and asked her about that she shook her head no youre not so bad and the priestess told me i didnt have to screw you if i didnt care to i just like to get drunk thats all what was he supposed to say to that plenty of lenelli liked to get drunk too scanno came to mind so did plenty of germans as for the russians the less said about that the better it didnt stop them from beating the snot out of the wehrmacht sometimes it even helped waiting in the trenches youd hear them getting plowed and yelling and shouting and carrying on and then theyd come at you not caring if they lived or died an awful lot of them did die which too often didnt stop the rest from overrunning your position hed seen so many drunken grenye in drammen hed figured all drunken grenye drank to avoid comparing themselves to lenelli didnt indians do that kind of thing in the united states drinking because you liked to get drunk seemed too ordinary to fit in with being a native maybe i have to start thinking of them as people hasso thought short squat dark mostly homely people who dont look like me gishte wasnt homely though she was a long way from gorgeous hed bedded gorgeous he knew about that the thought of velona and of losing velona stabbed at him again next to velona drepteaza wasnt gorgeous either well who was dammit velona turned movie stars plain with drepteaza it didnt seem to matter so much that was partly because drepteaza had one hell of a shape of her own as hasso had every reason to know and it was partly because drepteaza was interesting she didnt have the livewire aura that velona wore like a second skin but who did she also didnt go off like nitroglycerine if she got angry she was good people yeah shes good people hasso jeered at himself and she doesnt want thing one to do with you not that way even if you have seen her naked hey dont pour down all of that by yourself he told gishte and he got drunk too why the hell not he couldnt think of a single reason making love with gishte when they were both smashed was fun too he thought so at the time anyway and when you were smashed you didnt give a rats ass about anything but right then the bad news about a bender was you had to come down from it drepteaza eyed hasso as if he were something the cat was trying to cover up have a good time yesterday she asked at breakfast the next morning gnurf he answered squinting at her through eyes as narrow as he could make them wan winter sunlight and torches he usually wouldnt have tried to read by seemed much too bright today you need something better than porridge she said and spoke in bucovinan to a serving woman the woman came back with a bowl of strongsmelling soup what is it hasso asked suspiciously tripe and spices drepteaza told him it takes the edge off things feeling like a man defusing a bomb he tried it but the bomb had already gone off inside his head the soup did help calm his sour stomach he thought the mug of beer he downed with it went further toward reconciling him to being alive to his own surprise he did get to the bottom of the bowl of soup thanks he said to drepteaza in bucovinan better she looked at him like a feldwebel eyeing a private fresh from the russian front whod just painted paris red before paris fell again youre not going to be worth much the rest of the day are you she sounded more resigned than critical sorry hasso was sorry about how he felt that was for sure she startled him with a smile it happens she said youre a human being too that was how hasso turned the word into german in his mind anyhow the literal meaning of the bucovinan was somebody who speaks our language the ancient greeks had called foreigners barbaroi people who made barbar noises instead of words that meant something nemtsi the russian name for germans meant tonguetied ones or mutes considering how little bucovinan hasso actually spoke drepteaza either stretched a point or paid him a considerable compliment he stood up he seldom cared to do that around her it reminded her how different from her folk he was but right now that was exactly the point bowing he said not a cursed lenello eh she bit her lip did she turn red she was too dark and the lighting too gloomy to let hasso be sure you cant help the way you look hasso pemsel she said and i cant help looking at you and seeing what you look like rumors ran through the wehrmacht that hitler didnt trust field marshal manstein because he thought the officer had jewish blood mansteins impressive sickle of a nose no doubt had a lot to do with those rumors what was this but more of the same hasso sighed you see what you want to see whether it is there or not to make matters worse he had to say that in lenello it was too complicated to let him turn it into bucovinan maybe i do probably i do in fact drepteaza said also in lenello and what do king bottero and his men see when they look at us what does velona see when she looks at us did her voice take on a certain edge when she named the goddess on earth hasso thought so before he answered he sat down again looming over her if he wasnt making a point was just plain rude besides his head hurt less when he got off his feet you know what they think he said uncomfortably and hed thought the same thing till he came to falticeni as a captive how could he help it oh yes i know drepteazas nod was a ripple atop an ocean of hardrestrained bitterness i know too well we are small and swart and ugly and the lenelli can work magic and we cant to the lenelli that turns us into something not much more than beasts but only a handful of them are wizards the rest are as mindblind as we are does that turn them into beasts too scanno had pointed out the same thing when hasso stayed in drammen hed never once asked about it he wondered why not king bottero could no more cast a spell than drepteaza but bottero wizard or not was tall and fair and blueeyed to the lenelli that put him several steps up on the natives didnt german propaganda go on and on about jewish mouths and noses didnt the aryans of the reich look down their straight noses at italians because they were small and dark and excitable negroes the less said about negroes the better the fuhrer hadnt wanted to shake that colored sprinter and jumpers hand even after he won all those gold medals at the berlin olympics and coming back to this world the bucovinan priestess was dead right most lenelli were as mindblind as her own folk that didnt turn them into untermenschen in the eyes of their countrymen all that talk was talk the lenelli didnt like the grenye because they looked different they talked different and they were in the way those were all common enough reasons for two folk not to like each other germans and frenchmen sprang to mind but the mindblindness gave the lenelli an extra excuse to use the natives any way they pleased it all seemed as plain as a punch in the jaw to hasso who looked at the way things were here from the outside suddenly out of the blue he wondered what a lenello dropped into his world would think of the reichs racial notions would they look as foolish to him as botteros ideas did to hasso he was damned if he could see why not hell some of those policies looked foolish even to a lot of germans if theyd used all the people in the ussr who hated communism and stalin instead of jumping on them with both feet and driving them back into the red fold they could hardly have done worse on the eastern front and there were times when soldiers didnt move because trains were busy hauling jews around behind the lines if you were going to deal with the jews like that wouldnt after the war have been a better time why didnt i pay more attention to this while i was there hasso wondered he hadnt seen any need to that was why everybody set above him everybody beside him and everybody below him seemed to have pretty much the same ideas my god we threw the stupid war away and we didnt even know it what only when drepteaza asked did he realize hed spoken german nothing nothing i can do anything about now anyway hasso answered sheepishly something from back in the world i come from oh drepteaza sent him a shrewd look something that has to do with a woman there she might be shrewd but that didnt make her right he shook his head no not with a woman with my kingdom and with its affairs the reich wasnt a kingdom of course but explaining what it was was beyond him in either lenello or bucovinan it might have been beyond him in german too drepteaza didnt press him which was something of a relief she just said i hope youll remember youre here now he nodded im not likely to forget it he said ha scanno called when hasso came down to the soldiers buttery a couple of days later the renegade set down his spoon he was eating tripe soup that morning he went on they do let you out every now and again yes every now and again hasso didnt feel like talking to him and then all of a sudden he did can i ask you a question scanno spooned up another mouthful of soup then he said you can always ask if i dont like it maybe ill kick you into the middle of next week you can always try hasso said politely too politely he wasnt afraid of scanno not even a little bit the renegade scowled at him scanno was as arrogant and full of himself as any other lenello hasso didnt care he asked when aderno tries to put a spell on you in drammen how do you know he cant oh that scanno laughed on account of ive had other wizards try to ensorcel me and not a one of em could do it not since i was a kid matter of fact really hasso said sure why the demon would i waste my time lying to you scanno returned to his tripe soup which seemed more interesting to him than hasso was makes your insides hurt not quite so bad anyway he remarked yes i know hasso said at which the renegade laughed have you got any idea why this is so hasso persisted scanno started to shake his head then thought better of it hung over hasso had made that same quick choice more than once just talking hurt less and scanno did never even worried about it its something about me thats all like ill spend the night farting if i eat leeks for supper right hasso said sometimes you could find out more about somebody than you really wanted to know he tried a different angle do you remember when this starts not when you are a child no after that like i told you scanno frowned trying to remember if youre smart you dont want wizards trying to mess with you he observed hasso didnt say anything hed already seen that scanno wasnt smart that way and sure as hell the renegade continued mustve been about fifteen years ago i called some high and mighty wizard a cocksucking son of a whore and he told me hed turn me into a pig for that and the bastard tried and he couldnt and what do you do what did you do afterwards hasso asked i pitched his sorry arse into a hog wallow and better than he deserved too scanno answered ive had a couple of other runins with those walking chamber pots since and theyve never been able to bother me i see actually hasso wished he did hed taken scannos immunity to magic as part and parcel of what made spells falter near falticeni maybe he was wrong maybe it was personal well that could be interesting too how do you suppose this happened spells work on most lenelli yes sure scanno said i always figured it was because i was such a tough bastard he would have seemed tougher if his hands didnt shake and if his eyes didnt look like a couple of pissholes in the snow instead of pointing that out hasso said if you ever see why talk to me talk to drepteaza talk to lord zgomot the bucovinans want to know they need to know how to keep magic from biting on them when they get far from falticeni tell me about it the poor sorry bastards scanno laughed can you see botteros face if it didnt bite that made hasso laugh too because he could then scanno said boy wouldnt it make the goddess on earth pee in her drawers hasso didnt deck him that only proved he had even more discipline than hed ever imagined he did make a growling noise down deep in his throat he couldnt help it the worst of it was knowing scanno was right if magic did fail against bucovin velona would be incandescent she was gone lost she wanted him dead he wanted her back the grenye in drammen had plenty of reasons to get drunk so did hasso in falticeni xix lenello raiders went on harrying bucovins western villages all through the winter they kept some of the towns they seized that bothered lord zgomot who said they are going to jump off from those places when they really pick up the war again come spring well of course hasso said when word of the lord of bucovins comment got to him through drepteaza he heard everything second and third and fifthhand when he heard of it at all this is not what the lenelli usually do she said i wonder why not hasso said are they really so stupid i did not think so when i was with them that got him summoned before zgomot did you give the blonds the idea of biting and holding on instead of biting and letting go the lord of zgomot demanded i dont know lord hasso answered i dont think so i dont remember talking about it with them not like that king bottero just thinks one fast campaign will break bucovin hasso had thought the same thing why not he hadnt known any better hitler had thought the same thing about the russians well so much for that so much for this too maybe you made them think about the way wars are supposed to work lord zgomot said lavtrig knows youve done that with us we dont see things the way we did before we caught you all the gods know thats so was that praise hasso supposed it was though he suspected the lord of bucovin wasnt sure either you were going to send out raiders lord the german remembered any luck with them not much zgomot answered the border is the border magic works there it works just fine we could not gain surprise ah hasso wondered whether this clever little grenye would ask him to give the raiders some kind of sorcerous smoke screen he thought he might be able to figure out how to do that he wasnt a trained wizard but hed seen that he could make magic work but zgomot asked him nothing of the sort hasso remembered what hed heard about the natives and sorcery a wizard whod work magic for them would decide that as the seeing man in the country of the blind he ought to show them which way they should go and if they didnt feel like going that way he would try to make them do it no their experience with sorcery was far from happy instead the lord of bucovin said will we have enough gunpowder to fight the big blond bastards excuse me hasso pemsel the big blond lenello bastards when they invade us this spring because they will or do you doubt it no lord i dont hasso answered for a long time hitler had disguised his aggressive plans bottero didnt waste any time trying the lenelli were very direct in their dealings with grenye you have it i want it im going to take it the gunpowder zgomot prompted sorry lord my thoughts go somewhere else yes we should have enough if their wizards figure out how to set it off at a distance though what we have then is trouble lord zgomot took that in stride when did grenye have anything but trouble since the big blond bastards first washed ashore here never once and there are all kinds of trouble too you know king bottero is married to old king iesis daughter hasso knew queen pola came from the lenello realm just north of botteros hed forgotten iesis name if he ever knew it but he could say yes lord without stretching things too far well i hear iesi may move east too the lord of bucovin said i dont know whether his army will come separately under his command or march along with king botteros in one big host but they may move if they come by themselves we should hit them first hasso said oh why because bottero already knows some of my tricks the german replied we can surprise iesi and his men or i hope we can anyhow if we drive him back then we deal with bottero try to deal with bottero but he kept that to himself you dont think bottero will have told iesi about the kinds of things you do that will have told perplexed hasso for a moment he didnt hear a future perfect every day before he could answer zgomot took care of it for him no of course he wont if he ever had to fight iesi or one of the other blond kings he would want to be able to give him a surprise fair enough if iesi comes by himself we try to hit him first and knock him out of the fight he might be mindblind but he was nobodys fool neither was bottero come to that if you were going to make a halfway decent king brains were an asset do you let me fight your enemies lord hasso shook his head in exasperation he felt mindblind himself fighting with languages he didnt speak well enough will you let me fight your enemies lord zgomot looked pained hasso knew things he didnt and could do things he couldnt that made the wehrmacht officer valuable it made using him necessary and losing him unfortunate it also made him dangerous as if that werent obvious enough anyway hasso came in a large blond package i do not want you hurt the lord of bucovin picked his words with care you didnt want to offend the captive genie lest it turn on you after gnawing at the inside of his lower lip for a moment zgomot added i do not want to take the chance that you will desert to the lenelli again either he must have decided that hasso could see that he could see the possibility it was in the mildest possible way a compliment it was one hasso could have done without if you dont trust me to fight why do you trust me to make gunpowder for you he asked maybe i blow the palace to the sky hed thought about it maybe you will zgomot said steadily my thinking is you are less likely to do that if you stay inside the palace yourself hasso gave him a crooked grin my thinking is youre right he remembered russians whod killed without caring for their own lives before things really fell to pieces in the reich the papers had stories about japanese pilots who flew their airplanes into american warships hasso admired their courage without wanting to emulate it he liked living dying at the age of shot by an outraged husband struck him as a good way to go this also strikes me as one more reason to keep you where you are zgomot said damn hasso thought he could see why it would strike the lord of bucovin that way how do i persuade you that you can trust me he asked zgomot gave him the courtesy of taking the question seriously he didnt answer right away but plucked at his beard as he thought things over if you fight well against botteros men he said at last that may convince me if you dont let me fight against botteros men how am i supposed to fight well hasso inquired less acidulously than he might have zgomot stroked his chin again his eyes twinkled or maybe it was just a trick of the light it is he admitted a puzzlement iesi didnt move bottero kept moving he worked more methodically than he had during the autumn that invasion had been a blow aimed at bucovins heart when it failed to reach falticeni when it failed period the lenelli pulled back to their own border now bottero was trying something different he was taking one town making sure he had it and then going on to the next making sure he had a town involved either massacring the local grenye or chasing them off to the east with no more than the clothes on their backs some of the women didnt even get those as news of what the lenelli were doing and how they were doing it came to falticeni lord zgomots face got longer and longer his own people had to be screaming at him to do something how long would he stay lord of bucovin if he didnt whatll happen to me if bucovin gets a new lord hasso wondered he feared it wouldnt be good he also feared zgomot would order him to use gunpowder against the lenelli and he didnt think the time was ripe if you have trouble attack from an unexpected direction that maxim had served the germans especially manstein well in russia so hasso decided hed better take the initiative with zgomot before zgomot took it with him lord you are in touch with a lot of grenye inside botteros kingdom is it not so he asked yes of course it is so zgomot answered impatiently his temper was fraying round the edges something hasso hadnt seen from him before you ought to know it is so outlander if what you told me is true you did your best to keep them from doing bucovin any good and your best was better than i wish it were so why do you want to know now can you touch them off now that hasso had gunpowder he could use figures of speech based on it he hadnt realized how many of those there were till he had to do without them if the peasants blow up behind botteros line hell need to leave bucovin alone to deal with them gods help them when he does zgomot said hasso only shrugged the lord of bucovin sent him a measuring stare youre as coldblooded as a serpent arent you hasso pemsel with another shrug hasso said if i serve bucovin i have to think of bucovin first yes yes if you serve bucovin zgomot didnt mean it the same way hasso had well he had his reasons for doubting the german his biggest reason likely was that hasso looked like a lenello besides hasso was fighting on king botteros side when the bucovinans captured him the lord of bucovin wouldnt forget it or that hasso had been boffing the goddess on earth none of that would inspire confidence not from zgomots point of view all right maybe my looks arent the biggest reason hasso thought but they sure arent the smallest one either back to business now what i tell you to do probably does hurt king bottero hasso said i dont see how it can hurt bucovin a lot of grenye in botteros kingdom arent even bucovinans i should hope not they belong to the small tribes the weak tribes zgomot said bucovinans had almost as much scorn for the grenye whod quickly succumbed to the invaders from overseas as lenelli did for grenye in general but the lord of bucovin continued even if they are ruined men i hate to throw them into the fire they are still of our blood of our flesh what good does it do them if bucovin falls hasso asked zgomot grunted a point no doubt i do not know how much good an uprising will do us but i do not suppose it can hurt and you are right of course we have ways of making one happen if the border was as tightly held as hasso had tried to arrange it wouldnt be so easy to sneak into botteros realm hed tried to make it hard for grenye to sneak out of the lenello kingdom though he hadnt worried about any of them sneaking in he thought he would have sooner or later but he hadnt yet so many different things going on and how much attention would botteros marshals and wizards pay to his advice now that he wasnt in drammen anymore how much attention would they pay now that hed gone over to the other side they would probably do the opposite of anything hed ever proposed just on general principles if he aimed to return to the lenellis good graces hed find some magical way to get in touch with aderno and warn him the uprising was coming could he manage to touch the wizard in his dreams maybe he could he whistled softly talk about playing both ends against the middle next question was did he want to try anything like that he fit in better in drammen than he did in falticeni no doubt about it but fitting in better wasnt the same as fitting in well no doubt about that either and aderno and velona had both done their level best to kill him which didnt encourage him to try to do anything nice for them if i could get velona back again any man would do almost anything to have a woman like that but it wouldnt be the same as it was he could see as much however much he wished he couldnt and except for velona he had no overwhelming reasons to prefer the lenelli to the grenye i look right among the lenelli there was the other side of zgomots worrying about his loyalty because he was big and blond it did matter but only so much he was a foreigner in botteros kingdom too even if a less obvious foreigner grenye women are homely much of that went back to velona again velona would have been a knockout a knockout and a half anywhere next to her most lenello women were homely too hasso wouldnt have wanted to end up in bed with queen pola for all the tea in china he did think the average lenello woman was prettier than the average grenye drepteaza he muttered to himself no matter what he thought of drepteaza she didnt think much of him she thought he looked like a goddamn lenello was what she thought and there he was banging headon into looks again youre thinking hard zgomot startled him out of his none too happy reverie yes lord hasso couldnt very well deny it you dont say much the lord of bucovin remarked my head is full of mud hasso answered i dont have much worth saying no eh zgomot didnt believe him but seemed too polite to push about it since hasso hadnt told the whole truth that was just as well zgomot lifted an imaginary mug may you bring as much confusion to our enemies may it be so did hasso mean it he decided he didnt want to try to reach aderno in his dreams so maybe he did when scanno was sober he remembered he was a fighting man he liked to practice with hasso now i can pick on somebody my own size he said he was bigger than the german too but only a little when they used wooden practice swords he did pick on hasso even halfdrunk which he was a lot of the time he was better with a blade than the wehrmacht officer ever would be how old were you the first time you picked up a sword hasso asked rubbing his ribcage where one of scannos strokes had got through he would have an ugly bruise there tonight the renegade shrugged i dont know he said two three maybe four if youre going to be a warrior you need to be a warrior you start learning how as soon as you can that was true among the prussian junkers too but not to the same degree learning to shoot a rifle especially a modern one with a flat trajectory and good sights was a lot easier than learning to fence and ride handtohand combat in hassos world was nice to know but you needed it a lot less than you did here lets try spears hasso said the bucovinans used shafts with rags padding the end the same as the lenelli did had they come up with the idea on their own or borrowed it from the blonds hasso wondered whether even the locals knew any more he could hold his own with spears that made him feel better about himself and his place here moral dont get caught with just a sword he thought though the day was chilly he and scanno worked up a good sweat thrusting and parrying scanno swigged from a big mug of beer cant sweat all the good stuff out of me he said wiping his forehead on his sleeve he took another pull at the mug now i suppose youll want to thump my sorry ass you give me fencing lessons shouldnt i give you wrestling lessons hasso hoped he sounded more innocent than he felt he did want some of his own back if youre going to be a warrior you need to be a warrior who says said that somebody who looks a lot like you me and my big mouth scanno gave a crooked and rather slacklipped grin all right lets get it over with you can throw me around like a sack of beans hasso did too he also got thrown around some himself even if scanno wasnt so quick learning the new moves as orosei had been but then orosei was the kings masteratarms and scanno never more than middling good he might have learned faster had he stayed sober more but he might have done all kinds of things had he stayed sober more at one point in the proceedings he landed on his head he didnt move for close to a minute afterwards hasso eyed him in some alarm he hadnt intended to throw him that hard you didnt want to hurt anybody while you trained but accidents happened every now and then just when the german was about to see whether artificial respiration would do any good scanno rolled over sat up shook his head and winced got to make my eyes uncross there he said sorry hasso told him i didnt mean to do that shit happens scanno shrugged then winced again dont think i got hit so hard since i ran into a dragons skull right hasso said scanno was full of figures of speech for a hangover he hadnt heard that one before but he liked it wait wait scanno shook his head once more despite the horrible face he pulled as soon as he did it you think im talking about being drunk dont you i really did run into a dragons skull came cursed close to killing myself doing it too he got to his feet it took some effort but he managed hasso steadied him well all right that sounds like a story worth hearing i know what you mean you mean you wont believe a bloody word of it the renegade said that was exactly what hasso meant but he didnt feel like admitting it scanno went over to his mug of beer and upended it hasso didnt think he could have drunk so much at a single draught but he hadnt had scannos practice this was probably about twenty years ago you understand sure hasso said a lot of things could change in twenty years twenty years ago hitler was probably just about getting out of jail and publishing mein kampf the weimar republic still ruled germany whose army was just big enough to blow its own nose and maybe to sneeze if it got permission from france and poland first the shackles of the treaty of versailles still held the country down hitlerd thrown them off all right just the way he promised he would and started down the path that would wreck the reich far more completely than versailles did i was hunting deer in a nobles forest you know how it is scanno said poaching hasso knew just how it was yeah you better believe it buddy scannos grin was utterly without selfconsciousness or guilt i needed the venison a demon of a lot more than that rich bastard did too my backbone was rubbing against my belly and there arent many feelings worsen that one tell me about it hasso had been hungry more than he cared to remember on the eastern front who hadnt uhhuh scanno took hunger for granted too in this world one bad harvest meant people went hungry two bad harvests in a row meant famine scanno continued so there i was where the law said i wasnt supposed to be right at the beginning of summer you know when everythings all green and grown and luscious me and my bow sneaking through the woods he grinned again relishing the memory so you run into a dragon then hasso said i hear about one in king chersos realm what was it three years gone by now i heard about that one too never saw it cause it never came this far south goddess be praised scanno still swore by the lenello divinity then that was interesting or might be yeah i ran into a dragon all right only not quite the way you think tell me more hasso urged scanno could spin a yarn all right how much of it to believe well you could always figure that out later before going on scanno refilled the mug from a pitcher cant hardly talk with a dry throat he remarked and poured down another good draught after what hed drunk hasso wouldnt have been able to walk but the lenello seemed to need more even to feel a buzz where was i in the woods running into a dragon oh yeah i spotted this buck a big old fat buck nice antlers on him too if you care about that kind of crap me i was after meat he was upwind of me so my scent didnt give me away i did the best sneak ever i mean ever till i got close enough to draw and let fly hit the bastard too he quaffed again then what happened yes hasso was hooked in spite of himself you know how it is only way you can kill clean is through the eye or maybe through the heart if youre lucky i got him maybe a palms breadth back of the heart he was gonna die and die pretty cursed quick but not right there worse luck he took off running and i took off running after him i didnt want to lose him you better believe i didnt he wouldve kept me eating for days and days how did you run into the dragon then hasso asked how with my head thats how i was crashing through the bushes after the stag and i tried crashing through one and crashed into the dragons skull instead the bushes had grown up so you couldnt see the bones i guess all that dead dragon made good manure for them i went wham next thing i knew i was lying on the ground and quite a while had gone by how could you oh the sun hasso felt foolish he was used to wristwatches and clocks and always knowing just what time it was getting accustomed to slower more approximate timekeeping hadnt been easy scanno nodded thats right i woke up with a demon of a headache and with a gooses egg right between my eyes if i was going a little bit faster i bet i wouldve broken my stupid head i got up that took some doing too and i found what id run into what about the buck hasso asked gone scanno said mournfully i lost the blood trail the other side of those bushes hiding the skeleton the headache i had i lost my appetite too but i knew that would come back sooner or later i didnt quite starve or i wouldnt be here now right right hasso said its a good story but you dont believe a word of it i didnt say that like you needed to scanno drew out something on a thong from under his tunic lots of lenelli and grenye wore amulets of one kind or another scannos was plainer than most a fragment of what looked like bone drilled through so it would take the leather thong this is dragon skull i worried it off with my knife hard like anything i had to hone the blade afterwards all right for all hasso knew the bit of bone came from a donkey he didnt want to argue with scanno though what was the use he couldnt prove the lenello renegade was lying or maybe he could if he could master the truth spell aderno had used would it work here in falticeni most magic seemed to falter here and adernos spell for that matter had faltered against scanno back in drammen instead of experimenting with sorcery hasso asked do you want to throw me around for a while sure scanno said eagerly and he did hasso used the baths in the palace almost every day scanno laughed at him for that the lenelli were a less cleanly folk than the bucovinans hasso took the ribbing and ignored it hed been clean and hed been dirty and he liked clean better besides even with the drafts the bathhouse had to be the warmest room in the palace rautat noticed his habits too one more thing that says you really arent one of those people even if you look like them the veteran underofficer remarked as he scrubbed in a hot pool of an afternoon his scars werent puckered craters like hassos they were long pale lines on his dark skin im me thats all hasso answered they were both using bucovinan hasso had got to the point where he could follow it pretty well he spoke more hesitantly yeah well you arent so bad rautat ducked his head under the water and came up blowing like a porpoise thanks hasso submerged too when he came up a couple of women were walking past heading for another pool they chatted idly paying rautat no attention and hasso hardly any people in the palace were used to him by now neither of them wore any more than shed been born with the bucovinans were easy in their skins easier than the lenelli and much easier than any germans except a few resolute naturists back in germany hasso had always thought those people were nuts when he landed in a country where everybody took nudity in stride he had to think again hed been doing nothing but thinking again since he landed in this world what was one more time he did notice that just as he tried not to bathe while drepteaza was in there she also found ways not to come in while he was if she was already washing when he came in she hurried to get out if he got there before her she would wait till he finished she didnt seem angry at him not when they met for language lessons or to talk about gunpowder and other things he knew and the natives didnt maybe she thought he wasnt just seeing her nude he was seeing her naked if that was what was going on he didnt want to come right out and ask her he admired her tact he also admired her for understanding that foreigners had different ways of looking at things whether literally or metaphorically and if that was what she thought she was dead right he wished she were interested laying grenye women who gave themselves to him because they were supposed to was better than not laying anybody but he remembered velona too well after going to bed with her the natives didnt seem like anything special and except as convenient bodies he didnt care much about leneshul or gishte drepteaza would be different he was sure of that it wasnt just that she was prettier than they were she was smarter and livelier and and she wasnt interested in him you cant have too much of what you dont want somebodyd said that where hasso could hear it and he thought it was true screwing the grenye women gave him physical relief yes indeed but it wasnt what he wanted so every time he did it he felt emptier inside yeah drepteaza would be different he was sure she would except he was what she didnt want he wasnt a lenello no matter what he was he looked like one for the priestess the way he looked was plenty not wanting somebody because of how he looked wasnt that surprising not really hasso had judged plenty of people by their looks frenchmen and women jews ivans poles it was much less enjoyable when other people judged him you worked in drammen you say he said to rautat there in the baths anything was better than brooding about all the reasons drepteaza wanted nothing to do with him thats right rautat nodded water dripping off his chin and the end of his nose wanted to pick up the lingo wanted to learn things the lenelli know and we dont did it too and came home what do you think of lenelli then hasso asked bunch of big blond pricks rautat said promptly no offense yeah sure hasso said they both grinned well its the truth they treat grenye like donkey turds in the street rautat said and the grenye there some of them are so beaten down they feel like they deserve to get treated that way poor sorry bastards if they try to stand up they get knocked down is it any wonder so many of em stay plastered all the time i guess it doesnt get to you so much that way what about lenello women no hasso couldnt stay away from the sore spot big blond cows rautat replied who wants a gal taller than he is velona was damn near as tall as hasso he thought he would have wanted her if she were three meters tall whether she would have wanted him then of course was a different story and queen pola was almost as tall as he was too and he didnt want her for beans if she were fifteen or twenty centimeters taller than he was she would have made him want to run away maybe you have something there he said you better believe it like any good underofficer rautat was sure of himself i guess lenello women are all right for you cause youre a big blond guy yourself he didnt say big blond prick again which was something but me i pick on somebody my own size hasso thought that was what the idiom meant anyhow it might have been bawdier he didnt want to leave the baths before long it would be spring and then summer bucovin would warm up but it wasnt warm now even if velona had been right it didnt get as cold as russia dammit he couldnt get her out of his head he didnt want to be one of those men who spent years mooning after a lost lover and never did get on with their lives he didnt want to no but he didnt know what he could do about it hed really and truly fallen in love with her shed warned him not to how were you supposed to listen to a warning like that though if you were a male human being how could you help falling hard for a gorgeous sexy woman who screwed like there was no tomorrow velona had warned of worse than a broken heart but that was bad enough but not many women none he knew of except her could have come so close to frying his potatoes for him when she was in drammen and he was in falticeni and yet if i got back to botteros kingdom and velona took me back would i be happy would i want to pick up where we left off as soon as he asked the question he saw the answer bet your ass i would it wouldnt be the same though oh maybe for her it would she wouldnt have changed any well a little or she wouldnt take him back no matter what but hed spent as much time by now in bucovin as he had in botteros realm hed seen the other side of the hill and like scanno hed seen things werent quite so simple as most lenelli thought velona and bottero and the rest of the colonists from across the sea thought grenye were little and ugly and stupid and mindblind the last two werent the same but each amplified the other and they thought that because of all those things they could push the grenye aside like so many animals domesticating some and killing the rest and using the land they took any way they pleased well the grenye were little no matter what rautat thought hasso liked lenello looks better as far as he knew the natives were mindblind but so were almost all of the big blonds dammit the grenye were people some of them were stupid but so were some lenelli lord zgomot and drepteaza were as smart as anybody hed run into in drammen did they deserve to get pushed to the wall hasso wondered why he hadnt wondered about any of that stuff when he rolled into russia in a halftrack on june the ivans turned out to be as smart as anybody else too did they ever hitler should have spent more time wondering about that stuff too the other side of the hill hasso muttered whats that more of your language rautat asked which made him realize hed slipped into german what does it mean the bucovinan went on it means i see drammen and i see falticeni too hasso answered i get to know drammen and falticeni both well so have i rautat said so have lots of bucovinans not so many lenelli here some like scanno and some traders and some spies most of them just want to get as much from us as they can they dont give a turd what we want he cocked his head to one side as he had a way of doing i used to figure you were like that now im not so sure sometimes you act like a human being there it was again somebody who speaks our language and they were still speaking bucovinan hasso managed a wry smile well i try yeah i know rautat said seriously not a fart of a lot of big blond pricks who do he gave back a smile that matched the germans like i always say no offense tell me another one you little prick hasso retorted little dark prick just didnt sound right rautat splashed him he splashed back they ducked each other and raised hell like a couple of sixyearolds hasso had never imagined having fun in falticeni but this sure felt like it xx when spring came king botteros men stopped harrying bucovin for a while anyhow hasso wasnt surprised like fall spring was the mud time rasputitsa the ivans called it they needed a word for it because they had a godawful one all of winters snow melted there and for six weeks nothing moved it wasnt so bad here but it wasnt good and reports came back from the west that the grenye peasants in botteros realms were kicking up their heels hasso felt good and bad about that at the same time it took some of the pressure off bucovin which was why hed proposed it to lord zgomot but the lenelli were bound to give the rebellious natives a hard time we have to take care of ourselves first zgomot observed and those grenye arent bucovinans anyway ive said so before yes but theyre people hasso answered zgomot gave him an odd look that is the last thing i would expect to hear from a lenello he held up a hand before hasso could reply i know you are not a lenello by lavtrig hasso pemsel i do you look like one though and you cannot say you do not and so i naturally think i understand your lordship its an easy mistake to make lots of people here do it hasso had made plenty of mistakes along those lines himself he thought he kept his tone smooth here he must not have done such a good job though for zgomots gaze sharpened you wish some of those people looked at you in a different way one person in particular perhaps perhaps hasso agreed tonelessly how much had drepteaza told the lord of bucovin about that what did zgomot think of it whatever it was it didnt show on his face hasso went on nothing i can do about it i look the way i look not any other way most of us are guilty of something like that zgomot said hasso chuckled in spite of himself the lord of bucovin had a refreshingly cynical view of the world he added after a while other people might even forgive you for it one person in particular again might really again hasso did his best not to show too much with that he hoped casualsounding question zgomot nodded did one corner of his mouth quirk up just a little hasso thought so but wouldnt have sworn to it he decided he needed to know more did she tell you that he asked not in so many words women do not like to put things in so many words the lord of bucovin replied but you listen to what they do not say and you watch them and after a while maybe you start to know what is going on now he was smiling and smiling crookedly and sometimes you are right and sometimes you are wrong and that is what makes women women ja hasso said you cant live with em and you cant live without em they say the same kinds of things about us zgomot said it would not surprise me if they were right too no wouldnt surprise me either hasso agreed if you would excuse me lord where are you going a moment later zgomot waved aside his own question never mind i think i can guess you will likely find her in the temple at this time of day thank you lord the palace had its own temple the palace had enough of its own things to be almost a city of its own within falticeni with its smithy and bakeries and storehouses and chapel which hasso recalled only too vividly king botteros palace was the same way were the grenye imitating the lenelli again or was that just the nature of working palaces plenty of the ones back in europe were cluttered places too paintings and statues some in wood others in stone of lavtrig and the other bucovinan gods ornamented the temple they werent a handsome pantheon like the gods of greece and rome or even an impressively grim one like those of scandinavia some of them looked like the forces of nature they were supposed to represent others were monstrous in one way or another the god of death had a corpsepale face and fangs like a viper they got more macabre from there drepteaza was lighting a taper in front of a god or perhaps goddess whose earthly representation was a lump of brownish sandstone after murmuring a prayer she nodded good day hasso pemsel good day hasso answered what is that deity what does he she do jigan endures drepteaza told him enduring is a useful thing for grenye to be able to do these days dont you think useful for anyone hasso said do you will you talk to me he tried to do his talking in bucovinan he still felt more fluent in lenello but he wanted his accent which was not like the one the lenelli had to remind her he differed from them i will talk with you she said what do you want to talk about us hasso said drepteaza frowned im not sure theres anything to talk about should there be anything to talk about i hope so hasso started to say i think so but changed his mind halfway through he didnt want to sound like someone who was insisting he was in no position to insist if drepteaza wanted him dead all she had to do was speak to lord zgomot and he would die slowly if she felt like it no harm in talk she said now shall we go out to the garden no one will bother us there or if anyone tries we can send him away with a flea in his ear that was how hasso translated the bucovinan phrase anyhow the literal meaning was a flea on his ass bucovinan was an earthy language gardens were not an idea the natives had had for themselves along with so much else theyd borrowed the notion from the lenelli several nobles in drammen had formal gardens behind their homes lord zgomot had one on the palace grounds as much to show he was somebody as to admire the flowers a gardener trimming bushes took one look at the priestess and the tall foreigner and decided to find something to do in a different part of the palace he was no fool in his muddy sandals hasso would have done the same thing or maybe the fellow was had he hung around hasso would have paid him to go away hasso didnt recognize many flowers big stretches of the garden werent blooming yet not everything was even green drepteaza sat down on a bench of some hard smooth reddish wood after a moment hasso sat down beside her she didnt move away on the bench which was or at least might have been reassuring she seemed as selfpossessed to say nothing of selfassured as usual well hasso pemsel what do you want to say she asked now that he had to talk he felt tonguetied how long had it been since he really talked to a woman the last time you did with velona he answered himself but that wasnt the same thing theyd been lovers before they could talk to each other at all it had to be back before the war then after the fighting started hed sweettalked french shopgirls and russian peasants into bed with him but that wasnt the same either with them as with the grenye women here he wasnt doing anything but screwing life got complicated when you wanted more than that well if he chickened out now hed probably never get another chance with drepteaza hell if he chickened out now he wouldnt deserve another chance faint heart never won fair lady the worst that could happen if she told him to get lost was hed feel even more miserable than he already did he jabbed a thumb at his own chest i am no lenello he declared was he getting it out in the open or just being clumsy damned if he knew yes ive seen that drepteaza agreed gravely when you first got here i wasnt sure what you were now i think you are what you say you are a man from another world who joined the lenelli because you found yourself among them and because you looked like them hasso could have done without that last but when he saw three little dark men chasing one tall blond woman what was he supposed to think had he seen three lenelli chasing one grenye woman well who could say what he would have done life wasnt in the habit of letting you take it over he made himself nod yes i look like but am not he pointed at himself again i told you i know that drepteaza replied it matters less than you think im afraid you still do look like one i dont see how i could want someone who looks like that there it was plain as a wet fish in the face you look like a grenye hasso said doesnt bother me that surprised her he could see as much her answering smile was sweet and sad plenty of lenelli have lain with grenye women most men are less choosy than most women when they want they take whatever they can find for screwing sure speaking bucovinan hasso had to be blunt too if screwing all i want i be happy with leneshul and gishte more to life than just screwing i think yes no maybe yes sometimes drepteaza said you flatter me you know she had to explain what flatter meant when hasso nodded she went on i dont think a lenello would waste his time talking like this he would think i was his because he was a lenello and i wasnt not a lenello hasso said one more time he slipped an arm around her drew her close to him and kissed her she didnt scream or beat him over the head or even try to get away she just didnt kiss him back if a onesided kiss wasnt the most useless thing in the world hasso had no idea what would be he broke it off in a hurry im sorry drepteaza said his hand still dead on her shoulder it isnt there i almost wish it were things might be simpler but i wont lie to you do you want me to leave you alone and have nothing to do with you from now on would that be easier for you ill do it if you want she would do almost anything if he wanted her to except what he really wanted her to do lord zgomot dammit wasnt as smart as he thought he was hasso shook his head what difference does it make he said dully as if in afterthought he lifted his hand drepteaza didnt slide across the bench to put some distance between them she sat where she was confident he wouldnt do anything more than hed already done he had no idea where to go from there he didnt see anything he could do or say that would make any difference muttering he heaved himself to his feet and strode off hasso she called after him hasso pemsel he kept walking she said something no wellbroughtup german woman would have imagined let alone said was it aimed at him or at herself or at both of them at once he didnt know and he told himself he didnt care when he went back into the palace he ran into gishte almost literally she was carrying an armload of clean linens up a corridor come with me he said right now she sounded surprised and maybe a little annoyed too couldnt he see she had other things to take care of but he nodded right now she sighed men she went with him though back in his chamber he did what he chose to do when it was over she got up and squatted over the chamber pot to free herself of as much of his seed as she could put on her clothes picked up the linens and left he lay there no happier than he had been before he went into her you cant get too much of what you dont want now he knew exactly how true that was he sure as hell did and what good did knowing do him no good at all he couldnt think of one goddamn thing that did him any good at all i think it is time for us to show the lenelli what we have time to show them they would do better to leave us alone zgomot said whatever you want lord hasso answered two days after drepteaza turned him down he still had trouble giving a damn about anything all right then by the lord of bucovins tone he hoped it was all right but he wasnt a hundred percent sure also by his tone he hoped hasso wouldnt notice what he said next explained why i shall send you to the west hasso pemsel this gunpowder is your stuff you know more about it than we do you will use it best against the enemy i do that hasso agreed will i do that or will i see whether bottero and velona oh velona will take me back after all lying in velonas arms he would forget about drepteaza lying in velonas arms could make you forget your own name but youd sure be happy while you were forgetting rautat and some of the others who have worked with you will go along zgomot said they will learn from you and see how you do what you do then they will be able to do it for themselves did that mean then we wont need you anymore maybe or maybe lord zgomot suspected hasso knew more than he was telling hasso did and he wouldnt have been surprised if zgomot suspected the native was one sharp cookie the german was damn sure zgomot meant rautat and the others will keep an eye on you it made sense from the lord of bucovins point of view hasso could be dangerous for bucovin or he could be dangerous to bucovin he nodded now as if blissfully unaware of everything zgomot had to be worrying about whatever you want lord he repeated he wasnt about to argue not when zgomot was letting him leave the palace leave falticeni and get somewhere near the lenelli once more the roads dried out enough for him to move with a wagon a few days later the wagon carried jars full of gunpowder he finally had fuses that worked well enough considerable experiment had shown that cord soaked in limewater and gunpowder did the job better than anything else hed found anyhow i want to see the lenelli when things start going boom rautat said as they left falticeni he and hasso rode horses hasso wasnt about to try to drive the wagon an art about which he knew less than he did about egyptian hieroglyphics rautat went on the noise will be plenty to scare them all by itself once maybe maybe even twice after that no hasso said catapults his thoughts came back to them again the lenelli and the bucovinans imitating them as usual used them as siege engines but not as field artillery he wondered whether the natives or the renegades in falticeni could flange up something that could travel with an army and would let him fling jars of gunpowder two or three hundred meters load them with scrap metal and rocks along with the powder the way he had with these and theyd make pretty fair bombs in the meantime in the meantime hed have to lay mines and set them off with fuses he whistled tunelessly that might not be a whole lot of fun how was he supposed to get away again afterwards why didnt you think of these things sooner he asked himself one obvious way around the problem was to use an expendable bucovinan to touch off the fuses the poor son of a bitch would probably even think it was an honor the natives hated the lenelli the way hasso didnt like completing the thought but he did the way the russians hated us after muresh and the calculated frightfulness of the winter attacks and after years of similar things the bucovinans had their reasons for hate like that and the germans had given the russians plenty of reasons of that sort too looking back hasso could see it plain enough well the ivans got their revenge when the pendulum of war swung back toward the west why am i helping this folk against that one when im more at home over there hasso wondered was that why the omphalos stone brought him to this world he had trouble seeing how it could be then the landscape started looking more familiar somewhere not far from here you catch me he said to rautat thats right the bucovinan nodded were only a little ways away from the battlefield if you know how hard we worked to open up a gap in our line to make you aim your horses there without having it look like we wanted you to nicely done hasso said you fool the lenelli you fool me too rautat grinned as if the idea were all his but he said lord zgomot is a clever man better to use your own strength against you he said hasso nodded it was good strategy if you could bring it off manstein had when the red army charged west after stalingrad and then got an unpleasant surprise and the russians had at kursk the next summer letting the wehrmacht bleed itself white trying to bang through defenses tens of kilometers deep nobody in the other world would ever hear about lord zgomots ploy maybe nobody in this world would either not in any lasting way the lenelli did most of the writing here and they were no fonder than anyone else of chronicling their own defeats but hasso knew full well what zgomot had done he messed up my life along with botteros campaign the german thought they came over the top of a low rise and started down the other side hasso started to laugh it was that or pound his head against something you waited for us here he said a few heads skulls now pretty much sat on poles lenello helmets atop them as a memorial to the battle the pits the bucovinans had dug still yawned unconcealed now but the field had been efficiently plundered even the horses skeletons were gone what had the natives done with them burned them and smashed them to powder for fertilizer he supposed yes we did rautat said we were scared shitless blond bastards are bad enough anyway and we didnt know if the thunder thing would hit us again but you stood hasso had to respect that the bucovinan underofficer shrugged cant run all the time have to stand somewhere or we lose sometimes you stood and you lost anyway hasso knew all about that the hard way so no doubt did rautat they rode on bucovinans had reoccupied the keeps on both sides of the bridge over the oltet theyd torn out the makeshift planking the lenelli put down to force the crossing and replaced it with new stronger timbers as the wagon jounced and rattled and banged across hasso was glad if it went into the river he would have to start over or would that be so bad it would give me the perfect excuse not to fight the lenelli then he got over onto the west bank of the oltet and into what was left of muresh new shanties had gone up since botteros men sacked and plundered and raped and killed there but plenty of devastation remained the people stared without a word as a big blond rode through the place in the company of bucovinans nobody threw anything at him which was good but hasso remembered what had happened the autumn before maybe there were reasons to fight the lenelli after all once theyd ridden out of muresh hasso asked how far ahead are king botteros men in bucovinan the question needed only two words german often made compound words bucovinan revolved around them we still have a ways to go rautat answered another two words they arent even where we fought the first battle last fall not a strike at the heart this time more like taking away a hand and half an arm hasso nodded he had the same impression of botteros strategy the lenelli had got themselves a bloody nose when they charged ahead too fast now bottero seemed to want a digestible piece of bucovin once he had it hed go and take another bite and then no doubt one more that wasnt how hasso would have gone about things which wasnt the same as saying it wouldnt work the rule here seemed to be that the lenelli moved forward and the grenye gave ground before them sometimes they didnt move forward very fast sometimes the frontier stood still for years at a time but they never seemed to move back maybe ill fix that hasso thought yeah maybe i will and maybe ill do something else instead who knows what the hell i can do if i set my mind to it he himself had no idea that should have alarmed him sometimes it did sometimes he thought it was blackly funny when he came to the first battlefield he wondered whether he ought to comb the ground for the cartridges his machine pistol spat out could wizards do something nefarious if they found one for the life of him he couldnt see how not when the schmeisser would never work again do you know did you know a fellow named berbec he asked suddenly rautat shook his head hasso asked the rest of the bucovinans with him but they didnt know berbec either who is he rautat asked sounds like one of our names it is hasso explained how hed acquired the native on the field here i dont know what happens to him after i get caught maybe he belongs to velona now i hope she treats him well velona one of the bucovinans asked she was my woman hasso would have left it there rautat who knew more shared the gossip with his countrymen they all muttered back and forth too low for hasso to make out what they were saying finally the driver of the powder wagon a stocky fellow named dumnez said the big blonds goddess is strong yes hasso said nobody whod ever come within a kilometer and a half of velona would have dreamt of saying no that woman the goddess lives in is strong too rautat said so maybe dumnez hadnt been talking about velona after all rautat went on i saw her in both battles last fall im glad i didnt get within reach of her sword one of the other bucovinans pointed at hasso he must be pretty strong too then if she was his woman he is pretty strong not the best swordsman but pretty strong rautat said pretty tricky too lord zgomot thinks well of him he does hasso almost blurted it out in surprise if the lord of bucovin did think well of him he kept it to himself mighty well but if zgomot didnt think well of hasso all he had to do was say the word and the german was a dead man the native whod pointed said the priestess likes him pretty well too even if he is a blond hasso stiffened rautat hissed like a snake the other bucovinan winced though plainly he wasnt sure how hed stuck his foot in it hasso was worse luck maybe drepteaza did like him but she didnt like him enough or didnt like him the right way rautat obviously knew as much if the other fellow didnt he had to be out of the loop sure enough rautat said dont pay any attention of peretsh he doesnt know what the demon hes talking about i can see that for myself hasso said they traveled west in silence for some little while when they started running into parties of bucovinan soldiers hasso knew they had to be getting close to the marchlands botteros men were trying to occupy lord zgomot wasnt going to give up his territory without a fight in a way seeing the soldiers made hasso feel better he wasnt out here by himself against everything the lenelli could throw at bucovin in another way well my life gets more complicated he thought he hadnt expected things to be simple every so often he caught rautat watching him when there was no earthly need for it the underofficer always looked away in a hurry when he noticed hassos eye on him but hasso had a pretty good idea of what was going on in his head the native had to be wondering what the big blond would do when it came time to fight the folk who looked so much like him who could blame rautat for wondering that who could blame him especially when hasso was wondering the same thing himself hasso stared into the setting sun shielding his eyes from the glare with the palm of his hand the village in the distance was only blackened ruins he didnt see any lenelli moving around there but they wouldnt be far off he wished hed had a pair of field glasses around his neck when he splashed down into the swamp he knew something about gunpowder but hed never worried his head about optics the lenelli up ahead whether he could see them or not they were there couldnt see him he and rautat crouched side by side in thick bushes the rest of the bucovinan escort and the powder wagon waited behind the crest of a rise half a kilometer farther east somewhere around here youll start planting them right rautat said ja hasso answered absently the bucovinan accepted it that was one word of german hed learned hasso went on run a fuse from here over to the road wait and watch for botteros men to ride forward rautat laughed in eager anticipation then theyll find out they arent so cursed smart ja hasso said again and then lets go back plenty to do before we start to dig and to hide like eat for instance rautat rubbed his belly as if on cue it growled like an angry dog the bucovinan laughed so did hasso they scooted back through the bushes hasso had learned his forestfighting techniques in russia where any mistake was worth your life rautat was as good at moving silently as he was maybe better of course rautat had been hunting in the woods since he got big enough to carry a bow hed had more practice than hasso had a tiny almost smokeless fire crackled ten meters or so away from the wagon with the jars of gunpowder the bucovinans understood that they couldnt get careless with fire around it hasso hadnt let anybody who didnt understand that come along with him dumnez was toasting a hare above the flames three more lay by the fire already gutted and skinned and ready to cook yes the bucovinans could hunt all right hasso got his share of the tender meat you couldnt keep going forever on hare and rabbit not enough fat in them but they made a good supper every so often as the sun set and darkness deepened hasso looked westward again he didnt think the lenelli would be able to spot the fires glare over the rise ahead even if they did odds were they wouldnt make much of it they had to know the bucovinans were keeping an eye on them that wouldnt impress them not for beans nothing the bucovinans did impressed them bucovinans were only grenye after all softly hasso began to chant some of the charm was in german some in lenello he faced away from rautat and the rest they wouldnt hear his spell or make anything of it if they did he snorted in rhythm with the spell he wasnt sure there would be anything to make of it if they did for one thing he was an altogether untrained wizard for another he was still in bucovin even if hed come back close to the border with botteros kingdom if it didnt work then it didnt that was all he would take a different tack in that case but it worked all right when he turned around rautat and dumnez and peretsh and the rest lay sprawled close to the little fire all of them snoring softly i really can do this he thought excitement surging in him along with the excitement went a little bit of shame bucovinans were only grenye after all they couldnt work magic and had no defense against it his knees clicked when he got to his feet he wondered if he ought to cut the natives throats before he went west he couldnt make himself do it they could have killed him but they hadnt he also wondered whether to take the powder wagon with him theyd already unhitched the horses though he doubted he could harness them by dim firelight he also feared that the noise would wake the bucovinans spell or no spell by myself he murmured in german and wasnt that the sad and sorry truth wherever he went in this world he was irrevocably by himself joining with velona the way he had disguised the truth for a while but it was there still and all he came closer and closer to fitting in among the lenelli than with the bucovinans and so auf wiedersehen he started west by himself he went up the road till he got close to the crest of that rise no point making things hard on himself then he ducked into the undergrowth for he didnt want any lenello sentries to spot him coming up to the top of the high ground back in russia a sniper would make you pay if you did something stupid like that the lenelli didnt have scopesighted rifles or machine guns but he didnt want them thinking somebody was sneaking up on them in the dark they could lay a trap for him before they realized he wasnt a bucovinan he leaned against the trunk of a scrubby oak just for a second he told himself or maybe a little longer why not he didnt want to sneak through the bushes toward king botteros men in pitch darkness maybe an indian could do that in a movie and not make a godawful racket or maybe a bucovinan hunter or a lenello poacher could do it for real hasso knew damn well he couldnt and he didnt just want to tramp up the road in the dark either that was asking to get killed and so he yawned he slumped down against that tree trunk as he yawned again he wondered if he was getting caught in the backwash of his own sorcery he also wondered if he could do anything about it as his eyes slid shut he was sleepily doubting it the next thing he knew it wasnt altogether dark and the light filtering through the bushes was coming from the east from behind him christ he said he was awake now awake and sweating bullets if rautat and the rest had come after him they could have gutted him like a trout were they still sleeping hasso nodded to himself they just about had to be otherwise they damn well would have come after him and he would have woke up with his innards ventilated one way or another so his magic still had to be holding back there oh yeah im one hell of a wizard i am he muttered as he got to his feet im so good i put a goddamn spell on me it might work out for the best he thought and tried to make himself believe it now he could approach the lenelli in broad daylight they would see he was no dark little grenye that would let him get close enough to explain what he was and who he was and how hed escaped the barbarians from then on everything ought to go smooth as motor oil on a camshaft his stomach rumbled almost as loud as rautats had the day before he had a length of garlicky pork sausage in a belt pouch the lenelli would know he was coming out of bucovin just by the smell they ate onions but to them garlic was fit only for grenye hasso wasnt wild about it himself but eating it made him feel like an italian not a savage he worked his way forward through the woods for a while then stepped out into the road he hadnt gone more than about a hundred meters before a lenello stepped out from behind some thick bushes sword in hand hassos right hand fell automatically to the hilt of his own blade he stopped where he was perhaps twenty meters from the blond who overtopped him by five or six centimeters who the demon are you whered you sprout from the lenello demanded my names hasso pemsel i just escape escaped from the bucovinans hasso hadnt spoken much lenello lately it felt awkward on his tongue well so did bucovinan funny handle youve got you talk weird too the big blond said where are you from anyway another world hasso answered i am the fellow who comes uh came here by magic i am the goddess lover for a while and i want to be again too whether velona wants me to well ill just have to see thats all the lenello pickets eyes almost bugged out of his head its the traitor its the goddesscursed renegade he yelled at the top of his lungs then he swung up his sword and charged hasso for a second the german just stood there like an idiot a millimeter from too late he drew his own sword he managed to turn a stroke that would have cut him in half from crown to crotch then he dropped the sword the lenello was still caught in his aborted followthrough hasso jumped in close he grabbed the big blonds wrist and twisted the lenello dropped the blade you cant do that he gasped says who hasso twisted once more cruelly this time the lenello gasped again on a different note above the sound of breaking bone as he went white hasso brought a knee up into his crotch he folded up on himself like a straight razor hasso kicked him in the face while he was falling if you got into a fight like this you didnt dick around shouts came from the west so did the thumps of men running in heavy boots hasso didnt wait to find out whether they had crossbows wherever he was going it wasnt back to botteros kingdom he grabbed his sword dashed for the bushes and did his unmagical best to vanish xxi they did have crossbows the bastards quarrels rustled through the leaves and branches and thudded into sometimes right through trunks the lenelli wanted to put them right through hasso he couldnt go as quietly as he wanted because they were pushing hard after him the more noise he made the more foliage he disturbed the better the target he handed the archers he had to give the lenelli something to think about or theyd catch him and kill him he picked up a rock and flung it off to one side luck was with him it crashed off a trunk or a thick branch there he goes botteros men yelled to one another after him dont let him get away they crashed toward whatever the rock had hit hasso moved that way too now he was trying to be quiet the lenello behind whom he suddenly appeared had no idea he was there till a callused hand covered his mouth and jerked his head back the blond did no more than gurgle as a knife sliced across his throat hasso slipped off the other lenelli took longer than they should have to realize they were following a trail that led nowhere sondrio one of them called as they regathered whered you go sondrio if sondrio was who hasso thought he was he wouldnt answer till judgment day the lenelli all started calling for him he was over this way wasnt he somebody said by then hasso wasnt over that way anymore now hed gained a little separation from his pursuers and he could use all the skill at skulking he had if they were going to catch him they would have to earn it they werent such hot stuff in the woods themselves he was glad he wasnt up against the trackers and poachers orosei had given him by the aryesh at last one of these guys stumbled over sondrio perhaps literally dead the lenello yelled horror in his voice hes dead bled like a goddesscursed hog all the soldiers started shouting and carrying on then which was just what hasso had hoped for he must have grenye in the woods with him one of them said sondrio ran across them and look what they did to him they didnt imagine that hasso might have doubled back that must have seemed too crazy even to contemplate maybe it was too hasso wondered how dumb hed been dumb or not he got what he wanted they quit chasing him if they thought the undergrowth was full of lurking little swarthy men with knives well they could do that they could do whatever they damn well wanted as long as they didnt mess with him he didnt breathe easy till he got back over the rise that shielded the bucovinan encampment no he didnt feel easy then either if rautat and the rest of lord zgomots merry men were waiting for him with blood in their eye well what happened then if both sides wanted to kill him he was dead meat why didnt you think of that sooner you dumb asshole but he knew why down below his belly down in his balls and his dick he didnt want to believe velona didnt want him anymore didnt love him anymore didnt want to lay him anymore however you put it he didnt want to believe it even if it was true no especially if it was true want to or not he didnt see that he had much choice any more with adernos help shed tried to fry him twice at long range even that hadnt convinced him which only proved he was a jerk or he was thinking with his cock assuming those two werent one and the same no way in hell though that botteros soldiers would have done their best to massacre him unless their goddess told them it was all right since they had she must have damn he looked back over his shoulder he stopped so he could listen nothing either way he breathed a sigh of relief which differed only in his own mind from the panting he was also doing the lenelli behind had given up chasing him now what was going on with the bucovinans ahead however much he didnt want to he had to find out he couldnt very well stay right here and carve out a oneman realm sandwiched between botteros and zgomots since the lenelli wanted him dead for sure he had to hope the bucovinans didnt how much fancy talking would he need to do the answer turned out to be none when he got back to the camp he found rautat and the rest of the natives still sawing wood theyd hardly moved from where they were lying when he slipped away he hadnt expected his magic to work that well of course he hadnt expected it to clobber him either next interesting question was could he wake them up again if he couldnt he would have to throw them into the wagon and get out of there as best he could but rautats eyes opened when hasso shook him whats going on the bucovinan said and then seeing how light the sky was lavtrig is it daytime i was supposed to take a watch in the night wasnt i i dont know i dont keep track of that hasso said they didnt give him night watches they didnt trust him not to desert to the lenelli and they had reason not to fortunately they didnt know for sure what good reason they had rautat scrambled to his feet did anybody keep watch in the night doesnt look like it were all asleep he started shaking his countrymen as he did he went on did the lenello doglegs use a spell on us you couldve just walked off and we never wouldve known the difference or were you asleep too till a little while ago hasso answered the spell had got him too that it was his own spell hadnt occurred to rautat damn good thing too the german thought the other bucovinans woke up as readily as rautat had but how long would they have gone on sleeping if hasso hadnt got rautat moving he had no idea where are the lenelli anyway dumnez asked as he ambled off to take a leak behind a tree somewhere over that rise hasso and rautat answered together then we dont have to worry about them right away peretsh said lets eat breakfast that was such a good idea nobody said a word against it hasso ate hard bread and an onion a funny breakfast but any food was better than none as hed found out too often in russia he washed it down with lousy bucovinan beer if he knew anything at all about brewing he could have made a fortune among the lenelli or a bigger fortune in bucovin he started digging holes in the road filling them in and running lengths of fuse off to the side yeah hed tried to desert but his magic seemed to have covered his tracks the other side didnt want him this side did even if he didnt much want it it looked like his best bet his only bet right now what are you doing rautat asked you arent putting any gunpowder in those holes i know hasso started digging another one a hole in the ground wont hurt anybody even with a fuse running off from it i know hasso said again i should have cut your throat in the pit and saved myself the aggravation rautat opined do you have some kind of reason for doing this the way you are ja hasso went on digging without another word the air rautat blew out through his lips made a whuffling noise will you tell a poor dumb grenye savage what your brilliant reason is hasso realized hed pushed it as far as he could when bucovinans talked like that they were only half kidding the other half was all pain and rage they didnt want to think they were as stupid and backward as the lenelli made them out to be they didnt want to but they had trouble thinking anything else when they made those jokes about themselves youd better not agree not if you were big and blond so hasso said you arent dumb but the lenelli think grenye are you know that i saw that he wanted to remind rautat he wasnt what he looked like well sure the underofficer said but whats the point of the holes i want the lenelli to see dugup places in the road i want them to see fuses even burning fuses hasso answered i want them to see that none of that does anything then they forget about it they think stupid grenye try to make magic and of course it doesnt work then they dont worry about dugup places or fuses any more you follow he wasnt just kissing rautats ass the bucovinan was plenty smart and after frowning for a few seconds rautat started to laugh yeah i get it bugger me blind if i dont one of these times they wont be just dugup places theyll be jars of gunpowder and the lenelli wont even care till too late thats it hasso agreed rautat came over to him pulled him down so their faces were on a level and kissed him on both cheeks like a frenchman rautat had been eating onions too and hadnt cleaned his teeth any more recently than hasso had they were odorous kisses hasso didnt care he was glad to get them but if hed kissed the bucovinan he would have felt like judas so we dont drive forward then dumnez had the wagon ready to go we drive back instead thats right hasso said theyll think we were scouts or something or maybe a crazy merchant because of the wagon rautat said one of the other bucovinans pointed west toward the rise here come some of the bastards he called lets get out of here rautat said that was a wonderful order hasso was sure he couldnt have put it better himself when we get over the next rise we can make some more fake holes he said someone ought to stay behind to light fuses for them i do it if you want there are bushes to hide in no ill let gunoiul take care of it rautat pointed to one of the bucovinan escorts we cant afford to lose you if anything goes wrong we cant afford to have you go back to the lenelli either rautat didnt say that hasso thought he heard it even so rautat was right to worry too hasso would have gone back to botteros men if only they would have taken him since they wouldnt he was stuck on this side he was he feared stuck on the losing side no matter what he showed the bucovinans there was only one of him all the lenelli had several hundred years worth of technology the natives didnt no matter how hard they were working to get it and the lenelli had magic and the grenye couldnt match that no matter what they did so the big blonds insisted and hasso hadnt seen anything to make him think they were wrong well so what he muttered in german rautat gave him a quizzical look he pretended he didnt notice it wasnt as if he hadnt fought in a losing war before any german whod been on the eastern front knew all about a losing war knew more about it than anybody in this world was likely to hell any german whod lived under a rain of allied bombs that only got worse and worse knew all about a losing war maybe the bucovinans were doomed to go under the reich had turned out to be but like the reich they could sure make their foes remember theyd been in a fight all of his escorts joined him in digging holes in the road east of the next rise they had fun running lengths of fuse into the undergrowth off to either side of the dirt track gunoiul grinned because he was the one who got to stay behind and light some of those fuses dont let em catch you now rautat warned him we dont want them knowing what we know hasso beamed at him in pleased surprise somebody who understood what security was all about dont worry about me gunoiul said i dont want those whoresons nabbing me either and they wont ill catch up with you tonight if i cant do it any quicker than that the wagon and the riders with it retreated farther east still hasso kept looking back over his shoulder his companions and he were moving faster than the lenelli the filledin holes in the road and the lengths of cord that ran from them confused the invaders out of the west anyhow maybe they made them wary hasso could hope so he and the natives had done all that digging to give the lenelli the willies to give them the willies for a little while anyhow then the big blonds would decide it was all a big bluff one more weird useless thing the barbarians did to try to scare them and they would stop paying attention to filledin holes and to cords that ran from them even if the cords sizzled and smoked once they stopped paying attention well that was the time to show them they shouldnt have and once a bunch of lenelli went skyhigh they would never be able to trust any filledin hole in the ground with a cord again they would have to treat all of them as real even if most of them wouldnt be dummy minefields served the same purpose in hassos world a few lying signs could slow down a whole armored division hed seen it happen grenye peasants back in the lenello kingdoms can make these holes too he remarked to rautat the lenelli cannot will not trust their own roads rautat laughed youre full of evil notions arent you i try hasso said modestly yes you do rautat eyed him again if you arent careful you know youll have us trusting you in spite of everything no you wouldnt do that hasso exclaimed as if it were the worst thing he could think of all the bucovinans thought he was a funny fellow how much would they be laughing if they knew hed tried to bail out the night before not so very much he feared rautat ordered a halt after they made it over the next low swell of ground if the blonds come after us well go on he said but if they dont well wait here for gunoiul none of the bucovinans argued sounds good hasso said rautat gave him a hooded look that he understood too late his position in the chain of command was ambiguous to put it mildly what kind of rank badge did an important collaborator wear when it came to gunpowder rautat had to listen to him he was the expert when it came to tactics the way it did here the native could choose for himself he didnt need hasso butting in they waited no lenelli came over the crest of the hill to the west after an hour or so gunoiul popped out of the bushes the little dark man was grinning from ear to ear you should have heard them you should have seen them he said well tell us the story rautat urged as he must have known he was supposed to the big blond bastards just kind of poked at the holes at first made sure they werent horse traps you know gunoiul said then i started lighting the uh fuses he glanced toward hasso whod given him his technical vocabulary the lenelli saw the fire and smoke going through the grass and they started having puppies it was the funniest thing you ever saw they were yelling and pointing and carrying on like you wouldnt believe all the bucovinans laughed nothing they liked better than discomfited lenelli did they send soldiers after you dumnez asked they sure did gunoiul said i could have shot a couple of them too easy as you please but i made a scary noise instead he went woooo on a high wailing note and got out of there good hasso punched him in the shoulder the way he would have with a soldier on the eastern front whod done something unexpected and clever they wanted to spook the lenelli here and gunoiul had found a new way to do it well after that they didnt want to go very fast let me tell you the bucovinan continued i didnt have any trouble staying ahead of them and lighting more fuses thats what we wanted by lavtrigs curly beard rautat said and now that youre back we want to get out of here in case you stirred up an even bigger hornets nest than you think hasso would have said that if rautat hadnt the wehrmacht officer figured there was a pretty good chance the lenelli were well and truly stirred he also figured the filledin holes and smoking crackling fuses had only so much to do with it botteros men knew he was around even if rautat didnt know they knew and the lenelli wanted him no not dead or alive they wanted him dead or dead as he rode off toward the northeast he wondered whether he could escape to some other lenello kingdom than botteros that way he would have a chance to live among folk who looked like him and who thought more like him than the bucovinans did but when would he get that kind of chance and even if he did werent all the lenelli likely to reckon him a renegade now besides some other lenello kingdom wouldnt have velona in it there was only one of her that there was one of her seemed more than miracle enough if he couldnt have velona how much difference did it make whether he lived among lenelli or grenye and so i think maybe you truly are lord zgomots man rautat said out of the blue hasso started to laugh who said the small swarthy men couldnt work magic rautat not surprisingly didnt get it whats so funny he demanded nothing hasso said nothing he wanted to talk about anyhow i think i am truly lord zgomots man too dammit he added but only to himself the dreams came back two nights later hed been free of them for months and thought they were gone for good no such luck as he lay asleep wrapped in a blanket by a fire that had guttered down to crimson embers he felt someone stalking him through the inside of his own head i ought to work out a spell to put a stop to this he thought which would have been wonderful one of these days but not now patient as a wolf chasing an elk the lenello wizard pursued him through slumber and finally caught him hasso was anything but surprised to find it was aderno what do you want the german asked what are you up to aderno returned none of your business not after you try to kill me twice hasso said its my kings business by the goddess when aderno named her hasso saw velona behind him its my folks business i am no part of your folk you make that plain enough when i come to you all you want to do is murder me what are we supposed to do with you yes that was velona seeing her hearing her even in dreams tore at hasso from the inside out youre up to something with the cursed grenye you lenelli dont want me anymore hasso didnt waste time denying it king bottero tried to ransom you the savage who runs bucovin wouldnt take his money velona replied what she said was true and also missed the point lord zgomot was a decent capable worried rather gray little man doing the best job he knew how in a predicament hasso wouldnt have wished on his worst enemy to the lenelli he was only a grenye he would have been only a grenye to hasso too but for the fortunes and misfortunes of war sorry i cant do anything about it hasso said then you try to kill me should i love you after that he started bleeding inside again he still wanted to love velona and wanted her to love him we were denying you to the enemy aderno said he made perfect military sense he also made hasso want to wring his neck the combination reminded the german of some of his own countrys less clever policies during the war he said when you try to kill me you turn me into an enemy if youre a dead enemy it doesnt matter the wizard said if the reich had knocked the russians out in six weeks nothing else would have mattered since they hadnt they had to try to deal with the consequences of that failure only to discover they couldnt now aderno and velona were trying to deal with the consequences of failing to kill hasso they could try again and they might succeed if they did you are up to something with the grenye velona made that sound even more disgusting and outrageous than sleeping with a little swarthy woman they could kill me and they dont hasso answered stolidly more than i can say for some people killing is better than renegades deserve killing is much better than renegade wizards deserve velona was as implacable as an earthquake her dreamself turned to aderno now hasso had thought his own modest sorcerous abilities were what had kept him from harm when the two of them struck at him in falticeni maybe those abilities helped but hed forgotten falticeni lay at the heart of bucovin the place where for whatever reason lenello magic was weakest here near the western border he didnt just scream himself awake as he had in lord zgomots palace he puked his guts out as if hed eaten bad fish he shat himself too he thought his ears were bleeding but he was in too much more immediate torment to stick a finger in one of them and find out when he had to piss he pissed dark what had they done to him everything but kill him plainly while the fit was going on he almost wished they had rautat and the other bucovinans stared at him while he writhed and heaved id heard about this at the palace the underofficer said to his comrades hasso heard his voice as if from a million kilometers away it wasnt so bad there he was right nothing could have been as bad as this hasso would rather have stood out in the open during a volley of katyushas than go through this and if that didnt say everything that needed saying what could the only good thing about the fit was that it didnt last long once it passed hasso lay on the ground spent and gasping like a fish out of water give me a little beer he choked out dumnez poured him some he didnt swallow it but used it to rinse his mouth it couldnt get rid of all the foul taste some of his vomit had gone up his nose where is a stream he asked need to wash back over there rautat pointed will anything more happen to you i hope not hasso said his drawers were ruined beyond hope he used them to wipe himself as clean as he could then threw them away from now on he would be bareassed under his trousers well the world wouldnt end he was battered but almost unbowed when he came back to the embers of the fire look at the moon its still the middle of the night rautat said were going back to sleep can you do the same i dont know i find out hasso answered grimly aderno and velona hadnt attacked him twice in one night did that mean they couldnt he could only hope so in what was plainly meant for consolation rautat said soon now youll give the lenelli worse than they just gave you and it did console where it wouldnt have before that only went to show how badly abused hasso was i will he said and he really meant it for the first time since his capture get moving you fools a soldier shouted the word for fools literally meant donkey heads bucovinan was not without its charms the small swarthy warrior went on the accursed lenelli are on their way lots of them how about that rautat said and then to hasso if lots of those big blond bastards are coming this is the time to use the gunpowder for real yes yes hasso answered he hadnt exactly chosen bucovin hed had the choice made for him botteros followers wanted him dead well if they thought that was what they wanted now he was going to give them some real reasons to feel that way we dig real holes we put jars of gunpowder into them we light the fuses boom rautat said hasso nodded rautat continued and they wont be expecting it they think its all a bunch of grenye crap he laughed well show them whats crap all right one thing hasso said rautat raised a questioning eyebrow hasso pointed at himself i light the fuses this time he waited for rautat to swell up and turn purple he waited for the bucovinan to say he was too valuable to do something like that which meant he couldnt be trusted to do it he had all his arguments ready he was braced to threaten to put a spell on the powder so it wouldnt go off unless he lit it himself if they provoked him enough he was ready to try to cast that spell but rautat only nodded youve earned the right well find a good spot with thick growth by the side of the road that way youll have an easy time getting away same as gunoiul did you really aim to let me do this hasso couldnt hide his surprise rautat nodded again i really do if you arent loyal to us now you never will be either way its about time we found out he turned to the rest of the bucovinans whod traveled west from falticeni come on you lazy lugs this is what we came here for weve played all the games now we give it to the lenelli the way weve wanted to give it to them ever since they got here so dig curse you they dug like moles if hed told them to dig to china or whatever lay on the other side of this world hasso thought they would have done that the hope of getting their own back against the lenelli fired them like burning gasoline was this how the russians felt when they started winning after the wehrmacht pushed them back more than a thousand kilometers across their own country maybe this was even fiercer because the grenye had been retreating not for a year and a half but for generations they must have wondered if they would ever get the chance to go forward but here it was if the gunpowder worked rautat talked to the soldier who warned of the advancing lenelli not too much later he talked to another bucovinan this one an officer sweating in a helmet and mailshirt rautat pointed toward hasso several times he pounded his fist into his palm once he might be only a feldwebel but he acted like a general he got away with it too damned if he didnt the bucovinan officer nodded sketched a salute and hurried away rautat grinned till the top of his head threatened to fall off he also nodded to hasso if he hadnt been the official bucovinan in charge of the dangerous and important blond person he never could have pulled that one off and he knew it hasso placed the fuses in the jars next time he would come with jars already fused you couldnt think of everything at once not when you were reinventing a whole art all by yourself the bucovinans watched him intently if they got away and he didnt they would at least be able to go on with what hed already shown them whether theyd be able to do anything more wouldnt be his worry not in that case he hid in some bushes off to the side of the road a lot of the fuses ran toward those bushes but he wasnt too worried about that for one thing there were some dummies that went other places and for another by now the lenelli ought to think all the fuses were nothing but a big bluff they wouldnt pay any attention to them till too late rautat left him some hard bread and dried meat a jar of beer and most important of all a couple of sticks of something a lot like punk it glowed red and slowly smoldered without burning away in nothing flat good luck the bucovinan said and then want me to hang around with you whatever you want after what had happened while they slept hasso didnt have any trouble sounding casual when he answered the question im not running back to the lenelli no matter how much he might regret it he was telling the truth there too rautat plucked a hair from his beard considering at last he said maybe id better i dont think youre any trouble but if it turns out im wrong i dont want to have to explain to drepteaza and lord zgomot how i left you all by yourself fair enough hasso said from the underofficers perspective it was you did need to be careful about relying on a turncoat the german felt he had to ask can you stay down and keep quiet those talents were more useful in warfare in his world than they were here most fighting in this world was right out in the open how long would that last if gunpowder caught on ill do it i already thought about that rautat said good start now because here they come hasso said and hunkered down in the bushes the first lenello scouts had just topped the swell of ground to the west rautat got as flat as if a stalin panzer had run over him he didnt let out a peep he barely even breathed hasso didnt get quite so low as that he needed to see out one of the blond outriders stared at a dummy hole with a dummy fuse running from it another one said something to him they both laughed and rode on they were convinced it was just the grenye savages trying to play games with their minds hasso wished hed left somebody to light some of the dummy fuses too late to worry about it now much too late here came botteros main body red flags flying this had to be a bigger force than the one that was plundering bucovinan villages hasso wondered why but he didnt wonder for long theyre after me he thought it was a compliment of sorts but one he would gladly have done without on rode the lenelli big fair men in mail and surcoats on horses big enough to bear their weight soon hasso could hear the thud of hoofbeats the jingle of harness and armor and even the odd snatch of conversation oh that dont worry about it just the bucovinans trying to make us jumpy dumbass barbarians another lenello said when rautats question was a tiny thread of whisper inaudible from more than a couple of meters away soon hasso whispered back he wanted about a third of the enemy army to pass over the real gunpowder pots before he lit the fuses his guess was that that would cause the most confusion and the most casualties he swung a stick of punk through the air to get it to glow red then he touched it to the fuses one after another from the ground beside him rautat grinned wolfishly trails of smoke streaked toward the burning pots a couple of lenelli pointed to them others snickered and shook their heads as if to say those didnt mean anything either up till today they would have been right the pots buried in the road blew up one after another they didnt just hold gunpowder they had rocks and sharp bits of metal in there too homemade shrapnel they gutted horses and flayed knights lightly armored legs some fragments hit men in the face some managed to punch right through mail and the noise was like the end of the world especially to men and beasts whod never heard the like and werent expecting it hasso was closer than he might have been but still used to much worse but even rautat whod heard gunpowder go off before let out an involuntary yip of alarm the lenelli and their horses screamed as if damned the big blonds in back of the explosions wheeled their mounts and rode off to the west as fast as they could go the ones in front they dont know whether to shit or go blind hasso thought happily they milled about afraid to advance and even more afraid to retreat then bucovinans started sliding forward and shooting at them normally botteros men would have driven off the archers annoying them without even breaking a sweat here the bowmen were just enough to tip the lenelli into panic magic somebody screamed the goddesscursed grenye do have magic they fled then with no shame and in no order at all had more bucovinans and bettermounted bucovinans pursued they might have bagged most of that leading detachment of the army next time hasso thought no matter how much you wanted to you couldnt do everything perfectly the first time around but hed done plenty the way rautat sprang up and kissed him on both cheeks proved that so did the way the lenelli ran from now on theyd piss themselves whenever they saw a cord running to some freshly turned earth professionally hasso was happy personally hed worry about that later when he had time if he ever did xxii things in western bucovin were going to be different for a while maybe for quite a while hasso could already see that the natives had their peckers up and the lenelli the lenelli had to be wondering what the devil had hit them they sure would start to sweat whenever they saw string running to what looked like holes in the ground and they would have to be ten times more worried about bushwhackers than they ever had before and all because of black powder hasso thought if i knew how to make nitroglycerine after a little pondering he realized he might medieval alchemists had used nitric acid so maybe the bucovinans knew about it and you got glycerine from animal fat some kind of way then he shook his head to make nitro safe to handle you had to turn it into dynamite and he knew he didnt know how to do that turning out gunpowder was dangerous you had to be careful as hell turning out nitroglycerine no he didnt even want to try and he really didnt want untrained bucovinans trying that wasnt a disaster waiting to happen it was a goddamn catastrophe rautat nudged him lets get out of here plain good sense ended his woolgathering in a hurry right he said getting away wasnt hard king botteros men had either fled back to the west or were hotly engaged with lord zgomots soldiers they didnt have time to worry about a couple of men heading the other way not getting scragged by the bucovinans was more interesting hasso was glad he had rautat along the underofficer was able to convince his countrymen that the big blond beside him wasnt a lenello and was a friend hasso might not have had an easy time doing that on his own he felt better when he and rautat caught up with the wagon that held the rest of the gunpowder jars dumnez and peretsh and gunoiul and the other bucovinans on his crew were beside themselves with excitement it worked they shouted and we heard it blow up and other things besides once theyd said those first two though theyd said everything that mattered what now hasso asked now we go back to falticeni and find out what new orders lord zgomot has for us rautat answered we ought to leave the wagon somewhere closer to the front so even without us it can go into action fast if it has to hasso said not too close rautat said cant let it get captured no matter what he would have been right about that in medieval europe he was righter here hasso still worried about magic the longer till aderno and the other lenello wizards figured out what gunpowder was and how it worked the better how much of a spell would you need to ignite it from a distance where do you want to leave it then the wehrmacht officer asked how about muresh rautat said even if the big blond bastards do come that far it can always go back over the oltet hasso found himself nodding muresh should do he liked the idea of putting such a potent weapon in a town the enemy had ravaged only the autumn before in fact he needed a moment to remember that hed been part of the army that ravaged muresh it seemed a long time ago and that despite his trying to rejoin that army only a few days before king bottero didnt want him back well long live lord zgomot then he really had turned his coat he shook his head no hed had it turned for him if the lenelli wanted him dead and they damn well did how could he think he owed them anything but a good kick in the nuts the first chance he got it all made good logical sense which proved what exactly if jews had a country of their own would germans feel easy about fighting for it he had a hard time seeing how why would jews want germans on their side anyway but that one had an answer whatever else you said about germans they were better at war than damn near anybody else theyd shown twice now that they werent as good as everybody else put together but that wasnt the same thing so here i am im good at war by god im even better here than i would be back home and im fighting for the side that looks like a bunch of fucking jews and if that aint a kick in the ass what is why are you laughing rautat asked am i hasso said maybe because i am starting to pay the lenelli back for trying to kill me and maybe for other reasons too the one he named satisfied rautat revenge is good the native said seriously if anyone wrongs you pay him back a hundredfold we say that and youre doing it yes im doing it how about that hasso loved how about that along with isnt that interesting it was one of the few things you could say that were almost guaranteed not to get you in trouble and im already in enough trouble thank you very much he ended up in more trouble when they got to muresh his name pursued him through his dreams he knew what that meant aderno and velona were after him again he tried to wake himself up but couldnt do it and here in the west of bucovin magic worked better than it did farther east so aderno caught up with him in the corridors of sleep what did you do the lenello wizard demanded i pay you back for trying to kill me thats what hasso said savagely he found he liked rautats proverb you try to kill me three times now you think i kiss you after that he told aderno where the wizard could kiss him and you pay us back by working magic for the savages aderno said you dont know how filthy that is lying in these dream quarrels wasnt easy hasso remembered that so he didnt say anything at all he just laughed his ass off let aderno make whatever he wanted out of that and if he thought hassod routed botteros army with spells he would only have a harder time figuring out what was really going on why should i worry aderno said if we dont get you the grenye are bound to they dont trust renegades you know they dont try to murder me hasso answered thats you yes and wed do it again in a heartbeat velona said appearing beside aderno out of thin air or more likely out of thin dreamstuff you deserve it anyone who goes over to the savages deserves it and everyone who goes over to the grenye will get it the goddess has told me so telling things is easy backing up what you say is a lot harder how many promises did hitler make how many did he keep is the goddess really big enough to swallow all of bucovin of course she is velona had no doubts when did she ever this land will be ours all of it so even if you showed the barbarians the trick of your thunder weapon it wont matter because the goddess is on our side god wills it the crusaders shouted and sometimes he did and sometimes he didnt and after a while no more crusaders were left in the middle east velona was smarter than aderno though shed figured out what the booms were and he hadnt we should have killed you the last time she went on well just have to try again now this is what i get for loving you hasso asked though all the while he knew the answer was yes no one who beds grenye women can truly love the goddess in me velona said and if you dont care about the goddess then you dont care about me either now the goddess cares about you hasso pemsel she was still beautiful beautiful and terrible and terrifying i warned you long ago that there was more danger to loving me than the chance of a broken heart now you begin to see and now you begin to pay she gestured to aderno hasso didnt think she would have let him see that if she could have helped it but the other side evidently had trouble lying in the dreamscape too that was something of a relief and hasso sorcerously braced himself as well as he could the blow wasnt so strong as the one a few nights earlier his being farther east likely had something to do with that he woke with a shriek yes but by now he was almost used to doing that he didnt heave his guts out or foul himself so he reckoned the encounter a success rautat was less delighted do you have to make so much noise he asked crossly you sound like youre dying and you scare me to death sorry hasso said what do you want me to do when a wizards after me go after him instead make him wake up screaming instead you can do that shit right so do it i wish i could hasso said but the bucovinan underofficer wasnt listening to him anymore he swore under his breath he had no idea how to track aderno through the lenello wizards dreams or what to do if he caught him having the ability and having the knowledge were two different things expecting rautat to understand that was hopeless not a sword a shield hasso was a mediocre chess player but hed learned enough to know defending was easier than putting together a strong attack if the other guy needed to work hard to beat you maybe hed get sick of trying and go away maybe what do you people do against sendings of bad dreams he inquired why ask me rautat said whatever we do it isnt real magic the common grenye mixture of fear and bitterness edged his voice coming up against magic that did work must have been as horrible a shock for the natives here as the spaniards gunpowder was to the indians just curious hasso said whatever the grenye did wasnt real magic for them for him with the right spell cast by the right kind of mind it might be their notions would give him a place to start anyhow and he knew he couldnt screw every night till he got to falticeni he didnt want to screw in muresh it would remind him of all the rapes here during the sack with the air of a man humoring an eccentric a lunatic rautat answered well we use nettle and yarrow and prayer hasso discovered that he was smiling what did shakespeare say out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety that was it maybe old will knew more than he let on he often seemed to can you get me some of each hasso asked he knew nettles when he saw them yarrow to him was only a name ill send someone out to get you the plants yes rautat gave him a crooked smile youll have to find our own prayer though i dont know where that grows around here after what the lenelli did to muresh hasso guessed all the prayer in these parts had been torn up by the roots he laughed anyway to show rautat he got the joke and a couple of hours later a grayhaired bucovinan woman brought in a nettle and another plant hasso supposed it was yarrow the woman eyed him do you speak our language she asked he nodded yes not too well though were you in muresh when the lenelli ravished it yes hasso said again she nodded too as if hed proved some point and he must have because she said no wonder you have bad dreams she knew what the yarrow and nettle were for then well who likelier to believe an old wives tale than an old wife i take any oath you want i fought clean here hasso was amazed by how glad he was to be telling the truth he couldnt have said the same thing about what hed done in russia well how many russians had clean hands in germany and truthteller or not he failed to impress the bucovinan woman even so she said and walked away without waiting for an answer what had happened to her when botteros army came through muresh what had happened to the people she loved hasso didnt have the nerve to ask yarrow had fine tiny leaves and a spicy scent as the woman had hasso handled the nettle by the root to keep from getting stung he held the yarrow in the other hand and chanted in german he was sure the natives would rather hed used bucovinan but he had no idea whether magic here paid any attention to the natives language he knew damn well he could cast a spell in german that worked hed done it before so he tried it again and what would happen when aderno and velona tried to afflict him again thats why youre casting the spell jerk to find out whatll happen with luck aderno wouldnt be able to get through at all im sorry sir you seem to have reached a disconnected brain hasso snorted yeah his brain seemed disconnected all right even to him the only way to discover what would happen was to fall asleep hasso approached the night with all the enthusiasm of a soldier about to have a wound tended by a drunken stupid medic when it came to wizardry that was about what he was and he knew it the only reason he looked like a doctor in a clean white coat to the bucovinans was that they were even worse off than he was he lay down after a while he slept next thing he knew it was morning he approved of course he had no idea whether aderno had tried a spell of his own during the night but no news seemed good news he wasnt the only one who thought so you didnt scream your magic must have worked rautat said its a lot more restful when you dont scream you know for me too hasso said and the underofncer chuckled for all the world as if he were kidding nobodyd ever tried to blow rautats head off from the inside out the bucovinan didnt know how lucky he was if he stayed lucky he would never find out either hasso did feel a pang at riding away from the remaining pots of gunpowder they ended up stowing them in the castle on the east bank of the oltet which like muresh had been somewhat repaired there was bound to be more explosive in falticeni the bucovinans knew how to make the stuff now and they wouldnt have stopped because hed ridden west he did wonder whether zgomot would have the chopper waiting if the ruler decided hed learned enough from the dangerous blond hasso shrugged he just had to hope that wasnt so botteros men wanted to kill him if zgomots did too hed damn well die in that case and he didnt know what he could do about it catapults he said out of the blue he said it in lenello but the bucovinan name was almost the same the natives had taken the word as well as the thing it was what drepteaza called a bastard word with long and short vowels what about them rautat asked we need light ones on wheeled carts hasso said then they can throw pots of gunpowder at the lenelli oh yeah a slow grin spread over rautats face i like that lavtrig give me boils on my ass if i dont what other sneaky ideas have you got that would be telling hasso answered rautat laughed so did hasso but he wasnt kidding what kept him alive was being the goose that laid golden eggs as long as he could keep laying them and as long as none of them turned out to be gilded lead he figured he was all right if he screwed up lord zgomot would start sharpening that chopper so dont screw up he thought good advice but hard to live up to coming back to falticeni wasnt exactly coming home hasso had no home in this world and wondered whether he ever would but he knew lots of people in the palace zgomot was interesting to talk to and drepteaza was drepteaza hasso sighed he would be glad to see her one of these days before too long he would probably need to get drunk too hell hed done that on account of velona too but it was different with her hed got smashed because she screwed bottero drepteaza wasnt screwing anybody not as far as hasso knew that was the problem how the natives stared when he rode through the crowded muddy smelly streets with his bucovinan escort nobody had any idea who he was the bucovinans figured him for a lenello without photography and printing nobody except kings could get famous enough for everyone to recognize them and kings put their portraits on coins which struck hasso as cheating look at that big blond prick a bucovinan said pointing at him who are you calling a prick you asshole hasso replied in bucovinan the native gaped his buddies gave him the horselaugh rautat slapped hasso on the back they rode on so he did it one of the gate guards said to rautat when they got to the palace he sure did the underofficer sounded proud of hasso he probably was if he hadnt found the wehrmacht officer in the pit and decided not to finish him off he wouldnt have got soft duty at the palace he was enough of a feldwebel to know when and why he was well off good the gate guard said about time we had some magic on our side it wasnt magic lord zgomot understood that so did drepteaza so did the bucovinans who worked with gunpowder as for the rest well what if they thought it was that was probably good for morale grooms came out to take charge of the travelers horses hasso stretched and grunted he stumped around bowlegged like an arthritic chimpanzee that got a laugh from rautat and the rest of the bucovinans then he said i want a bath me too rautat said gunoiul and peretsh and dumnez and the others whod ridden with them nodded boy when he says things like that youd hardly think he was a lenello the gate guard said as if hasso werent there or didnt speak bucovinan the german didnt bash the native in the head however much he wanted to the man had already shown he didnt know what the hell he was talking about but most of the grenye in falticeni were bound to think the same things about hasso the ones whod heard of him anyway how many had no way for him to know he wondered if he could figure out how to make a printing press in the long run ideas were as important as weapons ideas were weapons but that was in the long run lots of other things to worry about first that bath for instance hasso let rautat lead the way he was glad to get out of his grubby clothes and even gladder to soak in the warm water with the root the bucovinans used in place of soap if only he had some cigarettes if you were a lenello youd still stink rautat said if i were a lenello hasso dropped it right there if he were a lenello he would have deserted when he got to the west if he were a lenello he probably would have got away with it too but im not he was sick of saying that if only the bucovinans would listen to him for a change or maybe rautat was listening i said if you were he reminded hasso you dont stink you enjoy being clean just like a human being does back in drammen hasso hadnt especially missed baths when you got into the field when you stayed in the line for weeks at a time you learned to do without getting clean you stopped worrying about it it was nice to have the chance to scrub the dirt off though hasso grabbed it without hesitation he didnt even have to get back into his dirty duds servants laid out some others that fit him no doubt borrowed from one renegade or another not bad he said not bad at all not even a little bit rautat agreed he had on clean clothes too now i could do with chopped pork and garlic over millet thatd fill up the hole in my belly and some mead to wash it down too sounds pretty good hasso said rautat leered at him he even understood why the underofficers meal was what the lenelli would sneer at as native food hasso didnt care even if he wasnt wild about garlic once you spent some time campaigning you ate anything that didnt eat you first either that or you starved he did add i think beer goes better suit yourself rautat said magnanimously lets go get outside some sounds like a plan food brightened the way hasso looked at the world it always did some of the meals he remembered mostly fondly were by any objective standard pretty horrible half a kilo of partburnt partraw horsemeat wouldnt put the ritz out of business any time soon but when youd had nothing but snow and a mouthful of kasha for three days before you stumbled over the carcass it seemed like the best supper youd ever had the bucovinan meal wasnt half bad even if it wasnt what hasso would have ordered given a choice hed just emptied his mug of beer when an attendant came up to him and said lord zgomot wants to see you now that youre done eating he tells you to wait till i finish hasso asked the man nodded hasso shook his head in amazement a ruler who thought of things like that what was this world coming to the wehrmacht officer got to his feet he towered over the native as he towered over all the natives here i am at his service of course congratulations hasso pemsel zgomot said hasso bowed thank you lord as usual he found the throne room cold and drafty and badly lit zgomots throne looked like a diningroom chair smothered in gold leaf you kept your promise your weapon did everything you claimed it would the lord of bucovin raised an eyebrow do you have any notion of how unusual that is hasso pemsel how many people renegades and bucovinans alike would have promised him and other grenye rulers that they could drive back the lenelli how many of those snakeoil salesmen would have been talking through their hats just about all of them or the big blonds wouldnt have pushed forward as far as they had what i say i can do lord i can do hasso answered stolidly so it would seem zgomot allowed if you knew how many of the others said the same thing though his mouth tightened likely at some unhappy memory then he brightened as much as he ever did anyhow and you did something else marvelous too whats that hasso asked you came back zgomot said we trusted you we had not a lot of choice maybe when you were showing us something so new and strange but we did it and you did not betray us he might have been a priest solemnly proclaiming a miracle shame flooded through hasso he hoped the throne room was too dim to let the lord of bucovin see him blush yeah hed come back but only because the lenelli didnt want him anymore he wondered whether bottero was wishing hed given his soldiers different orders and he wondered whether velona wished she hadnt lost her temper with him maybe bottero did wish hed welcomed back the man from another world hasso couldnt make himself believe velona felt any different about him velona didnt do things because they were expedient she did them because she felt like doing them she loved as she pleased and she hated as she pleased too here i am all right hasso said let the lord of bucovin make anything he pleased of that yes zgomot actually smiled a smile that didnt look cynical that didnt happen every day nor every week either and now that you are here again what other things can you show us that will drive the lenelli wild well hesitantly in a mixture of lenello and bucovinan hasso explained what he hoped to do with catapults and flying pots of gunpowder interesting zgomot said which from him was better than wild enthusiasm from a lot of people hasso knew but a catapult only shoots so far it only shoots so fast how do you keep the lenello knights from charging up and murdering the crew while they put a new pot in the throwing arm and cut the fuse just so hasso bowed low those are the right things to worry about lord he wasnt trying to butter zgomot up either the lord of bucovin had a good eye for problems spending his whole reign trying to hold off people with more tricks up their sleeve than he had doubtless contributed to that hasso went on very steady pikemen with long pikes can hold off knights good archers can do the same thing if you have knights of your own they can keep the lenelli from getting too close in the first place how sure are these ploys zgomot asked its war lord hasso spread his hands nothing is sure in war you already show that to king bottero yes he mimed falling into a pit and you already show that to me we have to do such things zgomot said when we face the big blond bastards straight up we lose we dont have enough big horses to raise swarms of knights the way they do we will one of these days but not yet how long would your long pikes have to be about ten cubits hasso answered that was five meters more or less several rows of spearheads stick out in front of the first row of soldiers if the pikemen stay steady and dont run knights cant get through a hedgehog we call that the proper term was a swiss hedgehog but zgomot didnt know anything about the swiss the lord of bucovin thought hard now these men would need training they would need practice what would happen if a wizard beset them again he saw the problems very clearly they would need training yes hasso said as for a wizard a wizard is more likely to go after the catapults and the gunpowder i think i think so too zgomot said but we could use a hedgehog against the lenelli even without catapults and gunpowder could we not no doubt about it lord and no doubt that zgomot was one plenty sharp cookie indeed hasso added archers would need better bows to fight knights they would need training too he knew of english longbows but he didnt know much about them so this is not something we can do right away zgomot said no hasso admitted war is a trade like any other you have to learn how if you want to do it well the lord of bucovin sighed i suppose so if we get beaten before we can learn though he sighed again that only means we should have started sooner i suppose he was right however little good being right might do him hasso was eyeing the dragons tooth in the corridor on the way to the throne room when drepteaza came up she stopped when she saw him so she said you came back after all hasso pemsel people keep telling me so hasso said here i am so i suppose i have to believe them he gave her something more than a nod but less than a bow i am glad to see you and im glad to see you here drepteaza said which wasnt the same thing at all lord zgomot was worried about you yes i know hasso frowned something in her voice wasnt quite right were you worried too not as much as lord zgomot was she answered whatever was bothering her it wasnt aimed at him why are you angry at the lord of bucovin hasso asked drepteaza gave him a sidelong glance you ought to know me what have i got to do with it hasso had thought he was off the hook maybe he was wrong i told you lord zgomot feared you would run off run back to the lenelli it all made perfect sense to the priestess not to hasso what does that have to do with you he asked you really dont know you really dont understand drepteaza sounded as if she couldnt believe her ears in some exasperation hasso shook his head if i understood would i be asking well you never can tell drepteaza had to tilt her head back to look up at him he always wondered if she was looking up his nose with the air of someone giving a dull person the benefit of the doubt she said if you had run off to the lenelli lord zgomot would have blamed me you what could you do about me hasso reached to scratch his head and banged his knuckles on the ceiling dammit he didnt fit in castles built for grenye you stay here in falticeni yes and thats part of the problem too drepteaza said lord zgomot worried you might go back to the blonds because i wouldnt go to bed with you he was angry at me because i didnt oh hasso said yeah lord zgomot was a sharp cookie all right hasso didnt like seeming so transparent especially to a man he still thought of as more than half a barbarian like it or not he evidently was he tried to put the best face on it he could you see you dont have anything to worry about neither does he but only because king botteros men had orders to kill one hasso pemsel on sight if they didnt if they didnt id be back in drammen now luckily the bucovinans didnt know anything about that hassos little sleep spell accomplished so much anyhow i would screw you to keep you from going back to bottero and velona if that is what it takes i will do it drepteaza said hassos jaw dropped he knew the bucovinans were blunt but he hadnt thought they were that blunt when he didnt say anything drepteaza went on if you want me to like you while im doing it though i think you would be asking too much oh hasso said again not even how about that or isnt that interesting seemed safe here you may not care of course some men only care about the screwing itself not whether anything lies behind it some women too no doubt but i think fewer drepteaza said i got the idea you werent one of those or you would have been happy enough with leneshul or gishte but maybe i was wrong you can have me ill make nice even if i really want to spit in your eye drepteaza was right plenty of men would have been happy enough with that bargain or vain enough to be sure they were such wonderful lovers she would melt with delight as soon as they got it in had he been offered a woman like gishte or leneshul on terms like that chances were he would have taken her what she thought of him afterwards wouldnt have mattered to him with drepteaza it did that was what made her different from the others or maybe im just a damn fool shit i wouldnt be surprised if youre ever interested likely you can find a way to let me know he said she looked at him for a long time it seemed like a long time anyway thank you she said quietly i am in your debt and under the circumstances i have no easy way to pay you back she walked off without waiting for an answer under the circumstances ja hasso said it in german so she wouldnt have understood it even if she heard it but he didnt think she did she seemed determined to get away from him as fast as she could under the circumstances hed barely found out what velonas name was before she gave him the time of his life drepteaza didnt work like that not with him anyway these people werent catholics there wasnt anything here about priestesses having to be virgins but hed had his chance and hed blown it he probably was a fool he sure felt like one right this minute well if he felt like one in the morning he could tell drepteaza hed changed his mind and how about it cutie in the meantime he went down to the buttery and asked for the biggest beaker of beer in the place hed seen this coming but maybe not so soon the tapman didnt even blink he just handed hasso a drinking horn with enough beer in it to drown a rhino hasso had to work to drain it but drain it he did then he thrust it back at the bucovinan fill it up again he said the beer made his brains buzz but he remembered to use the imperative whatever youve got youve got it bad the tapman said i dont know what youre talking about hasso said with exaggerated dignity the native took that for a joke and laughed so did hasso right up until he started to cry xxiii hasso had had his share of rocky mornings since splashing down into the marsh by the causeway this one was a rock like gibraltar he staggered down to the buttery for a little porridge and some beer with luck no one would talk to him and he would have the chance to forget how badly hed hurt himself as soon as he saw scanno he feared luck wouldnt be with him as soon as scanno saw him he knew all his fears would be realized you look like something the cat threw up the renegade remarked his loud cheerful voice reverberated between hassos ears anything loud and cheerful inclined hasso toward suicide or possibly homicide ive been better he said quietly scanno couldnt take a hint tied one on yesterday didnt you he boomed he wasnt quite so loud as king bottero would have been but not from lack of effort how did you guess the less hasso said the less he gave scanno to grab on to the better the chance the other man would shut up and go away he could dream couldnt he but scanno wasnt going anywhere youre a hero he said what do you need to go out and get plowed for i mean plowed bad not plowed happy you hurt yourself pal no kidding hasso said and then you ought to know you get drunk all the time yourself yeah sure scanno didnt waste time telling him he was talking through his hat but i like getting drunk and sloppy you mostly dont so what did you go and do it for yesterday none of your business hasso said sweetly gotta be a broad scanno said which was much too perceptive for that early in the morning and for how bad hasso felt so which broad is it and how come she wont give you a tumble shut up and piss off hasso said more sweetly still scanno laughed hasso started to get to his feet he would have relished a fight just then which went a long way toward saying how hung over he was take it easy if i pull out my sword youre dead scanno said if you pull out your sword i shove it up your ass hasso told him scanno might have been a renegade but he was a lenello with a lenellos prickly pride telling him not to do something only made him want to do it more you asked for it he said and started to draw hassos hand clamped down on his wrist scanno swore and tried to break free he was a better swordsman than hasso ever would be as a wrestler though he might as well have been a child hasso threw him to the rammedearth floor of the buttery ill kill you for that scanno shouted as his hand flashed to the hilt of his sword again hasso kicked him in the wrist he didnt know whether he broke it or not he didnt much care either though he wouldnt have been surprised scanno howled and clutched at himself if he was going to do any swordfighting he would have to do it lefthanded dont mess with me hasso stood over him breathing hard dont even think about messing with me you mess with me i make you sorry you were ever born then i set a spell on you and make you wish you were dead scanno plainly weighed knocking his feet out from under him hasso would have stomped his hand if he tried the germans eagerness to do just that must have shown on his face because scanno tried no such thing he kept his defiance to words that puke of an aderno couldnt magic me and you cant either ha hasso laughed harshly i tear off your stupid dragonbone amulet and then i cast my spell his mouth was running a good ten meters ahead of his brain he had no idea what he would say till it popped out but when he heard himself his jaw dropped he forgot all about scanno the renegade could have upended him and pounded him to powder hasso might not even have noticed fuck me he said in german oh son of a bitch fuck me what are those funny noises scanno asked still cradling his injured wrist with his other arm never mind hasso stepped away from him if scanno wanted to get up the wehrmacht officer had stopped caring he grabbed his mug of beer off the table emptied it at a gulp and hurried out of the buttery scanno stared after him i think hes gone out of his tree he said none of the staring bucovinans in there argued with him hasso knew the way to lavtrigs chapel it boasted more fancy decoration than the one in castle drammen dedicated to the goddess that only made him surer hed got it right before the less a deity actually did the more ornament he or she needed to disguise that laziness drepteaza was lighting a silver lamp in front of a gilded statue of the chief bucovinan god when hasso walked in he thought the statue was gilded anyhow it might have been solid gold what burned in the lamp smelled of perfume and under that hot lard the priestess glanced up in surprise good morning hasso what is it after a moment she added by the look on your face it must be something important you might say so yes you just might hasso nodded emphatically we need to talk right now her mouth tightened are you sure or will it only cause more trouble and pain than it eases it will cause trouble and pain all right for the lenelli hasso answered then i will listen drepteaza said at once can we talk here or do you need to go someplace where no one else can listen he looked around a couple of other bucovinan priests of rank lower than hers were puttering around in there it doesnt matter they can hear i think i know why magic doesnt work so well around falticeni i think i can make it so lenello magic doesnt bite on grenye most of the time not always i suspect but most of the time her eyes widened the way she looked at him it might almost have been the way a lover eyed her beloved almost but not quite hasso made himself not think about that it didnt matter not for this well youve got me interested drepteaza said tell me more i do that hasso said in this palace you have the tooth of a dragon yes it is a treasure and so under the walls here you have more bones of this dragon right of course we do we are proud that we managed to kill it we are lucky that we killed it too if we hadnt it could have wrecked falticeni worse than the lenelli might ja all hasso had seen of the late unlamented dragon was that one fang but it was plenty to convince him you know that magic does not bite on scanno the renegade i have heard it yes drepteaza said i dont know for myself that its true but i have no reason to doubt it its true i see i saw it for myself it drove aderno crazy trying to figure out why his spell wouldnt work hasso remembered how the wizard had experimented on a grenye woman to find out too he didnt say anything about that to drepteaza instead he went on scanno wears a little piece of dragon bone on a thong around his neck for an amulet he wondered if she would make the connection it seemed obvious to him but lots of things that seemed obvious to him didnt to the locals lenelli and grenye alike sometimes in this world they werent sometimes he just had a different way of looking at them they didnt think as logically as he did barring a few clerics the folk in medieval germany wouldnt have either by the standards of this world drepteaza was an educated woman by the standards of any world she was a bright woman all the same the frown that crossed her face said she didnt get it right away and then all at once she did it was like watching the sun come out from behind clouds you think dragon bones block spells she whispered thats right hasso said thats just what i think if all of lord zgomots soldiers have amulets if their horses have them if my pots of gunpowder have them too if that happens the lenelli have to fight fair fight fair drepteaza went on whispering while she echoed him thats all we ever dreamt of since they first came across the ocean and landed on our shores it would be so wonderful would be now hasso echoed her as she nodded the sunshine that blazed from her face faded once more we are missing only one thing dragon bones enough to make the amulets we need there arent many dragons and the ones there are live far to the north theyre hard to find and even harder to kill men dont just hunt dragons dragons hunt men too and they win more often than we do somewhere in botteros realm lies skeleton of a dead dragon hasso said scanno knows where drepteaza stared at him he watched the sun come out on her face again if you are right she said you know what this will do to the lenelli i hope i do hasso answered i want dragonbone amulet too so far his own little spell was holding its own against aderno and velona here in falticeni which also had dragonbone amulets of a sort he could believe it would go on holding if he headed west again he wasnt sure what would happen then he wasnt anxious to find out either does scanno know why the dragon bone is so important drepteaza asked he may hasso explained how hed brawled with the renegade and the thoughts the brawl called to mind riskier to send him back into botteros kingdom then she said if he can tell us where the skeleton lies we can have people who dont know why theyre doing it collect the bones and bring them back to bucovin you should be a marshal hasso said if the people getting the bones didnt know what they were good for the lenelli could torture them or cast spells at them till everything turned blue without finding out the wehrmacht officer did hold up a warning hand not sure skeleton is still there scanno says hes had his amulet for years now well if its gone well think of something else thats all drepteaza said with a shrug this is the best chance we have and we need to grab it she dropped hasso a curtsy bucovin is in you debt im sure lord zgomot will reward you as you deserve what about you hasso asked it is not my place drepteaza said primly he is the lord of bucovin too bad he is not too young and not too pretty hasso said he wondered if he would make her angry but she smiled and i am too young and too pretty she asked you are not too young you are just right and there is no such thing as too pretty hasso answered you dont think so you might be surprised drepteaza said sure as hell velona came up in hassos mind was it the goddess dwelling within her that sometimes made her beauty like a blow in the face or was it just that she was what she was what she was was gone hasso didnt know how many times she had to try to kill him to get the message across however many times it was shed finally crossed the threshold he truly believed she didnt want him back he didnt like it but he believed it drepteaza wasnt in that class but who was she was more than pretty enough hasso bowed returning the curtsy i would like you to surprise me he said i bet you would she wagged a finger at him you cooked up this whole scheme against the lenelli for no better reason than to get me into bed with you how could there be a better reason hasso asked as innocently as if he didnt mean every word of it go pour a bucket of cold water on yourself drepteaza said then go talk to lord zgomot he is the one who has to set things moving and after that after that go pour another bucket of cold water on yourself drepteaza answered but she was still smiling hasso clung to that as a drowning man would cling to to an anvil if hes dumb enough and odds are you qualify the german thought he went off to see lord zgomot zgomot was none too young and none too pretty but he was plenty smart if this works he told hasso it will be the most important weapon weve ever found against the lenelli not perfect hasso said if your army is in a pass and they magic up a landslide amulets dont stop falling rocks i am sure of it so am i the lord of bucovins voice was dry we have tried all sorts of things to block their magic i am not surprised no one thought of dragon bones till now though dragons are just too hard to come by he spoke to one of his attendants fetch the blond named scanno here yes lord the man bobbed his head and hurried away when scanno came in he had his right arm in a makeshift sling he took one look at hasso and stopped dead is this miserable bastard complaining about me lord i ought to complain about him the what followed was a colorful mix of bucovinan and lenello he is not complaining of you he says you know of a dragons skeleton in botteros kingdom is that so i ought to break him in half i will too first chance i get scanno didnt shift gears easily that will be later answer my question now zgomot said do you know where there is a dragons skeleton in king botteros lands scanno shook his good fist at hasso you were just lucky you the lord of bucovin coughed sharply that seemed to recall scanno to himself uh yeah i know where there is one or where there was one anyway once upon a time what about it why does it matter you will set down directions for reaching this place you will do so as exactly as you know how to do if we succeed in bringing back dragon bones you will be rewarded as handsomely as we know how if you lead us astray that would be unfortunate for you hey i wouldnt do that lord you know me i hate bottero moren you do that blowhard pile of pig shit scannos voice took on a certain whine hasso had heard before not here but in europe during the war it was the whine of collaborators who knew they had to keep reminding their bosses that they were useful and that they really had switched sides it was a whine hasso hoped he would never hear in his own voice you can do what i ask of you then zgomot pressed sure only i dont know if the bonesll still be there yknow i havent had anything to do with em for years and years so you cant scrag me well you shouldnt scrag me if they arent like its at the butt end of nowhere too if my men believe you have led them to the right spot no harm will come to you by lavtrig i swear it zgomot said there should be some evidence of that whether the bones remain or not is that fair i guess but scannos whine got stronger whats all this about anyhow how come you need dragon bones all of a sudden lord zgomot looked at hasso hasso looked back at the lord of bucovin he didnt think zgomot would say anything but the native did what you dont know scanno no one can drag out of you if misfortune comes youve got some kind of fancy reason for not telling me scanno said which was nothing but the truth his redtracked eyes swung to hasso and fry my balls if it doesnt have to do with magic he made as if to touch the amulet he wore but dropped his hand before it got where it was going so you think the dragon bone really does have something to do with blocking spells eh hasso and zgomot looked at each other again scanno might have been was a renegade with a hollow leg but that didnt make him a jerk with a weary sigh zgomot said well you have made sure you will not leave falticeni until the bone hunters return with their quarry we cannot have the lenelli pulling this out of you i wasnt going anywhere lord there was that whine again this time thick enough to slice hasso eyed scanno with imperfect trust if scanno brought word about dragon bones to king bottero and his wizards chances were the news would buy his way back into their good graces and hasso knew all about the impulse to switch sides fortunately zgomot didnt know how well he knew it scanno went on ill let your people know where they can find the bones my head will answer if they dont bring back a cartload of em or at least find out where they were that is what i want go talk to the scribes tell them where the place is draw them a map do that now while the thought is fresh in your mind zgomot said whatever you want lord scanno sketched a salute and hurried off as soon as he was out of earshot hasso said keep an eye on him lord keep an eye on his wife too watch them the same way you watch me i intend to keep an eye on him and an eye on nechemat as well zgomot answered placidly and you have an interesting way of putting that shrugging hasso said i know you keep an eye on me you need to i hope i know the difference between what i like and what is and now you really need to keep an eye on scanno too he knows too much yes and he likes to talk too you do not have that vice anyhow zgomot said in my world i know how important keeping secrets is hasso said now some secrets to keep here too the lord of bucovin nodded yes i would not have thought that but yes and you realize you will not be leaving falticeni either or not without guards not until the bonehunters have returned as steadily as he could hasso nodded back no one is ever going to trust me again that is part of what is too not what i like but what is we will see what we can do about what you like zgomot sent hasso away without explaining himself he had the rulers privilege of the last word hasso didnt think the bucovinans had beauty contests if they did the girl who came to his room that night would have finished no worse than third runnerup her name she told him was tsiam seriously she added lord zgomot says i am to do anything you want anything hasso said anything tsiam nodded but she couldnt keep a touch of fear from her voice who could guess what big blond foreigners might like what would you do if it were up to you hasso asked why whatever lord zgomot told me to do of course tsiam answered let me say it a different way where would you be if lord zgomot didnt tell you to be here with otset but hes starting to get tired of me thats why zgomot sent me to you otset was the bucovinan whod warned king bottero to turn back not long before the natives laid their trap and captured hasso up till now hasso had thought he was pretty smart but if he was why would he get tired of a girl as pretty as tsiam one more try do you want to be here if you dont you dont have to be you can go you dont want me tsiam seemed affronted not unless you want me she frowned how do we really know till we try and what am i supposed to say to that hasso wondered he found only one thing and he said it come on then and we try try they did when it was over neither one of them would have called it a success tsiam said you were thinking about someone else werent you afraid so hasso answered im sorry dont mean for it to show so much she shrugged nothing much to do about it do you want me to bother coming back no its all right tell lord zgomot i am not angry at you that is the truth i thank you for your kindness tell lord zgomot i thank him for his but this is not what i am after all right i hope you find it whatever it is tsiam quickly dressed and slipped out of the room hasso made a fist and slammed it down onto the mattress that didnt do him any good either he was eating a glum breakfast the next morning when drepteaza set her bowl of mush down by his by lavtrig why doesnt tsiam suit you she asked shes much prettier than i ever will be and after spending a couple of years learning to please otset shes bound to be better in bed too then why doesnt he want her anymore hasso asked hes had time to get bored with her you gave her one night hasso shrugged she isnt what i want he paused to spoon up some more of the mush and to wash it down with bad bucovinan beer none of that changed his mind so he went on you are you know that yes i do know that it only makes things harder for both of us drepteaza looked down at the rough planks of the tabletop im sorry not sorry but you know again hasso hated stumbling through a language he didnt speak well curse it do you fall in love just where you are supposed to i havent fallen in love at all so i cant really answer that drepteaza answered but you hasso pemsel it seems to me that you look for the worst places to fall in love and then go and do that if shed mocked him he would have gone up like jellied gasoline but she didnt she simply sounded as if she was telling him how things looked to her and maybe she wasnt so far wrong he doubted he would have had a happy ending with velona even if the bucovinans didnt capture him something else would have gone wrong or she would have found somebody new and then no that wouldnt have been pretty it might have been lethal velona herself had warned him he didnt want to think about velona it still hurt so did thinking about drepteaza but not the same way stubbornly he said you are not a bad place to fall in love you are the best place i know here she said one quiet word that hit him the way a panzerfaust blew the turret off a soviet t his face must have shown as much for she softened it a little maybe i would not be such a bad place for you if i felt for you what you feel for me but i dont i almost wish i did it would make things easier for bucovin this is not about bucovin i do plenty for bucovin i know youve done plenty for bucovin more than i could drepteaza said quickly but youre right this has nothing to do with that this is just about us no us to be about hasso said which held more truth than grammar drepteaza understood it anyway and nodded to show she did that is what this is about why there is no us she said us takes two hasso said without two forget it if you dont like me its not even that she broke in by now i know you as well as anyone in falticeni is likely to she was bound to be right especially with the qualification a couple of people back in drammen or wherever they were these days but that was another story and looked as if it always would be the priestess went on you are brave you are not stupid anything but stupid you are not a bad man if only if only i dont look the way i do he broke in she nodded yes that might do it she said maybe i should wear a mask maybe i should walk on my knees hasso was joking and yet he wasnt drepteaza understood that too you are trying to be as difficult as you can she said her voice full of mock severity or maybe it wasnt mock at all hasso bowed at your service he said or i would be only yes only drepteaza said i am sorry if i could do anything about it i would and that is the truth he thought about telling her he was such a wonderful lover he would make her forget all about the way he looked if he were speaking german he might have tried it in bucovinan it was bound to come out wrong he didnt even want to imagine it in lenello lenello was what he was doing his best to stay away from much better not to try a line like that than to botch it so he said no mask and knees eh maybe i make a magic to look like one of your folk instead he remembered too late that velona had done something like that he waited for drepteaza to throw it in his face she didnt not directly anyhow she said a spell like that might not work in falticeni and even if you did use magic that would remind me of what you what you look like i know it is not what you are but what you look like matters too what a woman looks like matters to you doesnt it yes he wished he could have said no but he knew damn well he wasnt that good a liar he could add a woman doesnt have to be big and blond to be pretty for me this is the truth he held up his right hand with first two fingers upraised as if taking an oath back in germany i believe you drepteaza said he couldnt tell if she understood the gesture but most men are less fussy than most women when it comes to such things often enough even a grenye will do you talk about the lenelli i am no lenello no matter what i look like you look like one no matter what you are the old impasse youre ugly go away i cant help what i am he muttered and i cant help what i feel drepteaza said i almost wish what nothing let it go when you start to say something like that you should finish she sighed i suppose youre right i almost wish i could help what i feel it would keep you from mooning around the way you do at least you dont paw me all the time the way a real lenello would if you did i would have to learn to throw you over my shoulder and who could i learn that from but you you see what a problem it would be he couldnt help smiling she had a barbed wit when she felt like turning it loose if you want to learn to throw people even people my size i can teach you he thought she would say no not wanting to give him any excuse to get his hands on her but she nodded that might be useful lenelli arent the only troublemakers around here we have thieves and robbers of our own sometimes if someone comes with a sword or knife better to give what he wants hasso said dont be stupid you can get killed for no good reason if you are stupid i understand drepteaza answered is there ever a good reason to get killed you ask a soldier remember sometimes its worse for everyone else and for you too if you run away instead how many men friends and enemies alike had hasso seen making that same unhappy choice a lot of soldiers most of them died from being in the wrong place at the wrong time but some chose their time and place and died trying to keep the bastards on the other side from doing something nasty and sometimes it made a difference and sometimes it didnt you couldnt know ahead of time you did what you did that was all am i big enough to throw you around if i have to drepteaza asked derailing his train of thought to throw someone my size anyway i throw lenelli much bigger than me maybe throwing me is harder because i know what you do before you do it hasso answered i see she nodded how does someone small throw someone larger though size is not the trick the trick is knowing what to do hasso muttered to himself he wanted to say leverage but he had no idea how either in bucovinan or in lenello i hope youre right let me go change into breeches so i can get thrown around without embarrassing myself hasso laughed in surprise what about the baths the baths are the baths this is different drepteaza said why i dont know i never thought about it but it is doesnt your country have customs that wouldnt make any sense to an outsider the gods know the lenelli do maybe we do im sure we do hasso sketched a salute all right go change then i meet you in the fencing practice room see you there drepteaza got up and left the table as hasso walked down the corridor he almost ran into dumnez his driver said hello im going to be one of the people getting dragon bones we set out tomorrow no the wehrmacht officer clapped a hand to his forehead you cant you mustnt somebody screws up to let you why shouldnt i i want to give the lenelli one in the teeth same as everybody else does dumnez said this has to do that some kind of way its too important not to but you know about gunpowder you shouldnt go where they might catch you security hasso was sure lord zgomot would see it when it got pointed out to him hed worried about scanno who could tell the lenelli just why bucovin wanted their dragon bones the people who were going didnt know that which was all to the good but zgomot hadnt thought about other security worries dumnez looked mutinous they wont catch me true you dont go so they dont catch you hasso said dumnez tried to slip past him but hasso grabbed his arm for a moment he wondered if he would need his dirtyfighting talents taking on somebody he outweighed by more than thirty kilos wasnt close to fair but if dumnez grabbed a knife to forestall him hasso added we talk to lord zgomot if you dont listen to me you listen to him right he wont waste time on the likes of me dumnez said he does he will for this hasso said come on he had to talk his way past the stewards and chamberlains who shielded any ruler from the slings and arrows of outrageous reality but even though gunpowder wasnt magic it was a magic word it got hasso and dumnez through to the lord of bucovin in short order zgomot listened pondered and spoke the foreigner is right dumnez you stay here is anyone else who knows about gunpowder going i dont think so lord dumnez replied go find out if anybody is pull him off zgomot said good thing you bumped into hasso we dont want to take chances we dont have to dumnez gave the wehrmacht officer a sour look but he didnt argue with his sovereign and hasso wasnt very late to the fencing room he apologized to drepteaza explaining what had happened that wouldnt have been good she agreed and then got down to business so youre going to throw me around are you yes you know how to land soft i think so all right we go slow at first he showed her how to flip a man he didnt take any undue liberties with her person when he flipped her he was sure he bruised her though she did land well she was strong for her size and well coordinated hed thought she would catch on fast and he was right it wasnt hard grab turn duck twist heave now i come at you he said and he did when she flipped him he didnt do anything to try to stop her he went over on his back and got a bruise or two of his own you let me do that her voice was accusing you even helped well sure he said as he climbed to his feet you have to learn he tried not to think about the feel of her against him i went easy with king botteros masteratarms at first too so he knows these flips drepteaza said not any more hes dead oh that seemed to satisfy her lets try it again faster this time a little hasso agreed he went over her shoulder and thudded down oof thats good drepteaza smiled it is again hasso picked up more bruises he couldnt have cared less you will be sudden death on two legs he said drepteaza positively beamed xxiv when hasso started working with gunpowder and catapults lord zgomot changed his mind and suggested that he move away from falticeni for a while hasso didnt say no the lord of bucovin had two excellent reasons on his side one was not showing everybody in a goodsized city what bucovin was up to the other was not unnerving everybody in a goodsized city with strange booms and blasts the place where hasso ensconced himself was more than a farm and less than an estate maybe it was as close as the bucovinans could come to a lenellostyle estate it had a big fancy house but one with a thatched roof several peasant families who worked the fields and tended stock in the meadows lived in cottages not far from the big house the house and land belonged to zgomot himself the place was more than thirty kilometers away from falticeni far enough to let hasso and his men make as much noise as they needed to rautat and drepteaza went with him the underofficer translated for him with carpenters and catapult makers when his bucovinan ran dry the priestess did some of that too she also taught him more of the natives language and she seemed intent on learning all the dirty fighting he knew how to teach sudden death on two legs she quoted thats what i want youre on your way hasso said she wasnt as strong as he was and she didnt have his reach but she was a long way from a weakling and she was fast as a striking snake she could hurt him and she had more than once hed knocked her about too once you started practicing anywhere close to full speed that was bound to happen thumping down on thick grass in a meadow hurt less than the rammedearth floor of the fencing room had the moreorless estate didnt stink the way falticeni did another advantage of moving to the country sure it had a dungheap and some odorous privies but it didnt have tens of thousands of people crapping and pissing and not worrying much about how to dispose of the filth bucovinans bathed more than lenelli but their notions of sanitation were just as rudimentary as those of the blonds once hasso got the carpenters to understand what he wanted they had no trouble mounting catapults on wheeled carts horses or even donkeys could pull them field artillery he said happily back in the world hed left behind you couldnt live without it not very long anyway the wehrmacht always used as much as it could the red army had guns in carload lots yes the field artillery was easy the ammo wasnt hasso rapidly found earthenware pots wouldnt do he couldnt fuse them precisely enough if a pot hit the ground before a spark hit the gunpowder it smashed like a broken plate that wasted far too much precious gunpowder to work have to be metal he said bronze or iron expensive rautat said in dismay he wasnt kidding either part of hasso still took an industrial economy for granted where everybody did everything by hand you didnt get anywhere near so much and what you did get cost a lot more but he answered not as expensive as losing to the lenelli eh lord zgomot will have to say rautat told him i cant order smiths to start making these things not by myself i cant send to him hasso said we find out if he says no we go back to falticeni zgomot must have said yes because several bronzesmiths and ironsmiths came out to the estate to find out what hasso wanted he explained one of the smiths tapped his forehead as if to say this foreigner was out of his mind hasso let the short wideshouldered men watch an ordinary clay pot full of gunpowder blow up one of them pissed himself in surprise and fear after that they didnt think he was crazy any more hollow balls one of them said can we make halves and solder them together that would be a lot faster hasso shook his head not strong enough im afraid can we rivet halves together another smith asked that should hold them till your magic works it isnt magic hasso said wearily but yes try riveting it wouldnt be as fast as soldering but he could see that it would be a lot faster than making hollow spheres from scratch the bronzesmiths looked especially pleased they could cast their hemispheres instead of beating them out the bucovinans knew how to make and work wrought iron but they couldnt cast it yet another smith asked how many do you need and how soon do you need them the basic questions of war as many as you can make and a hundred more besides and i need them all yesterday that was any field officers automatic answer here though caution looked like a good idea how many do you think you can make how fast he asked in return they had to put their heads together before they gave him an answer some of them were scratching their heads too they werent used to thinking in terms of numbers when they did speak up he was pleasantly surprised even cutting their claims in half hed have enough shells to fight a battle soon enough to give the lenelli a proper greeting you really think you can do that he asked we do by lavtrig we do answered the man who spoke for them he had impressive dignity and scarred gnarled hands that were even more convincing all the same hasso pressed lord zgomot is not happy if you promise one thing and give something else we will not disappoint the lord of bucovin said the senior smith whose name was unaril go then do it hasso said and maybe they would and maybe they wouldnt if they didnt bucovin would fight the lenelli the same old way and chances were shed take it on the chin but the big blond bastards would have a harder time if zgomots men got back with the dragon bones as soon as that went through hassos mind he wondered did i just think of the lenelli as big blond bastards he didnt wonder long damned if i didnt maybe he really had switched sides after all even inside himself and wouldnt that be weird he thought a double handful of bronze shells came to the estate field marshal manstein would have laughed his ass off as soon as he took one look at them hell so would frederick the great for that matter when you measured them by the standards of an art that had had some time to grow they were somewhere between funny and pathetic when you measured them against nothing at all though they suddenly didnt seem half bad he didnt load them with gunpowder right away he had the catapult crews practice flinging them while they were empty they went somewhere close to meters he had to hope that would be good enough he thought it would for one battle anyway the lenelli would be looking for buried pots of gunpowder and he intended to use those too artillery would take them by surprise unless they had better spies than he thought some of the shells dented a little when they came down a few rivets popped a smith whod stayed behind repaired them and sneered at the workmanship hasso only grinned at him the wehrmacht officer hadnt imagined everything would go perfectly the bucovinans were doing things theyd never tried before he was pleased theyd done as well as they had he filled a shell with gunpowder and lead balls the bucovinans had no trouble making those because they used slingers as well as archers he jammed down the stopper a wooden plug with a hole drilled through for the length of fuse and then he assembled everybody by the catapult to watch as the shell went downrange on the meadow hed been bombarding as soon as i light the fuse you shoot he told the catapult crew i light i yell now and you shoot no waiting not even a little you understand what happens if were slow a bucovinan asked you get a lead ball in the face thats what or in the nuts and so do i hasso thought he wished for an mm mortar and a trained crew since wishing surprise failed to produce them he got back to business you ready the bucovinans solemnly nodded hasso waved a stick of punk to heat up the coal then he brought it down on the fuse which sizzled to life now he shouted he didnt throw himself flat not because he trusted the catapult crew but because the natives didnt know enough to do the same if something went wrong the survivors would think he took unfair advantage swoosh the catapult arm shot forward hurling the shell far across the meadow but not so far as a lighter emptier one it was just about to hit the ground when fire touched the main charge boom hasso whooped if he could do it that well all the time hed make one hell of a gunner then he stopped whooping because a catapult man yelped and grabbed his leg blood ran out between his fingers one of the lead balls had flown all the way back here hasso hadnt dreamt that could happen lie down he said let me see it hurts the catapult man said as he obeyed i bet it does when the german got a good look at the wound he breathed easier it was a gash not a puncture the ball must have grazed the bucovinan going by if he bled freely chances were he wouldnt get lockjaw if he did neither hasso nor anybody else in this world could do anything for him one of the other catapult men handed hasso a rag for a bandage it looked pretty clean he put it on one of these days he would have to talk about boiling bandages no time now and he didnt figure it would matter here can you walk he asked the wounded bucovinan i think so the fellow got to his feet he limped but he managed yeah its not too bad thanks foreigner you tied it up good sure hasso always would be a foreigner that didnt mean he enjoyed getting reminded of it the catapult man hadnt meant any offense youve got a demon of a weapon there i never figured it could bite from so far off you werent kidding when you said close would be worse no i wasnt kidding hasso agreed why had the other man wondered if he was because hed never seen anything like this that was why hasso understood as much well now the native hadnt just seen it hed felt it and he was a believer everybody except the wounded man walked out into the meadow to see what was left of the shell what was left was about what hasso had expected some sharp twisted shards of bronze casing and not much more lavtrig every time you throw one of these metal balls you waste it the smith whod stayed behind at the estate sounded appalled not waste hasso shook his head we hurt the enemy with it but you cant use it again the smith said the metal flies once and its gone gone for good metal isnt cheap you know neither is losing a war hasso pointed out once more you want your smithy burned you want to get killed you want your daughter raped and killed you want another muresh of course not the bucovinan answered but i dont want to go bankrupt either we could win the war and throw all our metal away then where would we be does lord zgomot really know this is how things are yes hasso said a oneword reply that made the smith blink hasso is right we have to do this lord zgomot says so and i think he is right too drepteaza said the other choice is giving up more land and more people to the lenelli do you want that no priestess the smith answered he would argue with hasso the german was just a foreigner but he wouldnt argue with drepteaza he assumed she knew what she was talking about because she was a priestess well drepteaza commonly did know what she was talking about but that was because she was drepteaza not because she was a priestess hasso understood as much he thought drepteaza did too which was a measure of her good sense the smith by contrast had not a clue shall we send off another one rautat asked maybe not right now hasso said first we make sure our wounded can do what they need to do im all right the injured catapult man said it can wait it should wait hasso said one thing at a time suits me and not because of my leg the catapult man said wrinkling his nose smells like demon farts around here how do you know what demon farts smell like that wasnt hasso even if he had the thought it was drepteaza well i dont not really the native soldier admitted but it smells like what i think demon farts ought to smell like does it smell that way to you too hasso drepteaza asked he shook his head it reminds me of fireworks the key word came out in german he had to explain what fireworks were starting just about from scratch the bucovinans had no idea they can light up the sky with flames of different colors he finished best at night of course how do you make flames different colors rautat asked flames are flames right hasso didnt know how pyrotechnic engineers did what they did but drepteaza said havent you seen how salt makes a flame yellower bits of copper or copper ore can turn flames green the smith added you should know that rautat hasso said you were a smith an ironsmith not a coppersmith or bronzesmith rautat said thats why i went to learn lenello tricks iron is the coming thing i wanted to see what the blond bastards knew that we dont the coming thing hasso hid his smile rautat wasnt wrong not for the way things were in bucovin and if iron had come to germany a couple of thousand years earlier well so what hasso damn well wasnt in germany any more and he never would be again a damn good thing too he was better off here there he would have got killed or if he was very lucky or maybe very unlucky he would have ended up a russian pow he supposed he was still a bucovinan pow but the ivans wouldnt have hurt any v engineers they caught they needed what those fellows knew the bucovinans needed what hasso knew if good treatment was the price of getting it they were willing to pay the reds were probably doing the same for their german engineers come to that the amis were bound to be acting the same way love got stale or flamed out no one knew that better than hasso these days common interests on the other hand could last theyd better the wehrmacht officer thought if they didnt he was dead without the least bit of warning flatfooted drepteaza tried to kick hasso in the crotch he sprang back out of danger one of the rules when they trained together was that you had to be alert every second shed never actually got him in the balls bruises on his hip and thigh where hed had to twist away instead of jumping back said shed come close more than once she looked disappointed that she hadnt made him sing soprano this time what did i do wrong she asked nothing hasso said but i know you are dangerous so i watch you all the time when you move i move too youre fast she said i didnt think anybody that big could be that quick im sure youre faster than most of the lenelli who live in bucovin she didnt say than most of the other lenelli hasso couldnt remember when shed last said that it had been a while anyhow he shrugged they can do things i cant i am never going to be anything much with a sword they learn when theyre little i learn now they have too much head start but this this i know how to do you must she said you she tried to kick him again again she gave nothing away beforehand if he hadnt suspected she might try to give him a double shot she might have done what she aimed to do leave him writhing in the tall grass clutching at himself instead of leaping away or twisting he grabbed her right foot and yanked it up farther than shed intended it to go she let out a startled squawk as she lost her balance and went over on her back he sprang on her and pinned her to the ground she tried to knee him when he did he really had trained her well but he didnt let her do that either got you this time he said his face a few centimeters above hers she nodded yes you did now will you let me up youre squashing me flat sorry he shifted so he took more of his weight on his knees and elbows but then he said i let you up in a little bit and leaned down and kissed her if shed wanted to nail him then she could have done it he realized as much just after his lips met hers which was exactly too late if shed twisted away and screamed well nobody was anywhere close by but someone likely would have heard her people would have come running and then he wouldnt have got hurt he would have died chances were a millimeter at a time she didnt do either of those things for a couple of seconds she didnt do anything at all he feared it would be a hopeless botch like the one in the garden back in falticeni but then she kissed him back after a fashion it was the most experimental kiss hed had since he was a kid and learning how himself the way she did it convinced him hed better not push anything too hard he drew back instead and asked well drepteaza stared up at him not so bad she said sounding honestly surprised i didnt used to think i would ever want a big blond to touch me in any way but with you teaching me to fight you had to touch me for that and it was what it was and after a while i didnt worry about it anymore and this what you just did what we just did wasnt so bad after all hasso bent toward her again how about this he asked softly this time the kiss got down to business she knew how all right she hadnt been sure she wanted to now she seemed to be quite a while later when their lips parted she murmured that was pretty good ja hasso said and she smiled so did he no doubt like an idiot he went on i want to do this for a very long time you havent known me for a very long time drepteaza was relentlessly precise what else have you wanted to do he did his best to show her he hadnt thought he would be her first and he wasnt he did hope he pleased her he wasnt sure because she didnt show what she felt as extravagantly as velona that he should think of velona now even for an instant only showed he really had it bad well he did dammit afterwards he had no idea what to say before he could come up with anything drepteaza beat him to the punch there are you happier now he started to laugh that was as blunt as usual yes he answered are you she frowned thinking it over the way she so often did if she said no he thought he would sink down into the ground but thoughtful still she nodded yes i am i dont know whether i will be if i bear a wizards child three seasons from now but that is in the hands of the gods could a halfbreed work magic hasso thought so but he wasnt sure he also wasnt sure a germangrenye halfbreed would be the same as a lenellogrenye halfbreed since he couldnt do anything about that or about whether drepteaza would catch he asked her was it all right for you if you have to ask you wont like the answer that was a rule as ancient as women drepteaza though was out of the ordinary she kept so much of herself to herself she nodded now slowly but she nodded you were sweeter than i thought you would be she said you really meant it i said so hasso replied what i say i mean it would seem so drepteaza admitted but i told you before i know a lot of men will say anything to get a woman to go to bed with them not in bed hasso said with dignity and with precision of his own on the grass so we are drepteaza said we ought to get dressed too before someone comes over to find out why were not trying to ruin each other wait hasso said and kissed her again the kiss took on a life of its own but not quite enough to start a second round im getting old dammit the german thought even if he was still this side of forty two in a row were only a memory she shook her head as she put on her breeches and tunic you are a very strange man hasso pemsel he shrugged he couldnt very well tell her she was wrong not here even if he would have been ordinary enough in the reich i come from another world what do you expect as she had a habit of doing she answered what hed meant for a rhetorical question i expected you to act the way you look i expected you to act like a lenello if id doubted you were one id be sure you werent now how did she mean that did she know how lenello men made love did she know from experience do i want to find out hasso wondered and decided he didnt he pulled on his own trousers a good thing i see uh saw those kicks coming he said otherwise we never do this now if both those kicks get home maybe we never do this forever i just have to practice more drepteaza said sweetly and how the hell did she mean that once more hasso decided he didnt want to find out even if no one came out on the meadow and caught them in flagrante the rest of the bucovinans didnt need long to figure out that hasso and drepteaza had become lovers rautat spoke for them you make her unhappy you big blond prick and ill cut you off at the knees so were the same size then ill really give you the whipping you deserve i dont want to make her unhappy hasso protested youd better not the underofficer growled shes special and not just cause shes a priestess either you think i dont think so too hasso said rautat snorted who knows what you think who knows if you think i love you too hasso said fat chance rautat said with another snort are we just about finished here can we go back to falticeni pretty soon weve done all the fooling around we need we have to fight pretty soon or dont you think bottero will come after us again as quick as he can of course he will hasso answered you know that as well as i do well no rautat shook his head youve met the man you know him i havent i dont being on the same battlefield with him doesnt count hasso hadnt just met bottero he liked him that had nothing to do with anything not any more hasso thought botteros enmity was only professional not personal like velonas when it came to wanting him dead that might matter a pfennigs worth or it might not he stuck to business saying we can go back to falticeni youre right weve done what we came here to do what about the dragon bones have you heard anything rautat asked not a word hasso said you nothing the underofficer answered i wonder which of us theyd tell i wonder if theyd tell either one of us theyd better we need to know hasso said and the people going after the dragon bones better get out before king botteros army marches if they come after its too late good point they can make amulets for themselves and be safe from lenello magic not that that does us any good rautat said they cant even do that hasso said they dont know what the dragon bones are for they only know lord zgomot wants them youre right thats your fault we never would have worried about stuff like that by ourselves rautat said one more reason the lenelli keep beating you hasso said their security isnt very good if yours is worse he rolled his eyes but then he brightened the dragon bones should ward zgomots men whether they know why or not come to think of it hmm yeah i suppose so the bucovinan paused eyeing hasso you know something youre starting to speak our language pretty well not like you grew up in falticeni or anything but pretty well i think its better than your lenello by now maybe hasso said if it is i have to thank you and drepteaza rautat leered at him well if you tried sweettalking the priestess in lenello shed make you sorry and we both know it hasso thought about that drepteaza angry wouldnt be an erupting volcano like velona shed make him think a glacier had crushed him instead fire or ice better not to provoke either the german said i know you think im stupid im not that stupid hope not anyhow i used to think you were stupid rautat said part of it was because you didnt talk very well not in any language i know ive found out different since stupid youre not but you are bloody strange everybody says that youd be bloody strange in my world too hasso answered landing in his world rautat wouldnt know the customs or speak the language hed end up in trouble before he could learn how could he help it id be strange anywhere the underofficer said not without pride he wasnt wrong either hasso laughed and clapped him on the back the german knew how to deal with rautat hed handled plenty of feldwebels in his wehrmacht days the language here changed so did a few of the details the art as a whole no dealing with drepteaza as a lover that he had to learn one step at a time it wasnt simple either there were moments when he felt like a man trying to defuse a boobytrapped bomb the priestess was more private and much more complicated than velona had been when drepteaza was unhappy shed retreat into herself she would stay polite all the time if you werent paying attention you wouldnt notice anything was wrong then you would lose more points for not noticing hasso complained only once she laughed at him this is what you spent so long mooning over and chasing now you have it and you find out it isnt exactly what you expected what am i supposed to do about that i am what i am i cant be anything different not for you or anyone else he shut up after that she was telling the truth and she had to put up with him too well no in fact she didnt she could dump him any time she pleased but she didnt do that it was as if shed decided that as long as they were going to be lovers she would see just where that led your world must be a funny place she said once as they lay side by side in a cot that wasnt really big enough for both of them why he asked you are a fighting man rautat says you are one of the most dangerous fighting men he ever saw from everything ive seen hes right but you are the gentlest lover any woman here would ever have known he grunted velona never accused him of every such thing everybody he supposed was different with a different partner why is that drepteaza persisted partly its you he pursued his own thought drepteaza made a small dubious noise it is hasso insisted and partly men and women in my world are closer to equals than they are here oh that intrigued her in a new way as he hoped it might how why later he wondered whether bucovinan and maybe even lenello men would have reason to swear at him as best he could he explained how womens rights had flowered in his world over the past hundred years drepteaza reacted the way he knew she would that sounds wonderful why isnt it like that here i dont know hasso answered you say it wasnt always like that where you come from it used to be more the way it is here drepteaza waited for him to nod then went on how are things in your kingdom different now from the way they used to be machines hasso said automatically we have machines to do the things magic can do here but the machines do it better they do it for everybody not just for a few rich people and with lots of machines it doesnt matter so much if men are bigger than women it doesnt matter so much if men are stronger what you know what you can do that matters women are still the ones who have babies though drepteaza said ja hasso noddedthat is one reason there are still differences but women have babies more when they want in my world he explained about rubbers how do you make them drepteaza demanded they would be marvelous the bucovinans and the lenelli used pulling out in time for contraception when they bothered to pull out in time they also used blowjobs and buggery which were more fun for men than for women women here had lots of children lots of kids died here but lots were born hasso spread his hands no idea he hadnt seen anything like rubber here and had the locals had it he didnt know how to make it thin enough for condoms there were the ones they called skins though sheep gut might do like a sausage casing drepteaza giggled and reached for him just like a sausage casing even if he didnt usually manage two rounds close together he surprised himself and did that night afterwards he slept like a log the next morning as they got ready to go back to falticeni drepteaza kept going on about equality for women and about condoms she didnt seem to be able to think or talk about anything else hasso knew hed changed things here with his knowledge of war he hadnt thought what he knew about other things in his lost world might change them here too listening to drepteaza talk he could tell hed been naive she was bubbling with excitement as if she wanted to pack a hundred years into a day hasso wasnt the only one listening to her either rautat sidled up to him and asked why is the priestess all loopy what kind of bullshit have you been feeding her i tell her how things are in my world hasso answered uneasily how the broads rule the roost how nobody there ever gets knocked up and they find babies under the cabbage leaves rautat was exaggerating but if you listened to drepteaza for a while you wouldnt think he was exaggerating by much he eyed hasso if half of what she says is so youre lucky you got out of that place its a demon of a lot better here hasso was lucky hed got out of his own world but not for the reasons rautat imagined you may be right he said and let it go at that he swung up onto his horse easily enough hed ridden on the eastern front too you couldnt always find a halftrack or a vw going where you needed to if you didnt want to walk you went on horseback and he was heading back towards a capital that hadnt fallen unlike the one from which the omphalos stone had hurled him a capital more like moscow than berlin he thought uncomfortably in some ways the lenelli did remind him of the germans he would never see again in others they made him think of the teutonic knights whod gone east against the slavs in days gone by and also eventually ended up losing to them in still others they might have been spaniards or anglosaxons bumping up against indians they werent just like any of those groups however you looked at it though hasso wasnt on the side he would have chosen for himself well sometimes you got your sides chosen for you that was all the bucovinans were people too drepteaza was a very sweet person hasso smiled in the saddle the ivans hed fought were also people he supposed their pagan ancestors whod faced the teutonic knights were people as well the red indians no doubt about it he let out a startled grunt maybe even the jews were people he hadnt thought so for years it wasnt safe or easy to think so not in the reich but hed known a few back in weimar days not well or anything but he had they hadnt seemed so bad if they hated germans now hadnt germany given them reason to he didnt know what all had happened during the war you didnt want to know stuff like that not officially but what if it was all a big fuckup wouldnt that be a kick in the ass xxv except for the stinks hasso was glad to get back to falticeni and lord zgomot seemed as glad to have him back as he was ever glad about anything which is to say not very the lord of bucovin said so the gunpowder shells work the way you want them to do they close enough lord hasso answered zgomot plucked a white hair from his beard he twirled it between his fingers and let it fall close enough is as much as you can expect in life most of the time isnt it i dont argue with that lord the wehrmacht officer said youd better not zgomot told him youre old enough to know so tell me hasso pemsel are you happy now that drepteazas finally sleeping with you close enough lord hasso repeated deadpan the lord of zgomot grunted well ill forgive that from you you had the lenello goddess on earth in your bed for a while that must have been something wearing id guess but something all the same but tell me this is drepteaza happy now that shes finally sleeping with you shed better be or ill make you sorry his tone warned drepteaza mattered to him carefully hasso answered i think she is also close enough if you dont believe me you can ask her oh i did zgomot said i summoned her before i called you i think you are right pretty much i did want to find out how big a braggart you are now that you finally got something you wanted for a long time and hasso said and no doubt about it you are no lenello if you were i would have heard about every thrust every gasp every wiggle zgomot raised an eyebrow you lived among the blonds you know they are vain that way from what hasso had seen the bucovinans were blunter about screwing than the lenelli lord zgomot had a point though the lenelli did invest more vanity in it since hasso didnt much want to talk about it he changed the subject are the men back with the dragon bones no the lord of bucovin replied which answered what hassod asked but left him wanting more more involved another question is bottero moving yet also no for which i thank lavtrig and the other gods zgomot said yes hasso said though he believed in none of the bucovinan gods he wouldnt have believed in the lenello goddess either if he hadnt been compelled to believe there was something there the border isnt closed then no it is not zgomot agreed hasso nodded to himself since hed gone over to the other side the lenelli were liable to have decided all his security worries and precautions were nothing but a load of crap he hoped they did that would make defending against them a hell of a lot easier with a sigh zgomot went on but when bottero does move we are going to have to get through another invasion another years crops ruined in the west another year of burning and murder and rape that is what war is hasso said only one thing worse than to go through it oh the lord of bucovin raised an eyebrow i would not have thought anything was worse i do not think anything is worse one thing is hasso insisted to go through a war and lose that is worse that is what happens happened to my land in my world that is why i am here to try so much to suffer so much to go through so much death and devastation to do that twice in less than half a lifetime and have nothing at all to show for it was the lot of germany how might things have turned out worse he couldnt begin to imagine we managed not to lose last year zgomot said then bottero started late in the campaigning season he will not make the same mistake twice say what you will about the lenelli but they do not make the same mistake twice in a row that is my peoples failing i fear our imaginations spin more slowly than theirs not with you ruling lord hasso wasnt throwing out flattery to butter zgomot up the lord of bucovin was doing as well as he could against long odds i think bottero made a bigger mistake last year too he said now hasso made a questioning noise zgomot eyed him he let me get my hands on you he will regret that to his dying day and may it come soon you give me too much credit hasso said id better not lord zgomot replied after hasso and velona became lovers they moved in together and never separated till he got left for dead on the battlefield and she had to withdraw drepteaza didnt take up residence with him in zgomots castle no matter how much he wished she would have she moved more slowly than velona in almost every way but she didnt stay away from his chamber either sometimes he could talk her into coming by on a particular night sometimes she would knock on her own most of the time she would make love with him once in a while she only wanted to talk he quickly decided getting annoyed about that was a bad idea one evening when she was leaving after talking with him for a couple of hours he gave her a crooked smile and asked do i pass the test even in the lamplight even with her olive skin he could see her turn red it took him by surprise he hadnt meant to embarrass her but she answered as frankly as usual as a matter of fact you do a woman wants to think a man wants her for something more than just this she touched herself between the legs for a moment and i think you do and i think that is good i can talk with you better than with anyone else except maybe rautat hasso barked laughter and that is not the same no it isnt drepteaza agreed not that rautat is stupid ive seen hes not but there are times when he would rather not think yes hasso nodded vigorously rautat made a good underofficer he liked routine he would have made a wonderful friend for another underofficer whose mind worked the same way hell he was friends with other sergeants like that hassos mind ranged further in this world it damn well had to you can go places with me where he doesnt want to and not just in bed you may end up changing us more than the lenelli have drepteaza said for better for worse how can we know ahead of time but you change us he thought again about the printing press one of these days when he had time if he ever did if the bucovinans ever started printing books that would change them even more than gunpowder did but that lay in the future a future that might never be born if i dont the lenelli do he said we know it drepteaza answered if you change us maybe we stay ourselves too if the lenelli change us we lose ourselves forever there used to be lots of little kingdoms in the western part of the land theyre gone now even the grenye who still live in them dont know much about how they used to be that could happen to us too hasso had seen those grenye peasants they had nothing but work and drink some of them had nothing but drink as far as the lenelli were concerned that was fine the germans would have run the ukraine and russia the same way if theyd won hasso hadnt thought much about that while he was fighting the ivans now he did his country had aimed to destroy another one not just to beat it but to destroy it no wonder the russians fought back so ferociously and what did germany end up doing destroying itself instead so much for all the glorious triumphs of the reich what were you thinking drepteaza asked for a moment there you looked over the mountains to the bucovinans that meant a long way off most of the time it made an effective figure of speech not here not now i was thinking about my old land hasso answered farther away than over the mountains what about it i begin to understand why we lost our war we wanted to treat our enemies the way the lenelli treat grenye hasso said but the lenelli know more tricks than the grenye we didnt know more tricks not enough more will you be angry if i say it does not sound as though your land was on a good path drepteaza asked hasso shook his head no it does not sound that way to me either not now but in the middle of a war who worries about such things you have enemies you fight them you try to beat them you try to keep them from beating you you dont think past that to think past that is your uh kings job if your king orders you to do something you know is wicked should you do it he frowned if you know it is wicked no but mostly for a soldier much simpler you fight the other sides army you try to beat it what happens in the land you take thats not your worry no that wasnt the wehrmachts worry that was up to the ss to the gestapo to people like that they didnt think hitler could order them to do anything wicked if he ordered it it had to be all right your conscience troubles you drepteaza didnt make it a question he could have denied it by lying to her and to himself some he said i did a lot of fighting the last four years against our worst enemies maybe we were not always good i know we werent not them either few people would choose war drepteaza said and then qualified that by adding few bucovinans would anyhow i am not so sure about the lenelli hasso wasnt so sure about the lenelli either they thought they had a goddessgiven mission to civilize that is to conquer the grenye the germans had thought the same thing about their slavic neighbors theyd tried conquering them again and again and now the russian slavs had turned things upside down the germans had usually had an edge but not one big enough to make up for the numbers against them the british made it work in india and north america the spaniards farther south so it could if the gap between attackers and attacked was wide enough would it have been here hasso didnt know all he knew was that he was doing his damnedest to throw a spanner into the works maybe he said slowly maybe i owe somebody something when a bucovinan messenger ran up to lord zgomots palace hasso took no special notice that happened all the time he did notice when a messenger rode up to the palace the natives didnt have that many horses they saved the ones they did have for important business and since he was waiting to hear about some important business a messenger on foot summoned him to zgomots throne room what is it about hasso asked his hopes rising i dont know the lord of bucovin didnt tell me the palace flunky answered if you go though he will tell you so there hasso thought he made himself nod and smile and not give the messenger the satisfaction of knowing hed irked him i go then he said and he did when he got to the throne room he found lord zgomot in animated conversation with the man whod come in on horseback zgomot in animated conversation with anybody was a prodigy the native ruler wasnt long on personality but the lord of bucovin looked up and actually smiled as hasso approached good day hasso pemsel he said i owe that drunken lenello a large reward i am slow to spend my gold and silver without need but i gladly do it here we have dragon bones hasso asked we have dragon bones zgomot agreed he gestured toward the messenger i learn that they are in our lands and they passed by botteros men without suspicion the lenelli thought we might grind them up to manure our soil we did not discourage them from thinking this he sounded pleased with himself and well he might he sounded very pleased with himself in fact a nice touch lord hasso said your idea as a matter of fact yes zgomot answered things you said about keeping the lenelli from knowing what we are up to came to mind a story like that will also let the blonds think we are stupid barbarians who could not get bones closer to home they think we are stupid barbarians anyway of course yes they do hasso had too when he was in drammen now he was glad to get the chance to speak of the folk he resembled as they compared to the lenelli the bucovinans were on the barbarous side but as hed seen that didnt make them stupid the lenelli just knew some tricks of the trade that they didnt well no not just the lenelli could also work magic lord zgomot pursed his lips wheels inside of wheels eh always hasso said when do bones get to falticeni i do not know the lord of bucovin turned to the messenger yurgam ten days or so yurgam answered once they made it over the border they got horses instead of donkeys but they are still pulling a heavy wagon hasso shrugged it has to do he would have wanted the bones here sooner but he couldnt turn a horsedrawn wagon into an opel truck or better yet a captured american studebaker that wouldnt have been magic it would have been a bigger miracle than the one that brought him here he nodded to zgomot we need saws to cut bone we need drills to put holes in pieces we need cord or thongs to hold them in place what are the bones for if not manuring yurgam asked before hasso could speak zgomot did i do not want to tell you not yet the fewer people who know the better the more things we learn it seems the more secrets we need to keep hasso beamed sure as hell zgomot was starting to see what security was all about he might be a mindblind grenye but he was one damn sly mindblind grenye thered almost been some security hiccups about gunpowder and dragon bones if the lord of bucovin had anything to do with it there would be no more he learned from his mistakes thats more than hitler ever did hasso thought and if the dragonbone amulets worked how much would being mindblind matter in a few years oh some magic would still be able to do things to the world if not directly to people wizards would still be able to ride unicorns hasso grinned he could ride one himself as hed proved the grenye still wouldnt be able to yeah magic would matter some but it wouldnt mark enormous distinctions between one folk and another the way it did now equality this is equality hasso hadnt had much use for it when he saw it in action and in inaction during the weimar republic but hed also seen that the fuhrerprinzip had some flaws in practice the fuhrer led the people followed right over a goddamn cliff maybe making everybody as good as everybody else worked better he could hope so in fact he had to hope so if the lenelli had magic and the grenye didnt and if that magic stayed important he feared the big blonds would win in the end no matter what he did someone called his name through the echoing corridors of dreams hasso hasso pemsel he tried to shape the ward spell again this time in his sleep he had some luck with that anyhow enough to let him wake up without waking up screaming once awake he went to the door of his room and told one of the guards ask drepteaza to come here please the winter before a bucovinan guardsman would have laughed in his face at the idea of bothering her in the middle of the night this fellow nodded and said all right if she chooses not to come though dont blame me fair enough hasso said the guard set off down the corridor drepteaza was yawning and rubbing her eyes when she came back with the soldier what is it she asked blurrily around another yawn something important i expect it had better be she didnt say that or need to maybe i hope you are not angry at me he led her into the room and shut the door behind them the lenello wizard and the goddess are hunting me in dreams again and so what has that got to do with me no drepteaza wasnt awake yet or thinking very fast then she remembered the dim lamplight shadowing her face only made her smile look more crooked oh a woman will hold that away from you for a night at least a new way to tell me you care eh sorry hasso said should i get someone like leneshul i dont much want her but if you want me to use her for medicine and not bother you i can do that drepteaza started to laugh the really funny part is i believe you when you say you dont much want her she said what kind of fool am i though if i give you the chance to change your mind i may not be at my best but ill try hasso feared he wasnt at his best either maybe they matched each other because it turned out all right or better than all right you are the best medicine he said afterwards stroking her cheek they should make you into syrup and put you in bottles she laughed again on a startled note thats the most ridiculous sweet thing or maybe the sweetest ridiculous thing anyone ever told me its true hasso said ha drepteaza replied which wasnt a laugh at all she yawned once more try not to wiggle too much i dont feel like going back to my room you wiggle more than i do hasso said from where the two of them ended up when they slept together he thought that was true he added besides tonight i dont wiggle at all and mimed limp exhaustion a likely story drepteaza said but she closed her eyes and soon fell asleep so did hasso and adernos wizardry didnt trouble him for the rest of the night the wagon full of dragon bones came into falticeni the next morning the driver had to fight his way through the narrow winding crowded streets to the palace none of the locals knew what an important cargo he had thanks to the way the bonehunters were chosen the driver didnt fully understand that himself one look at some of the teeth and claws in the wagon told hasso the bones were real good he said now we go to work we cut them up small we make them into amulets what are the amulets good for one of the bucovinans asked instead of answering straight out hasso came back with a question of his own is king bottero marching yet does anybody know the wagon driver nodded hes marching all right he wasnt that far behind us when we left his realm one of the border guards who passed us through said it was nice of us to manure our fields the big blond pricks would get good crops out of them the little swarthy man aimed an obscene gesture back toward the west then he noticed hasso watching him uh no offense its all right they are a bunch of big blond pricks hasso said then what does that make you cheeky as a park sparrow the bucovinan grinned at him oh im a big blond prick too hasso answered easily but im a big blond prick with two differences yeah what are they the driver asked a split second in front of one of his pals for one thing im a foreign big blond prick not a lenello big blond prick and im a big blond prick whos on your side when lord zgomot heard the invasion had begun he started assembling his own army bucovin was a big sprawling kingdom or lordship or whatever the hell the right name was the natives sensibly laid up supplies here and there on the main routes around the realm so soldiers wouldnt starve as they came in to falticeni but without the telegraph without trains without trucks nothing happened as fast as hasso wished it would he got a surprise of his own not long after the mobilization order went out into the tent city that was sprouting in front of falticeni came perhaps a thousand men who marched with long pikes held straight up and down they marched well too the pikes stayed vertical and didnt dip and foul one another after seeing them come in hasso hurried back to lord zgomot they look good he said can they fight they have all fought before the lord of bucovin answered they have never fought like this but they have been drilling hard they like being called hedgehogs by the way that is what they named the regiment good for them hasso said if they dont keep lenello knights off the catapults no one does that last was always possible even if he would have preferred not to dwell on it he went on how long are they working i pulled them together before you went off to my estate to try the catapults and the gunpowder shells zgomot answered when you described them i thought this is something we really can do it does not take anything we did not already have it is only a new way to use tools we already knew about you did it without me too hasso didnt know whether to be proud or worried if the natives decided they could get along without him would they knock him over the head and do just that you were busy with other things i thought we could manage this ourselves and i turned out to be right zgomot said i hope they stay steady when the fighting starts that is all so do i hasso said i am going to be with the catapults the hedgehogs keep will keep the big blond pricks off my neck that would be good lord zgomot said his voice dry you should watch them drill to make sure we did not forget anything i do that hasso promised he kept the promise too as he said it was his own personal private neck on the line the picked regiment of bucovinan foot soldiers knew hed had the idea for their formation that didnt seem to bother them they were used to having new ideas come from foreigners the japanese would have been like that in the closing years of the nineteenth century now they could stand up to anybody in the world how long would it be before the bucovinans could stand up to anybody in this world win this fight first or you won t get the chance hasso thought he fingered the dragonsfang amulet he wore under his tunic aderno and velona hadnt paid any sorcerous calls on him since he donned it maybe that meant they couldnt he sure hoped so but maybe it just meant they hadnt tried the past few days win this fight first that was always the imperative and when he watched the hedgehogs go through their evolutions he began to think the bucovinans could they marched very well they formed ten rows and lowered their pikes into a bristling wall of points if he were a horse he wouldnt have wanted to try to charge through them you could hurt yourself that way he said as much to the officer in charge of them the native his name was meshterul nodded we will hold the godscursed lenelli will never get through us he vowed that was an important consideration whether the bucovinans knew it or not it wasnt the only consideration all right they cant get through you hasso said can they get around you meshterul frowned around no he didnt get it around yes hasso nodded who is on your flanks if the lenelli get to the catapults through those people we are still screwed ah meshterul nodded he sketched a salute youre right i was just thinking about the hedgehogs but the real point is keeping the big blond pricks off the catapults isnt it ja hasso said drepteaza and rautat and maybe even lord zgomot might know what that meant but meshterul only gave him a blank look hasso kept to bucovinan after that yes youre right that is the point the hedgehogs may be very important later on if the whole line of foot soldiers carries long pikes how do the lenelli break through at all meshteruls eyes sparkled thatll be the day by lavtrig yes hasso said again once more in bucovinan but that day is not here yet youve got the hedgehogs and youve got a bunch of odds and sods armed with this and that the kind of troops the lenelli have been licking ever since they crossed the western ocean well need riders on our flanks then the bucovinan officer said hasso found himself nodding bucovinan knights mostly couldnt match their lenello counterparts they were better than ordinary bucovinan infantry though after some thought of his own the wehrmacht officer said and we put mines in front of and around the catapults too if we fight in a position that gives us time to do it i havent seen those in action everybody tells me theyre strong magic though meshterul said not magic at all hasso said one more time meshterul stayed polite but plainly didnt believe him if something went boom and blew lenelli to hell and gone it had to be magic didnt it people in this world sure as hell thought so even though hasso knew better he also knew he had to remember to take care of a couple of things some of the mines will be fakes bluffs just turned earth with a fuse sticking out what good does that do meshterul asked it saves gunpowder it keeps the lenelli guessing and we can make fake mines faster than real ones if the lenelli dont know theyre fakes they might as well be real hasso answered the bucovinan captain started to laugh im glad youre on our side dip me in shit and fry me for a pork chop if im not hasso wasnt nearly so sure he was glad to be on the bucovinans side but he wasnt sure he wasnt glad either which marked a change in the way he looked at this world and it wasnt just because he was sleeping with drepteaza he was sure of that hed lived here long enough now and seen enough to have gained a perspective different from the one he had when he first got here and different from the one he brought from his own world ubermenschen untermenschen no and no people were people dammit so here he was fighting for the little swarthy bastards getting ready to go to war against the big blond pricks he started to laugh which made meshterul give him a funny look he didnt care just because people were people that didnt mean everybody loved everybody else oh no not even close several days later than hasso thought it should have the bucovinan army moved west from falticeni he used the time as well as he could he made sure every pot of gunpowder and every metal shell the army was taking with it had a little bit of dragon bone inside or on it accidents could still happen a spark a fire you treated gunpowder with the proper respect and made those as unlikely as you could and now hed magicproofed the powder too or he hoped like anything he had he began to believe the dragon bones would do what he wanted them to do aderno and velona hadnt come close to troubling him since he started wearing his dragonfang amulet he didnt believe they werent trying to bother him anymore they had every reason to hurt him if they didnt kill him if they couldnt then the amulet was working the way he had in mind by now almost everybody in lord zgomots army wore an amulet artisans with saws and thongs had turned them out as fast as they could hasso knew zgomot wore one himself hed given one to the lord of bucovin himself and watched him put it on under his tunic zgomot wore a different tunic today on horseback but the bulge was still there i tried to shoot you last year hasso said riding up alongside him yes i know zgomot answered you killed one of my guards and wounded two more you dont hold it against me hasso asked if you had killed me i would hold that against you zgomot said hasso laughed as much in surprise as for any other reason the lord of bucovin didnt make jokes even wintry ones very often zgomot went on as things stand no you were on the other side you were doing what you could for bottero i might fault your taste but not your loyalty if you tried to shoot me now i would hold that against you and i would have good reason to i think so do i lord hasso said quickly i have no reason to do that well i hope not lord zgomot said we are giving you as much as we can and i hope you stay happy with drepteaza and i hope she stays happy with you i spent a lot of time worrying about that i know lord hasso replied zgomot had damn near ordered her to go to bed with him for what the reich would have called nationalsecurity reasons the only problem was drepteaza didnt take orders like that worth a damn hasso thanked whatever gods happened to be in business locally that shed eventually found reasons of her own he said i am very happy i hope drepteaza is too she cannot be too unhappy or she would drop you she has a mind and a will of her own zgomot said which paralleled hassos thoughts of a moment before only too well the native continued i have tried to ask her a time or two but she does not always tell me all of what she thinks she does not always tell anyone all of what she thinks hasso nodded it wasnt as if he hadnt also noticed that she is her own person yes i like the person she is so do i though not i daresay the same way zgomot smiled one of his crooked knowing smiles since you came to this world you have been lovers with two women with minds of their own well not all of velonas mind is her own since part of it belongs to the lenello goddess but you know what i mean attracting two women of that sort is a compliment to you i would like it better if one of them didnt keep trying to kill me lord hasso said indeed i can see how that might be so but i assure you that you would like it less if they both did if both of those two went after a man at the same time i do not think he would last long neither do i hasso said which was the truth when he was coming back from trying to redefect to the lenelli hed had similar thoughts about bottero and zgomot he couldnt make it here without one of them not unless he aimed to go into the king business himself and he didnt he might like to carry whatever they gave you here instead of a generalfeldmarschalls baton but he had not the slightest desire to wear a crown yes if bottero and zgomot both wanted him dead dead he would be if velona and drepteaza both wanted him dead dead he would be too he suspected he would enjoy dying a lot less in that case suppose velona didnt want him dead suppose she wanted him back what would he do then if he had any brains he would stay with drepteaza even so if he had any brains being with velona had nothing to do with brains you went with velona for the same reason a test pilot climbed into a new fighter planes cockpit to see what kind of thrills it would give you next and velonas thrills were a hell of a lot more exciting than any you could get from a lousy airplane hasso shook his head it was dead it would never come back to life he might miss it he did miss it if he spent all his time mooning over what was lost he would lose sight of what he had what he had was pretty goddamn special too the goddess rules are different from anyone elses zgomot said quietly ja hasso said and then did a double take are you sure you are not a wizard lord he didnt like being so transparent it was dangerous and if zgomot could read him like that couldnt drepteaza do the same thing i am only a man hasso pemsel the lord of bucovin answered but i am a man who knows something of women as much as a man can anyhow and i am a man who has heard a lot about the lenello goddess i am jealous of you maybe only half an hours worth of jealous but jealous even so half an hours worth of jealous that sounded about right would you throw away the chance for happiness for the rest of your life for half an hour if the halfhour was with velona you just might and for a while afterwards you might think youd made a good bargain too if that wasnt power what was it with a shiver hasso said lets beat them lord zgomot nodded xxvi drepteaza rode with the army too hasso wasnt sure she was there to help him translate or just because she couldnt bear to stay behind he wouldnt have wanted to wait back in falticeni either better to know than to worry about every courier who came into town whatever her reasons he was glad she was there she had the same fears as zgomot they boiled down to one basic question which she asked hasso in the tent they shared the night after they set out from the capital can we really beat the big blond pricks can we the german echoed yes of course we can she gave him an exasperated look will we i dont know he answered the look got more exasperated but he went on i am not a god to know things ahead of time maybe they ambush us maybe their magic works in spite of amulets maybe i dont know what all kinds of things can go wrong his mouth twisted believe me when i say that i know what i talk about could germany have beaten russia maybe if the yugoslavs hadnt fought costing the wehrmacht six weeks of good weather in the east maybe if the second years campaign that led to stalingrad hadnt got fucked up from the start maybe germany could have got a draw if she hadnt thrown away so many panzers in the kursk bulge almost two years lay between kursk and berlin but it was downhill all the way after that what are our chances drepteaza asked that was a better question hasso shrugged better than they would be without gunpowder better than they would be without amulets better than they would be without the hedgehogs youre supposed to pat me on the back and tell me everything will be fine drepteaza said maybe it will i hope so hasso said but what you hope and what you get are two different beasts i make no promises i cant without lying what if we lose she persisted even if we lose i think we scare the lenelli out of their hair that was what you did in bucovinan instead of scaring somebody out of a years growth i think they think twice about messing with bucovin after this fight either that or they all get together and jump on us while they still can drepteazas mood swung much more than usual if they see dangerous grenye then they will make friends and they will stay friends till we are beaten the priestess sounded very sure of herself hasso wanted to tell her she was wrong but that wasnt so easy the lenelli were full of contempt for the grenye it sprang from their certainty that the natives couldnt really be dangerous if the grenye suddenly turned out to be opponents worth fighting the lenelli might go after them like hunters after wolves or maybe more like hunters after mad dogs about time they find out they make too many mistakes when it comes to grenye hasso said my kingdom made mistakes about its neighbors it will spend a long time paying for them you see you can make the verbs behave when you think about it drepteaza said for a moment he was annoyed shed changed the subject then he was just surprised and after that he decided hed eased her mind at least a little now if only he could ease his own bucovinans with pots of gunpowder fuses and spades and others with fuses and spades but no pots of gunpowder did their best to delay botteros march east hasso figured they would blow up a few lenelli and make the rest thoughtful none of them knew how to make gunpowder he wanted to hold that secret as tight as he could as long as he could it would leak eventually such things always did but eventually wasnt now and now was what counted all the natives who harassed the lenelli also wore dragonbone amulets if aderno and his pals wanted to try to pick them out by magic well good luck hasso kept gaining confidence in his amulet even after hed come some distance from falticeni aderno and velona werent able to break through and give him a hard time as far as he could tell no lenello magic had come down on zgomots army at all just as much to the point if the wizards wanted to set off the armys gunpowder at a distance the dragon bone would make sure they had their work cut out for them had hasso been a proper wizard and had zgomot had other proper wizards working for him they could have used sorcery to stay in touch not radio but good enough hasso would have known what was going on closer to the border while it was going on as things were he had to wait for messengers the way caesar and napoleon did the news the messengers brought wasnt good bottero was tearing up the countryside as he advanced and enslaving or killing the bucovinans who didnt flee before him none of the news was surprising the lenelli had done much the same the year before that didnt make hearing they were doing it again any more welcome bottero seemed to be taking a more southerly track into bucovin this time around that surprised neither hasso nor zgomot if the lenelli came up the path of devastation theyd made the autumn before they would have a harder time foraging off the countryside and would need to bring more supplies with them better from the invaders point of view to let the natives feed their army you can make things harder for them lord if you burn the land in front of them hasso said i know zgomot didnt sound thrilled about the idea and explained why but if i do that i also make things harder for my own folk until i fear i cannot beat the lenelli without doing that i would rather not start the fires hasso bowed you are the king he used the lenello word not its closest bucovinan equivalent to his surprise lord zgomot smiled once again hasso pemsel you show that whatever you look like you are no lenello none of the big blond pricks would ever admit that a stinking little mindblind grenye he too shifted to lenello for the description could ever be a king that only proves they do not know you lord hasso said bottero is not a bad king but you are a better one i do not think the lenelli have a king as good as you for which i thank you the lenelli are strong they can go forward with good kings or bad bucovin has less less margin for error is the way i want to put it a weak lord of bucovin or a foolish one or even an overbold one could cost my folk dear he was right he had a tiger by the ears and he couldnt let go he couldnt kick the tiger in the ribs either not unless he wanted to enrage it and get himself torn to pieces he had to hang on and hope he could grow his own fangs and claws stripes were too much to hope for everything the army brought with it had to give him more of that hope than hed had before lord you deserve to win hasso blurted maybe i like to think so bottero and velona would tell you otherwise though zgomot said with a shrug but even if i do so what we do not always get what we deserve and do you know what a lot of us a lot of the time are lucky that we do not was it any different in the world you come from hasso didnt need long to think about that no lord he said no different at all if germany had got what she deserved well then what he asked himself the vaterlands hands werent clean in that goddamn war whose hands were maybe the scariest thought of all was that hitlers reich had got what it deserved evening twilight soldiers rubbing their sore feet other soldiers tending to horses and donkeys and oxen somebody playing a clay flute somebody else playing the bagpipes or possibly flaying a cat flatbread baking on hot griddles millet stew bubbling in big pots a cook swearing at a trooper whod stolen some sausage and a sentry running back into the encampment calling a unicorn a unicorn the bucovinan word literally meant nosehorn since that was also the literal meaning of the german word for rhinoceros the wrong image formed in hassos mind for a moment rautat poked him in the ribs youre a hotshot wizard right you ought to be riding the bastard ive done it hasso said this one probably just runs away from me you ought to try the underofficer persisted yes you should drepteaza agreed think how much it would mean to our warriors to see that they had a wizard a true unicornriding wizard going into battle on their side infantrymen fought better when they knew a few panzers were in the neighborhood the tanks didnt have to do anything they just had to be there if the foot soldiers knew armor could back their play they got bolder hasso had never thought of himself as a panzer but he could see that the bucovinans had a point well i see what i can do he said and then louder to the sentry where is this unicorn who oh its you the native said come with me ill take you to him do you think you can mount the beast i dont know hasso answered i want to find out what will you do if you can ride it the sentry persisted piss off the lenelli hasso said isnt that reason enough more than reason enough you ask me the man grinned he pointed towards a stand of oaks a few hundred meters from the encampment i went out there to make sure no lenello spies were hiding in amongst the trees and i saw the beast instead maybe it wasnt instead maybe a unicorn had brought a lenello wizard up here to see what the bucovinan army was up to maybe he was sending word to botteros army like a forward artillery observer back in hassos world maybe maybe anything dammit hasso made sure his sword was loose in the scabbard as he walked out to the trees it wouldnt do him much good against a lenello soldier but it might against a wizard those boys would depend on magic till they found out it didnt work hasso sure hoped they would find out it didnt anyway how were you supposed to call a unicorn simple make a noise like a virgin he shook his head he really was losing it not only was the joke weak it wasnt even true not in this world he stepped around the trunk of a tree that had been growing there a few hundred years and there it was it stared at him out of big black eyes a woman would have killed for hey he said softly a noise more of recognition than anything else in the dim fading light that pure white coat seemed to glow even more than it would have under bright sunshine he saw right away that the unicorn was wild it had never borne a lenello wizard on its back it was unshod no one had gilded or silvered its horn or braided its mane and tail it had no saddle or reins hey he said again a little louder he had a bit of honeycomb a treat for his horse he held it out to the unicorn here you go what do you think of this he watched its nostrils dilate as they took the scent of the honeycomb and no doubt his scent too did magic have an odor how could a unicorn tell a wizard if it didnt maybe the way aderno did by magic slowly cautiously the unicorn approached it took the honeycomb with as much delicacy as a cat would have taken a bit of fish its mouth and breath were warm and moist against hassos palm after it finished it looked at him as if wondering whether there was more he reached out to stroke its nose it let him do that it felt like fine velvet under his fingers sorry he said thats all ive got with me theres more back at the camp though if you want to give me a lift it couldnt possibly have understood him could it it was just a beautiful animal wasnt it what did he know about unicorns not bloody much what he knew about this one was that it knelt and gave him an inviting look he wasnt a terrible horseman but hed never ridden bareback before hed never ridden an animal without reins and a bit either the lenello wizards didnt do that hed seen as much if he tried it and it turned out not to be what the unicorn had in mind he was in a ton of trouble but the last invitation more definite than this one hed had was the one velona gave him after he shot the grenye who were chasing her yeah and look how that turned out his mind gibed but you couldnt win if you didnt bet he got on the unicorns back and patted the side of its neck it rose to its feet as easily as if he didnt weigh a thing wow he said and then come on this way he pointed over toward the encampment and damned if the unicorn didnt head in that direction the horse the bucovinans had given him was a plodder this this was like riding lightning and fire the unicorns hooves hardly seemed to touch the ground he knew they must have but they didnt seem to when he came out of the little wood the sentrys jaw dropped lavtrigs dick he exclaimed you did it how about that hasso knew he was grinning like an idiot well if he hadnt earned the right who had as usual the camp was a raucous place he could tell just when the bucovinans spotted him because silence rippled out and through the place people turned and looked his way till all he saw were thousands of staring faces all with wide eyes most with mouths fallen open he waved to the natives to victory he called if he could have figured out how to say in hoc signo vinces in bucovinan he would have done that to victory seemed to do the trick in a heartbeat everybody was yelling it the unicorn sidestepped nervously but calmed down when he patted it again he didnt plan on leading a wild cavalry charge his place was back with the artillery but he had one hell of a mount under him of course hed thought the very same thing with velona too when rautat came over to congratulate him on bringing back the unicorn the beast snorted angrily lowered its head and aimed its horn at the underofiicers midriff hey hasso said i wasnt going to do anything rautat said he also backed off in a hurry which made the unicorn relax cut that out you hasso told the animal it turned its head and looked back at him as if to say whos the boss here anyway and it knew the answer too it was could you train a unicorn could you convince it that you were the boss if you could hasso hadnt started doing it yet and he didnt know how anyway he did know he wasnt about to put up with the unicorns doing anything like that to drepteaza to his surprise it didnt even start it stood quietly and let her come close boy i like that rautat said whats she got that i dont he snickered coming up with his own obvious answer to that drepteaza bent down picked up a pebble and threw it at him the unicorn let out a snuffling noise and bobbed its head as if to say he had it coming go get some more honeycomb hasso told the underofficer i promised and maybe that makes it put up with you rautat nodded and scurried away do you do you think i could touch it drepteaza asked i dont know hasso answered you can try but be ready to get out of the way in a hurry if it doesnt want you to without bit reins and stirrups he had next to no control over the unicorn if it decided to rear for instance all he could do was grab its mane and hang on for literally dear life eyes wide and shining drepteaza stepped up alongside the unicorn she reached out and set her palm on the side of its neck oh she whispered its like i dont know what its like but its wonderful its more finely woven than a horse isnt it yes that was a better way of putting it than hasso had found for himself thank you she told him and moved away had velona been standing there she would have been wild to ride the animal drepteaza was sure she couldnt and didnt try hasso suddenly wasnt so sure himself he slid down from the unicorns back wait he called to drepteaza she stopped a few quick strides brought him over to her she let out a startled squawk when he picked her up it was easy she couldnt have weighed more than fortyfive kilos what are you doing she said but she needed only a moment to realize exactly what he was doing no stop you cant the unicorn wont let you the unicorn wont let me and sure enough the unicorn looked extremely dubious when hasso started to put drepteaza on its back cut that out he said again shes not going to hurt you nobodys going to hurt you he still didnt think the unicorn could understand him but he wasnt a hundred percent sure it couldnt rautat chose that exact moment to come back with the honeycomb which didnt hurt hasso set drepteaza down for a moment and kept his promise to the unicorn then he picked her up again she had the sense not to kick and flail she alighted on the unicorns back as smoothly as she could and sat very still once she got there the animal snorted and rolled its eyes but it didnt try to buck her off hasso patted its flank walk he told it and damned if it didnt take a couple of steps it cant do that drepteaza said im not magic you are to me babe hasso said she gave him a look that warned she would have a lot to say to him later but this wasnt the time or place pretending he didnt notice he went on maybe it just needs someone who can do magic close by or maybe the lenelli are full of shit who knows we could never ride them drepteaza said if we caught them and tried to tame them they starved themselves to death but im really on it arent i you really are and everything is good yes yes she said but then maybe youd better get me down i dont think i want to push my luck all right hasso took her in his arms again he wanted to give her a quick kiss before he set her on the ground but he didnt he didnt want to look like a big blond taking advantage of her in front of her people as her feet touched the ground she patted him on the hand as if to tell him hed done that right im a grenye she said im a grenye and ive ridden a unicorn who could have imagined that will it carry other people someone asked it wont carry me the stupid creature rautat said the glare the unicorn gave him told the world he was right honeycomb or no honeycomb wondering whether the unicorn disliked grenye men in particular hasso asked a cooks wife if she wanted to try it sure if the creature will let me she said she giggled when he lifted her off the ground he didnt giggle she was at least fifteen kilos heavier than drepteaza but the unicorn made it very plain it didnt want her on its back sorry hasso said setting her down dont worry about it foreign sir she replied with more grace than a lot of noblewomen probably would have shown under the same circumstances i know im no priestess the unicorn must know the same thing did it if it did how the cooks wife smelled of garlic but so did drepteaza all bucovinans did they ate the stuff with everything except melons and strawberries so what made the difference the unicorn wasnt talking lord zgomot came over to see why people were kicking up a fuss a unicorn he said well well i have never been lucky enough to see one close up before he gave hasso something that was more than a nod but less than a bow an advantage to having a wizard with us that i had not thought about it let me on its back lord drepteaza exclaimed me really zgomot did bow to her i am jealous do you want to try lord hasso asked zgomot wasnt much heftier than the cooks wife hasso thought he could get him onto the unicorns back whether the unicorn would put up with it me the lord of bucovin sounded surprised if it doesnt want you up there it lets you know but it doesnt hurt you it is a polite unicorn hasso said that made several bucovinans smile so it probably wasnt just the word he should have used but what the hell it got his meaning across and the cooks wife affirmed that shed tried failed and still had all her giblets lord zgomot plucked at his beard well why not he said let us see what will happen the unicorn let him come up alongside it it let him touch it which seemed to impress him as much as it had drepteaza can you lift me up there he asked hasso i think so lord the german answered you dont eat a big lunch i hope zgomot smiled a crooked smile no i was moderate wonderingly he stroked the unicorn again you had to touch a unicorn like that if you were a man it was like touching your first girl only more so whenever you are ready zgomot said hasso picked him up the unicorn laid back its ears and snorted when the lord of bucovins behind touched its back but it didnt buck or run wild or do any of the other things that could have made zgomots bodyguards use hasso for a pincushion you are on a unicorn hasso told him i am on a unicorn lord zgomot sounded amazed well who could blame him how the bucovinans cheered drepteaza looked as proud of her sovereign as could be and hasso said king bottero never does this no he is missing something then zgomot said will it walk for me he urged the unicorn forward as if it were a horse but it wouldnt go not even the couple of steps it had for drepteaza shrugging zgomot slid off i am a grenye and i have been on a unicorn he declared as drepteaza had by the way he said it he might have been the first man to set foot on the moon his subjects cheered louder than ever hasso looked at the unicorn it looked back at him if it didnt wink he was losing his mind or maybe he was losing his mind if he thought it did wink no one else seemed to notice was he going to start collecting omens and portents why not everybody else in this world did and as far as he could see a winking unicorn couldnt be anything but a good one a bucovinan named shugmeshte was almost out of his mind with glee he was one of the gunpowdermen whod gone forward to slow down botteros advancing army i fooled em he told hasso and zgomot bugger me blind if i didnt fool em what did you do hasso asked shugmeshte swigged from a mug of beer so i dig holes in the road and run fuses to them right this is before the big blond bastards get there you understand so then i plant some real jugs in the field alongside but real carefullike so you cant spot em easy hasso grinned i think i like the way this story is going the lord of bucovin nodded hasso said well tell us more so the blond pricks come by shugmeshte said so they see theres trouble in the road so they get smart or they think they do so they ride into the field so whatever happens in the road doesnt hurt em so i light the fuses and bam they go flying i blew up a unicorn i did im not sure i want to hear that hasso said he was still riding the wild one himself but he clapped shugmeshte on the back you do good you did good and this says something important what zgomot asked it says the amulets really do keep lenello wizards from spotting gunpowder this is good news hasso wondered whether shugmeshte had blown aderno to hell and gone that would be very good news he could hope anyhow ah the lord of bucovin nodded i see yes what you say makes good sense you seem to have a way of doing that thank you lord hasso said coming from a resolutely sensible fellow like zgomot that praise meant something zgomot turned back to shugmeshte are you ready to do this to the lenelli again lavtrig yes the gunpowderman exclaimedwe can hurt them we can scare them weve never been able to scare them before i like it go then zgomot said shugmeshte saluted clenched fist over his heart the same gesture the lenelli used how long ago had the bucovinans adopted it did anyone here even remember hasso wouldnt have bet on it zgomot nodded to hasso we have kept security as well as we could none of the gunpowdermen knows how to make the stuff not many folk besides us and the men who get them oh and scanno know our amulets are made from dragon bone this is how you should do things lord hasso said sooner or later secrets get out but you always want it to be later not sooner you do make sense zgomot told him one of the first things a ruler learns is that secrets always get out hasso thought of the american bazooka it was a wonderful weapon it let a foot soldier wreck a panzer without needing to creep suicidally close as soon as the germans saw it they knew they wanted something like it they made capturing one a top priority once they had one the panzerschreck got into production in a few months and it was better than the bazooka that spawned it with a largercaliber rocket it had a longer range and could pierce thicker armor later is better hasso said again once the lenelli got their hands on some gunpowder and they would because his fuses were imperfectly reliable how long would they need to figure out what went into it not too long odds were none of the ingredients was especially rare how long would they need to start making their own that could take a while they would need to work out the right proportions then they would have to figure out how to mix them without blowing themselves a mile beyond the moon so it wouldnt be a few months but it might be only a few years cannon can i build a cannon hasso got the same answer he always did maybe but not right now and how long would the lenelli take to realize dragon bone was thwarting their spells getting their hands on an amulet wouldnt be hard but how could you sorcerously analyze something that didnt let you work magic damn good question he thought even if they did know what could they do about it even if you knew what water was could you get something to burn in it he wished he hadnt thought of it that way because you could if you were sly enough and smart enough magnesium would burn even underwater if you tossed a lump of metallic sodium into water it would start burning all by itself so did the lenelli have the sorcerous equivalent of sodium hasso shrugged how was he supposed to know he was a stranger here himself the lenelli the lenelli of botteros kingdom anyhow had velona if she wasnt sodium hasso couldnt imagine what would be did they know how to use her or perhaps the goddess to best advantage he shrugged again one more thing he couldnt be sure of well find out he thought a little or maybe more than a little uneasily zgomot knew where he wanted to make his fight hasso hadnt been there before so he couldnt judge the position firsthand when he listened to zgomot and rautat talk about it it sounded good sometimes you had to assume the other guys on your side knew what the hell they were doing sometimes you got royally screwed making assumptions like that too hasso had to hope this wasnt one of those times knowing where his own force would stand let zgomot chivvy bottero in the direction he wanted him to go bucovinan raiding parties shoved the lenello line of march a little farther south than it might have gone otherwise with a little luck the invaders wouldnt even notice they were getting shoved peasants fled before the lenelli they clogged the roads in the low countries and france fleeing civilians had worked to the wehrmachts advantage they slowed up the enemy then years later german civilians fled before the ivans and made life difficult for the army what went around came around at hassos suggestion zgomot tried channeling the refugees down some roads with luck leaving others clear so his soldiers could move on them it didnt work as well as hasso hoped the bucovinan traffic cops were trying something theyd never done before and the peasants didnt want to listen to them you did what you could with what you had that was all with a couple of machine guns and enough ammo he could have slaughtered the lenelli without losing a bucovinan with a battery of s a forward observer and a couple of radio sets he could have slaughtered them before they got within ten kilometers of him with experienced german feldgendarmerie personnel he could have kept the peasants from mucking up the roads so badly as things were the soldiers had to push through and past the farmers and their livestock they lost time doing it they lost less time than they would have with no bucovinans directing traffic but more than hasso liked we will use more gunpowder in front of the lenelli to slow them down too zgomot said when hasso complained things will even out so they will hasso knew he sounded surprised he should have thought of that himself good thing somebody did no no flies on zgomot who was the barbarian anyway one evening hasso saw the smoke of lenello campfires or maybe of farmhouses the lenelli were burning rising against the bright western sky soon now he said yes zgomot nodded he was never a talky man the closer the battle came the less he said his whole realm rode on this and he felt the pressure well why wouldnt he the poor son of a bitch hasso said we put the hedgehogs in front of the catapults yes the lord of bucovin nodded hasso continued on their flanks we dig trenches that way we worry not so much about other troops protecting them botteros men will see the trenches zgomot said ja so what they see they cant get past them they go fight somewhere else we want them to do that yes yes zgomot nodded we will dig if we have time more smoke fouled the horizon the next day the day after that the bucovinans came to zgomots chosen battle site hasso smiled when he saw it the lord of bucovin could pick em all right well the german had already found that out the hard way if zgomot couldnt pick em hasso would still be fighting for the other side falticeni might have fallen if it hadnt it would this time around for sure and he would still be bedding velona details details details here looked good a small river anchored the bucovinan right the lenelli wouldnt turn that flank on the left a forest made it hard for the enemy to get through zgomot would have to post some soldiers in there but not many if bottero wanted to get past the bucovinans hed have to come right at them and he would hasso knew the lenello king well enough to be sure of that down in his gut bottero wouldnt believe a bunch of grenye savages could stop his knights yes theyd done it the autumn before but with a trick hed have his wizards looking for pitfalls this time he wouldnt get fooled the same way twice and he wouldnt think the natives could come up with two new things in a row by now he would know about gunpowder of course bucovinans swarmed over the field in front of where they would post their line at hassos direction they dug dummy mines and planted real ones a lot of the real ones were nearer the trees where soldiers could light the fuses without risking their lives too much minefields werent made to stop enemies though they were made to channel them these would aim the lenelli right at the catapults that would be great if the hedgehogs did their job could they really hold off horsemen could they say hold off a deep striking column if they couldnt lord zgomots strong position was in a word fucked if they cant i am in a word dead hasso thought he spoke to them you have to stand fast no matter what you have to if you do we win bucovin wins if you dont you screw us all have you got that yes they shouted they seemed eager enough how eager theyd be when lenello knights on big horses couched lances and thundered down on them hasso would just have to see even in the fight the bucovinans lost the autumn before hed thought they were plenty brave now they had better tools to be brave with maybe that would turn the trick he had to hope so scouts rode out of the west pointing over their shoulder as they came most of them rode donkeys not horses the greater part of the horses bucovin had were under bucovins knights the shouts the natives let out gradually turned into words and the words were theyre coming the lenelli reached the field late that afternoon botteros banner fluttered big and bright and red in the distance velona would be somewhere over there hasso spotted several unicorns the wizards had come in force well he hadnt expected anything else zgomots men stood in line of battle ready to fight a lenello rode forward waving green branches as a sign of truce he came straight toward the center of the line right where the charge would likely go in he was scouting the ground but what could you do when he got close he shouted tomorrow you die in lenello and rode away without waiting for an answer xxvii it was a long restless night hasso and zgomot feared the lenelli might try to steal the battle under cover of darkness the bucovinans slept in shifts and in their armor with weapons close at hand zgomot sent scouts and sentries as far forward as he could and well out to both flanks as well hasso wouldnt have wanted to try a nighttime cavalry charge he feared an attack on foot if bottero thought that was the best way to cut down the value of gunpowder well the lenello king might well have been right and a little past midnight so the german judged by the position of the moon the lenelli did try something bucovinan scouts gave the alarm horns blared in the bucovinan camp soldiers who had been sleeping sprang up clutching swords and spears hasso grabbed a smoldering length of punk and ran to the catapults lobbing shells at night was one more thing he didnt want to do he couldnt aim and they were much too likely to go off before they flew because the catapult men would be clumsy in the dark he shook his head not they it wouldnt happen more than once but to his surprise the lenelli drew back instead of striking home big fires blazed in and around their camp maybe they feared bucovinan raiders that was a comforting thought by the light of those fires hasso made out tiny figures in reality blonds mostly taller than he was running back and forth and gesticulating at one another he wished for zeiss binoculars with them he might have learned something about what was going on over there as things were he could only guess whatever the lenelli had planned it didnt seem to have worked i wonder if they tried to use magic to lull our scouts to sleep so they could get close without our knowing drepteaza said when he went back to their tent he didnt think he would sleep any more but he hoped he was wrong he chewed on that slowly he nodded makes more sense than anything i think of he said and it means our amulets work he reached up and touched his through his tunic the lenelli cant be happy about that he imagined bottero screaming at his wizards and the wizards yelling back the bucovinans couldnt have prayed for a prettier picture it only means theyll hit us harder come the dawn drepteaza predicted theyll think they have to pay us back pay us back hasso said puzzled of course she sounded surprised he couldnt see what she meant weve insulted them we didnt fall over when they expected us to and when grenye insult lenelli the lenelli pay back in blood hasso grunted uneasily that had the feel of truth to it the wehrmacht felt the same way about the red army when the russians didnt roll over and play dead after june how dare they keep fighting when theyre licked was the thought in german minds all through that summer the reich had two years of nothing but victory behind it by then its soldiers expected more as if that were theirs by right well the lenelli had generations of victories behind them by now they too expected more drepteaza was right they were liable to turn mean if they didnt get them the germans sure had yes the germans had got mean and then theyd got desperate if you jumped on a bears back all you could do was hang on tight sometimes that didnt help either hasso wouldnt have been fighting in the ruins of berlin if it did the lenelli wouldnt have gone that far down the road yet but theyd still be angry affronted theyd want their revenge all right didnt bucovin also have some revenge coming though we see who pays uh whom hasso said drepteaza kissed him the sun came up behind the bucovinans that would help their archers and slingers and hurt the bowmen of the lenelli who would have a harder time aiming were the battle different it would have mattered more this fight wasnt going to be about archery it would be about knights and gunpowder and it would be about the hedgehogs they took their places in front of the catapults a hundred men wide ten men deep as they marched into position they held their spears high and they kept on holding them high the lenelli would see that they had unusual weapons but hasso didnt want them seeing what the hedgehogs intended to do with those weapons not till the very last moment he rode out in front of the pikemen on the unicorn just to give botteros men one more thing to think about you can do it he told the pikemen again if you do it we win if you run bucovin runs with you you will fight yes they shouted sure as hell they thought they could hold the lenelli out hasso was sure of that and it mattered if you thought you could win you were halfway home not all the way hasso knew that too bitterly well but halfway was a lot better than going into a fight with your heart in your throat sure the enemy would do something horrible to you any minute now slowly the lenelli formed their battle line would they use a strike column if they did where would it go in he knew where he expected it to go toward the hedgehogs whether he wanted it going there was a different story if they held he would blow the lenelli to kingdom come if they didnt well shit if they didnt hed be too dead to worry about anything else anyway as he looked toward the building enemy line of battle he didnt see a striking column though maybe botteros men were disguising it well or maybe bottero thought hasso knew the perfect counter and so didnt dare use a deep column or again maybe the lenello king was just against everything hasso had ever been for whatever bottero was thinking hasso sure hoped the lenelli didnt throw a striking column at his army he had no perfect counter and getting his line broken scared the crap out of him but he saw knights all the way across the lenello front were more of them in one place than in another he wished again for the zeiss field glasses whatever he wished for from the world in which he was born he didnt get it he wondered why that didnt stop him from wishing where was velona somewhere in that line somewhere in the middle of it odds were if she couldnt kill him by exploding his head from the inside out shed be willing to try a more conventional way of getting rid of him willing hell shed be eager and shed be deadly as a cobra too horns blared there in the lenello line lances swept down to point at the bucovinans their points sparkling in the sunshine at the same time captain or colonel or whatever the hell his rank was meshterul shoutedlower down swept the pikes too those of the first five rows stuck out beyond the leading men creating a fence of spearheads the back rows of pikemen didnt drop their spears all the way to horizontal but kept them up at increasing angles the pikeshafts would deflect a few arrows as the men moved forward they would lower their spears more and more hasso went from one catapult to another each one had a shell on the casting arm he wouldnt do all the lighting this time not with several catapults fighting at the same time all he could do was fight one catapult and direct the rest are we ready he asked is everything the way it should be ready the crews shouted he hoped to god they were right catapults were complicated machinery for this world and as liable to break down as panzers were back in the world he came from well hed done what he could do now most of it was up to the natives more horns blew the lenelli moved forward slowly at first they wouldnt boot their horses up to a gallop till they came within missile range of the bucovinan line the bucovinan knights would have to go forward too or take the charge with no momentum of their own that worried hasso if something went wrong the moving wings and the stationary center could come unglued and let the lenelli in he didnt know what to do about it he hadnt seen anything he could do about it except worry there was botteros banner heading straight for him the king would ride right by his standardbearer his lance would be couched and he would be ready to kill anything that got in his way bottero was as tough as any of the men he led which was saying a good deal before long hasso recognized his former sovereign zgomot made a better administrator in a fight hasso would have bet on bottero every goddamn time and there was velona brandishing a sword she wore a mailshirt but her head was bare her long fair hair swept out behind her but that wasnt what drew his eye to her the goddess filled her he could tell she was beautiful and terrible and terrifying he glanced warily toward the sky the day stayed bright and clear hasso allowed himself a sigh of relief the worst thing the lenello wizards could have done as far as he could see was to start a driving rainstorm dragonbone amulets wouldnt stop that trying to set off mines and launch shells with wet fuses would have been a nightmare but the wizards hadnt thought of it this time anyhow off to his left on the forest flank a mine exploded too soon and then another one a bucovinan there must have come down with buck fever and lit his fuses too soon some of the lenello knights horses over there flinched inward which threw their charge into a little confusion but not enough not enough and then a mine blew two horses off their feet fifty meters in front of the trees and blasted another man out of the saddle more mines went off as the foot archers moving up behind the knights came near some of them went down too and the rest like any troops with half a gram of sense hesitated about going forward that was good but he didnt have much time to dwell on the archers the knights were nearing him with frightening speed they looked as if they could ride down anything on earth the way a company of panzers would have looked to foot soldiers in his own world if the hedgehogs panicked and broke and ran they didnt the men in the first row went to one knee the better to receive the charge without hassos telling them what to do the bucovinans in charge of setting off the mines in front of the hedgehogs lit their fuses at just about the right time he didnt know whether to cheer or to puddle up his students were going out into the world on their own and they were doing well the world was also trying to break in on them velona shouted something hasso couldnt make out what it was but he shouldnt even have been able to hear it from a range of several hundred meters not through his own sides yells those of the other lenelli and the rising thunder of the horses hooves he shouldnt have been able to but he did the goddess he thought uneasily maybe probably the wizards were thwarted whatever power velona had was wilder and stronger than theirs it scared the bejesus out of him because he didnt know what its limits were or if it had any he didnt know but he was about to find out he touched a glowing length of punk to the fuse on the shell in the catapults hurling arm as soon as it caught he jumped back yelling loose swoosh thump the arm shot forward and thudded into place against the padded rest other swooshes and thumps said the rest of the catapults were shooting too hasso breathed a prayer of thanksgiving to whomever that no shell went off too soon blowing up a catapult crew would have been bad for morale an air burst right above the hedgehogs heads would have been worse boom boom those were mines going off a little too soon horses reared and snorted in fear but the lenelli fought them down and kept on coming they wouldnt panic the way they did the first time experience counted here as anywhere else you lived and you learned if you lived the lenelli had nerve too not even their worst enemies among whom hasso now counted himself would have denied that for a moment boom boom more mines this time horses went down knights crashed to the ground or flew through the air the charge was disordered but it came on anyhow german fifteenyearolds advancing on josef stalin tanks with panzerfausts couldnt have shown more guts things happened very fast now boom boom boom those were the flying shells bursting on and above the lenelli and spraying lead balls and sharp fragments of bronze and iron through them more horses fell more knights got blasted hasso thought they would break then his catapult crew like all the rest worked frantically to reload the weapon and tighten up the ropes of hair that powered it they grunted and cursed and sweated as they yanked at windlasses they didnt seem to have cranks hasso made a note to himself to do something about that before too long he wondered if hed remember off on the wings where the defense wasnt so tough the lenelli engaged the bucovinans if the blonds broke through on either side they might still win no matter what happened to their center germany had built up motorized panzer and panzergrenadier divisions but the rest of the wehrmacht the bulk of the wehrmacht still relied on horses and shoe leather hasso had modernized some of the bucovinan army but not all how well would the rest perform for that matter the lenelli werent beaten yet even in the center hasso lit another fuse loose swoosh thump the catapult flung it away boom it blew up and hurt some blonds in spite of the pounding to which they couldnt reply they kept on coming hed heard that a charging horse would stop short and wouldnt impale itself on a picket fence of spearpoints no doubt that was true if the horse was left to its own inclinations but determined riders could make their horses go forward against those long spears they could and they did wounded horses shrieked like wounded women some of them fouled pikes as they fell others pushed forward into the gaps so did dismounted lenelli trying to get within sword reach of the bucovinans the spears held them out meshterul and the rest of the hedgehogs officers deserved the knights cross with oak leaves and swords this was the first time theyd ever used their phalanx but they performed like tenyear veterans every time a pike got fouled another man stepped forward to get his point into the fight hasso just hoped they didnt run out of men they were only ten deep next time theyd be deeper was that bottero there a third of a meter taller than the natives that was velona slashing away as if possessed and so no doubt she was if even she if even the goddess couldnt break through well the bucovinans had a chance anyhow one catapult crew wrestled its unwieldy contraption around so it could shoot at the lenelli off to the right swoosh thump boom one shell bursting where the blonds didnt expect it created far more fear than a whole salvo they were braced to receive good job hasso yelled good job and then meshterul yelled a command the natives might never have given on the battlefield before forward hasso wondered if the hedgehogs commander had lost his mind the pikemen had stopped the lenello cavalry charge in its tracks that was all they had to do hasso had been far from sure they could do even so much could they drive the blond horsemen back damned if they couldnt they thrust their long pikes at the unarmored horses not at the knights on their backs the wounded horses shrieked some reared some fell their riders had a devil of a time keeping them under control the bucovinans speared the lenello knights who went down with their mounts speared them and then trampled them underfoot as they surged ahead the lenello line wavered the knights had never met infantry like this as hasso knew too well from bitter experience if you couldnt go forward all too often you couldnt hold your ground either in what seemed like no time at all there was no line in front of the hedgehogs there were only frightened knights riding away as fast as they could swoosh thump boom more shells sped the lenelli fleeing the center on their way then at hassos shouted orders all the catapult crews swung their weapons to one side or the other and started bombarding the lenelli on the wings a bigger force of hedgehogs could have rolled up the lenelli to either side of them by what struck hasso as a miracle meshterul realized he didnt have that kind of force and halted his men before they advanced too far and got cut off such intrepid brainless heroism had cost the saxons dear at hastings swoosh thump boom the catapults couldnt fling shells anywhere near so fast as a battery of s they didnt have so many shells to fling either hasso was painfully aware that they wouldnt have any more for weeks once they ran dry here everything rode on this battle swoosh thump boom that was a good one it burst just above the lenelli on the left and knocked down four of them a round couldnt have done much more and it panicked the knights who were still fighting they decided all at once that theyd had enough going up against grenye savages was one thing facing death from out of the air that was something else they rode off too seeing them retreat the knights on the right also pulled back the lenello archers whod come up behind them now screened their withdrawal well the archers tried the catapults outranged them though three or four shells bursting among them sent them on their way you know what we just did rautat said as the archers withdrew we beat em hasso knew it damn well but rautat was going to make his joke whether hasso gave him a straight line or not we just circumcised the big blond pricks thats what he said and went off in gales of laughter all the natives who heard him broke up too and hasso laughed along why the hell not to a winner everything was funny along with the bucovinans hasso tramped the field after the battle they were looking for loot and to finish off or capture surviving lenelli he was looking for faces he knew he soon found one too there lay mertois castellan of castle svarag a pike had punched through his thigh and he must have bled to death so many dead horses rautat said sadly what a waste at least a hundred of them lay twisted right in front of the hedgehogs position theyd done what their riders told them to do and theyd paid for it so had a lot of the men who spurred them forward the lenelli didnt know what they were up against till too late there lay king bottero bucovinans had already stolen his fine sword his helm with the gold circlet his gilded mailshirt despite the byrnie hed taken a lot of wounds he didnt have a son the succession in drammen was liable to get messy that was good news for bucovin too and there lay velona her golden hair all sodden with blood none of the bucovinans had taken the sword from her hand they knew who she was and they knew what she was and they didnt want anything to do with her they werent so dumb even rautat hung back a couple of steps as hasso knelt beside her so thats what she looks like up close the underofficer said if you like great big blondes i guess shes pretty hasso hardly heard him he eased the sword from his onetime beloveds grip then reached out to touch her hand when he did he frowned she should have been cooler than that if she were dead his index and middle fingers found that spot on her wrist by the thumb side of the tendons her pulse was slow but it was there jesus he muttered another deity missing in action here what rautat said shes not dead hasso said shes just knocked out rautat started to draw his belt knife to remedy that then he jammed it back into the sheath i dont dare he said not against the goddess he took off on the dead run hasso would have stopped him if he had tried to kill velona he wondered why when shed come so close to killing him he also wondered what the hell he was going to do with her to her when she came to he didnt fear the goddess the way rautat did which probably meant he didnt understand the situation as well as the native did cautiously feeling he found a knot on the side of her head he nodded to himself going into battle without a helmet was great for heartening your friends and frightening your foes when it came to actually fighting not so good he probed a little harder if she had a fractured skull she might not wake up which might prove a relief for everybody but her she grimaced and tried to twist away from him she wasnt deeply out then that was a good sign or maybe a bad one depending on how you looked at things then her eyes opened for a moment she had no idea who he was who she was herself or what the hell was going on hasso sympathized hed been down that road himself the autumn before a concussion was not your friend she blinked and blinked again her mouth set reason was coming back those blue blue eyes found his you she said her voice a hoarse croak afraid so lenello came rustily from his lips he wasnt used to hearing it without a rough bucovinan accent any more either want some water please he had a jug on his belt he took it off and held it to her lips she drank and drank better he asked when shed almost emptied it a little maybe she needed two tries to sit up when she looked around and saw bucovinans roaming the field and lenelli and their chargers down and dead in windrows she looked first humanly astonished and then more than humanly outraged what did you do to us what did we do to you to deserve this well trying to kill me makes a pretty good start hasso worked hard to remember the past tenses that had given him so much trouble he needed them here i loved you and you tried to cook my brains for me he watched her gaze sharpen if she could have slain him right there she would have done it but she couldnt even start it was like watching an archer try to shoot in a driving rainstorm my wits are all scrambled she muttered i believe it hasso said you are going to have headaches like you dont believe takes days maybe weeks to get over he tapped the side of his own head i know what did you do velona repeated the flying thunder that forest of spears she shuddered then winced plainly wishing she hadnt and none of our magic worked weve had to deal with renegades but this how the goddess must hate you i take my chances hasso said which shocked her well too bad it was too bad in too many ways but he couldnt do anything about any of them now he continued i tell you something else too you need to remember it all lenelli need to remember it go on she said im listening right now i dont have much choice simple easy four words grenye are people too in bucovinan it would have been one word people hasso said again strong enough to stand against lenelli isnt that a big part of what makes people velonas chin came up little blackhaired mindblind savages cutting through a couple of hundred years worth of lenello arrogance wouldnt be easy or quick hasso was about to remind her that king zgomots socalled savages had whipped the living snot out of her kingdom twice running before he could someone behind him said i didnt know she would be so beautiful he whirled there stood drepteaza and several paces behind her and looking scared rautat hasso felt almost as if shed caught him being unfaithful with velona he glanced at the goddess on earth she looked like hell haggard battered bruised and filthy her hair all matted with blood all the same the essence remained and drepteaza saw down to it velona was looking from one of them to the other too and she also knew what she saw who is this person she asked hasso and if the last word of the question held a certain mocking edge what could he do about it it was the word hed used himself i am drepteaza priestess of lavtrig in falticeni she spoke for herself in her own excellent lenello and she stepped forward and took hassos hand in hers yes and he squeezed hers velonas eyes flashed disgusting she said as a matter of fact no hasso told her this time drepteaza squeezed him but he had to speak to velona again you warn me not to love you how do you blame me if i love someone else velona stared at him so did drepteaza had he said anything to her about love he didnt think so his timing was less than ideal hed have to fix that later now now velona spoke to him as if he were an idiot and she doubtless thought he was as if spelling out what he should have known already she said i meant a lenello not a grenye too bad hasso said grenye are people too he underscored that by switching to bucovinan to ask drepteaza what do we do with her i dont know the priestess answered in the same language no velona didnt speak it hasso hadnt thought she would stoop to learning drepteaza went on we could do two things i suppose we could kill her or let her go not keep her prisoner the way you do uh did with me hasso asked if she were only velona i would say yes we could do that drepteaza said with the goddess in her she shook her head i dont know how much power she can pull through that connection i dont want to find out it could be worse than keeping all your gunpowder prisoner in one place hasso grunted and nodded hed always thought velona was so much female dynamite here was his own thought come back to him transmuted how much bad luck goes with killing her he wondered aloud i dont know the answer to that either drepteaza said even with an amulet that works im not sure i want to find out do you she would kill me in a heartbeat hassos eyes kept sliding to velona beatup as she was she still looked damn good to him drepteaza had to know it too he would likely end up paying for that later he sighed i havent got the heart to do it regardless of bad luck i told you you were a fool but then if you love me you already know that drepteaza turned to rautat who was hovering in the background go fetch lord zgomot this should be his choice yes priestess the underofficer seemed relieved to have an excuse to beat it what are you barking and mooing about velona asked hasso so much for her opinion of bucovinan whether to kill you or not he answered her nostrils flared it wasnt fear it was more the reaction a cat would have if it heard the mice were planning to bell it the curse of the goddess would fall on the guilty she warned we know drepteaza said that didnt worry the three guys chasing you when i first came to this world hasso used two lenello past tenses in one sentence he impressed himself if not velona she looked at him as if a donkey had just lifted its tail and left him lying in the roadway when you did i thought you would be a blessing for my folk not a curse he is a blessing for this world drepteaza said quietly not if he helps grenye velona had the courage and the blindness of her convictions we are not your beasts of burden drepteazas voice had an edge to it hasso could have told her she was wasting her breath odds were she already knew a thousandkilo bomb wouldnt change velonas mind well well lord zgomot said courteously in lenello i did not expect this velona eyed him with a certain caution if not respect hed caused the lenelli a lot of trouble over the years neither did i she said bitterly what do we do with her lord hasso asked also in lenello drepteaza filled in the alternatives in bucovinan if velona didnt like it too bad that was her attitude hasso didnt see how he could blame her zgomot seldom looked happy maybe he had right after his armys smashing victory contemplating what to do with velona gave him a good excuse for his chronic dyspepsia she hurts us if we keep her if we kill her or if we let her go he said which summed things up pretty well best to let her go i think at least she wont hurt us in the realm if we do that not right away anyhow king bottero will thank you velona said in unwontedly quiet tones no he wont zgomot replied hes dead dead bottero the full magnitude of the disaster velonas kingdom had suffered seemed to sink in for the first time goddess her lips shaped the word without a sound but she got no help from the goddess then was she too badly hurt to sustain such aid did all the amulets around her block it hasso had no idea i will give you one of the horses we captured the lord of bucovin told her you may ride away on it if you are wise you will not set foot in my lands again i doubt i am wise if that is wisdom she said but i thank you for the gift all the same by the way she spoke it was no less than her due hasso wondered if she could even stand let along ride but she was one tough cookie when the horse came the groom who brought it promptly took a powder do you want help getting up into the saddle hasso asked not from you she said coldly you beat me you beat my kingdom you beat my folk you have not stolen my pride she swayed but she mounted without help from hasso or from anyone else and he was convinced nothing but that enormous maybe monstrous pride kept her on the horse as she rode west at a slow walk whew hassos shoulders slumped as they might have had the bucovinans lost you loved her you loved that drepteaza asked yeah well you already knew i was stupid there are degrees to everything you must be right you usually are hasso bent down and kissed her right there on the battlefield you probably werent supposed to do things like that but when he came up for air he saw lord zgomot smiling at them zgomot pulled his face straight in a hurry but not quite fast enough drepteaza saw the lord of bucovin smiling too she sent him a severe look then turned up the voltage when she aimed it at hasso you are impossible she said jawohl he stiffened to attention and clicked his heels which nobody from this world did his arm shot out in a salute nobody from this world used at your service fair lady impossible drepteaza repeated but without the iron that had been in her voice before she turned to zgomot what are we going to do with him lord well as for me i aim to keep him as long as i possibly can zgomot answered what you do with him is up to you of course but he does not seem to want to go away in spite of ah everything in spite of velona he meant was he right as things worked out yes would he be right if velona wanted me back hasso wondered damned if i know never a dull moment with her no not even close but one day sure as hell shed detonate and blow you to bits drepteaza was quieter but safer definitely better for the long haul and he had something he needed to say straight to her not just let her hear in passing i do love you you know she nodded yes i do nice of you to tell me though as his ears heated she went on and if you loved her too i have to wonder about your taste maybe not lord zgomot threw the drowning hasso a line men dont judge women the same way women judge men a pretty face a nice shape a tight snatch i know drepteaza said and hassos ears got hotter yet she went on plenty for a goodtime girl but for love you ought to look for more there this time hasso spoke for himself well i did i found you yes who knows what you were looking for when you found me she said a pretty face a nice shape the other i dont know about but i wouldnt be surprised zgomot said yes bucovinans could be very blunt drepteaza squeaked hasso might have if she didnt beat him to the punch since she did he added and more impossible drepteaza repeated he nodded not without pride of his own she made a face at him and said if i can forgive you for being big and blond i must love you good hasso said and kissed her again he found zgomot smiling once more when he broke the clinch if bless you my children wasnt written all over the lord of bucovins canny face if it wasnt then maybe hasso was seeing sheer relief all across the field zgomots men were slitting the throats of lenelli or leading them off into captivity some would make useful laborers others would know things the bucovinans didnt and that hasso didnt either bucovin was still behind its neighbors most ways now zgomots realm had more of a chance to catch up and now the bucovinans knew a few things the lenelli didnt too i did that for better or worse i did hasso thought now hed seen from both sides what happened when technically superior enemies who thought themselves the lords of creation came at you it was great fun when the panzers rolled forward or the assault column of knights struck home being on the receiving end was a different story yeah just a little no wonder the russians fought back so hard no wonder they hated the german invaders so much hasso hadnt got it then even the red armys counterattacks hadnt made him understand hed only understood that there were way too many ivans if the other guy aimed to take your land and wipe you out or enslave you forever nothing like putting the shoe on the other foot it would have happened here it would have but it hadnt and he had a lot to do with that maybe velona was right after all when she said the goddess brought him here for a reason it just wasnt the reason she thought he kissed drepteaza one more time goodbye velona
