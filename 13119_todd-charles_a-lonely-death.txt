charles todd a lonely death northern france early june the sod had grown over the graves turning the torn earth a soft green and the rows of white crosses gleamed brightly in the morning sun except for the fact that a fallen soldier lay beneath each wooden marker it was pretty there under the blue bowl of the french sky peaceful finally after four tumultuous years of war even the birds had come back picking at the grass for seeds insects and worms the man watched them those birds and was reminded of a line from hamlet that somehow had caught a schoolboys imagination and then lingered in a corner of his adult mindthat a worm may feed on a king had these fed on lesser dead many had been hastily buried where they fell others in mass graves sorting the dead for proper burial had been gruesome at best many had never been identified walking down the rows now looking at names remembering burial details broken bodies bits of them endless lines of them he wondered if he was changed by them no on the whole he thought not the war had been a part of the fabric of his life and he had endured it survived it and was still steadfast in his purpose he stopped his gaze sweeping the crosses it was the living who concerned him now a few had escaped him but there were still eight left and he was ready were they not that the state of their souls troubled him overmuch he turned his back on the cemetery striding toward the paris taxi that had brought him out here and as he did the slanting june sun warmed his shoulders listening to the sound of his footfalls he realized that he hadnt bargained for the silence here he wondered if those lying beneath the crosses savored it after the noise of battle or was it unnerving there was a train to calais tonight another from dover to london but he was in no hurry a good dinner first if he could find one a bottle of wine and then a sound nights sleep as the taxi turned and drove back the way it had come he leaned his head against the cracked leather of the seat and closed his eyes london july chief inspector cummins walked into scotland yard at half past nine went directly to his office and set about finishing packing his books it was his last day and he wanted no fanfare an injury sustained in the line of duty had put an end to his career and not a day too soon he said to inspector ian rutledge who had stepped in to wish him well i should have left at the end of the war but i found one excuse after another to stay on this case pending that case passing through the courts and here i still am well past my time he looked up another stack of books in his hand no regrets i feel responsible rutledge began but cummins cut him short nonsense i knew what i was doing i hadnt reckoned on the toll the years had taken thats all i wasnt quite fast enough at fiftyfive one still believes one is thirty until he looks in his mirror as he shaves will you be content in scotland after the bustle of london my god yes and if im not my wife will tell me that i am cummins reached for the roll of tape to seal that box and then turned to fill another when do you intend to marry dont leave it too long ill be a grandfather next month rutledge laughed as he was meant to do youve left behind a splendid record well be living up to it for decades to come cummins set the books down on a corner of his cluttered desk and looked around the office the shelves were nearly empty the desk as well and the photographs had been removed from the walls he took a deep breath and said pensively yes well i enjoyed the hunt you see more than i should have done all the same there was one case i never solved i was a little superstitious about it if you want the truth i kept the folder on my desk for years telling myself id get to the bottom of it sooner or later i even dreamed about it sometimes when i was tired what bothered me most was not knowing whether the dead man was a sacrifice or a victim and if his murderer had ever killed again a sacrifice it was an odd choice of words for a man like cummins cummins glanced sheepishly at rutledge it was what struck me as soon as i saw the man that he was left there for a purpose a warning if you will or a sacrifice of some sort not religious i dont mean that kind of thing he broke off then shrugged as if to make light of what hed said it was the setting it made me fanciful i dare say when was this long before your time it was midsummers eve cummins turned away and walked to the window where sunlight had just broken through the morning clouds and was turning the wet pavements from a dull gray to bright pewter some fifteen people had come to stonehenge dressed as druids unbleached muslin handmade sandals staffs of peeled oak boughs mind you i doubt they knew much about ancient druidism but theyd come to watch the sun rise and chant nonsense and feel somethinggod knows what anyway they walked to the stones sang and marched drank a little homemade meadhoney laced with rum we were told laterand waited for sunrise cummins paused staring not at the view outside his window but back into a past he reluctantly remembered and rutledge thought hes not going to finish it it cuts too deep still he waited quietly ignoring the dull rumble of hamishs voice in the back of his mind finally cummins went on as if compelled they were misguided playing at something they didnt understand but harmless enough i suppose at length the sun rose one of the women told me later that it was magnificent her word she said the dark sky turned to opal and rose then purest gold as they watched the rim of the sun appeared on the eastern horizon she said that what followed was unbelievablea shaft of light came spilling across the dark earth and touched her face she said she could feel it just as the schoolmaster had told them he was the one who talked them into this silliness but even he was taken by surprise losing his train of thought cummins turned and said where was i oh yes this young womanher name was sarah harmonwas still staring at what she called the stone of sacrifice thats what the schoolmaster had told them it was called it stands along the eastern avenue between the main section of stonehenge and the horizon do you know it yes i do hmm she was trying to recapture a little of the emotion shed felt when the sun struck her face and then she noticed something odd about that stone it was light enough by then you see when she began screaming everyone turned toward her startled she pointed to the stone they could just make out something there and rushed down the avenue to find a man strapped to it he was dead even they could see that and when they held up their lanterns for a better view they realized hed been stabbed cummins cleared his throat he was strapped to the dark side not toward the light hadnt they seen anything anyone apparently not i questioned them for hours the body could have been out there before ever they arrived in the dark they wouldnt have noticed they didnt know the victim they swore they didnt not even this schoolmaster whod lured them out there it would have been a perfect cover for murder terrence nolan he was as frightened as the rest of them and in the end i believed them i expect the murderer whoever he was had counted on no one finding the victim for days as for the dead man he was youngthirty to thirtyfive at a guessand he was wearing only a scrap of cloth like a loincloththere was no clothing at all no marks on the body nothing through which we could identify him even the bit of cloth was a cheap cotton that could be bought anywhere it took us six weeks to discover his name who was he rutledge asked intrigued one harvey wheeler he came from orkney a neerdowell according to the authorities there his father had gone to kirkwall to run the post and harvey grew up rather wild and unruly a truant from school roaming the island at will and never sorry for his escapades his parents gave up trying to control him apparently and he went missing in after a brush with the police it was thought hed come south into scotland at any rate he reappeared in edinburgh in late and then left a step ahead of the police who were after him for attempting to defraud a woman hed met there that was the last anyone had heard of him until he was found dead on salisbury plain why anyone would wish to kill him is still a mystery it must have had to do with the missing two years of his life although it always struck me as odd that someone like harvey wheeler should end that way as murders go it didnt fit were you certain of the identification as certain as may be when edinburgh took an interest in the description wed passed around we sent along a photograph that was when they recommended we contact orkney they in turn felt it was very likely that our corpse was this young man his father was dead by that time and his mother too ill to be shown the photograph but the kirkwall police had no doubts and so he was buried in a churchyard on the outskirts of winchester no one saw any point in sending the body north that was the end of it his murderer was never found cummins paused looking toward the window as if it held the answer before bringing his gaze back to rutledge it was an odd inquiry from start to finish i never felt comfortable with it id have liked to go to kirkwall myself but the orkney islands are at the northern tip of scotland and the yard felt it was money wasted to send me there all the same id have liked to know more about harvey wheeler what brought him into england for one thing and where he might have lived on this side of the border the murder weapon never turned up we searched the area every inch of it we came to the conclusion that the murderer carried it off with him it could be anywherethrown from a bridge buried in a dustbin returned to wherever it had come from there would be no way to know would there that it had anything to do with a crime what was odd was the coroner found a tiny flake of flint in the wound the feeling was it was on his clothing and driven in by the force of the blow that led us to believe two facts that he was dressed when he was killed although his clothing was never found and that he must have come from a part of england where flint was readily available and that covered a good bit of ground was he killed there at stonehenge very likely not there was no sign of a struggle unless of course wheeler was drugged and carried there still the coroner found no evidence of his being either drugged or knocked unconscious prior to his death and there wasnt enough blood at the site cummins hesitated it was his face i think that disturbed me as much as the rest of it a handsome enough man fit and well made more a gentleman than wheeler appeared to be or perhaps that was his charm and why he nearly succeeded in defrauding that widow how many more women were there that we never heard of i can understand why wheelers murder has remained fresh in your mind that and the fact that it was the only case i failed to solve to my own satisfaction cummins made a wry gesture and smiled sheer arrogance of course i took pride in my record all the same the men used to call me cautious cummins but it was always my way to work out each detail until i could make a case out of the pieces you remind me of myself as a young inspector you know the smile widened i bequeath you this albatross of a case if you ever solve it let me know he went back to packing dont let bowles lay the blame for my going on you rutledge he warned because he will try he has it in for you he has from the day you returned to the yard after the war i dont know precisely why but hes been instrumental in blocking promotions and failing to give you proper credit where it was due hes mean and vindictive ive never liked him and im not about to pretend now warning taken rutledge said surprised that cummins would speak so bluntly i should finish this the chief inspector said glancing around the room two more boxes should do it i think im not one for prolonging the inevitable he put out his hand and rutledge took it in a firm grip i wish you well ian thank you sir i hope your retirement will be a happy one rutledge walked to the door and was on the point of opening it when cummins said inspector i would have no objection to hearing from you from time to time and then his attention returned to the half dozen books in his hands as rutledge strode down the passage toward his own office his footsteps loud on the bare boards he wondered if he would look back at the end of his career and remember a case the way cummins had lived with his aye but first ye must survive long enough to leave the force on your ain twa feet hamish said his voice seeming to follow rutledge the short distance to his own room hamish was his penance for what hed done in the war a voice that was relentless and unforgiving like the guilt that haunted him in life corporal hamish macleod had been the closest thing rutledge had had to a friend during the darkest hours of the somme offensive despite the vast difference in rank between them the young highlander would have made sergeant if hed survived the battle he was a natural leader the sort who cared for his men and understood the tactics of war but that had been his undoing refusing a direct order on a battlefield had led to a firing squad it wasnt cowardice it was an unwillingness to lead tired and dispirited men in another useless charge against a wellconcealed machine gun nest yet even knowing as well as hamish did what it would cost in lives knowing that it was impossible to dislodge the enemy rutledge had had no choice but to give the order to try one more time in an effort to clear out the nest before the main attack began along the entire line the few sacrificed for the sake of the many and then as an example to his men hed had no choice but to give the order to fire that had ended hamishs life military necessity but in human terms despicable to rutledges already battered mind after days of endless fighting that had killed thousands of good men for mere inches of ground and did nothing to bring the war nearer its inevitable end this one death had seemed insupportable a decision made at hq a decision that appeared sound and workable to officers far from the fighting officers who didnt have to look exhausted men in the face and ask them to climb over the top one more time and die to satisfy a strategy that was broken before it had even begun had resulted in a bloodbath that was incomprehensible hamish macleod had simply given that bloodbath a personal face dr fleming had explained it bestthough it was no comfort to rutledge to hear it you couldnt accept that one mans death and so you refused to let him die hes every young soldier you tried to keep alive and failed hes your expression of guilt for that failure and he will be in your head as long as that guilt lasts or until you die and take hamish macleod with you to the grave guilt or not hamishs voice sounded as clear as if it had come from a foot or so behind rutledges shoulder where hamish had so often stood and fought and explanations did nothing to ease the strain of knowing the voice was there that it would speak or not as it chose and there was nothing on gods earth to prevent it or keep others from hearing it even when rutledge knew they could not he could never be certain of anything except that hamish had never forgiven him just as he had never forgiven himselfeven though he had never been given any choice in the matter hamish had taken that away too and left rutledge to cope alone and yet never alone trying to shut out the soft scots words in his mind rutledge tried to settle to the papers on his desk and after a time he managed to concentrate on them he knew he would miss cummins there were already rumors that inspector mickelson would be promoted to fill his place eastfield sussex on the hastings road july eastfield was neither particularly charming nor particularly important historically or politically it had begun as a hamlet where the road out of hastings climbed the bluffs leveled out and turned eastward a large field at that point had served as grazing for tired oxen and horses either before their descent into the town below or after their ascent from it this common field had eventually been encircled by the huts of providers of servicesa tavern to feed the drovers a smithy to see to torn hooves and a brothel to ease a mans other needs the newbuilt abbey at battle had soon taken the hamlet in hand to save the souls of its inhabitants and to charge a small fee for the hitherto free grazing at the dissolution of the monasteries the tiny village had passed into the keeping of a crony of henry viiis hardly aware of the change in ownership by descendants of that crony had fallen on hard times and the village found itself forgotten though the field for grazing still served those going to and from hastings the fees were now collected by a selfappointed squire who was no more than a jumpedup yeoman who saw his chance to prosper and no one thought to formalize the new status of eastfield in any fashion it began to flourish in victorias reign selling its produce and wares to the hungry fishermen and residents of the little port where the valley broke through the ridge and swept down to the waters edge and as hastings grew so did eastfield by it boasted changes that brought in more revenuethe small firm that had built tackle fish boxes and other furnishings for the fishermen found that the newly acquired taste for sea bathing had brought hotels in its wake and hotels needed a better quality of furniture to serve those who expected fine accommodations the second stroke of good luck occurred when the pierce brothers decided to locate their brewery in three buildings at the far end of the hastings road an exiled frenchman set up a small latin school in the middle of the village and made a good living educating the sons and daughters of those who could now afford it the brewery the furniture making and the latin school gave the village an air of success the misses du toit thoroughly english daughters of the schools founder changed their name to tate on the death of their father and in passed charge of the school to a niece mrs farrellsmith a young widow by eastfield had doubled in population and in took great pride in furnishing a company of its sons to fight for king and country in the great war they had received a letter of commendation from the king himself and the brewery produced a beer it called the rose of picardy which unexpectedly became very popular among soldiers and then exsoldiers making the pierce brothers brewery under its arrow label famous throughout kent sussex and surrey content with their ordinary lives the villagers of eastfield saw no reason why their future shouldnt be as peaceful as their past and then on a friday night in july that illusion was shattered william jeffers had no inkling of his fate when he walked into the conqueror pub in a back street of eastfield the sign was swinging gently in the late evening breeze squeaking a little in its iron frame on one side of it a vast painted armada of norman ships was shown anchored in an english baythere was debate as to whether it was intended to portray hastings or pevenseyand on the other side a victorious william raised his painted sword high to celebrate his famous victory over king harold at senlac hill the haze of tobacco smoke was already thick as the barkeep hailed the newcomer with a smiling greeting jeffers rarely came to drink in the pub he was a farmer and had little time in the evenings and less money to waste in conviviality but it had become a regular thing each year for him to mark the anniversary of the wound that had ended his military career and nearly cost him his life jeffers settled himself at a corner table with his first pint and for the rest of the evening proceeded to drink as much as he could hold he left half an hour before closing making his way toward the church the light was fading and he sat on the low stone wall surrounding the churchyard until he had watched the sun set and the long shadows deepen into night he was not a praying man but he found himself saying a prayer for the dead most of the dead on his mind werent lying here in st marys they were in france but it would do at length he stood up and made his way to the outskirts of the village where abbey street met the hastings road he was only slightly tipsy he told himself he had to rise at half past four in the morning to milk the cows but this anniversary was more important than duty the hole in his chest was just a rough and ugly scar now but it sometimes ached as if it hadnt healed four years the flesh had surely forgot the pain and the terror and the weakness from loss of blood but the mind hadnt the mind never forgot and so he tried to drink himself into oblivion he never quite got there he tripped on a stone recovered his balance and walked on the farm was barely a mile away but tonight the road seemed twice as long overhead the stars were so bright he felt he could hear them his grandfather always said to him when he was a lad listen to the stars willie can you hear them just listen and he would listen over the ordinary night sounds of rats in the feed bins or a stoat hunting in the hedgerow a horse moving in its stall he could have sworn he heard them a stone rattled on the road behind him and he turned to see what was there nothing but his imagination at this hour of the night he had the road to himself his mind was clouded with the beer hed drunk his wife would have something to say about that he shook his head to clear it but it was no use he tripped again and swore a voice quietly called his name jeffers whirled to see who it was peering through the darkness but for the life of him he couldnt bring the pale face into focus do i know you he asked after a moment you did once sorry i dont remember never mind it doesnt matter jeffers nodded coming this way no good night he turned and plodded on leaving the man standing there he wanted his bed now the beer was making him sick something flashed briefly in the starlight seeming to fly over his head and then it had him by the throat and he was fighting for breath twisting and shifting furiously but the thing at his throat bit all the harder and in the end it was no use william jeffers was the first man to die t hree nights later jimmy roper was in his barn sitting up with a colicky cow dandelion had always been prone to the ailment with a temperament that was easily unsettled but she was his best milker and worth the trouble to keep her healthy her calves carried that trait and she had done much to improve the quality of the dairy herd he was tired it had been a long day and it would be longer still before he could seek his bed but he had learned patience after taking over the farm from his ailing father one waited for cattle and for crops and for time to shear one waited for sun and for rain and for a still day to harvest if hed had a choice he would have worked at the brewery but as an only son he had had to fill his fathers shoes he heard the squeak of the barn door and leaned around the edge of the stall to see who was there pa is that you i told you id come to your room as soon as i saw to things here there was no answer his father shouldnt have walked that far hed be out of breath shaking roper got to his feet feeling a tingle in one leg from crouching there by dandelion until his foot had gone to sleep under him picking up his lantern he walked down the aisle past the stalls where his three horses dozed undisturbed by their temporary neighbors restlessness and saw that the outer door was open several inchesbut there was no one inside the barn after all had his father had a fainting spell crossing quickly to the door he peered outside and saw that someone was standing a little distance away in the shadow of the cowshed not his father thenthis was someone taller straighter younger he could just make out the mans features but they meant nothing to him someone needing work then in the past six months he could have hired a dozen men like this walking the roads footsore and hopeful but the farm could barely keep his own family and that of one laborer and he had come to hate turning hope into hopelessness he put off the moment of decision looking for me roper asked then went on quickly sorry im attending a cow can it wait it can wait the man said go back to your cow roper nodded and left the door ajar out of courtesy dandelion was on her feet when he got back to her stall mouthing the hay he had put in the manger for her looking at him with what he swore was mischief in her dark eyes you just wanted company then did you he said scratching her between her horns too good for the yard thats what you are hed long suspected that it was trueshe had been sickly in her first year and kept in the stall where she was petted and made much of and even now preferred the barn all right you can stay here the night but im going to bed he stepped back studying her for a moment to be sure she was recovered one of the horses snorted moving uneasily in his stall and then roper was startled by a sound just behind him before he could turn something flashed before his eyes bright in the lanterns glow tightening around his throat before he could put up his hands to protect himself it cut into the skin with such force he could feel blood trickling down his neck dandelion jerked away moving to the back of the stall the whites of her eyes showing her fear but he was beyond worrying about her fighting for his life with the breath left in him strong as he was the man behind him had a fearsome strength and then roper was on his knees on the hardpacked earthen floor aware that he didnt have a chance in hell a last fleeting thought as he died was for the lantern and a dread that it had overturned in the struggle and jimmy roper became the second victim t he third to die was the son of the present owner of the pierce familys brewery it occupied three stone buildings that had once belonged to the abbey and had fallen into ruin but the abbot had built well and pierces grandfather had bought them renovated them and made his fortune from them the brewery stood on the inland side of eastfield where the road up from hastings turned toward battle and in the beginning the family had occupied quarters in the third building but expansion had put paid to that and prosperity had brought them a fine house on abbey street that was a generation ago and tyrell pierce anthonys father had become a man to reckon with in the community anthony himself had come home from the war with one leg but that hadnt prevented him from taking his place in the firm continuing his rise through the ranks from the driver of the dray to assistant to the brewmaster his father was a strong believer in an owners intimate knowledge of each position in the yard and in the brew house on this nightthe third since jimmy ropers deathanthony pierce had gone back to the brew house to look at one of the temperature gauges on the new kettle it had been playing up and must either be repaired or replaced on the morrow the foreman had tinkered with it earlier with no success and after dinner anthony had strolled down to have a go at it certain that it could be salvaged his father had spoken to a supplier in london who had informed him that it would require three days to find and ship the new gauge and that would mean that the current batch of mash would have to be dumped at a loss he had always liked the smell of the brew house almost a sour odor rich and thick on a warm night the door was never locked and lighting his lantern he walked in climbed to the first floor and went to the bench where the foreman had left his tools setting the lamp there he walked over to study the offending piece of equipment after working with it for some minutes he stepped back there was no hope of repairing it the foreman had been right if it went now they would just have to absorb the loss of this one kettle clean it out and wait for the new gauge to arrive before starting it up again twelve more hours thats all they needed and if luck was with them he shook his head and then put his tools back on the bench anthony pierce had served as an officer in the war and was accustomed to leading men he was popular enough with the brewery workers and when he heard the outer door on the ground floor open with its familiar scraping sound he called out im up here is that you fred its hopeless ill drive to london tomorrow myself and see if i can expedite replacing the damned thing but the man who appeared on the stairs his footfalls steady on the treads was a stranger not the brewmaster pierce frowned said this building is closed to outsiders is there something you wanted the man said not really i thought you might remember me thinking the man was looking for work pierce said is it help you need no im here for old times sake well im just closing up walk down with me he limped toward the man wondering for a moment if hed served with him but the face wasnt familiar at all and although he was dressed plainly his clothes were of good quality not money thenhe wasnt looking for work when pierce reached the wooden stairs the man moved aside youve got a new leg i see why dont you go first pierce was reluctant but he said only all right and started down one hand on the rail he could hear the footfalls of the man behind him almost pressing on his heels and he felt a sudden unease he told himself it was only because the cursed leg was new and he was still nervous about falling they had reached the ground floor and pierce crossed to the heavy door his hand already out to push it wide when he realized that there was something wrong he was on the point of turning to order the other man to precede him into the alley between the brew house and the storage sheds when he saw the wire flash in front of his eyes he put up a good fight for a man with one false leg but of course it was no use he was no match for his murderer the last thing he heard was a harsh whisper almost in his ear and then nothing when the first of the workmen arrived the next morning he was lying on the stone floor within a few feet of the door his body already cold rutledge found a letter waiting for him in his flat as he picked up the envelope from the floor he recognized the handwriting at once setting his hat on the table by the door he crossed to a window opening the envelope as he went and pulling out the single sheet inside he could feel the tension in his mind that was hamish and tried to ignore it as he spread the sheet wide there was no salutation im writing to say goodbye my decision has been made and by the time you read this there will be no turning back i have tried ian but the war changed me it changed my family it changed everything and finding my way again to what i knew before isnt possible i went to dr fleming as you suggested but he couldnt help me i think after so much time theres no real answer to be had but he is a good man and he did his best for me i want you to know that i have seen to financial matters my wife will be taken care of and i think she will be relieved not to have to deal with me the nightmares are worse and encroaching deafness from the guns is a frightful thing it isolates a person and i was already isolated my wife must shout at me to ask the simplest questions and even so i can barely hear her voice tenderness is impossible and she sleeps in another room now so that i wont keep her awake with my tossing and turning and the screams i dont remember in the morning but she does we hardly knew each other when we married in and we never had a chance to build that common ground that might have seen us through im tired ian i cant tell you how tired and this is the only way to peace i can see forgive me if you can pray for me if you will but know that i will be happier out of this misery and i have not decided that lightly fare thee well my friend i hope that you will see your way clear where i have not you didnt marry your jean after all and that may be your salvation i have watched someone i believed i loved more than life itself withdraw a little more each day until theres only hurt and confusion left it would break my heart if it werent already broken so goodbye and may god have mercy on both of us it was signed max rutledge stared at the letter in his hand and then slowly reread it it was dated two days ago too late far too late maxwell hume had been a captain of artillery whom rutledge had come to know well at the start of the war a career man he was an experienced and able officer liked by his troops and his superiors early in the war the two men had shared their first leave staying in a shell of a chateau unable to find transportation to paris or londonfive days where their friendship had been cemented with laughter and more than a little wine salvaged from the destroyed cellars the time had passed quickly both men still able to see in the other an odd reflection of himself as he was before the war and yet they had been as different as night and day max had possessed a mad sense of humorall artillerymen are mad just look at napoleon while rutledge had been blessed with a level head that kept both of them from breaking their necks in maxs impromptu dares amongst the chimney pots or on the halfmissing staircase or wherever else his wild fancy took them they had convinced an elderly woman from the nearest village to cook for them and do their washing closed their eyes to the minor pilfering that went with her and dug through the ruins of a oncefine library to pass their evenings reading it was the only time in all the war that rutledge had been able to put aside what he had seen and done and felt the certainty that the fighting would be over in the first year still blinded men even when they began to realize it wasnt true and then came the somme and madness on a level that was intolerable rutledge had always suspected that it was max humes guns that had fallen short and taken out his own salient the night that hamish macleod had gone before the hastily collected firing squad but he had never said anything about it when next they met hume like rutledge himself was a changed man by that time terse and fallible and near to breaking some things were better left unsaid and yet he thought in some fashion that max knew the truth and that it was the last straw in what had been a fine career setting the letter aside rutledge went to the cabinet beneath the other window and poured himself a drink he silently toasted hume and then went to his bedroom to pack rosemary would need him now and he had no choice but to go and do what he could aye hamish was there in his mind as he always was in times of upheaval or stress but will the lass want you there the viewpoint was unexpected rutledge heard himself saying aloud i was maxs friend its the least i can do aye all the same yell remind her of the war and shell no thank ye for that half an hour later having told the yard where to find him he had set out for gloucestershire and humes home just over the border it was late when he got there and he found lodging in the small hotel that stood on the main street of the town he had hoped to arrive in time to speak to rosemary that evening but the drive had taken longer than hed anticipated he had never been to chaswell it was a pretty little town and max had spoken of it often but after the war neither man was fit for casual visits although they had stayed in touch desultorily by letter the next morning he went to humes house it was set back from the road a low wall surrounding the front garden and two steps leading to the grassy walk up to the door before hed lifted the crepehung knocker the door opened and rosemary hume stood on the threshold staring up at him with haunted eyes rutledge said ive come to do what i can she flung herself into his arms and wept on his shoulder it was the only time he was to see her cry pulling away at last she wiped angrily at her tears before he could offer her his handkerchief in the background he could hear voices but she pulled the door closed behind her to shut them away and said he shot himself he went to the far side of the churchyard and shot himself where i wouldnt be the first to see him and when they came to tell me that he was dead i wanted to take up that revolver and shoot him again the fool the poor wretched damned fool he wrote to me but by the time the letter came it was too late he left only a brief message for me he told me he loved me too much to drag me down into his despair and he asked my forgiveness that was all rosemary told rutledge after what wed endured together what we had tried to salvage out of his despondency all he could leave me were a few dozen words i deserved more ian i deserved to know what he was planning and why i could have accepted it then hard as it would be because i was included but i was shut out she was a small slim woman with fair hair and very dark blue eyes there were heavy circles under them now with grim lines about her mouth rutledge who had broken such news to other people more often than he could count said rosemary its natural to be angry with max all the same i dont think he could have borne telling you that hed failed thats how he had seen it his failure and so it was a private matter because of that youve been a policeman too long ian she answered him coldly i was his wife for gods sake what does it say in the bible something about a man and a woman cleaving together and in the marriage vows forsaking all others i shall never forgive him until the day i die i shall never forgive him she swung the door open at that juncture and led him inside hamish reminded him ye didna believe me rutledge tried to ignore him as he walked into the room where friends and family had gathered there were twelve to fifteen people sitting and standing talking together quietly rosemary made the introductions although rutledge knew several of the former army officers her parents were there but maxs parents had died during the war leaving only a distant cousin who had been gassed at ypres he was sitting in a chair by the double windows that led to the gardens struggling to breathe and talk finally falling silent his face strained rutledge hadnt met reginald hume before this and as they shook hands he remembered max saying something about his cousin having been schooled in england although hed returned to scotland to live inherited the family pile on the isle of skye filled it with books and prefers them to people thats why he didnt come south for my wedding i shant be surprised if he misses my funeral as well it had been said in jest there were voices in the kitchen where food was being collected as friends and neighbors brought dishes along with their sympathy the day dragged on and at one point rutledge found himself speaking to the rector of st pauls chaswells church scotland yard are you mr gramling asked when rutledge nodded he went on i understand you are here in your capacity as a friend not as a policeman good then youll be pleased to hear that ive determined that captain hume died while his mind was overcome by his suffering wounds take many forms he said to rutledge with a perfectly straight face i see no reason why he may not be buried in holy ground im glad to hear it rutledge responded it was something that had been on his mind most of the afternoon there would of course be an inquest someone else had brought that up but he had hoped for rosemarys sake that it would be reasonably considerate of her feelings i hope that i shant be required to give evidence humes letter was still in his pocket he had no intention of reading it aloud at an inquest i see no reason to impose on your personal grief mr gramling agreed understanding rutledges unspoken message he regularly attended services with his wife even when he couldnt hear what was being said i could consider that a proof if we need it that he was sound of mind and spirit mr hume did not fail in his duty to the church and the church will not fail in its duty to him i consider that very enlightened of you he said and gramling smiled he was a short stout man with heavy shoulders just beginning to gray he had deepset dark eyes under thick eyebrows lending him a sinister look until he smiled i dont hold with judging my flock i see no reason to usurp gods right he paused then added max and i spoke from time to time often on a tablet of paper i kept in my desk i burned the sheets afterward i considered him a friend they stood there talking about the war and the past and then rosemary called to rutledge asking him to help reginald up the stairs to lie down for a while he was a pale shadow of his cousin thinner fairer his features less well defined because of his suffering each breath was a testament to his will to live if asked rutledge would have thought that reginald was the more likely of the two men to end his own life but there was a tenacity in his face that gave it its intense character he thanked rutledge as he sank back against his pillows i came for rosemarys sake he managed to say not for maxs he told me he would not expect to see me at his graveside rosemary will need your strength ive loved her as long as ive known her reginald said max was aware of that he knew i would have come for her sake if not his rest while you can rutledge said ill see that shes all right he left the room the sound of reginalds raucous breathing following him even after he had pulled the door closed behind him on the stairs he found rosemary sitting on one of the treads out of sight on the landing he thought she was crying but she was simply sitting there quietly staring into space she turned as she heard his footsteps and said is he all right hes resting its for the best she nodded he got a letter too did he he had said as much but rutledge hadnt asked him the contents everyone but me she stood up resolutely and walked down the stairs without looking back the funeral the next day was well attended although most of the people there had known rosemary hume most of her life and max hume only for the past eight years four of them interrupted by war rutledge was glad to see that she would have support after he had left the service was simple stressing the qualities of the man they were gathered to bury and then it was time to follow the wooden coffin to its final resting place rutledge watched it being lowered gently into the ground and as he took up a handful of earth to cast into the grave in his turn hamish said it willna be you lying here its no the answer but it had been in his mind and hamish knew it no not yet he silently answered as the earth spilled from his fingers to land softly on the coffin lid and then he was following rosemary and reginald hume back through the churchyard to where his motorcar was ready to carry them to the house a police constable stood by the bonnet and he nodded to rutledge as he came through the gates of the churchyard rosemary was settling reginald in his seat trying to save his energy for the meal already waiting at the house she looked up to say something to rutledge just as the constable stepped forward inspector rutledge yes im rutledge a message from scotland yard sir will you proceed with haste to sussex the village of eastfield just above hastings its a matter of some urgency rutledge glanced at rosemary hume ill see my friends home first he said the inquest was that afternoon rosemary had asked for it to wait until after the funeral he knew she expected him to be present she said tentatively ian ill put in a call to the yard this may not be as urgent as it appears she shook her head its better if you go surprised rutledge said but i thought and broke off i have my family now and my friends i dont need max any longer i dont need maxs friends he was on the point of arguing when he caught reginalds eye there was a warning there after a moment rutledge said yes i understand but you know how to find me if you should change your mind i wont she said with finality and when he had delivered his passengers at the hume house rosemary offered him her hand as he stood ready to help her out of the motorcar thank you for coming ian it was very kind of you maxwell loved you in his way i think because you understood better than the rest of us thank you for that as well and she turned to offer her support to reginald her back to rutledge reginalds face was expressionless but as he shook rutledges hand he said im glad you were here keep in touch will you i have a feeling about things sometimes id like to hear from you rosemary had gone ahead to open the house door and was out of earshot as reginald spoke the last words and then she was back taking his arm as she steadied him on the short walk to the house rutledge saw them inside and then turned to drive to the police station but the constablehis name was beckerhad no more information than the brief message he had passed on to rutledge the hotel sent someone to find me he explained it was a sergeant gibson on the line i asked him if there was any further information to pass on to you but he said that someone in eastfield would explain all you needed to know i was to tell you privately that the chief superintendent had not been at the yard when the message from eastfield had come through and it was too urgent to await his return rutledge said my things are at the hotel ill be packed and ready to leave in ten minutes ive taken the liberty sir to ask samantha if she will put up sandwiches for you its a long way there will be a bottle of cider as well rutledge thanked him and in fewer than the ten minutes he was on his way the sandwiches in a small basket beside him it was necessary to drive past the hume house on his way out of town the windows were open to the summer heat and through them he could see silhouettes of people moving back and forth inside he felt a surge of something he couldnt have said what and then returned his attention to the road and all the long way hamish kept him company his voice just audible above the rushing of the wind but it was not a pleasant companionship as often happened in times when rutledges mind was occupied the voice found the chinks in rutledges armor and probed them with a sure knowledge of what rutledge least wished to hear it dwelt for a time on maxs life and then the manner of his death moving on to the woman who swore she hated her husband but who had wept bereft on rutledges shoulder before she could get herself in hand at one point as he drove eastward rutledge had stopped along a road in hampshire to offer a lift to a woman trudging back to her village with her marketing in a basket he had needed to hear a human voice someone who knew nothing of him or his past she was grateful for his kindness and he set her down in front of her cottage without telling her how she had briefly lightened the darkness in his mind it was as if humes death by his own hand had foreshadowed his own rutledge spent the night on the road driving into eastfield in the early hours of the next morning a watery sun had risen and he could see that there had been a heavy rain in the overnight hours puddles stood about in spots and a pair of farmyard geese were noisily bathing in what appeared to be an old horse trough filled now with rainwater he found the police station halfway down the high street tucked into a small building between an ironmongers and a milliners shop he left his motorcar on the street and went inside the constable sitting at the desk across from the door looked up his attention sharp and questioning as if dreading to hear what this new arrival had to say the look of a man hamish was noting who expected more trouble than he was prepared to deal with rutledge gave his name and added scotland yard the constables expression changed to intense relief constable walker sir i wasnt expecting you sir not for another hour or more he responded coming around the desk to meet him the yard told us you were in gloucestershire and hoped to leave shortly you made good time a wry grin spread across the mans plain face im more than happy to turn this inquiry over to you in all my experience ive seen nothing like it nor has inspector norman in hastings ill be bound a shocking business we never expected one murder sir much less three sergeant gibson told us he was sending one of the yards most experienced men whatever i can do to help you can count on me sir rutledge was surprised to hear gibson singing his praises he found himself wondering why they had always had a guarded relationship drawn together more because of their mutual dislike of chief superintendent bowles than because of any friendship between them thank you constable rutledge began hoping to cut short walkers effusive welcome but the man was already moving past him to the door if youll just follow me sir i promised to take you to mr pierce as soon as you arrived hell tell you what you need to know his son was the third victim i dont think its wise to speak to mr pierce until youve given me a picture of whats happened why im here rutledge followed him as far as his motorcar and stopped there facing walker the man turned to him uncertain they didnt tell you anything at the yard but i explained to the sergeant i spoke with that may well be but as you say i was in gloucestershire and i was ordered to come here directly walker stared at him i thought he recovered quickly and said it was mr pierce who asked the chief constable if he would bring in the yard the hastings police wanted to take over the inquiry you see and mr pierce felt they wouldnt address his sons death as he would have wanted it done it was coldblooded murder sir it has turned eastfield on its ear three men in nine days all three of them garroted and no sign of the murder weapon william jeffers then jimmy roper three nights later and three nights after that anthony pierce a farmer a dairyman the son of a brewer one walking home minding his own business and left dead in the road one sitting with a sick cow in his own barn and one at the brewery looking to repair a faulty gauge he went on earnestly who is killing these men how does he know where to find them alone and why these three worst of all who is next me my neighbors son the man who hires out for harvesting crops rutledge had listened closely a frown on his face three dead and no apparent connection among them except that they were alone at the time of their murder and killed with the same type of weapon well theres the war sir walker admitted and theyre of an age having fought in france together please if you will sir speak to mr pierce rutledge agreed although with reluctance it was not usual to have a civilian passing on the details of an inquiry but he could see from walkers anxious face that pierce was a man to be reckoned with in eastfield and until he knew just exactly what he was dealing with it might be as well to see what pierce had to say leaving the motorcar where it was they walked to drum street and the tall mellowed brick facade of the brewery buildings a large gold arrow had been affixed to the front of the main building under the name pierce brothers and rutledge realized that this was the beer famous in three counties for its rose of picardy label they found the senior pierce in his office an oldfashioned but elegantly styled room in oak with paintings of the founders on the walls and a large marble hearth that held pride of place to one side of the partners desk by the windows a tall man stood up as rutledge and walker were admitted by an elderly clerk scanning rutledges face he came forward and said to walker good morning constable this is inspector rutledge mr pierce from scotland yard as you requested pierce held out his hand and rutledge shook it saying im told you would prefer to tell me whats been happening here in eastfield he had kept his voice neutral neither accepting pierces authority to do any such thing nor disputing it pierce led them to the chairs set out before the empty hearth i apologize for that mr rutledge constable walker here has handled events so far with his usual skill and i am grateful for that its just that i have a very personal stake in finding this madman two days ago my own son was his third victim that doesnt make anthony any more important than the other two victims but william jefferss wife and jimmy ropers father arent able to speak for themselves at this time their loss was as devastating as mine but they are alone in their grief and i have a staff at my disposal to see me through the next few weeks i understand rutledge answered without committing himself pierce was a man used to giving orders and it was possible that mrs jeffers and jimmy ropers father were grateful that he was taking charge clearing his throat as if to dispose of all emotion before he began pierce said the first constable walker here knew of jefferss death was sometime after midnight when a goods van driven by one sammy black came through eastfield on his way to hastings hed had a problem with his van and was several hours late as it was soon after passing the church he saw something in the middle of the road to use his own words he said that it looked like a bundle of old rags lost off a dustmans cart but he slowed because there wasnt sufficient room to pass on either side and he was wary about driving straight over the rags hed served as a driver in the war and was accustomed to watching out for unexploded ordnance in his path by that time his headlamps had reached the bundle and he could see it more clearly he realized it was someone lying in the road and he stopped to see if it was a drunkard or if the man had been struck by another vehicle he got out of his van and walked over to what lay in the road getting in the way of his own headlamps and having to step aside now he had no doubt the man was dead his eyes were open and there was a great deal of blood around his neck at first black believed that the man had cut his own throat unwilling to leave him there black finally decided to protect his body by leaving the van in the road and he walked back into eastfield to find the police station he turned to constable walker have i got that right constable yes sir its exactly what hed written in the statement he signed then perhaps youd like to take up the account at this point i sometimes sleep on a cot in the room above the station mr rutledge my wife being dead for some years i heard mr black banging on the door as i had only just gone to bed i opened the window and called out to him asking what the problem might be he told me hed just discovered a dead man in the road and would i come at once i asked if he was certain the man was dead he told me hed seen enough dead men in the war and he was certain all the same i took the time to summon dr gooding and he brought his trap with him in the event we needed it we reached the body and mr black drew his van to one side both dr gooding and i had brought a lamp with us and we could see fairly clearly mr black was right the man was dead and as the light reached his face both of us recognized him at the same time dr gooding leaned closer and then straightened up looking up at me hes been garroted he said shock in his voice and i bent over to see for myself it was the only explanationthe wire had cut deep and yet it was clear from jefferss face that he had been strangled mr black at this point had gone back to his van and i believe he was sick by some bushes along the verge knowing that this was a heavily traveled route from about four oclock in the morning until first light we cast about to see if we could find anything of importance dr gooding in particular wanted to find the ligature that had been used but there was nothing to find just the body in the middle of the road the doctor did say that mr jeffers had been dead for some time an hour or more at a guess his account had been vivid where pierces had been factual without personal feelings coloring it but rutledge could see that walker whose quiet village must seldom produce violence of any kind had been appalled by the brutality of jefferss death dr gooding had brought a blanket and we wrapped the body in it and i helped to set it in the cart i drove back with mr black and the doctor took the body to his surgery mr black gave me his statement and i found that mrs sanders across from the hotel had spent a restless night and had seen the goods van come down the street just when mr black had said it came and it was very likely that his statement of finding the body when he did was true i went back to the scene later and still found nothing that would tell me who or why murder had been committed walker paused rutledge thought that if the constable had been in his own office he would have got to his feet and begun to pace there was more on his mind than the death and rutledge waited patiently to hear the rest of the story dr gooding came to see me at half past ten walker went on reluctantly he asked me to come with him to the surgery i found that hed removed the victims clothing and it was obvious that he had been garroted although neither dr gooding nor i had ever seen a case before but that was not what he wanted me to see he had probed the mouth of the victim and found that inside it almost dried to his tongue was an identity disc rutledge turned to stare at him from the war he asked in surprise yes sir from the war i recognized it but it wasnt mr jefferss disc if he ever had one there was another name on it one i didnt know he reached into his pocket and brought out an oiled cloth setting it on the low table in front of the hearth before unwrapping it inside were three flat fiberboard discs in the war both the army and soldiers themselves had come up with ways to identify the dead and wounded but none of them had been successful enough to see widespread use some men had simply sewn their names in their uniforms a timehonored method a variety of discs had been introduced as well some on string some on thin rope these particular discs had an interesting history stamped from thin layers of compressed wood fibers they came in pairs and were worn around the neck on a thin length of rope if a man was killed one of the discs was placed in his mouth for the burial detail to use in marking his grave the other of the pair was collected and sent back with his kit eventually ending up with his family but the war had been over for nearly two years why would such a disc be placed in the mouth of a murder victim hamish who had been quiet for a time said quite clearly revenge rutledge suppressed a start for it seemed that the soft scots voice had echoed around the room obvious to everyone but when neither of the other men responded to it he said after a moment there are three discs here one was also found in the mouth of jimmy roper who was sitting with a cow suffering from colic when he was killed there was no one else in the barn no sign of forced entry and no one in the houseropers father or the maid who kept house and cooked for the two menhad heard anything pierce answered as for my son he was discovered on the ground floor of the brewery just by the stairs dr gooding examined his mouth there and then and found the third one rutledge could hear the undercurrent of rage in the quiet voice rutledge looked closely at the names on the discs one belonged to a corporal in a yorkshire regiment the second to a welsh sapper and the third to a private from cheshire turning to pierce he asked was your son an officer yes of course officers werent issued identity discs he pointed out i wonder if these men survived the war he shook his head three different regiments what could these three soldiers have had in common with three men living quietly here in sussex thats precisely why i asked the yard to step in we need to learn what we can about these soldiers if were to answer the question im sure you must know someone in the war office who can find out for us where they served and if their paths ever crossed rutledge did know such a man but had no intention of applying to him for answers but sergeant gibson would have his own way of looking into the matter tell me about their war recordsjefferss ropers and your sons were they ever involved in any trouble during the fighting discipline misconduct brawling nothing of the kind pierce retorted curtly they all served honorably my son was an officer in the same regiment as a company of men who enlisted together from eastfield but he never commanded them as it happened they were in two different sectors of the front their paths never crossed i cant say never with complete certainty but i dont recall my son ever speaking of encountering them hed have said something in his letters asking me to relay the message to their families he was that sort thoughtful and responsible there are others of that same company still alive we could ask them two of the company died in france walker added one missing and the rest came home it was not the case generally men who served together as a rule died together the eastfield company had been very lucky rutledge turned back to the discs what were they intended to represent hamish had called it revenge but how why pierce was saying i know regiments were split upsometimes sent to bring up the strength of other regiments but it seems unlikely that theres a military connection still these discs say otherwise rutledge turned to walker was there any trouble among these local men have you heard any rumors of hard feelings of unsettled issues i have not walker said with confidence my own nephew served with them and then his attention was focused on rutledge my god are you suggesting that the killing hasnt stopped should i be warning my nephew and the others that they could be in danger as well if these murders have to do with the eastfield company then why did my son have to die pierce demanded almost cutting across the constables question i cant tell you the reason for that not yet rutledge answered him and then to walker he added it will do no harm to have a word with these men but if the killer is a local man why the identity discs belonging to these outsiders he paused weighing the discs in his hand then asked was the eastfield companyor your son sirever on burial detail pierce shook his head im sure anthony wasnt i dont believe so walker answered but ill ask are you saying thats where these other discs came from its possible but we wont know until we find out who these men are and why their names are connected with three murders here id rather believe it was one of them than one of ours walker said pierce took a deep breath i dont care who it is i want it stopped i want this murderer brought to justice then why did you refuse to let the hastings police step in rutledge asked ah that ive had words with inspector norman in the past oh not over anything of this nature not murder but my younger son danny was troublesome in his day and inspector norman wanted him clapped up in prison until hed learned the errors of his ways i refused to let norman bully me or my son and in the end danny won a medal for bravery presented by the king himself at buckingham palace the same arrogance as norman called it when danny was fourteen saved the lives of dozens of men danny charged a machine gun nest singlehandedly and held the german detail at gunpoint until he could be relieved they were taken prisoner if he hadnt stopped them from firing god knows how many of our men would have been killed where is daniel now rutledge asked pierce flushed i dont know he came back from the war spent two weeks with us here in eastfield and then disappeared one night we havent heard from him since i blame inspector norman there not two days after danny came home norman was on my doorstep wanting to know if danny had been part of a group of men who had robbed the owners of a small hotel and their dinner guests he claimed that the description of one of them could have fit danny quite easily did your son have an alibi the flush deepened he didnt need one his word was good enough but once a troublemaker always a troublemaker in the eyes of the police walker stirred uneasily as if hed been caught in the crossfire between pierce and the hastings police dropping the subject of daniel pierce at least for the moment rutledge asked who had found the bodies of the other two victims walker said it was the housekeeper at the roper farm she thought jimmy might still be sitting with dandelion instead she found his body just outside the stall and young mr pierce was discovered by the foreman coming in to work the next morning he thought the killer might still be in the brew house and sent his men to search armed with whatever weapons they could lay hands to while he stayed with the body and one of the other men came for me but there was no sign of an intruder no sir whoever he was he hadnt broken in who survives jeffers and roper mrs jeffers his wife and ropers fatherhes old frail rutledge turned to pierce your son anthony wasnt married the young woman he would have married at the end of the war died in the spanish flu epidemic in of late anthony had been friends with mrs farrellsmith shes head mistress at the misses tate school its a wellestablished institution here in eastfield a good many people from outside the villagebattle hastings as far away as ryesend their children here anthony attended it himself until he was twelve the tate sisters were still alive then have you seen any strangers here in eastfield has anyone asked for jeffers roper or pierce i spoke to any number of peoplein the hotel the shops the pubs the restaurants walker said shaking his head and there hasnt been anyone here that we didnt know and thats whats most worrisome id always thought of a garrote as being a french weapon but the only frenchman in eastfield is in the churchyard and hes been there these thirty years and more t en minutes later when rutledge and constable walker had taken their leave of pierce rutledge waited until they were well out of earshot of the brewery and any of its workers before asking what do you think became of daniel pierce daniel walker repeated and then looked away i dont know he justleft in the middle of the night if you want to know what i think he didnt wish to be a burden on his father the pierces have enjoyed a fine reputation all through the years and anthony was a good man best suited to being the heir in temperament not one to carouse and come home drunk in the middle of the night singing bawdy songs as he walked down the street pierce seems to believe his son changed yes well a father would wouldnt he but ive made inquiries from time to timeon my own sir not officially and theres been no word of him in the towns where i know the police so perhaps he has why should you search for him rutledge asked his curiosity aroused walker flushed the question catching him unprepared after a moment he said ive always had a soft spot for young daniel sir i was not my fathers favorite child either and yet rutledge had gathered the impression that daniel was his fathers favorite something in the timbre of his voice had betrayed the elder pierce still the question that has to be asked is was he jealous enough of his brother that in the end he would kill two innocent men in order to cover his tracks when he killed anthony pierce walker sighed i dont think daniel was the sort to want to be tied to a brewery for the rest of his life i wouldnt have been surprised if hed made a career of the army i remember how excited he was just before the war about shackletons journey to the antarctic and how pleased he was that the king encouraged shackleton to go on with his plans even after war was declared changing the subject without appearing to he pointed toward an ornate fourstory building ahead thats the fishermans arms hotel a little grand to call it that but its comfortable theyre keeping a room for you i took the liberty of asking them after i was told the yard was sending someone to eastfield rutledge thanked him ill go and register but as soon as possible i want to see the statements youve collected thus far and then speak to dr gooding its best to catch the doctor after his midday meal one oclock will that suit you yes ill come for you then rutledge answered as they reached his motorcar walker turned the crank for him and he drove on to the hotel there was space to park in the small yard to the far side and the woman at the desk smiled when he gave his name weve been expecting you mr rutledge she said as if he were a valued guest and not a policeman in their midst he rather thought that pierces name had been used to secure a better choice of room hamish said as rutledge climbed the stairs to the second floor ye ken mr pierce doesna want the hastings police called in for fear theyll look for his ither son yes thats very likely rutledge agreed scotland yard has no prejudices the room faced the street rather than the yard and it was large airy and comfortable rutledge set his valise in the wardrobe and went to the pitcher of cool water on the stand between the windows where he washed his hands as he was reaching for a towel to dry them he heard a commotion in the street and looked out to see what was happening constable walker was speaking to an elderly man crippled by arthritis leaning heavily on his cane he looked tired distraught and very angry the man was repeating at the top of his lungs i want him buried do you hear decently next to his mother where he belongs i dont care what the police have to say about it i want my son walker tried to placate him but there was nothing he could say that would satisfy the old man hamish said ropers father very likely rutledge thought walker had described him as old and frail pushing away from the window rutledge hurried out of the room and down the stairs when he reached the street walker was still patiently trying to persuade the elder roper to return to his farm rutledge walked up to them introduced himself to roper and with a nod to walker said im here from scotland yard in fact i only arrived this morning if you will give me three days ill see that your sons body is released to you but i want to be sure that i know everything i need to know in order to find his murderer will you give me those three days roper turned to him his eyes wet with tears three days you say three days rutledge acknowledged thats reasonable roper turned to go finally satisfied rutledge stopped him did your son have any enemies do you know someone who was jealous of him who held a grudge of some sort or had quarreled with him recently roper laughed a harsh and breathless sound jimmy had his hands full at the farm and caring for me there was no time for jealousy or grudges or quarrels whoever it was should have killed meim past being useful but no it was jimmy was taken even the germans had spared him except for his damaged leg i told him when he came home that he could give them the damned leg it was his hands and his brain the farm needed he was unhappy then moping about for weeks i had to tell him didnt i that the leg was of no account and to his credit he came to his senses and set about making the farm pay again and wed have done it too if he hadnt been killed wed have seen our way clear in another year turned a profit even thats gone with jimmy and ive put a fathers curse on whoever killed him i hope he suffers as ive suffered and knows the fires of hell before ever he gets there he gripped his cane fiercely as if he could see himself bringing it down on the head of his sons murderer but the outburst had exacted its toll and ropers face was drawn with the effort it had required how did you get here rutledge asked taking note of that i walked no one would come and tell me what was happening walker said his eyes meeting rutledges over the stooped mans head its no little distance to the farm rutledge said my motorcar is just there in the hotel yard drive him home ill do that sir thank you walker touched ropers arm this way if you please sir it was easy to see that roper was torn between maintaining his dignity and allowing himself to be driven after a moment his aching bones made the decision for him id take that as a favor he answered and let walker lead him to where rutledge had left his motorcar rutledge watched him go it was easier for a policeman to consider the victim as another case until he met the family and friends of the deceased and began to learn to see the dead through their eyes it was always a turning point and now he had met first pierce and then roper it had also served to emphasize the difference in status between the first two victimsfarmers bothand anthony pierce the son of a man of position and wealth whats more one was married two were not what did those three have in common the war but two had served together and one had not was it the fact that all three had survived but according to walker so had a number of others including his nephew what linked these three men hamish said yon identity discs in their mouths r utledge had eaten his meal and was finishing his tea when walker came to take him to meet dr gooding the doctors surgery was within walking distance a rambling house that had been divided into two halves one for his practice and the other for his living quarters three women were just leaving the surgery as the two men opened the gate and started up the flagstoned walk leading between borders in which flowers were blooming profusely they noticed the man with constable walker straightaway and rutledge could all but hear the speculation racing through their minds he could also imagine their conversation as soon as they were out of earshot walker said the tallest of those women was married to one of the eastfield company that marched off together to fight the kaiser mrs watson her husband was killed in the third week of the fighting after they reached the front he opened the surgery door for rutledge and added the rest led charmed lives for nearly five months before george hopkins bought it roper had a bad leg machine gun he could hardly walk when he came home but youd not have known it now barely a limp pierce lost his to gangrene from a foot wound he wasnt fitted with a new limb until last year it took that long for the stump to heal jeffers was shot in the chest but lived the surgery door led into a cramped waiting room empty now dr gooding was coming out of his office and looked up as the two men entered good afternoon constable he said to walker i was just going through to my luncheon were running late today he was a man of slender build with a receding hairline and a strong jaw this is inspector rutledge sir from scotland yard hed like to speak to you about the dead men gooding cast a glance at the clock sitting on the mantelpiece but said yes of course he took them into his office and gestured to the chairs opposite his desk sitting down again he reached for a sheaf of papers set to one side of the blotter passing them to rutledge these are my reports on the bodies constable walker has copies rutledge glanced through them all three men were garroted and all three had the army discs in their mouths yes thats correct to tell you the truth id never seen a case of garroting before but of course i had no difficulty in recognizing at once what had been done when i examined jeffers my guess is that something like piano wire must have been used it was strong strong enough to cut through the flesh of the throat in each case causing bleeding i should think a man wielded it jeffers was inebriated but he would not have been easy to kill and the same goes for roper despite his leg a woman couldnt have held on to the garrote given the struggles of the three men it was well after dark when they were attacked and each was in a place where his death wasnt likely to be witnessed jeffers along the road on the outskirts of eastfield roper in his barn and of course pierce in the main brewery were they stalked do you think gooding shook his head they werent prepared that wire came over their heads and there was an end to it if they had believed they were in any danger they might have got a hand up in time to try to defend themselves it wouldnt have changed the outcome they might have lost a finger or at least their hands would have been noticeably damaged and this wasnt the case it was a very concise report but then the doctors luncheon was waiting rutledge said do you know of any particular connection among the victims or any trouble they may have had with anyone else in the village id say roper and jeffers knew each other better than either of them knew anthony pierce as boys all three of them attended our village grammar school together but when the pierce brothers were sent away to public school my guess is that they very likely lost touch as for trouble walker here can answer that better than i could if youre asking if they came here yes from time to time but never anything more than childhood ailments and the occasional scrapes and bruises from climbing trees or a rough game of football after the war was there any sort of hard feelings amongst the survivors of their company something that happened in france perhaps and not finished there if there was they never came to me to patch them up he hesitated danieldaniel pierce that ismay have been the sole exception to that two days before he disappeared i saw him in the street and there was a bruise on his left cheek he didnt mention it and neither did i it didnt appear to be anything serious ive heard he was something of a troublemaker when he was young it wasnt precisely what pierce had told rutledge but he was interested in hearing goodings point of view a troublemaker thats a little harsh who told you that gooding asked frowning you dont suspect he has had anything to do with these murders how well did he know roper and jeffers probably no better than anthony did i always had a feeling that his escapades were nothing more than an attempt to impress his brother and the others the youngest trying to prove his mettle what sort of escapades rutledge pressed he could sense that walker was uncomfortable now but he ignored him he probably thought it was quite a lark the things he got up to one summer three or four boys dressed in sheets and moved about the churchyard one moonless night they gave the sextons wife and two young people courting in the church porch one hell of a fright on guy fawkes night they made their own bonfirethe old mill on the edge of town it was a shambles anyway no one lived there they torched it still it could have caused a general conflagration if the wind had blown the sparks about there were demands that the ringleaders spend a night in jail cooler heads prevailed and they were marched home under escort these hardly seem to be boyish pranks to me walker said i was here then they werent intending to do harm on the other hand the summer before the mill incident there was a near drowning the father of the boy in the witchs chair was asked if he wished to press charges but his son wouldnt hear of it he told me theyd drawn lots to see who would play the witch theyd been reading about the reformation in school and the pond wasnt deep enough to drown the boy but they hadnt accounted for his being tied to a chair and took fright when his head went under does this boy still live here in eastfield oh no sir walker answered he hasnt for these past fifteen years his father was a bookkeeper at the furniture makers and as i remember he found another position in staffordshire closer to his late wifes family which brought him full circle to daniel did daniel serve with the rest of the eastfield company like his brother he qualified as an officer and he chose to join the sappers remembering what walker had told him about daniels taste for adventure that made perfect sense to rutledge it had been dangerous work tunneling under german lines to lay charges the miners were often buried alive when the powder went off prematurely or the tunnel supports failed or they were killed going back inside to find out why the tunnel hadnt blown on schedule anything else you can tell me about the three men rutledge asked jeffers was very drunk he wasnt an habitual drinker mind you it was just his habit to mark the anniversary of his war wound by going to the pub and taking on as much beer as he could hold he told me once how close hed come to dying and he couldnt quite put the fear of that behind him then all three of the dead men had been wounded in france yes ive received copies of their medical records nothing suspicious there if thats what youre asking me i suspect the anniversary was not as important to the killer as the opportunity to catch jeffers alone on a dark road rutledge turned to walker did you ask at the pub was there a stranger there that night or anyone who showed undue interest in jeffers only the regulars as it happened and everyone knew it was jefferss night to remember they generally left him to it dr gooding pointedly glanced at the clock again and rutledge thanked him for his time he left walker at the police station after picking up copies of the statements the constable had taken prior to his arrival and went back to the hotel to read them as he walked into reception the man behind the desk said mr rutledge you have a visitor sir surprised rutledge asked who it was but the clerk said only hes waiting in the room beyond the stairs rutledge thanked him and went on to the door of the room used sometimes as a parlor for hotel guests or as a dining room for small private groups the man standing there looking out a side window toward a small garden turned as he heard rutledge come in he was tall and thin with a long face and brown hair flecked with gray inspector rutledge he asked his eyes scanning rutledge with intent interest im inspector norman from hastings they shook hands and then rutledge got to the point ive been sent here in your place i hope you have no objections not really although im not happy to have a murderer loose so close to hastings i hope your appearance on the scene doesnt drive him to greener pastures rutledge smiled indeed know anything about eastfield that would be useful to an outsider coming in only that its never been a problem the usual village troublesa fight now and again petty theft neighbors upset over real or imagined trespass domestic quarrels where someone is hurt a lorry accident or two over the years theyre mostly peaceful and walker is a good man he keeps his patch quiet still all three men were in the war and i wouldnt be surprised if thats your connection there was an entire company from eastfield but anthony pierce wasnt one of them no id heard he asked not to be given charge of men he knew very wise of him in my opinion harder to keep order and discipline if you grew up with your men or sometimes easier rutledge commented theres that as well norman answered still it doesnt mean that this trouble didnt stem from the war i expect anthony pierce kept an eye out for the eastfield men if there was something to hide hed have known it or someone thought he did otherwise why put an ordinary soldiers identity disc in an officers mouth which was a very good point norman prepared to take his leave just keep this bottled up in eastfield he said and if theres anything i can do let me know with a nod he walked past rutledge and was gone rutledge found himself thinking that norman had wasted no time in coming here to look over the competition he hadnt been in eastfield more than a few hours it occurred to him to wonder who had alerted inspector norman to his arrival hamish said unexpectedly someone who doesna like yon mr pierces intervention r utledge spent the next hour reading through the statements hed been given and they were all consistent with what hed learned during the morning apparently no one had left the pub within half an hour of the time jeffers walked out of it to his death and no one in the roper household had heard anything that would have indicated that someone had been prowling around the barn the night roper was killed the old dog on the floor by the bedside of the dead mans father had slept as soundly as his master his hearing diminished by age going deaf as a post the woman who cleaned and cooked for the two men had told walker both of them but she herself had heard nothing as for the foreman who had discovered anthony pierces body the next morning he had written that hed found the outer door shut and hadnt seen pierce until he had come in and turned toward the stairs mr anthony had gone there to see to a broken gauge because i found my tools had been moved when finally i went up the stairs to have a look at it again myself which indicated rutledge thought that pierce had been killed on his way out of the brewery rather than on his way in no one had been lying in wait for him but it was likely that someone had followed him there and finding the door unlocked stepped inside he went out after finishing the statements and walked first to the place on the hastings road where the van driver had come upon the body of william jeffers there was nothing to be seen here but rutledge had no trouble finding the spot from the description given by the driver standing there on the quiet stretch of road rutledge looked around there was a farmhouse some hundred yards away but walkervery thorough in his thinkinghad interviewed the family living there unfortunately their bedroom windows were on the far side of the farmhouse and they had not seen or heard anything except for tending to a child with a fever who had cried at half past three in the morning they had slept soundly there were shrubs along the side of the road that marched toward the farmhouse lane and pastures on the far side the jeffers house was beyond these tall spare and jutting from the fields like a sore tooth a perfect place for an ambush hamish remarked as rutledge scanned the surrounding landscape next he went to the roper farm walking down the lane past the house and to the barn where the murder had taken place there was no one about although clothes hung on the line drying in the warm afternoon sun and so rutledge went inside the barn there were bloodstains on the floor where jimmy roper had died but any footprints that might have been there at the time of the murder had long since been lost as first the maid and then the elder roper had walked round the body and then the constable himself followed by the doctor not to mention whoever had led away the cow that had been in the now empty stall his next stop was the brewery but before going there rutledge paused at the hotel to ask where the nearest telephone was to be found he was told there was only one telephone in eastfield and that was in the office of tyrell pierce making his way there again rutledge stopped briefly at the door that led into the twostory building where the great wooden kettles were housed and opened it the stairs were not ten feet from the door leading upward into the richly scented heart of the building someone had conscientiously swabbed up anthony pierces blood but the location was marked by the very clean spot on the floorboards where abrasives had been necessary to reach deep into the stained wood standing outside again rutledge considered the three murder scenes all they had in common was their solitude at the time of the killings but someone had followed each man to his death and that meant someone had been in eastfield on each occasionwhether he had been noticed by anyone or not hamish said aye but he canna materialize out of thin air where does he keep himsel when hes no prowling about in the dark it would lead someone to believe that the killer lived in eastfield rutledge left the thought there and walked briskly toward the door leading to the brewerys office it was a busy room bright and cluttered with paperwork with some half dozen clerks dealing with orders for arrow beers or placing orders for everything from hops to bottle labels and there was no privacy at all the senior clerk a man named starret led him to the telephone on his desk then stepped away to let rutledge use it he put through a call to london and after a time was connected to the yard it was another five minutes before sergeant gibson was found yes sir he answered warily id like to find out what became of the following men after the war and id like to know if there was anything particular in their records that might have an impact on the murders here in sussex did their paths cross that of the eastfield company or of any individual in that company he had written the three names their ranks and regiments in his notebook taken from the discs that dr gooding had retrieved during his examinations gibson repeated them and then said it will be a day or two shall i ring you at this number when ive learned anything rutledge told gibson how to reach him and then was on the point of hanging up when gibson said theres been a complaint to the chief constable in regard to the yard taking over this case indeed rutledge asked in surprise a mrs farrellsmith sir he remembered the name she was the woman anthony pierce had been seeing recently but why would she complain to the chief constable he asked gibson that careful to phrase his question in a fashion that half a dozen listening ears couldnt interpret and gossip about i cant say sir except that she appears to feel it was unnecessarily complicating matters rutledge thanked him and hung up he thanked the clerk as well and went out the way hed come in there was a private staircase to pierces office as well as a door leading into it from the clerks room and for a moment rutledge debated speaking to pierce he changed his mind and went out into the street constable walker was surprised when rutledge walked into the police station and asked directions to mrs farrellsmiths house i didnt interview her he began in apology but rutledge cut him short she might know something that anthony pierce didnt tell his father its a long shot but worth exploring shall i go with you sir walker asked half rising from his chair no i dont want this to appear to be an official visit merely a matter of being thorough i see walker said but rutledge thought he didnt the misses tate latin school was at the head of spencer street two houses had been connected by an addition that closed the gap between them apparently by someone who knew what he was about because the results were pleasing rather than haphazard a central door had been let into the addition but walker had said that mrs farrellsmith had chosen to live in the smaller house to one side of the school and that she could usually be found there at this hour of the day he went up the pair of steps leading to the walk and the door and was let in by a young girl in a school uniform her hair hanging down her back and held away from her face by a blue ribbon she was quite pretty and meticulously polite asking him to wait in the hall while she inquired if mrs farrellsmith would receive him she disappeared through a door to the left of the staircase and returned with a smile asking him to come in he had wondered if mrs farrellsmith would speak to him given her complaint to the chief constable the girl announced him then went away closing the door softly behind her the room had been turned into a private office with bookshelves and chairs set in front of a lovely old desk of wellpolished walnut at the moment it was cluttered with papers and folders some of them held in place by a large chipped glass paperweight as if she had been recording marks or sorting files before the start of a new term the woman behind it rose as he came in she was tall for a woman and far prettier than she allowed herself to be her hair pulled back into a bun at the nape of her neck was fair and determined to wave in spite of attempts to keep it straight and tidy her eyes were a very dark blue and her nose was straight above firm lips he put her age at thirty inspector rutledge she said in acknowledgment of his presence then waited for him to speak ive come to ask you a few questions about anthony pierce he said and she seemed to find that surprising because her eyebrows flew up in spite of her selfcontrol please be seated she replied and when he had taken one of the two chairs before the desk she said what sort of questions i expect there were things he wouldnt have discussed with his father but i was told hed grown fond of you and i thought perhaps he might have said something to you that could help the police find his killer i dont think anthony confided in me anything he couldnt have told his father after a pause when he didnt speak she went on as if unwilling to allow the silence to go on too long are you saying he had secrets thats what ive come to ask you believe that he knew where to find his brother if he did he never told me rutledge was surprised in his turn daniel yes daniel his father is too stubborn to try but i expect hed like to know where his other son is i take it you dont care for daniel not particularly hes the sort of person who leaves responsibility to others i believe in responsibility and selfdiscipline i try to make certain that my students understand that these are virtues to cultivate they will lead happier lives if they do it was an interesting perspective on duty hamish interjected aye but is it the reason shes so set against yon brother rutledge said only how long have you been in charge of the school since before the war she answered without giving a date and then she added reluctantly it was after my husband died that i came here you must have been very young to take over a school it would have been a grave undertaking at any age she lifted her chin as if in denial i didnt have any choice and i have made every effort to live up to what my family established i dont think ive given them any reason to regret their decision to entrust this school to my keeping he changed the subject did your husband know daniel pierce it had been a general question looking for an explanation for her dislike of the younger pierce but much to his surprise it had struck home i dont see that thats any of your business she replied curtly which tells me that he did was it before you married him or after he was an older boy at the school where both anthony and daniel were sent then you didnt know them no crisp and unconditional rutledge considered her for a moment she had married a man with a hyphenated name as a schoolboy would he have despised the upstartbut welltodopierce brothers trade and old money often clashed or perhaps there had been very little old money and the widowed mrs farrellsmith was now headmistress at a small school in a sussex village where there was almost nothing that could be termed society it would explain why she was willing to accept anthony pierces attentions trade or not there was a comfortable life in store for the brewery heirs wife again he changed the direction of the conversation did anthony pierce have any enemies from the war most particularly why the war years she asked her mind nearly as quick as his to spot anomaly did something happen there that might have had to do with his death in his minds eye he could see again the identity discs found in the mouths of the dead men we have some reason to believe it could have a connection yes if there was anything untoward that happened in france anthony never confided in me i dont believe he would have if you want the truth he knew i didnt care for unpleasantness she must have realized how selfish that sounded and added in spite of herself we had a number of students over those four years who marched away to war and never came back theres a list of their names on a board in the school parlor for all to see and remember anthony knew how much this had saddened me he thought her selfcontrol remarkable for a woman who had just lost a man she cared for for that matter her eyes showed no signs of crying herself to sleep even though it was only two days ago that pierces body had been discovered and as if she had read his thought tears welled in her eyes if theres nothing more inspector i find this a very painful subject hamish said shes afraid yon brother killed him it would explain her very first question to him not about anthonys death but in regard to daniels whereabouts but he left it there if anything occurs to you mrs farrellsmith will you speak to constable walker hell see that the message reaches me yes of course her voice was husky you can find your own way out i think he thanked her and rose to leave the image he took away from the interview that stayed with him as he walked back to the hotel was of her face as he glanced back at her just before closing the door desolation was writ large there but for herself he thought not for the dead t he long day was drawing to a close when rutledge went back to the police station intending to return the sheaf of statements walker was standing by a window looking out at the last shafts of light that touched the rooftops on the opposite side of the street and he turned to greet rutledge as the man from london stepped through the door any progress he asked not much thats helpful tomorrow id like to speak to some of the other men from eastfields contingent can you arrange it thats easily done walker said but his mind was clearly on something else what is it rutledge asked suddenly alert whats happened thats just it nothing has happened so far but tonights the third night after pierce was murdered im wondering if that will change once darkness falls i see your point the problem is our friend out there has the advantage he has a better knowledge of where and when to strike because hes obviously laid his plans well otherwise you and inspector norman would have caught him without my help all you can expect to do is get in his way and force him to alter those plans that means patrolling not the village itself but back gardens barnyards the brewery precincts the lanes anywhere a man might be outside alone meanwhile id ask everyone to stay in after dark i dont know if hell alter his plans or just wait until weve passed by walker said clearly still worried it depends doesnt it on whats driving the man yes i grant you that garroting is a very physical way to kill more so even than a knife whoever it is may not be able to stop now that hes started unless he only intended to kill those three men no one else theres that walker answered considering the matter although for the life of me i cant see how theyre connected it may only be in the murderers mind rutledge said walker turned to him in surprise i hadnt considered that its possible that whoever it is uses a garrote because the face of the victim isnt important rutledge said but that would indicate random killings i n the morning inspector norman in hastings sent a man to eastfield with the message he was held up first by the heavy rain and then having to wait for walker constable petty standing in the window of the police station finally saw his fellow constable coming down the street walker just returning from another round of the village in an effort to reassure himself that indeed nothing had happened in the night came through the doorway nodded and began to strip off his rain gear a cup of tea petty much as i could use one i dont think theres time the man replied and he said what hed been told to say refusing to answer any of walkers questions walker growling in frustration pulled on his gear again and set out for the hotel when he began his rounds the night before he had had no way of knowing that rutledge awake at two and again at three oclock had also gone quietly out of the hotel and with only hamish for company had also walked through the darkness pausing now and again to listen to the night sounds around him it was amazing he thought as he moved through the silent streets that a habitation with so little history to scar it could seem so ominous in the broken moonlight if there had been rape and pillage and fire and sword here at some time in the distant past it had not left its mark except perhaps during those hours between midnight and dawn hamish observed where there are people theres death and it was true hopelessness starvation plague disease among the animals all of these brought death as surely as armies as his footsteps echoed on the hardpacked surface of the road then vanished in the soft earth of the churchyard rutledge had wondered if he were being watched he had no feeling on that score but he considered what he would do in a murderers shoes would he choose one of the taller buildings along the main street with a wide sweep of views in either direction the church tower tall enough to allow an overview of the village and the surrounding farms or the shadows of a dense stand of lilac hed noticed where the road curved just beyond the brewery buildings on its way out of eastfield how had the murderer found his victims if he hadnt followed them or watched them walk by themselves in a direction in which he could expect to find his killing ground hamish said into the silence ye ken how donald macrae found the snipers rutledge did remember they had been plagued for nearly a week by a wellhidden sniper and no one had caught the muzzle flash because he chose a time when the british line was too busy private macrae had been detailed to watch for it and instead he had scavenged old hay from the horse lines and a few ragged planks from a repaired section of trench wall that night he had piled the bits and pieces just outside the trench it sat there for two days the germans across no mans land at first amusing themselves by firing into the debris testing their skills and then they ignored it on the third night macrae had poked the tip of a rifle under the edge of the hay barely visible and early the next morning he had jiggled a helmet on a bayonet just behind the planking for all the world like a man sighting down the barrel of his weapon macrae had set two spotters to watch as the german sniper took his shot at what he believed to be his opposite number giving himself away in the process it had been too tempting and it had been his last they had caught two other snipers with the same trick over the span of six months or so it could well be the case here that someone waited under cover until his quarry had walked into his sights but that meant he could wait for his opportunity coldly precisely unemotionally in no hurry to complete whatever task hed set himself satisfied at last that there was no one else abroad rutledge had returned to his room slept lightly and when the clock in the church tower struck the next hour he had arisen and done it all over again just as he reached the hotel the clouds that had been gathering for the past hour or more consolidated over southern sussex and kent and a steady rain began to fall walker had just come through the door of the hotel and was crossing the lobby intent on climbing the stairs in search of rutledges room when his quarry walked out of the dining room after an early breakfast the constable passed on the message from norman keeping his voice low so that it wouldnt carry to the man at reception watching them with interest rutledge was very still for a moment then he said damn the fox had outwitted the hounds while rutledge had been scouring eastfield the killer had moved on im afraid sir that inspector norman isnt the least bit pleased walker said in some satisfaction but im not denying im pleased it wasnt someone from my patch collect petty and bring the motorcar around will you ill be five minutes it was not a long drive suddenly the road came to a cleft in the cliffs and then wended down the hillside scattered buildings and cottages gave way to a tumble of houses perched above the shoreline to the left were rows of tall black wooden net shopsdrying shedsand the fishing fleet already drawn up on the strand the rain beat against the motorcar as they reached the bottom of the cleft and they tasted salt on their lips to the right the town itself opened up streets winding into a maze of other streets and beyond the increasingly popular waterfront empty now of holidaymakers waves were coming in as gray as the sky and their froth looked dingy as they crashed into the shale of the strand hastings had once been a tiny fishing village at the mouth of a valley that had spilled down from the cliffs to the narrow strand below with time the village had grown east toward the headland but it never really flourished as a port even in william of normandys day although later it had been one of the english cinque ports with a castle that overlooked the sea and protected the mouth of the valley sea bathing had finally made the coast prosperous and hastings had then expanded westward toward st leonards the old town with its sand fishing boats the tall tarred structures where the nets were dried and a crowded street of houses and shops reclaimed from the sea were left as an anachronism as the town built anew for the carriage trade with prospects circles and promenades taking pride of place this had waned with the war although sea bathing was picking up again rutledge drove directly to the police station following walkers directions only to be told that inspector norman was still out on the headland above the fishing fleet they went back the way they had come and as they reached the strand through the rain they could just see the top of the cliff where it jutted out into the water silhouetted against the gray sky were a dozen or so men tiny figures at this distance moving about near the edge just above where part of the cliff face had broken away in the past and tumbled down into the sea watching them rutledge realized that there was a climber making his way back up to them struggling against the pull of the wind as he worked ropes that were invisible from this angle i dont envy that poor bastard walker was saying watching him it would have been a dangerous business even in good weather what possessed him even to try such a thing rutledge was silent as he made his way to the funicular that ran up the cliff face just beyond the black net shops for a wonder it was working the two men waited impatiently for the next car to take them to the top rutledge could already see a policeman moving toward the upper station as if coming to meet them it was a quick run to the top and then they were stepping out onto the wet grass facing the full force of the wind the policeman a constable said to rutledge inspector this way please sir he turned to lead the way toward the rounded knob of the headland where most of the policemen and several civilians were still busy even in the downpour rutledge could see that there was something on the ground where they were standing although most of their attention was riveted on the climber still inching his way up the cliff face rutledge realized that what had appeared to be two bodies actually were two men stretched out on the wet grass anchoring the climbers ropes their heads hanging over the precipice two more men held their ankles to keep them from being dragged over rutledge could see that the grass was bruised and slippery as hell and the wind in this unprotected spot was whipping in off the sea rushing upward to buffet the knot of figures he pulled off his hat to keep it from blowing away and felt the rain driven against his face the men didnt turn as rutledge came to join the group he saw that walker stopped a little to one side trying to speak to the constable who had come to the funicular to fetch them he had to shout in the mans ear to be heard everyone looked thoroughly miserable but they were intent on the drama unfolding at their very feet rutledge heard a shout of pain as the wind slammed the climber into the wall he was trying to ascend and one of the men on the ropes cried are you all right ben if he answered rutledge couldnt hear him others aware now that someone else had come out here looked up to stare briefly at rutledge but norman waited without turning as more and more rope was hauled up and still the climber hadnt crested the top looking out to sea rutledge was hardpressed to tell where the horizon ended and the water began and he could see heavier clouds forming a line that darkened the sea and sky as it headed his way he knew without being told that the men here were racing that line all at once the men stretched out on the ground scrambled back and the teams heaved on the ropes with all the strength they could muster then like a jackinthebox a mans head and shoulders popped up followed by his torso and legs and he made it to the bruised grass at the edge the climber flopped down where he was flat out exhausted his hair was dripping rainwater his clothes wet through someone came forward and draped a tarpaulin over him but he was sweating from exertion and asked them to pull it away again only then did inspector norman turn as if hed known rutledge was there all along his hair was also plastered to his skull his face red and raw from the rain and the wind he shouted to rutledge pointing down the cliff face one of yours rutledge made his way to the brink gripping the shoulder of one of the men who had been pulling in the climber to keep himself from being blown over below crumpled on the rocks that were being lashed by the sea was a body the climber had been down there attaching a sling of sorts to it with ropes he brought back to the top tied to his belt it had been one hell of a climb down there and even worse conditions trying to work with the body on such a narrow ledge barely big enough for one man and then the climb back had been even more hazardous norman somewhere behind rutledge called look out and he turned to see four men pulling hard on ropes he stepped back from the edge and watched as the menhe learned later that they were from the lifeboat station belowbegan to haul the dead man to the top what makes you think hes one of mine rutledge shouted norman grinned at him his long thin face seeming to split in two but there was no humor in it when the climber got down there he said the mans throat had been cut took him forever to get those ropes down and attached properly we didnt want to drag the body against the rocky face the sling should offer a little protection but i have a feeling his throat wasnt cut i have a feeling hes been garroted thats when i sent for you why rutledge demanded feeling a surge of anger at the mans gloating why should it be one of ours if the killer has moved on thats a hastings man lying down there call it instinct norman told him and then turned back to watch the men straining against the dead weight on their ropes and these he drew a pair of field glasses from his pocket we had to know if he was dead or alive i can tell you the doctor didnt relish going down after him you could almost see him praying it was a corpse he gestured to a middleaged balding man with a growing paunch standing to one side waiting someone crawled to the end of the cliff and then called over his shoulder easy lads easy the men on the ropes slacked off caught their breath and when the signal was given this time they brought the body up to the top of the cliff and then with a last effort pulled it over the edge onto the grassy slope for an instant it appeared to be on the point of sliding into the abyss again teetering there until it was finally pulled to safety rutledge heard norman swear two other men ran forward caught the rope handles on the sling and gently urged it back to higher ground while the lines were kept taut when all was secure the rescuers squatted where they were heads down almost overwhelmed with exhaustion rutledge and norman reached the body in three long strides kneeling in the rain to slip the sling back and examine the man the doctor hurried forward to join them hes dead he said after a cursory examination as we thought ill tell you more when i can examine him further this isnt the place for it constable walker had come up behind them hands on his knees as he leaned forward to see over rutledges shoulder rain had soaked rutledges dark hair and rainwater was nearly blinding him as it ran down his face he wiped it with his hands then considered the body the victim lay on his stomach his clothing dripping water it was clear to everyone who could see the back of his neck that hed been garroted as inspector norman had suspected the deep line of the wound was black in the gloomy light of the stormy day the rocks had also taken their toll his trousers muddy and ripped a tear in his shirt signs on the exposed skin of his hands of scrapes and cuts still it was evident to rutledge that he hadnt used them to protect himself when the wire had come around his throat with a glance at rutledge norman reached out and turned the body over and behind him walkers sharp intake of breath was audible norman looked up know him walker said yes sirits theo hartle he and his father work in the furnituremaking firm in eastfield are you sure his face is rather battered theres no doubt in my mind walker told him ive seen him every day of his life near enough well then inspector norman said he is in fact one of yours and on my patch the doctor conducting a swift inventory of visible injuries said no other wounds apparent just those consistent with his fall and with the attempt to bring him back from the ledge and it was damned lucky he struck that ledge or hed have been taken out to sea and wed never have found him it wasnt a matter of luck inspector norman told him if you know these cliffs this was the only place along the rim where it was sure that he would be stopped before he went into the sea hamish spoke startling rutledge aye and did yon murderer ken the ledge was there rutledge looked down at the dead face hartle appeared to be in his middle twenties like the other three victims fair taller than most and of heavy build which had made the task of bringing him up from the rocks even harder the doctor was turning away norman gestured to his men all right get him to the doctors surgery he went over to thank the men of the life boat service for their help giving them a handful of coins as he spoke get yourselves something to warm you ill have a statement later when youre off duty norman had brought a motorcar to the top of the headland and as they walked through the rain toward it he said it was sheer chance that he was spotted the fishing boats coming in reported seeing something on the ledge a leaper they thought and when we came up to look i had a bad feeling about it we got the lifeboat men up here and began rescue operations but the ledge wasnt wide enough for more than one man to climb down to it the way the sea was crashing over those rocks its a wonder they werent both swept away they had reached the motorcar and norman used his hands to wipe the rain from his face before getting in rutledge hesitated his thoughts as always racing to hamish and then pushing them aside he joined walker in the rear seat norman said as they crested a slight rise to reach the road and his tires fought for a grip a damnable day for this i told you i didnt want your murders spilling over into hastings rutledge had pulled out his handkerchief cold and damp despite his trench coat he could feel the heaviness of the cloth weighing across his shoulders and water inside his shoes the question is what brought hartle here they wound their way down to the town and headed toward the police station norman was saying grimly thats your lookout isnt it but i dont like this business not one whit the interior of the motorcar smelled of wet wool unpleasant and heavy in the dampness as they pulled up in front of the police station norman turned to ask where did you leave your own vehicle by the net shops at the foot of the funicular ill send one of my men back to fetch it come inside they got out and went into the station it seemed dreadfully cold without the sun to warm it and norman spoke to the sergeant at the desk asking him to see that they were brought tea from the small canteen it was a far larger station than the one in eastfield and normans office was down a short passage to the left from the cells to the right they could hear a man singing in a monotone at the top of his lungs hes half mad norman said in explanation as he shut his door against the sound we bring him in from time to time for his own sake his sister cant control him he took the chair behind the desk thought better of it wet as he was and searched in one of the drawers for a sheaf of paper here use these he said passing them across the desk or youll stick to the wood god i dont know when ive been this wet opening a cupboard door he found a towel and began to dry his face and hair all right walker tell us what you know about this man hartle he was in the war with the others a likeable man never any trouble before or after the war he went to work at kenton chairs carving scrollwork for chair backs and desk fronts his father always claimed he had a natural talent norman looked across the desk at rutledge factory is a misnomer the furnituremaking concern turns out desks chairs tables bookcases and bedsteads using a variety of machines and then finishing them by hand theres a market in these new hotels springing up along the south coast for quality furnishings that are durable enough to take the rough handling of holidaymakers it employs a dozen men i should think he looked at walker who nodded fifteen at the most but theyre all skilled men and for the most part their fathers worked there before them a man name of kenton owns it and kenton chairs have been well known for decades even though theyve expanded their line theres a cottage industry as well caning the seats mr kentons grandfather began the business in a shed on his property walker added the hartles have worked there for three generations at a guess so what brought our man to hastings inspector norman wanted to know if hes employed at kentons ive no idea rutledge answered him id like a copy of the doctors report as soon as may be we all know the cause of death you could see the mans throat but was he killed out there on the headland or taken there after he was dead what do you think with this rain any blood or signs of a struggle have been washed away hours ago the only hope is to backtrack him if he was here in hastings for some purpose why didnt he return to eastfield the same dayor evening as may be what was he doing here late at night and where was he staying ill have my men ask questions in the lodging houses and the pubs the door opened and a constable entered in his hands a painted wooden tray that had seen better days the edges were worn and the garland of roses that decorated the center was chipped and scratched but the china teapot cups jug of milk and bowl of sugar resting on it were spotlessly clean and probably a decade newer norman stood up took it from the man and proceeded to pour three cups it was blessedly hot and there was a silence as they drank a little rutledge could feel the warmth spreading through him and was grateful setting his empty cup aside he said well exchange what information weve found ah but is this my inquiry nowor yours norman asked smiling rutledge was in no mood to argue jurisdictions the chief constable handed the inquiry over to the yard i believe he would agree that hartles death falls into the same case ive been pursuing since i arrived in sussex if i have any say in the matter the inquest will be held here rutledge said he died here it will be held here but you said yourself hes one of ours norman didnt answer finishing his tea he said well see about that in due course for the moment leave me to my work and ill not interfere with yours well see if we can trace his movements in hastings if you learn anything in eastfield that will help with thatwhy he was here in the first placeill thank you to make life easier for us ill speak to his employer rutledge rose my motorcar should have been brought in by now thank you for the tea ill be in touch walker hastily swallowed the contents of his cup and rose to follow rutledge from normans office norman let them go without saying anything more and rutledge was glad to see that his motorcar was in truth waiting in front of the police station he and walker stepped out in the rain and walker said back to eastfield rutledge answered id like to go back to that headland walkers groan was almost audible rutledge turned to him you neednt get out there rutledge crisscrossed the headland looking for clues it was nearly hopeless given the conditions but his eyes were good and he knew that there was only this one chance to find anything at all hamish said against the wail of the wind give it up he was right the search turned up nothing more than a halfpenny which could have been lying in the grass for months if not years the bearded face of edward vii stared back at rutledge as he turned it over retracing his steps to the motorcar he got in and said to walker do you know the doctor who was out here this morning not well hes dr thompson his surgery is somewhere in hill street then lets find it rutledge drove back the way he had come and after some trouble they finally saw the small shingle that hung by the doctors door the doctors nurse a tall spare woman with a sweet face answered their knock and showed them into the surgery a body lay on a long table covered now with a sheet clothing and other belongings had been set aside in a shallow bin to finish dripping dr thompson was just washing his hands and he turned to greet them recognizing them he said you were on the headland with inspector norman did he send you i was just about to ask him to step around rutledge identified himself and constable walker ive been sent by london to take over the inquiry hartle isnt the first victim of this killer the others were in eastfield ah yes i remember something being said about jurisdiction ill tell you what ive learned and confer with inspector norman later he added after a moment as a courtesy what do you know so far that my initial conclusions were correct theres the throat of course not manual strangulation but the use of a garrote abrasions from the fall over the cliffs edge but these occurred shortly after death not before he wasnt alive when he hit the rocky ledge below how long hed been dead i cant tell you at the moment but i would make an educated guess of sometime before midnight perhaps as early as ten or eleven oclock the cold rain hampers any more definitive conclusion have a look he pointed to the sheet where hartle lay and rutledge walked over to lift it he could see the wound very clearly now and the cuts and scrapes dr thompson had mentioned any thoughts on what sort of garrote it is wire most likely to cut that deep more efficient than a silk cord or even knotted rope he pointed to a long jagged wound in the dead mans abdomen it had healed but the scar was still prominent bayonet id say a miracle he survived the infection that must have followed never mind the damage done by the blade itself as you can see hes a big man he would have taken some killing i daresay your murderer has a few bruises to show for it lifting one of hartles hands he pointed to the fingers initially i thought this was damage from the fall or the recovery but im of the opinion he tried to pull whatever it was away from his throat see the broken nails and theres some indication of dried blood under the others id put his age at about twentyeight from the lines around his mouth he must have been in some pain from his wound and large as he is strong as he no doubt was he isnt as filled out as he should be walker spoke for the first time twentyeight his last birthday he was about to ask a question but rutledge forestalled him did you find anything else of interest he asked dr thompson said i was just coming to that nothing to do with the cause of death or the state of the body you understand inside the mans mouth was an identity disc from the war you know i didnt quitei was told this victim was theo hartlei believe it was you constable who identified him from eastfield but the disc would say that this was a man named french from herefordshire i dont quite understand why the disc was therethe war has been over for two years after allor why there is some question about the name of the victim he passed the disc to rutledge it was clear that he was curious and wanted an answer to his question it was also apparent that the police hadnt made such details public and dr gooding had examined the other three victims not dr thompson rutledge said looking at the name on the disc please treat what im about to tell you as confidential only a handful of people know that this appears to be theshall i call it the signatureor the hallmark of this murderer identity discs from another man and another regiment left in the corpses mouth if walker tells us that this man is theo hartle i believe him why the disc of one corporal french should be there we havent yet determined which is why we arent making this information public dr thompson stared at him your murderer must be a little mad to do such a thing we dont know rutledge answered whether hes mad or clever or just vengeful not yet thompson shook his head at a guess theres something buried so deep in himwhoever he isthat he uses unnecessary force to kill with the garrote the wound in hartles throat is obscenely deep the sea washed away most of the blood but it must have been a ghastly sight to begin with and its personal satisfaction hes after your murderer not simply the mans death he could accomplish that far more easily a fascinating point rutledge looked at thompson reassessing this portly backwater doctor who had such insight into a killers mind thompson who must have guessed what rutledge was thinking smiled grimly i was in the war myself i know what men are capable of doing to each other i have no illusions on that score i also discovered that some of them enjoyed it that may be what youre facing here someone who misses the thrill of stalking and killing someone who has discovered he cant live without it blood lust inspector isnt something only the lower animals experience i t was nearly one oclock rutledge and walker went in search of lunch and found themselves in a small corner shop that catered to workingmen it was situated on a street where buildings backed up to the shelving land the lower portion of the room was mainly a counter filled with various cooked meats cheeses and an array of sandwiches on the upper level reached by a half dozen steps were bare tables and chairs set out in front of a bar that dispensed tea coffee and cider as well as beer and ale they ordered from the smiling young woman who came up to their table and presented a handwritten menu listing what was available she was just bringing their sandwiches and glasses of cider when the sun came out the streets and rooftops began to steam as the air warmed and the neighboring houses gleamed wetly giving them a justwashed look the young woman glanced over her shoulder and said there and about time too turning back to the two men and noting that one was a policeman with raindarkened shoulders she added were you there on the headland when they brought that poor soul in just caught in the downpour rutledge answered for both of them its brave they were going out to the edge of the headland that way and in such a storm bits crumble and its easy to lose ones footing and go over every summer someone ventures too near the edge and goes over never fails youd think theyd mind the signs that are put up each year but they never do and some of them let their children romp and play up there as if it were the back garden and safe as houses last may it was a little boy flying a kite who fell i hope this wasnt a child its a crime the way some parents havent the sense they were born with even the smugglers knew better and she moved on to another table walker said there are smugglers caves all about hastings it was a lucrative enterprise when french goods were banned and theres some who say that it goes on still when nobody is looking he bit off the end of his sandwich and added around it do you think dr thompson was right about our murderer liking the feeling of killing its one other solution it may even explain the discsthat in his mind these keep the war alive but where did he come by these thats what i need to find out whether or not they have any particular significance odd that inspector norman never mentioned the disc in hartles mouth or had the doctor told him there hadnt been time rutledge finished his cider and beckoned to the woman who had waited on them he paid the accounting and waited for walker to retrieve his helmet and cape from the other chair ive put it off as long as i can he was saying but theres his sister to tell shell be broken up about this i doubt her husband will they never got on together he and theo rutledge stopped on his way to the door do you think he could have done this his legs are in braces poliomyelitis as walker cranked the motorcar rutledge looked out to sea the heavy gray clouds were far out along the horizon now making their way to france ahead lay the duty he disliked the most breaking news to an anxious family he could have left it to walker but that was not his way how did anyone lure hartle out onto the headland walker asked as he joined rutledge in the motorcar and after dark hartle was a canny man he wouldnt have gone there without a plausible reason they drove in silence back to eastfield and constable walker pointed out where the dead mans sister lived it was a simple bungalow in a street of similar houses single story squat roof and a small garden behind constable walker broke the silence as they got out of the motorcar ive done this three times now pray god its the last together they went up the walk a curtain twitched in the room to the left of the door even as they reached for the knocker a woman was opening the door to them her face anxious her fair brows drawn together in a frown of uncertainty constable walker she said her glance flicking to rutledges face she was very unlike her brother rutledge noted smaller boned fair hair where his was the color of wheat her face softer and her eyes a pretty brown behind her just visible in the shadows over her shoulder was a man in a wheeled chair his face pinched and sour mrs winslow this is inspector rutledge from london her face crumpled its theo isnt it oh my god i knew iti knew it when he didnt stop by last evening im afraid so mrs winslow he was found early this morning in hastings she put her hands to her face and began to cry behind her her husband put out his hand as if to offer comfort and then dropped it rutledge gently led her from the door and into a small sitting room where hed seen the curtain twitch earlier settling her on the stiff horsehair sofa the man in the invalid chair followed them into the room saying what happened to him then tell me what happened rutledge turned slightly toward him and said in due course constable perhaps mr winslow will show you where you could make some tea i think his wife will be grateful for it at first he thought walker would refuse but then the constable realized that getting the husband out of the room was important at this stage he turned to winslow and said wheres the kitchen then as if in such a small house it would be hard to find winslow cast a glance at his wife then looked at rutledge and saw that the suggestion was in fact a command that brooked no argument he spun his invalid chair and with poor grace led the constable away rutledge found a clean dry handkerchief in an inner pocket and gave it to the weeping woman she took it gratefully he said his voice pitched not to carry beyond this room was your brother in the war it was an attempt to distract her from her immediate grief she nodded with the rest of the eastfield volunteers a muffled yes came from behind the handkerchief and then she raised her eyes to meet his gaze a slow and awful truth dawning hewas helike the others im sorry yes i thoughti thought perhaps there had been an accident on the road he wasnt feeling well but he went to hastings anyway yesterday taking the van the shipment of varnish from london hadnt come mr kenton asked him to see if he could find a few tins to tide them over he shouldnt have been driving at all but he wouldnt tell mr kenton that i thoughti thought he might have taken his own life trying not to shame us her voice failed and rutledge found himself thinking of rosemary hume murder was sometimes not the worst news to reach a household why did you fear he might do himself a harm he asked after giving her a moment to collect herself in another room he could hear the rattle of cups and low voices as the two banished men talked quietly his stomach it hasnt been the same he was always one to like his food but now he had to watch what he ate no cheese or rich sauces not even an occasional curry nothing with spices and he did like his mulled cider of an evening when it was cold he had to give it all up only the plainest of boiled meats and potatoes and vegetables his favorite dish was parsnips roasted in goose drippings but he couldnt have it everything was tasteless he said and still his stomach would reject everything sometimes and hed be violently ill you could hear him all over the house virgil said it kept him half nauseated as well but i felt for theo and lay there in bed listening to him and praying he wouldnt begin those terrible dry heaves that went on for hours your brother lived with you when he first came out of hospital there was no one else mum and dad were gone and mary and the baby died of the spanish influenza before ever he was wounded that must have broken his heart but he never mentioned them when he came home he went to the churchyard by himself not even asking me to come and show him where they were and as soon as he could he went back to the farm and lived there alone it wasnt a working farm anymore but it was our home he felt comfortable with his memories thats what he said comfortable as if he could talk to them somehow mum and dad mary and the baby how was the relationship between your brother and your husband not very good she told him with resignation in her voice theo didnt want me to marry virgil you see he thought it was pity i felt and not love she hesitated and then asked was it quick how my brother died she waited braced for his answer quickly enough rutledge said you know about the other deaths oh yes its all over eastfield thats all anyone talks about i expect theyll be gossiping about poor theo now i feel guilty ive done my share of the gossiping and now i see it wasnt right did your brother have enemies did anything that happened in the war seem to worry him he never talked about the war not to me he just came home put away his uniform and got on with his life i asked him once if it was very bad being wounded and all he said was it was the ticket out was he closer to someone in particular a friend in the army someone here in eastfield theres no one i know of who would harm theo why should they he was a good man he never was any trouble growing up he helped his father at kentons and never complained they liked him there they did from the beginning her voice trailed off as she stared into space reliving another time and place i cant see any point to killing him i mean theres no money to speak of although he was never in debt when he came back from france was he on good terms with the men hed served with did he have any problems with anthony pierce i dont know i mean he never spoke of trouble he never went looking for it for that matter theyd all changedthey didnt sit about talking over what theyd done in the trenches it was as if it hadnt happened in a way but of course it had hadnt it she frowned theo was given a medal he must have been brave but i dont know what he did it was something rutledge had heard often enough since his own return to england censorship of course meant that letters home could say very little about where men were or what they were doing and many of those at home in england had no means of knowing what war in the trenchesor on board ships for that matterwas really like the images they had were often so far off the mark in many instances that no one would recognize in them the reality of france he had spoken to a woman who had told him quite proudly that her dead son had had a good bed and clean sheets every night he was away from home hed told her so himself rutledge hadnt disabused her of the notionone her son had no doubt cultivated for her sake and to her question about his own situation on the somme he had assured her that he too had slept well hed been rewarded by a smile and a nod as if she had been happy for him of course many families had known the truth of the savagery their loved ones were caught up in but even they had sometimes preferred lies hamish said what we did was to die for naught rutledge flinched mrs winslow misconstrued it should i have asked him about the fighting was it important no he answered her it doesnt matter at all and then constable walker came in carrying the tea tray and mrs winslow turned to it as if it were a lifeline her husband following him into the room looked quickly from rutledges face to his wifes as if he could read in the air between them something of what had been said they took their leave shortly afterward and walker said harshly as the two men reached the motorcar i hope to god we find out who is committing these murders dropping walker off at the police station rutledge changed into dry clothes then went to find the rector of st marys church the signboard at the gate into the churchyard gave the priests name as ottley as rutledge was about to decide whether to try the rectory or the church first he saw the man he was after just closing the rectory door and striding down the walk toward him youre the man from london the rector said squinting at his face as rutledge met him on the flagstone walk he pulled out his spectacles for a better look yes do you want me i was on my way to see mrs winslow to offer what comfort i could the constable left word to look in on her my name is rutledge scotland yard id like five minutes of your time first is there somewhere we can speak privately the rector gestured vaguely in the direction of a bench set under an apple tree growing between the church and the rectory its gnarled spreading branches offering good shade as the watery sun strengthened will that do my housekeeper is mopping floors i doubt shed care to have me tracking back inside rutledge led the way and the vicar dusted the bench with a handkerchief before settling himself in one corner rutledge took the other sad circumstances were in the rector said with a sigh i cant quite bring my mind around it you know four murders its unspeakable i never dreamed of such a thing here in eastfield rutledge could hear bees buzzing about over his head where the tight knots of young green apples were nestled id like to ask you about eastfield youve been rector here for some time nearly thirty years now he answered twenty of them without the support of my dear wife but one copes somehow indeed you knew these four men who have been killed what can you tell me about them im not asking for secrets of the confessional but for observations you must have made as you watched them grow into manhood they were boys in and out of scrapes but no harm done for the most part a rowdy bunch excepting of course for anthony pierce who played with them only occasionally still there were one or two more serious incidents as youd expect and then they were strong enough to help out at home and their childhoods changed no longer collecting eggs before school or bringing in the cows afterward they were set to heavier work mucking out the cowshed or the barn helping with the planting and the harvest whatever was needed some were able to stay with their schooling others werent so fortunate hartle of course was apprenticed to his father at kentons the pierce brothers went away to public school and the nonsense stopped it was a common picture of life on farms girls working under their mothers eye sons learning firsthand the trade of their fathers large families helped eke out the needs that slender purses couldnt meet though they meant more mouths to feed as a rule on small holdings food was more plentiful than money for wages and the system worked did anything happen in the armybefore they leftafter they were in francethat might lead to this sort of killing the rector shook his head i never heard of it if anything did but they wouldnt have told me would they theyd have confessed to a chaplain and whatever it was would have stayed in france hamish said youll never uncover the truth then but he had to he made one last effort saying to the rector is there a place to look i dont ask you to reveal any secrets but it will save timeand livesif i am given a direction to follow its not a conspiracy of silence the rector told him at least not on my part its just that we dont recognize whatever it is as the problem we may be looking in the wrong places on the other hand what places ought we to be searching i dont know rutledge found himself suddenly remembering the case that chief inspector cummins had failed to solve was this of the same ilk he refused to believe it somewheresomewherethere was a grain of truth to pursue and one way or another he would find it hamish said start with the most obvious it was good advice but not very helpful he thanked the rector and went back to find constable walker striding into the police station he said every victim so far fought in the war either in the village company or as in pierces case in another i need that list of their names every single one of them walker frowned hed been up most of the night rutledge remembered and had had little time to work on anything else ive started it sir do you want the navy as well rutledge took a deep breath everyone if he wore a uniform i want his name on that list walker pulled a sheet of paper from the side drawer of his desk and picked up his pen mumbling to himself he went through the village in his mind house by house at length he looked up rutledge had waited patiently watching the list grow seven walker said he turned the sheet around so that rutledge could read the names hed written and their branch of service very good rutledge said how many of these were in school together as boys all but this one he said pointing to alistair nelson he came here when his father was brought in to work at the brewery he was sixteen at a guess and he went off to join the navy as soon as war was declared then withdraw his name if you will that leaves us with six men find them for me and bring them here to the station and tell them to be prepared to be away from home for three nights i may need longer than that but well begin with three here some of these men have familiesdutiesthey cant just walk away tell them they have this afternoon to find someone to help them with their work but i want them here an hour before nightfall what are you planning on doing with them walker asked theyll want to know that as well they dont need to know but i intend to lock them up here and hold them without visitors incarcerate them but what have they done thats a bit harsh murder is harsher i want them under your eye until i return and i shall hold you responsible if theyre set free for any reason at all and where will you be walker asked goaded im going to track down some of the men whose identity discs we have if i cant find answers here in eastfield i can at least make certain no one dies while im in another part of the country ill leave written orders you wont be held accountable for my actions walker studied him for a moment you believe the men whose names are on this list may be the next victims sir one of them is my nephew all the more reason to keep him safe rutledge replied one man has already died on my watch i wont see another killed while im away we cant protect all six of them all of the time walker we dont have the manpower and i dont think hastings will agree to lending us men but if this killer keeps to his schedule there will in fact be another murder before i return the solution is to put his victims beyond his reach it will be inconvenient i grant you but the risk is not acceptable it was easier said than done walker sought out each of the six men sent them grumbling to the police station and even after rutledge had explained why he was taking this step there was strong opposition to his plan i cant be away for three nights hector marshall exclaimed ive got cows to milk vegetables to hoe chickens to feed another man added that his wife was pregnant and likely to deliver at any time two more told rutledge they could look after themselves and didnt need his help doing it he answered only im sure theo hartle would have said the same he was a bigger man than any of you and still he was murdered walkers nephew billy tuttle said with all due respect sir what if its one of us the killer i mean and were shut in together he looked at the others defiantly im not saying it is not by any means but it bears thinking about the last two to come in asked why they should be punished when theyd done nothing wrong refusing outright to stay in a cell rutledge listened patiently to their protests and then said very well lets make it simple we neednt draw straws tell me which of you will volunteer to become the fifth victim step forward ill release you as a stalking horse to see if youre on the killers list or not and if the murderer should be one of you he will most certainly have to wait until hes free before killing again hes not a fool whatever else he may be he wont kill here they stared at him it wont work marshall told him pointblank he was a small compact man with a broken nose and an obvious dislike of authority you cant be sure that madman is after one of us why not the greengrocer or the foreman at the brewery the rector or the clerk at the hotel are you volunteering rutledge asked im not volunteering marshall began rutledge cut him short i remind you each victim was alone after dark no one saw the killer arrive no one saw him leave think of a better plan and ill consider it marshall objected again look we dont know why those four died im not saying its something they did or didnt do but my conscience is clear why should i run with my tail between my legs like there was a silence step forward who among you feels safe enough to take such a risk you survived the war the lot of you are you feeling lucky they talked amongst themselves and then turned back to him three days walkers nephew said not an hour more thank you but i warn you if you give constable walker here any reason for complaint ill have the lot of you in charge for obstructing the police is that clear the man called henderson said where will you be tracking down connections between the living and the dead unless you can tell me what you believe this is all about unless you know something that i dontand constable walker doesnt what happened in france nothing henderson replied nothing that would lead to murder then or now we served with honor all of us there was the ring of truth in his voice but he hadnt been in the company that left eastfield together three years younger than the rest according to walker hed volunteered on his seventeenth birthday and had served with the new tank corps like anthony pierce he was an outsider still pierce had been murdered anyway no one else spoke up rutledge waited looking each man in the eye and they dropped their gaze first even marshall hamish said into the silence ye ken it might not be what they did but what they failed to do and they wouldna remember that rutledge answered him in his mind this killer could have moved on to hastings or rye or even london but he hasnt because his quarry is still here half an hour later he left eastfield behind walkers parting words were i hope you find something that makes this incarceration worthwhile there was an undercurrent of doubt in his voice rutledges first stop was in hastings to see if any progress had been made in tracing hartles movements before he was killed inspector norman said testily its early days but he was seen in a shop that carries varnish at half past ten in the morning they didnt have what he needed and he went to another place of business and found it closed he came back half an hour later and bought four tins of the varnish he was to pick them up at two oclock at that point it appears he had lunch in a small pub that fishermen frequent apparently he knew the pubs cook in france he visits the man whenever hes in hastings yesterday the man wasnt there his wifes mother was being taken to hospital in eastbourne for suspected appendicitis we checked and she was admitted for surgery hartle waited for him at the pub and the cook returned to hastings at threefifteen the two men sat down together for a good twenty minutes and hartle asked if the family was able to pay for the motherinlaws care then a little before four oclock hartle left to retrieve his tins ostensibly on his way home to eastfield or so the cook says he could think of no reason why hartle would delay returninghed got what hed come for we know for certain our man left the pub close on to four half a dozen people can vouch for that after that we lose him then that must be when he encountered the killer you cant be sure of it its possible my men will turn up something more by the end of the day where is the van he was driving when he arrived in hastings we havent found it yet it doesnt mean we wont i dont fancy the idea that this man whoever he is is setting up shop in hastings i want him to go back to eastfield at least until youve made a little progress toward identifying him this fellow soldier hartle visits when hes here in hastingsis the man in the clear oh yes he couldnt overpower hartle if he tried consumptive if you ask me thin as a rail rutledge drew a breath in frustration keep looking im on my way to london to investigate these discs call the yard and ask for sergeant gibson if you need to reach me but he wasnt ready to leave hastings just yet he went in search of the pub the fishermans catch and saw that it was a small establishment that catered to men who ate hearty in the morning and were in bed well before nine in the evening to sail with the sand fleet before the sun rose hamish said he wouldna stay oer long if he was to reach home at a reasonable hour he must have done this time was someone following him or did the killer know he was being sent to hastings yesterday its uncanny how well someone understood the habits of the first three victims and where to find them alone at night if hes watching them he lives in eastfield thats one of the reasons i penned those men in the police station the cook one bill mason was in the middle of preparing a roast for the evening meal and rutledge agreed to interview him in the kitchen it was small crowded noisy and almost unbearably hot claustrophobic rutledge felt the beginnings of a cold sweat ive already talked to inspector normans men mason said busy basting the roast and then preparing potatoes and onions to add to the pan inspector norman had called him thin but he was cadaverous his hands shaking his cheeks sunken a nervous tic by one eye rutledge recognized the symptoms shell shock not consumption he swallowed hard to keep his own voice from cracking as he said they must have asked you about when hartle came here and when he left i want to know if he was afraid of anyone the sunken gray eyes turned to gaze for a moment at rutledges face afraid yes of anything anyone did you serve with him in france we met in hospital we never fought together mason turned back to his work as someone from the bar shouted a request for a ham sandwich with pickle a helper who had been listening in to the conversation reluctantly turned away to fill the order mason watched him for a moment then said quietly i dont know that theo hartle was afraid not exactly but he saw someone here in hastings yesterday morning while he was looking to buy the varnish he couldnt put a name to the face and that worried him he caught just a glimpse mind you but he couldnt get it out of his head when i came back from eastbourne he was waiting for me here he wanted me to help him search and see if i recognized the man i told him to leave well enough alone why did he think you might know this man when he was in hospital there were days when theo was barely conscious he thought i might be able to put a name to the face he said it was important to know he finished peeling the potatoes and set them aside rutledge said he was hoping it was someone from the hospital or not he was hoping it was he said hed feel better if it was did the man seem to recognize hartle i dont know theo didnt say anything about that he just didnt want it to be the father whose father the cooks hands were shaking he put aside the carrot he was trying to scrape and clutched the edge of the table with taut fingers his head down just go away now i cantyoure pushing too hard please rutledge could hear his own voice saying lives depend on this whose father but he was watching the color drain from masons face and the way his eyes were blinking as if he couldnt focus them properly hamishs voice was loud between them warning rutledge to stop and rutledge could feel himself losing control blackness sweeping through his mind the sound of the guns so loud he wanted to press his hands over his ears and hide from it but he was here for a reason and he gripped that the way most men would grip sanity and said again whose he could hardly hear the reply it was a whisper lost in the roar of guns that wouldnt stop he wouldnt tell me for gods sake he wouldnt tell me and i let him go hunting for that man alone because im a coward rutledge reached out and clapped mason on the shoulder a comradely gesture but the man shrunk from him cringing until he was lying on the floor in a tight knot protecting his body he wouldnt tell me for gods sake he wouldnt tell me and i let him go looking for the man alone ashamed rutledge stumbled out of the kitchen somehow found his way to the door and into the street he leaned against the wing of the motorcar sick the sounds slowly receded and after a time the darkness also withdrew he straightened up ignoring hamish still raving in his mind l eaving the motorcar where it was rutledge began walking heading nowhere one street after another left and then right and then left again after a while he found he was standing in front of a small shop its blackandwhitestriped awning affording a little shade from the now warm sun gradually he noticed that he was staring at a display of porcelain figures jeweled fans small dolls in colorful costumes enameled silver snuffboxes and ornate black lacquerware with scenes from fairy tales fancifully painted across the tops he had no idea where he was looking up at the scrolled letters on the shop window he realized that this was where russian emigres had put their personal belongings up for sale turning away he tried to get his bearings there was the distant headland green now in the sunlight where hartles body had been found using that as his guide he walked in an easterly direction until he realized that he was coming out of a side street that ended near the water the pub was several streets over glancing at his watch he realized that hed been walking for more than an hour he swore and was about to turn up toward the pub and his motorcar when another shop window caught his eye the display was of all things military gold braided tricorns an assortment of swords and a polished table where tiny lead soldiers fought pitched battles there was a rusty halberd books on military tactics from wars long past a pistol with a split barrel and even a wellused kaiser wilhelm helmet with its pointed spike and a long spear that appeared to be east african on the spur of the moment he went inside the proprietor was an elderly man with streaks of gray in his fair hair and bright blue eyes he glanced up from a sock he was mending as the bell over the door jingled and smiled at rutledge looking for anything in particular he asked in a deep gruff voice identity discs from the war do you ever see them or have them for sale the crinkles around the blue eyes deepened theres no market for that sort of thing they were rather flimsily made as a rule buttons now and uniformsthey turn up i have a button hook from the grenadier guards any number of shell casings some of them with trench art others plain an officers whistle wellpolished riding boots with gilt spurseven several pairs of field glasses hamish had subsided in his mind and rutledge was about to turn away when something caught his eye in the glass display case where he was standing it contained smaller and more expensive objects kept under lock and key there were an ivory pipe a cigarette case made from what appeared to be tortoiseshell a flint knife a few american civil war lead soldiers and assorted buttons watches rings and other pieces of jewelry inscribed with military insignia he pointed to the knife what can you tell me about that its said to be quite old struck from a single large flint the gentleman who brought it in told me his grandfather had turned it up while working in his garden it set him off on a search for an ancient burial site thinking there might be funeral goods but to no end the proprietor took the object out of the case you can see how the blows were struck to shape the blade careful he added as he passed it to rutledge its sharp enough to cut hide rutledge took the blade how was it used according to a dr butler who comes in from time to time it would have had a handle a length of wood with a fork at one end into which the blade would have been inserted he pointed to the blunt end see how its notched rawhide would be wrapped tightly around wood and blade and perhaps soaked for a tight fit if you knew what you were about you could flense a hide just with the blade but if you were of a mind to stab a woolly mammoth youd need the handle for a sure grip short handle for jabbing longer piece of wood for throwing of course if this is as old as its said to be the wood and the rawhide have long since rotted away a pity but there you are yes i see rutledge gingerly tested an edge and could see that it was quite remarkably sharp still where did you say it was found i didnt but from what i was told the old grandfather lived in east anglia theres flint there along the north coast he reached into the case again and drew out two or three unprepossessing round gray stones and with them half of a stone showing the shiny black surface of the flint inside rutledge was well aware of what flint looked like but he let the proprietor continue his explanation of how flint tools could be made stone age or not but whoever discovered how to do this sort of work must have had a monopoly in his day everyone came to him for their blades until someone else learned how to do it a little better or a little faster striking the blow in the right place to make a sharp edge rather than break the edge offthats the skill right there rutledge said after a moment a long way to come to sell you this find i was of the same opinion the man shrugged but its a fine piece of its kind only it never sold theres not much call for something this old ive kept it more as a curiosity than anything else whats a military shop without what must have been one of the first tools of war how do you remember who brought you each item rutledge asked ive kept a record over the years i read it sometimes there was a gilded sword that had belonged to one of napoleons generals inscribed as well i was reluctant to sell it but money is money he pulled a dogeared ledger from beneath his counter and opened it at random rutledge could see that he had listed each object hed bought the date and the price paid hed also drawn a fine sketch of it as well lets see he thumbed through the pages until hed found what he wanted there it is flint knife blade he pointed to the clever sketch filled in with black ink sold to me for fifteen pounds by a charles henry no provenance that it is as old as it appears to be but it is a fine example of flint workmanship and i rather liked it but it never brought in the profit i had anticipated he turned more pages and then pointed out that he had sold a button hook to a man from kent on holiday in hastings this is the half of the ledger where i keep my sales listed rutledge thanked the man and was on the point of leaving when he changed his mind and asked the price of the flint knife sixteen pounds im afraid necessary to turn a profit even after all this time rutledge bought it and then asked if it could be wrapped and put into a box for mailing ten minutes later he walked out of the shop and went to find the post office there he sent the small parcel to chief inspector cummins hed added a brief message i found this in a shop in hastings sussex it is said to be old but i should think anyone who knew how to work flint could make one just like it add a handle wrap it well with rawhide and it would make a formidable weapon it would most certainly explain the bit of flint found in your victims wound and it could explain in some measure why he was a sacrifice this may not be as old as stonehenge but it could most certainly have been used to kill men as well as animals what do you think a t the yard sergeant gibson had the direction of the three men whose discs had been found before rutledge had arrived in sussex he had had time on the long drive to consider which of the men to call on first and hed chosen the man whose name was connected with anthony pierce pierce the officer the anomaly corporal trayner lived in belton yorkshire and rutledge drove on late into the night to make up for lost time finally stopping in stafford in a hotel near the railway station this was industrial country and the towns buildings were black from coal smoke staffords narrow streets and tall church tower had always reminded him of etchings hed seen of german villages late the next morning he arrived in the little town of belton and asked at the local police station for directions to the trayner house it proved to be one of six victorian cottages down a lane just past the churchyard solid houses of no particular distinction except for the gardens that grew rampant in the small space between the gate along the road and the door hollyhocks stood tall in the back of the gardens holding pride of place at this time of year a rose climbed to the small porch of the fifth house and a small sign by the walk identified this as spring cottage rutledge went to the door and lifted the knocker a brass dolphin a young woman answered the summons and asked his business rutledge identified himself and asked to speak to corporal trayner she invited him in saying over her shoulder dear theres a mr rutledge to see you from scotland yard she led the way into the front room although the curtains stood open the room felt dark closed in despite its eastern exposure and the brightness of the morning sun a man sat in one of the chairs a cushion at his back and a white cane at his side he rose as rutledge entered and held out his hand but his eyes were scarred and blind and he waited for his visitor to come to him rutledge took the extended hand and then the chair that trayner indicated he was fair with broad shoulders and a ruddy complexion he said what brings you here inspector there was only curiosity in his voice not strain if he had a guilty conscience it was well concealed rutledge briefly explained his reason for driving to belton and added can you tell me if you are still in possession of your identity discs i dont think i ever had any not of the sort you describe i know what they are i just sewed labels in my uniforms mostly in the pockets and that was that it was an unexpected response rutledge said youre quite sure about this its rather important yes im sure to tell you the truth most of the men in my company were not impressed with the fiberboard discs we were regular army you see or i was until this he gestured in the direction of his eyes did you know an officer by the name of pierce anthony pierce trayner shook his head no the name means nothing to me should it does eastfield sussex mean anything to you or these names william jeffers james roper theo hartle trayner frowned but said only im afraid i cant help you must be mistaken your name was on the disc i saw i cant be wrong on that and you say that this must have something to do with me but what i dont know rutledge said slowly feeling his fatigue as he spoke it had been a long drive for nothing and time was short he had three days not enough time to go elsewhere and yet now he felt compelled to try finally he asked was there anything that happened in franceanything at allthat might make someone feel he had to avenge your blindness revenge is a very strong term but if any of my men felt that i had been wronged theyd have taken their anger out on the germans not the british it was a german shell that did this rutledge had to leave it there he asked them to contact the yard if they could remember any detail that might have been overlooked and they agreed mrs trayner saw rutledge to the door he apologized for disturbing them and she smiled wryly ive never seen anyone questioned in a murder case before it breaks the tedium of our days but my husband is telling the truth inspector he always does rutledge thanked her and turned away but trayners voice called to him from inside the house and rutledge heard him stumble as he hurried toward the door mrs trayner went quickly to help him but her husband brushed her aside impatiently no harm done lucy dont fuss he came out into the passage and asked are you still there inspector rutledge yes im here what is it i was right when i told you i didnt remember your anthony pierce but there was another piercedavid i think it was a lieutenant in the sappers he was attached to our division for two or three weeks i dont think i met him but i knew of him is that any use to you david rutledge queried no david isnt right trayners sightless eyes squinted in the direction of the sky as he pondered daniel that was it daniel pierce his eyes came back to where he thought rutledge was standing he had a reputation for being difficult as i recall thats how i came to hear of him but damned good at his job from all reports trayner was pleased with himself as if this was a small victory over his sightlessness proving to scotland yard that he was a reliable witness even if he couldnt see as other men did thats very helpful rutledge answered thanking him and moving on to the motorcar just as he was about to drive away hamish said is he still there and rutledge looked back trayner was standing in the open door as if savoring the world beyond his doorstep his wife hovered in the background fearful that he might take it into his head to do something that would harm him t here was a severe thunderstorm as he crossed into wales and rutledge took shelter in a small hotel that was miles short of his destination the welsh border had once been as turbulent as the scottish border but this hotel catered to daytrippers coming across from worcester and the dining room was crowded with those caught out by the weather on their way back to england he sat in the bar looking out at the lightning and wondered what he would learn from j a s jones welsh sapper he turned as the man behind the bar asked what hed have and gave his order noting the mans limp and a ragged scar down his arm he asked in the war were you the man smiled grimly i was that and you rutledge gave his regiment but not his rank at the somme were you lost my brother there i did bloody shambles rutledge answered agreeing with the unspoken condemnation he heard in the welshmans voice it was and all he brought rutledges ale and said ive found it hard to settle again i dont know if its because of my brother or because i cant see any sense in anything now we were close what about your family thats what my da asks over and over again what about my wife and children i dont know the answer i think ive changed and they havent he went away to serve another stormbound driver and then came back to where rutledge was still standing howve you managed then i was wise enough not to marry before i went away to fight just as well as it happened he regarded the man what did you do with your identity discs when you came back the man gave a bark of laughter but it was bitter burned them i did in the grate as if i could burn away all that went with them sadly it made no difference more people were coming in and he was busy rutledge took his glass and went to an empty table by the window hed hardly finished his ale when the storm moved on almost as suddenly as it had appeared and the rain changed from downpour to a light drizzle that barely concealed the sun moving on rutledge discovered that j a s jones lived in a town so small it hardly took up space on the map hed used to bring him this far the small slateroofed houses huddled together against a hillside and the road seemed to help pin them there preventing them from sliding down into the brisk little stream on the far side j a s jones lived above his fathers greengrocers shop a stair to one side of the shop door led up to another door at the top and here rutledge knocked several times before anyone came to answer the summons jones was a small dark man with thinning hair and a short beard he looked at rutledge quizzically and said if youre wanting your money i dont have it not this week my name is rutledge from scotland yard in london good god i know im overdawn at the bank they neednt have sent the yard i know nothing about your banking arrangements rutledge said im here to ask a question about the war to do with a murder inquiry in sussex sussex i dont think ive ever been there his frown appeared to be genuine what is it you want of me can you tell me what became of your identity discs jones stared at him ii dont really know is it important very if they are here will you look for them please come inside then jones stepped back from the door im a bachelor theres nothing tidy about the place it was true halfeaten meals littered the tabletop in the long single room and clothes had been dropped helterskelter on the floor the two or three chairs and the posts of a bed rutledge could see the tiny kitchen at the far end opposite the door im out of work at present jones told him dragging a small battered trunk out from under the high oldfashioned bed my family does what it can to keep me out of the poorhouse but its been a closerun thing unlocking and then lifting the lid he considered the contents mostly the uniforms why would you want my discs i served out my time theres been no problem with the army he began to delve into a corner fingers poking here and there rutledge said there have been several murders in a village where all the men served together in each case a disc was found in the dead mans mouth the names on the discs appeared to be randomyorkshire cheshire wales were trying to find out what connection the discs could have with events in the war jones looked up from his search youre saying one of these men had my disc in his mouth but thats not possible i have my discs here there must be some mistake if you have your own discs then i shall have to agree with you there rutledge responded jones went back to searching and finally brought out a thin strand of rope from which two fiberboard discs dangled here they are then he said triumphantly rutledge took the rope and examined the discs both were there the name on each one worn but still legible the only difference between the two he held now and the one that had been found in sussex was a small nick in the edge of the one owned by jones youre right he said slowly you have both after a moment he passed them back to jones did you ever serve with men from the vicinity of hastings anyone named theo hartle jim roper anthony pierce or william jeffers he deliberately put no rank to the names an army in the field was seldom made up of one homogenous regiment to bring a regiment up to strength the army took what it needed from whatever troops were available and so a company from hastings might for a time serve with a company from glasgow only to see it replaced by a company from cornwall if it suffered heavy casualties but jones shook his head i dont think so you were a sapper did you ever serve under a lieutenant daniel pierce never served with him but we knew about him there were stories of his going back into a tunnel to see why a charge hadnt blown or going back after men caught in the tunnel when it collapsed one such story claimed he broke through into a german countertunnel and the two men shook hands then shot each other i dont know how much of it was true but we were always willing to believe the tales it gave us a glamour you might say they claimed he dug a hole down to hell one night and dined with the devil there was always something being whispered behind the backs of our officers it was their opinion such tales encouraged recklessness it was dangerous duty at the best of times what else was whispered about lieutenant pierce oh i dunno that he was unlucky in love that sort of thing he set the discs back in the trunk straightened the contents where hed been digging around and added over his shoulder he wasnt the only one unlucky in love i came home to find that the girl i was to marry had eloped with a bosun from a frigate an englishman at that hamish was saying something in the back of his mind but rutledge was already posing the question how did you know that pierce was unlucky in love one story said the girl he was to marry had died another said that shed chosen another man either way she was lost to him wasnt she and where theres smoke there must be fire he shoved the trunk back under the bed and got up dusting off his hands will there be anything else inspector he asked warily as if the discs had been a trick to get rutledge in the door and the truth was to come out now preoccupied rutledge said no thank you im satisfied that all is as it should be but when he left jones was standing in the doorway watching him go as if to make sure rutledge wasnt playing some sort of game rutledge could feel his gaze on the back of his neck and wondered what jones had done that made the man so suspicious of a policemans visit on the whole rutledge thought his answers had appeared to be truthful it wasnt his inquiry and he let it go hamish in the back of his mind said as the motorcar turned around and rutledge headed for england he was verra careful of yon trunk he brought back souvenirs he shouldna have had and jones wouldnt have been the first to do that coming through gloucester rutledge realized he would pass not twenty miles from where rosemary hume lived she had told him to go away but that was in the heat of anger and heartbreak over her husbands death he debated and then decided to stop and speak to her she could have changed her mind and he owed it to max he thought to do what he could when he reached chaswell the first person he recognized was maxs cousin reginald sitting in a motorcar outside a greengrocers he pulled alongside and reginald looked up greeting him with the warmth of a man doomed to boredom for a good half hour more inspector what brings you back to chaswell youre the last person i expected to see this afternoon ive been to wales to interview a witness im on my way back to london and thence to sussex how is rosemary shes taken it hardbut you know that she hasnt forgiven poor max and nothing i can say will change her mind so ive given up trying im surprised she wants me here but she does and in time that should help the healing he made a deprecating gesture or possibly shes afraid the journey back to scotland will kill me and she doesnt want my death on her hands rutledge smiled ignoring a lorry driver sounding his horn as he edged past the two motorcars half blocking the road anything i can do no juststay in touch his gaze went to the shop door as two women emerged baskets in their hands chatting together then he turned back to rutledge i havent got much longer i know that and so does rosemary i expect thats why she hasnt sent me away he paused staring down the road as if he knew where it was leading he didnt look at rutledge as he asked will you come and see me if i send for you for maxs sake rutledge thought he knew what reginald was saying that with max gone he felt the need of someone to be there at the end for it was not a death he could ask rosemary to watch i give you my word ill try reginald nodded its no more than i expected thank you ian it was the only time hed used rutledges given name and then rosemary hume stepped out of the shop and looked up to see rutledge speaking to her houseguest for an instant he thought she was about to turn away instead she gave him a cool greeting and rutledge asked how she was coping ive had time to understand what happened to us to max and me she said if he didnt care enough to go on living if he couldnt face me with the truth of his feelings then our marriage was over she held out one hand stripping off its glove her finger was bare of rings i intend to take him at his word and go on with my own life as i see fit but as she turned to pass the basket filled with her purchases to reginald rutledge caught the reflection of unshed tears in her eyes recovering she said i thought you had pressing yard business in sussex its what took me to wales im returning to sussex now he hesitated rosemary ian no dont make excuses for him she turned to reginald but before he could step out of the motorcar to turn the crank rutledge forestalled him ill see to it he did and moved to one side with a nod she drove away hamish said ye canna talk to her no until shes at peace yes rutledge answered returning to his own vehicle thats true at least reginald has stayed with her in the end that may help her more than anything i could do or say h e didnt stop in london the three days were up at sundown he paused in hampshire and tried to put a telephone call through to the brewery but there was no answer he realized that tyrell pierces office must already be closed and there was no way now to reach constable walker to tell him to keep the six men under lock and key until he could arrive in eastfield sometime in the early hours of the morning he tried next to telephone inspector norman in hastings in the hope that he could get word to eastfield but inspector norman was out on another case he was told and rutledge would have to wait for his return he attempted to explain the situation but the man on the other end of the line said firmly im sorry sir youll have to speak to the inspector swearing to himself rutledge grimly set out again making the best time he could he hoped that walker would have the good sense to wait but with each mile he was more and more convinced that the objections of the incarcerated men would prevail and walker would let them go after all he had to live in eastfield long after rutledge had returned to london and there was nothing to be done about it but to pray that the waiting killer failed to find one of his targets alone and vulnerable i t was closer to five in the morning when rutledge drove into eastfield and drew to a halt outside the police station he had had to stop for an hours rest somewhere in the new forest pulling to the side of the road in an effort to rest his eyes the night sounds around him were soothing and he had slept instead for a wonder hamish was quiet he had been busy ever since rutledge had left chaswell taking advantage as he so often did of the stress that was already filling rutledges mind it was becoming increasingly apparent that something more than an event in the war lay behind these murders for one thing there was the face that hartle couldnt place a face that worried him on the day he was killed who was it hed seen and had he not only tried to find that man again but encountered him in the dark on the headland and why the headland for another the connection between those identity discs and the murders was less clear than it had first appeared and there was daniel pierce as well whose name kept cropping up were these pointers toward the truth or was he still missing something that would bring the disparate pieces of the puzzle together but even hamish was silenced by sleep brief though it wasno more than twenty minutes but twenty precious minutes if a mans life was hanging in the balance the day had broken now whatever was going to happen had already happened he sat for a moment in the motorcar fighting his fatigue and staring at the closed and silent police station it was one of the hazards of police work making the wrong judgment he had done his best to protect the six potential victims of this killer rather than taking the chance that the murderer wouldnt strike again while he was away but at the same time hed accepted a risk of a different sortby denying the killer his opportunity he could have changed whatever plan there was to these murders and caused it to take on different possibly more personal overtones he wasnt interested in finding out whether he could outwit the murderer or not he was only intent on stopping him he got out of the motorcar and stretched his muscles tight and cramped from the drive from wales and then he walked to the door of the police station and put out his hand to lift the latch the door was firmly locked he stood there for a moment his tired mind trying to grasp what that meant a police station was always open if the constable wasnt there he left a message on the desk telling whoever needed him where he could be found foreboding gripped him he knocked firmly using his knuckles and there was no answer he had no idea where walker was at home at the scene of another death and there was no one about at this hour the street quiet and shuttered and then rutledge remembered mrs sanders who had seen the lorry driver come through hastings and then return again for the police after hed spotted the first body on the road rutledge had read her statement he turned and looked across the way where was she not in the shopsor even above them then he saw the tall narrow house wedged between a milliners and an apothecarys it looked to be one of the oldest buildings in eastfield brick and timber the upper story leaning slightly to one side as if the foundation had begun to subside when the newer apothecarys had been built crossing the street he walked up to the front of the house and looked up at the double windows of the first floor one window was open to the slight morning breeze the lacy white curtain billowing into the dark room behind and hamish said ware rutledge peered intently at the window and then realized that behind the panel of white curtain was a tiny wizened face looking to be as old as the house itself he called to the woman staring down at him pitching his voice so that it carried to her but didnt rouse neighbors on either side im looking for constable walker come in mrs sanders called after a moment i never lock my door he turned and lifted the latch the door swung open easily and he stepped into a narrow dark passage to one side stairs climbed to the first floor to the other shut doors led into two rooms and then a third door closed off the passage at the far end he took the stairs two at a time and rounded the railing toward the open door of the room that overlooked the street a chair stood by the window and in it sat the woman hed glimpsed from below cushioned and pillowed and covered with a quilted comforter she turned her head to smile at him the wrinkles in her face smoothing across her withered cheeks but the eyes in that face were neither clouded nor dim they were the color of pansies almost a purple they were so dark a blue her wellbrushed white hair drawn back into a smooth braid that lay over one shoulder looked like a pale halo in the shadow of the curtain come in young man you must be the policeman from london ive seen you come and go from the station with constable walker yes im inspector rutledge mrs sanders indeed i am theres a chair behind you do sit down he sat im trying to find the constable unaccountably the station is locked so it is he came out shortly after midnight and walked away i think he locked the door as a precaution a precaution he was afraid those who were inside would try to leave rutledge felt a surge of sheer relief hes kept the six men locked up inside oh yes but it wasnt an easy task i could hear the yelling last night my guess is thats why constable walker left theres nothing wrong with my eyes or my ears only my limbs have given out i believe you do you sit at that window every night and every day except when i take my meals im nosey you see and i have the world spread out before me here i dont need much sleep i doze when i feel like it and the rest of the time i watch it can be quite entertaining eventually the whole town passes beneath my window or across the street from me you gave constable walker a statement regarding the lorry driver he had been about to say the driver who found the first body but broke off dont be shy young man there have been four murders in this town if you count poor theo hartle i have a woman who comes and cleans for me and another who brings my evening meal we gossip he was sure they did have you seen anything else from your window strangers who come to eastfield in the night but who arent to be found during the day there was a man before the killings beganperhaps a week before it was dark when he came walking up the hastings road i couldnt see him clearly enough to identify him he was moving without haste like a sightseer taking in the view i thought it was odd even so but i decided he was looking for work and trying to determine whether he stood a better chance here or in hastings i expect he chose hastings because i never saw him again he said taking a chance did you know daniel pierce well enough to say with any certainty that the man wasnt pierce her eyebrows rose danny pierce do you think hes come home or considered it i dont know you must tell me she gave that some thought i cant see danny slinking through eastfield in the dark hed come striding in there are those who would be happy to see him if he did then who else could that man have been if i come up with a name ill tell you she promised meanwhile theres constable walker standing by your motorcar wondering where you might have got to rutledge rose and glanced out the window and he had a perfectly clear view of the constable framed as neatly as a photograph for mrs sanderss pleasure he thanked her and left closing the house door behind him as he started across the street constable walker called testily i wondered where you went i was about to try the hotel he waited until rutledge had reached him and added what did you learn about those discs i hope it was worthwhile ive had to put up with enough abuse while you were away the yorkshire corporal had never had discs the welsh sapper found that his were still in his trunk where he expected them to be there was no time to move on to cheshire but im beginning to think we need to take a closer look at those discs we have youre saying theres no feud between companies the two men i questioned had never heard of our victims but they knew daniel pierce by hearsay he was a colorful man apparently walker frowned mr piercehis fatherwont be pleased with that news and you are not to tell him this is a yard matter well leave him out of it until we need to question him again meanwhile i was very glad to see youd kept your charges actually i let one of them go in the middle of the night his wife had her baby there were complications and dr gooding sent to ask if he could come home i locked the door to the police station and took him there myself as it turned out mother and child are fine but they could have lost the baby well done lets see how the rest of our charges are faring walker unlocked the door to total silence he glanced at rutledge and crossed to the cabinet behind his desk to retrieve the lantern he kept there then he led the way to the large holding cells where hed incarcerated the six men when he opened the second door into that passage his eyes had to adjust to the gloom before he saw his five remaining prisoners they were standing backed up against the cell wall faces pale and eyes squinting against the sudden glare of the lantern trying to see who was behind it and then they recognized their jailer their gaze traveling on to the tall figure behind him there was an outburst of protest vociferous and heated rutledge had expected their anger to be directed at him since hed insisted on locking them up here he wasnt disappointed as he sorted through the words tripping over one another as the men demanded to know why walker had abandoned them for the remainder of the night he realized that they had come to agree with him about the danger they were in after a moment rutledge raised his own voice accustomed to being heard on a battlefield and stopped them in midsentence they glared at him but fell silent he turned first to walkers nephew now one at a time whats happened there was someone outside not fifteen minutes after my uncle had left with tom and here we were locked tight in here like fish in a barrel tuttle told him what do you mean someone outside walker demanded in front no there tuttle said pointing to a side door walker said to rutledge theres an alley outside it led down to the stables and outbuildings they were torn down at the turn of the century and a warehouse for kenton chairs built in their place facing the street that runs behind the station he strode down the short passage and shook the latch but it was still secure as he came back someone else took up the story at first it sounded as if he was trying to force the lock and then for a time there was nothing we were just settling down when we could hear him again i swear it sounded as if he was sliding something under the door marshall thought he might be blocking it but after a bit it smelled as if he was trying to burn his way through the passage filled with smoke you can still smell it walker sniffed the air then turned to rutledge do you rutledge nodded it was faint but enough smoke lingered to pick it out now that it had been brought to his attention walker went again to the door and this time opened it inspector sir he said after a moment and rutledge went to see what hed found charred rags were jammed against the bottom of the door and rutledge bent down to touch them they were still damp as if they had been lit and then nearly doused to create a maximum of smoke with a minimum of fire rutledge looked up the alley toward the main road but he couldnt see mrs sanderss window which meant she couldnt have seen whoever was at work here he could have set the building on fire walker declared kicking the rags away from the door and then squatting beside them to sift through them but they were torn cloths something that could have been found in a dustbin or a tip rutledge thought used for cleaning and then discarded i doubt the station would have caught the outside of the door is blackened but not heavily charred i think he was intending to stampede your charges walker got to his feet if thats what he was after he succeeded there must have been pandemonium nobody relishes the thought of being burned alive he must have seen you leave with tom he knew he was safe walker looked at rutledge i dont like the sound of that that he was watching he took a deep breath i was of two minds when you wanted these men clapped up but now theyll be released and the two of us cant watch six of them but fright may have sharpened their memories lets find out they went back inside and told the anxious men in the holding cell what theyd discovered tuttle walkers nephew said be damned to him then hes a coward but marshall disagreed my uncle was out in india for a time he told me that old tigers got a taste for man when they couldnt kill larger prey and they were more dangerous because of that their brethren in the jungle would slip away if they got the scent of a person but not these hes not a tiger one of the other men said hes mad thats what he is i dont think so rutledge answered him and i ask you again is there anything in your pasts that could have come back to haunt you is there anyone who has ever held a grudge in the war here in eastfield in any place for that matter but they shook their heads hamish said it was something loomed large in the killers mind but ye ken not in theirs how well do any of you know daniel pierce rutledge asked out of the corner of his eye he could see walkers gesture intended to stop him from asking these men about the younger pierce but this was a murder inquiry and tyrell pierce couldnt set limits on the directions it took we knew him as a boy but not as a man tuttle said after a glance at his companions he went away to school you must know that and even when he was home during holidays he didnt have anything to do with us then after the war he was hardly here in eastfield before he was gone again it was mr daniel then and touching your cap to him did you resent his going away to school or was there something between you before then while he was still daniel an old hurt a misunderstanding a case where no harm was meant but he took it hard or perhaps you did his eyes swept the half circle of men and he read nothing there that would help him he gave as good as he got marshall answered his glance sliding toward walker and then away again we avoided him if we could manage it he was anthonysmr pierceslittle brother and no one cared to have him tag along after us whats more he was a tattletale if we werent careful and on purpose he never got it right often as not we were in trouble for something we hadnt done i was that glad when he and his brother went off to that school wed had enough of both of them rutledge considered the man wondering what he had to hide because his voice and his shifting gaze betrayed him hamish said he didna care to be caught and that was very likely itmarshall had been a ringleader in whatever mischief was afoot and daniel pierce was a thorn in his side the only reason we was allowed to play together was mr pierce was busy at the brewery and couldnt always keep an eye on anthony and who else was there i ask you his age the rectors son was older and dr gooding only had girls henderson added anthony was all right one of the other men put in he never caused any trouble which was an odd way to put it still they were getting nowhere burning down an empty mill and frightening lovers in a churchyard hardly led to murder on the whole he thought hamish was right the killer saw injury where others did not if in fact it was the past that had led to these deaths he said when you leave here dont take what happened last night lightly dont go out alone after dark not even on your own property take someone you trust with you between nine at night and early morning lock your doors if someone summons you ignore it unless theres another person to go with you and dont turn your back on a stranger it could cost you your life the four men who were killed had no chance to cry for help remember that they were dead before they quite knew what was happening to them its not a risk worth taking and he let them go home there was nothing else he could do walker watched the five men gather their belongings and walk out the door of the police station without looking back even tuttle his nephew had nothing to say as they left do you think theyll heed your warning walker asked rutledge shook his head well know when the next victim is found r utledge left the constable at the police station and went to the fishermens arms to shave and change after an early breakfast he went to the brewery and waited patiently in the office until tyrell pierce had finished overseeing the work on a new gauge for their primary vat he came in brisk and busy the distinctive aroma of roasted hops following him in the door he ushered rutledge into his office and said immediately is there any news have you found this killer not yet rutledge took the chair pierce indicated and watched the man round his desk and sit down hamish was saying do ye reckon theres a reason his son canna come back to eastfield and the father knows what it was he did and who is to blame for it pierce was fit enough rutledge found himself thinking but it was difficult to see what daniel pierce was afraid ofor was ashamed of no one else seemed to remember unless of course the smoking rags under the police station door was a red herring and the four men who might have told the police the truth were already dead it was hard to believe that pierce had murdered his elder son to protect the younger he recalled tyrell pierces barely concealed fear on his first visit fear that daniel was somehow involved or at least that the police would suspect him rutledge said several differing possibilities are emerging in this case i had thought initially that the war was at the bottom of these murders the identity discs most certainly pointed in that direction but the more i learn the more questionable that assumption may be which brings me to another line of inquiry your son daniel for an instant rutledge thought pierce was going to come across the desk after him the mans face suffused with blood and there was such a deep anger in his eyes that rutledge wondered if hed taken hamishs suggestion too lightly and then pierce got control of himself and said tightly are you like all the rest at a loss to find the truth and eager to lay these crimes at the door of a man who hasnt lived in eastfieldreally lived heresince well before the war im not interested in crucifying your son mr pierce the best way to clear his name is to confront reality not hide from it did your sons get on well together of course they did pierce snapped were they both in love with the same girl that caught the older man by surprise what are you talking about i spoke to a sapper in wales a man by the name of jones he told me that daniel pierce had quite a reputation during the war tales of his exploits were popular fare amongst sappers there was even the story that hed dug his way to hell and supped with the devil pierce forced a laugh hardly surprising daniel was nothing if not brave and he had a cool head always did he said it made him an ideal sapper and the murderer of four men also had a cool head hamish was reminding rutledge but he said only your son was a man who preferred to work alone in the tunnels when he was setting the charges i imagine he must have had trouble with authority he wanted to do things his way including how to mine tunnels properly all right yes pierce said goaded he wrote something in a letter something about the fact that if he was going to die it would be his own mistake not that of anyone else they also said he appeared to live a charmed life but that he was unlucky in love the girl he wanted to marry died if memory serves before anthony took an interest in mrs farrellsmith he was engaged to a girl who died young thats true as far as it goes is it possible that his brother daniel was in love with the same woman ive never heard anyone even suggest that he might have been was there another girl then i was unaware that my son fancied anyone much less had formed an attachment hed always said that he never wanted to settle down to an ordinary life as a boy he was forever reading about explorers and lamenting that there was nothing left to discover perhaps his brother was already set to inherit the only life daniel wanted to live nonsense men will also say such things when theyve been disappointed in love you never knew my son pierce told rutledge his voice harsh on the other hand i believe that mrs farrellsmiths late husband did in fact know daniel at school perhaps that surprised pierce i dont know anything about that when i called on her mrs farrellsmith believed at first that id come to her because we knew where your son was what are you driving at man it makes me wonder how attached she was to anthony pierce or if she was fond of him because he was your heir that left the older man speechless this is a small town rutledge continued hardly more than a village that has outgrown itself its difficult to keep secrets when people have known each other most of their lives men here went to the same school as children they served in francewhat else connects them i dont know yet you cant ignore the fact that when this killer has finished his work here he could begin to search for daniel next does your son know the danger in which he stands or will he be caught off guard like the first victims you may feel that obstructing the police protects your son but it could have just the opposite effect because he could possess the missing piece of information that could save other lives including his own tyrell pierces face was as pale as the shirt he was wearing ive lost one child to this killer i dont want to lose another the truth is i dont know why daniel wont return to eastfield or where he is i write to him in care of a tobacconist shop in st ives cornwall i have reason to believe he doesnt live there that his mail is forwarded to him by the friend or acquaintance who owns the shop or whoever comes to collect it its a fragile link but its all i have and i will preserve it at any cost i want you to understand that if you do anything to interrupt this line of communicationsend policemen to question that shop owner or have my sons mail watched or interfere in any wayi will see to it that your career at scotland yard is over i have the power to break you and i will break you rutledge believed every word of that warning you can try he said but if i were you id do everything in my power to keep my son safe he stood up and for a moment regarded the frightened man on the other side of the desk including asking the police to help me as it is if daniel is killed it will be no ones fault but your own he turned and walked out the door not waiting for a reply behind him he heard pierce clear his throat as if on the point of calling him back but in the end he did not rutledge went from the brewery to the school begun by an emigre frenchman and now run by mrs farrellsmith she was just finishing a report when the girl on duty that morning led rutledge to her office she frowned when she saw who was standing in the doorway but signed her name to the report put it in a folder and set it to one side before acknowledging her visitor with a nod rutledge suppressed a smile she would he thought have been quite happy to live in the era when a policeman was relegated to the servants entrance and was shown to the familys quarters by a housemaid stiff with disapproval he stood there in silence and finally she was irritated enough to offer him a chair and ask him what brought him to the school this morning daniel pierce he said and waited it took her a moment to compute this clearly having expected him to begin with the murders daniel pierce she repeated trying to recover control of the conversation and what have i to do with anthonys brother im waiting for you to tell me a slow flush crept up her fair skin nothing she snapped i have nothing to do with him id wondered why you had been willing to take this position with the misses tate latin school i thought perhaps you were in straitened circumstances after your husbands death or that you felt a strong family tie to your aunts now im coming around to the possibility that you chose to accept this position because daniel pierce lived in eastfield and you expected him to return to the village when the war was over which he did but he hardly spent a fortnight here was it because of you i shall have you recalled for incompetence and rudeness rudeness to my betters im sure youll try meanwhile ill leave you with a problem that has been on my mind since theo hartles murder he recognized a passerby while he was in hastings the day of his death he couldnt place the face hed seen but it disturbed him enough that he could well have gone in search of that person when he should have been returning to eastfield and that could very easily have cost him his life who did he see was it daniel pierce he stood and walked to the door i dont know why you feel im your enemy mrs farrellsmith why you should feel more comfortable with inspector norman conducting this inquiry i have no wish to probe into your personal life or your secrets but i have four dead men to whom i owe a duty and six living men im here to protect if you can put your antipathy aside long enough to help me do what i came to do we might save daniel pierces life it could well be that his name is on this murderers list like his brother he served in the war and like his brother he went to school here as a boy if someone believed he had a good reason to kill anthony pierce then its likely that he also has a good reason to kill daniel pierce please consider that he walked out the door without waiting for an answer or looking back to see how mrs farrellsmith had taken his suggestion he was halfway down the passage when he heard her call his name but he kept going and she didnt call a second time from the school he went to collect his motorcar and drove to hastings there was a telephone available in the offices of the pierce brothers brewery but the favor rutledge expected to ask of sergeant gibson was not something he wanted to be overheard by anyone in eastfield h amish was vocal as rutledge drove to hastings yeve got nowhere he reminded rutledge and yeve annoyed yon brewer and the woman theyll have ye recalled it wasna the chief superintendant who sent you here ye ken he willna stand by ye i understand rutledge answered him aloud the wind whipping his words away as he descended into hastings but either daniel is the dangeror hes in danger either way ive got to find him hes one man therere six ithers at risk six ithers closer to hand i know he had reached the stade at hastings old town the sound of waves rolling in was regular and soothing with no wind or storm to drive them today he pulled to one side and watched the sea for a time the whisper of the water just before it turned to race back into the sea was soft and seductive rutledge had always liked the water hed learned to row at an early age but had never had the opportunity to sail if the war hadnt come when it did he thought he might have taken the time to learn his life had stretched before him then in measured decades and he had been happy marriage lay ahead and with luck children he would have grown old with them and watched their children in turn take their first steps toward a life of their own it would have been enough but that had never happened he wasnt sure whether he missed it or was glad that it had only been a dream broken dreams were easier to walk away from than broken lives he watched as sunlight danced across the water and far out to sea a smudge of smoke marked the passage of a ship lines from o a mannings poetry came to mind and he was unaware that hed spoken them aloud i look now and then at the sea and the reflection of myself is there restless sometimes or calm or angry or even uncaring but never happy i remember then i came from the sea and someday must go home oddly enough he had never liked the idea of drowning the revolver was swifter and the darkness came faster max hume had known what he was about hamish said aye but first ye must write a letter to your sister that jarred him what would he tell frances that she would understand and that had been maxs dilemma and why he had not written to rosemary rutledge put the motorcar in gear again and drove west into hastings new town until he found a sizeable hotel there ought to be a telephone here he said under his breath and found a place to leave his vehicle the white swans was built with a wide balustraded terrace across the main front warmed by the sun and sheltered by a projecting wing on either side a great deal of architectural detail reminiscent of a wedding cake gave the threestory hotel an elegant air and judging from the handsomely dressed families sitting under broad pastel umbrellas as they finished late breakfasts it was expensive as well rutledge took the shallow stairs that led up from the road two at a time crossed the terrace and entered the highceilinged lobby filled with chairs and potted plants and an air of style and grace reception was to one side of the ornate staircase and he asked for a telephone he was directed down a passage to a glass door inside was a leather chair and a small table with a telephone a lamp and an enameled tray holding a pen and hotel stationery he put through a call to scotland yard and was relieved when sergeant gibson came to the telephone almost at once sir any news gibson asked in the background two men carried on a conversation lowvoiced the words indistinguishable rutledge thought they were standing in gibsons doorway or just outside not yet i need information on a farrellsmith who died before the war leaving a widow who is now in charge of the misses tate school in eastfield he went to public school in surrey and was there at the same time as anthony pierce and his brother daniel thats all i can tell you but you should be able to trace him through the school do you know which school it was no but you might try whitefriars first indeed i will where am i to find you sir send your reply by post to the fishermens arms in eastfield i dont want to be overheard taking this call in the brewery office there was a moment of silence rutledge had assumed that gibson was writing down the particulars of his request and also where he could be found instead the sergeant had been waiting for the men outside his door to walk on down the passage for as the voices in the background faded gibson said rapidly theres been a complaint the chief constable spoke to the chief superintendent not half an hour ago rudeness and unprofessional conduct rutledge said grimly the woman mrs farrellsmith she has not wanted the yard to take this case away from the hastings police is bowles viewing this seriously early days sir but is it wise to be looking into her familys background under the circumstances shes a suspect i cant give her special consideration just because she complains about me and the best way to protect myself is to find out what it is shes afraid of and either strike her from the list of suspects or charge her go ahead with the queries ill accept the consequences just be as discreet as possible he rang off sitting there in thought for several minutes before opening the door and stepping out into the passage as he did he realized that a man was standing at reception waiting for the clerk behind the desk to return and the man was staring at rutledge with concentrated interest their eyes met he kens who you are hamish warned rutledge was already striding toward reception the man quickly turned his back and hurried out of rutledges line of sight by the time rutledge reached the lobby the man had disappeared rapidly scanning first the staircase and then the lounge rutledge realized that the only direction the man could have taken was through the hotel door and out to the terrace he hastily surveyed the terrace but the families and couples who were sitting beneath their pastel umbrellas seemed not to have noticed anything amiss and on the street below the broad steps there was only a woman walking with a small child he went down the steps and stopped her asking i just missed my friend he came out of the hotel and i didnt see which way he was going startled she looked up at him a man um i think he went that way she told rutledge gesturing east no one has come by me going in the other direction she inclined her head toward the west the way she had come he thanked her with a smile that brought an answering smile and then he was walking east along the hastings road but it was hopeless there were more people on the walk now and one man could easily have disappeared among them or popped into one of the small shops that catered to holidaymakers he would need half a dozen policemen to help him search them all standing to one side so as not to obstruct pedestrians coming toward him he waited on the off chance that the man thinking himself safe might reappear but his quarry was far too canny and even though rutledge returned to the white swans and sat for a time in the quiet lounge facing reception he never returned rutledge even spoke to the desk clerk but he had been busy putting a jewelry box into one of the hotel guest safes and never noticed the man waiting at reception for him rutledge drove back to hastings old town and stopped where he had before near the net shops even this space was more crowded than it had been but he closed his eyes and tried to recall his brief glimpse of the mans face before he had turned away what had he seen what could he be sure of how many times had he asked witnesses to describe someone the man was of a little above medium height broad shouldered hair a medium shade of brown eyes indeterminate but rutledge thought they must be light rather than dark gray possibly or a pale blue hamish said into the silence in the motorcar gray eyes ye ken he was wearing a gray suit it was true what else he moved well that was true that swift turn almost on the thought so that rutledge could no longer see his face and he was able to leave the hotel and cross the terrace without creating a stir even when he was hurrying and he had fit in at the white swans clothing and appearance in keeping with the clientele nothing to make him stand out or seem memorable in a crowd even the woman with the child when questioned had paid him little heed because he attracted no attention rutledge gave it another few minutes but there was nothing else he got out and started the motorcar and then for a moment debated where to turn not to inspector norman constable walker then he set out for eastfield his mind busy he would like to believe that the man was daniel pierce but how could pierce recognize him on sight rutledge was aware that he too had fit into the hotel scene comfortable in his surroundings and in no way attracting attention to himself no one had walked past the telephone room while he was making his call he was certain of that for he could see clearly through the glass doors the man couldnt have overheard part of his conversation then their first contact came as he was stepping out of the telephone closet and starting down the passage the man must have looked up seen him and in that same instant known who he was hamish said unless he followed you into the hotel and wanted a better look thats unlikely but was it where had the contact begun in eastfield for instance had someone stalked rutledge just as hed stalked his victims to take the measure of his opponent there were enough dark corners and darker alleys someone standing silently in the shadows could have escaped rutledges notice but could he escape hamishs there was no way of knowing before when he had walked half blind out of the hastings police station he might well have attracted the notice of someone during that hour of helpless wandering still he wanted to believe that it was unlikely he didnt care for the feeling of vulnerability that being followed at such a time gave him reaching eastfield he left the motorcar at the fishermens arms and went on foot to the police station constable walker was just leaving to eat his midday meal he saw rutledges face as he came through the door and said immediately somethings happened rutledge answered im not sure describe daniel pierce for me walker said pierce let me see not as tall as you dark hair light blue eyes slim at least he was the last time i saw him hed just come home from france he may have filled out since then why he frowned dont tell me youve found him was it pierce hamish said the sun could ha lightened his hair that was true but was it pierce or had he caught a glimpse of the murderer who would have every reason by now to know what the man from london looked like better to let it go rutledge said i was probably mistaken or wishful thinking walker replied with a grin then it vanished as he added despite what his father says i dont know of any reason for daniel to be living in hastings within a stones throw you might say and not keeping in touch with his family if you want my opinion for what its worth daniel pierce is living in london where hes his own man its what id do in his shoes r utledge was sorely tempted to ask tyrell pierce if he kept a photograph of his sons at the brewery but better judgment prevailed it was not yet the time to let the man at the white swansif he was indeed daniel pierceknow that hed been identified on the other hand there was a question he wished to put to theo hartles sister he went to the winslow house and knocked at the door he was almost certain someone was inside and he waited eventually winslow himself opened the door his face sour im not up to visitors today he said plaintively you must come back another time im sorry to have disturbed you it was your wife i wished to see that brought a grunt from the man in the chair shes not here rutledge thanked him and left as he walked back to the hastings road which formed the main street of eastfield he asked himself where mrs winslow could be found at this hour of the day the greengrocers the butchers the bakery he stepped into each shop but didnt see her not doing her marketing then he paused outside the police station and thought about it her brother was dead the rectory he turned and walked toward the churchyard hamish said aye she wouldna wish to have her husband with her and rutledge saw that she was indeed standing in the churchyard pointing to a space next to two stones hartles wife and child the rector and mrs winslow looked up as he approached across the freshly mown grass of the churchyard not more bad news the rector asked anxiously no ive come for a word with mrs winslow when shes finished her business here she pointed to the markers at her feet he saw hed been right here lay her brothers wife and child i was just asking rector if there was room here beside mary he says there is i dont know quite what sort of service to have she frowned my husband feels it ought to be brief without much ceremony but theo didnt kill himself did he it doesnt seem right a proper one rutledge answered her without reservations the fact that his life ended abruptly makes no difference the service should be the same as hed have been given as an old man with all honor due him she smiled tears filling her eyes yes thank you that would be fitting she turned to the rector there we are then ill think of what hymns hed have liked and any favorite scriptures she bit her lip rutledge knew what was on her mind your brothers body he said gently will be released very soon she nodded unable to trust her voice the rector took her arm and walked with her a little way until they were out of the churchyard and standing in the drive up to the rectory rutledge gave them a chance to finish their private discussion but as the rector turned and nodded to him he caught them up now mrs winslow asked brightly as if to affirm that she was in control of her feelings again you wanted to speak to me he thanked the rector and then said to her theres a tearoom next to the bakery i believe would you like a cup she hesitated yes i would she admitted frankly but theres my husband i ought to see if hes all right he will manage very well rutledge told her and gestured toward the road she went with him the two of them walking in silence until they were halfway to the tea shop i wonder rutledge began how well theo hartle knew daniel pierce daniel the pierces didnt have much in common with the rest of us once theyd been sent away to school they were home on holidays of course but you didnt walk up to the pierce house and ask if daniel or anthony were in did you their lives had changed more than ours but on the whole i think theo liked anthony better myself i liked daniel he was always nice to me nicer sometimes than theo she looked away her mind elsewhere finally she added theo was my brother and i shouldnt speak ill of the dead but he could sometimes be very selfish at that age id like to think it was the influence of those he ran with back then what one couldnt think of the others could i was glad when theo outgrew them i think thats why my parents agreed to let him be apprenticed so soon at kenton chairs and they were right it was best for him in many ways if your brother saw daniel pierce on the streetlets say in hastings or somewhere like thatwould they stop to chat well it would depend wouldnt it on the occasion if daniel was alone and theo as well they might speak if daniel was with a lady or friends theyd nod in passing id think but theo would let daniel take the first step it would be proper you see it would be proper rutledge thought for the workingman to defer to the brewery owners son in the matter of recognition in a public arena old habits died hard even after the upheaval of the war there was nothing between the two men that might make your brother uncomfortable encountering him again after all this time she considered that as rutledge opened the door of the tea shop for them silence fell in the busy room and every eye turned their way mrs winslow hesitated as if shed been caught fraternizing with the enemy her face turning pink rutledge took her gently by the arm and said in a voice intended to carry but apparently for her ears alone i think a cup of tea will make you feel much better he summoned the woman waiting on tables and asked for tea and a selection of pastries then he guided mrs winslow to a seat by the window she turned to him with anxious eyes and he said only the rector will never forgive me if i dont keep my promise you shouldnt have had to make such a visit alone my husband she began yes it would have been difficult for him but a friend perhaps he could see from her expression that she had few friends he could understand why their tea came and the pastries she let him pour her cup and pass her the pastries and as the occupants of the shop realized that there was to be no arrest or harsh interrogation to report to their friends they lost interest mrs winslow nibbled a pastry and then shyly reached for another he realized it was a treat for her that such outings had stopped long ago it was not until they had left the shop and he was walking toward her home that she answered the question hed asked earlier daniel and theo had a fallingout oh it was years ago theo couldnt have been more than nine or ten daniel was seven at the most i dont know what they fought about but it couldnt have been very serious at that age could it still theo gave daniel a bloody nose and afterward he came home terrified that the police would be sent for and take him up that tyrell pierce would see that he was sent to borstal but nothing came of it and anthony told theo later that daniel claimed hed fallen off will jefferss stallion trying to ride him bareback she smiled at the memory i expect he was ashamed of being bested by theo but he was only seven after all when was the last time your brother saw daniel it was before the war im sure of it that fortnight when daniel came back from france theo was still in hospital did you see daniel then only once and not to speak to she hesitated hed just left the misses tate school and it appeared that someone had hit him in the face because there was a big red mark on his cheekbone and he was angry i did wonder how he came by it they were at the corner of her street now and she put out a hand if you wont mind id rather go the rest of the way alone my husband keeps watch he stopped and she thanked him profusely for the tea and the pastries then hurried on toward her door as if acutely aware of how long shed been away from home hamish said a bluidy nose doesna lead to murder no rutledge answered him silently if that was all there was to it theo hartle may not have told his little sister the whole story still it lent credence to the possibility that someone was erasing the worst memories of daniel pierces childhood but what was more interesting was how daniel had got that mark on his face he went back to the hotel for lunch and found a letter waiting for him it was from chief inspector cummins rutledge took it to his room and opened it ian thank you for the surprising contents of your parcel it had not occurred to any of us to look for a flint knife we were told that the wound was oddly shaped and so we developed a list of foreign knivesafrican southeast asian middle easternand the theory was that in his travels wheeler had lived in a port where such souvenirs were available to buy or steal portsmouth southampton dover london and so on we had one promising lead an oxford don retired to dartmouth whose home was broken into while he was abroad and several objects from his near eastern collection were stolen alas when he returned and inventoried what was missing a selection of yemeni knives they didnt match the dimensions of the wound your flint knife is a far more likely candidate what more can you discover about its origins meanwhile i shall ask a friend who is interested in such topics if he can detect traces of human blood on your find his home laboratory must surely be useful for something other than mystifying his wife family and friends i must say this is encouraging but i absolutely refuse to let my hopes be raised again lest they be dashed as so many others have been i must have intrigued you with my account of this unsolved mystery i should have warned you that it was bound to cause sleepless nights and overwork ones imagination and it was signed simply cummins smiling rutledge returned the letter to its envelope and put it in his valise now if he could only have equal success in solving his own mystery m r kenton who owned the furniture works where theo hartle had been employed came into the dining room of the hotel as rutledge was finishing his luncheon he was a tall stooped man with graying hair and spectacles he stood in the doorway looking around and as the woman who served meals approached him he asked her a question rutledge looked up from his plate of cheeses just as she was pointing to him the man came over introduced himself and asked if he could join rutledge for a few minutes or if rutledge would prefer to meet him in the hotel lobby after his meal yes of course sit down rutledge answered and signaled the woman to ask for a fresh pot of tea kenton thanked him and said this business with theo has been heavy on my mind i come here reluctantly you understand because what im about to tell you is something i refuse to believe still im no policeman and if there is any possibility that i am right then i have a duty to those who have died to talk to you he broke off as the fresh pot of tea and a dish of biscuits was set before them when the woman had gone away again rutledge said i appreciate your sense of duty i shall look into the matter i cant promise anything but i will respect your confidence as far as im able kenton appeared to be relieved that was clearly what he had come to ask theo was a good man kenton went on i dont know how were to replace him steady dependable amazingly gifted when it comes to working with wood well liked by the others in the firm such a loss ive been asked to say a few words at his funeral he paused stirring his tea as if it were the most important task of the day rutledge said watching his face i dont think thats what youve come here to tell me kenton met his gaze no no it isnt i dont know where to begin i suppose what had hartle done that could be of interest to the police he turned to the window ignoring the question my mother had a companion for many years she had an arthritic condition and was a regular visitor to the spas of europe looking for a cure for the pain if not the disease when she fell ill at wurzburg a young woman named hilda lentz nursed her back to health when my mother recovered she asked hilda to come back to england with her the idea of travel must have appealed to her because she agreed but instead of returning to germany she married the son of one of our friends a man named peter hopkins and they had three children she continued to work with my mother until her death and hilda died of appendicitis a year or so later shed lost a child a daughter in childbirth but her sons were treated more or less as members of our family carl hopkins in fact came to work for me because he has a way with machinery thats invaluable what does he have to do with theo hartle nothing everything i dont know he shook his head vigorously carl was torn about the war you see his eyesight was damaged by a case of the measles and there was no doubt that he couldnt serve when the war came but his younger brother george joined the army with the eastfield company and carls favorite german cousinhildas sisters boyhurried to join the german army carl considers himself english but he was worried about his brother and his cousin neither of them survived it wasnt long after we heard about george that someone sent carl an anonymous letter saying that george had been shot in the back while crossing no mans land the army refused to confirm or deny the story but the letter claimed that george had been shot because he had a german mother spoke fluent german and wasnt to be trusted george hopkins rutledge remembered the name hed been one of the two eastfield soldiers who died in the war go on when the eastfield soldiers began to come home from france carl asked them how his brother had died and in carls view they were evasive well apparently it was a night attack just as georges commanding officer had told us in his letter no one really knew how he died were you in the war i cant imagine that its a tidy business attacking at night i suspect the letterwhich was posted from londonwas meant to be hurtful not true unfortunately about this same time carls aunt wrote to him to say that his cousin had died of his wounds as an english prisoner and she believed he hadnt been given proper attention it was understandable she was upset looking for someone to blame but she told carl that he ought to be ashamed of his english heritage because the english had killed both george and his cousin carl withdrew into himself dr gooding gave him something to help him because he walked for hours every night unable to sleep thank god early last year he got over whatever it was came back to work and seemed to be himself again i cant tell you how relieved i was then why are you telling me about him now taking a deep breath kenton met rutledges gaze several weeks ago he received a letter from someone in germany his aunt had hanged herself despondent still over the death of her son according to her priest and enclosed was a copy of the letter from her doctor documenting her ill health an effort i should think to convince the church that she was not an intentional suicide but it made sad reading carl showed it to me asking what to do i suggested making a small gift to the church in her name and that was the end of it for all i knew now now im betraying a trust he stopped his face drawn his eyes reflecting his discomfort and anxiety rutledge said ill speak to him quietly without making it obvious thank you im not sayingim not pointing a finger you understand but my god four men are dead and if i dont speak up there may be others i love carl like a son ill do anything to help him but i was fond of theo as well i cant believe carl could have harmed him not theo it took a great deal of courage to come here but you did the right thing kenton rose from the table have i he could have been my son you know but my mother persuaded me not to marry hilda and she was right in the long term we were much happier with our respective spouses all the same i still remember how i felt at the time as he walked away rutledge wondered if that last was true or if over the years kenton had convinced himself that it must be true that his mother had been wise he went directly to the police station and found constable walker reading a message from inspector norman he looked up as rutledge came in theres a woman in hastings who saw theo hartle at seven oclock speaking to a man the inspector wants to know if youll be interested in interviewing her with him i told constable petty that wed come as soon as i tracked you down lets go rutledge said and turned toward the inn to collect his motorcar he told himself that carl hopkins could wait but he was wrong i nspector norman was waiting for them impatient and short tempered he greeted rutledge with a sharp i was about to go on without you ive got a murder inquiry of my own two women killed in a house on brent street they walked in on a man ransacking it theres an intensive search in progress i dont appreciate the distraction of your inquiry well talk to this person ourselves constable walker and i this is my patch i told you he reached for his hat and led the way back to the street well use your motorcar if you please and so rutledge had no choice but to accommodate inspector norman constable petty and walker with no space left for hamish where he usually rode however the distance wasnt too great and in a matter of minutes they were walking into a shop that catered to newborns and small children there were caps and blankets gowns and christening robes finely woven blankets and the dresses that children of both sexes still wore when very young rich with embroidery and ruching and tucks there was also a small selection of prams rocking horses and the teddy bears that the american president had made so popular as well as a tray of silver rattles spoons cups and teething rings the woman waiting on a customer was large and motherly with a lowpitched voice and a warm manner she glanced up as she saw the four men enter the shop but her discussion of cap ribbons never faltered and so the four policemen were forced to stand idly waiting until the customer was satisfied and had left with a small parcel done up in silver paper mrs griffith inspector norman asked coming forward yes how may i help you i doubt youve come for christening robes or china kittens inspector norman gave their names and then said you spoke to one of my men about theo hartle oh yes i heard that the police were trying to find out where he was before he was killed i saw him where the main road divides just at the foot of marine street he was speaking to a man a friendly conversation as far as i could tell but rather serious as well i was walking with a friend and we werent going in that direction and so i didnt have an opportunity to ask after his sister you know the family rutledge asked surprised his mother and i went to school together and then we were married and went our separate ways but we stayed in touch peggy winslow is my goddaughter and i have tried to keep an eye on her for her mothers sake but that worthless complainer shes tied to keeps her on a short rein a pity but there you are she always enjoyed the little treats i planned for her visits but she doesnt come to hastings these days rutledge remembered how mrs winslow had seemed to enjoy the pastries at the tea shop in eastfield did you know the man hartle was speaking with i dont think i do although i may have seen him about from time to time and hartle didnt appear to be afraid of him or uncomfortable in his presence no not as far as i could tell what time of day was this inspector norman asked closer to seven than six at a guess she said i wasnt exactly keeping track of the time and they were still there talking when you last saw them still there on the corner i couldnt have said where either of them went after that i find it so hard to believe that theo is gone he survived the war the germans couldnt kill him and then some murdering maniac takes his life i shall go to the funeral no matter what that husband of peggys has to say and ill bring her here as well she ended vigorously and rutledge had no doubt that she would do just that can you describe the other man he asked she pursed her lips thinking not as tall as you brown hair slim i had no particular reason to take note of him all the same it sounded like the man rutledge had encountered at the white swans hotel no certainty of course but still very likely hamish said ye ken it doesna mean he didna follow his victim and kill him when it was finally dark and that was true as well you were never near enough to hear any of their conversation rutledge asked you couldnt judge the other mans accent for instance no not close enough by a long chalk mrs griffith replied are you thinking he might have been a foreigner then actually i wondered what class of man he might have been i can tell you he was dressed more like a gentleman inspector norman had turned to stare at rutledge are you suggesting what i think you are he was a sharp man and rutledge had forgotten that no onethat is to say no one alivehas heard the killer speak he could be a scot as far as we know or from the midlands it would be helpful if we could place him norman grunted then turned to constable petty if youll take mrs griffiths statement and to the woman he added when the shop is closed wed like you to come in and read it over before signing it i dont know that ive been any help she said doubtfully but yes i shall come in and sign the paper they left her then and on the street once more inspector norman stopped by the motorcar instead of getting in you think it was daniel pierce dont you ive been given no reason to suspect pierce he said keeping to the literal truth there was only circumstance and conjecture so far hardly evidence but im told you wouldnt mind seeing him taken up for this crime or any other and you have a reason for thinking as much norman went on relentlessly ignoring the denial dont hold out on me rutledge im not holding out he retorted so far theres no clear motive for these murders and as long as there isnt i have no more reason to suspect pierce than i do any other person im told you went away for several days what was that in aid of rutledge wondered who had told him that walker or someone else i went to see two of the men whose names were on the identity discs weve found one man swears he never had themand thats likely he was a career soldier and sewed his name into his uniform the other man i spoke with found his discs in the trunk where he kept his uniform and souvenirs i saw them for myself i didnt pursue the question any further there wasnt time but if two of the discs are false then the others are likely to be if these are false then where did the killer get real names to put on them from transport manifests burial details payroll accounts censoring lettersor merely sitting in a pub and keeping his ears open and so where does that leave us inspector norman demanded im not sure the discs weve found in the mouths of victims appear to be real but that means someone has learned how to counterfeit them well enough to pass for authentic discs it would be easy enough i should think but why should anyone go to that much trouble and if he did why not simply make up the names on them or use the victims name if im any judge the two men i spoke with hadnt heard of or met anyone from the eastfield company nor did they know anthony pierce instead the killer used real people the point then seems to have been the confusion these discs have created theres only one reason i can think of to use the wrong names inspector norman said opening the door to the motorcar if hed used the names of the real soldiers involved then wed be able to trace them and learn precisely whatever it is thats behind these murders he got in and waited until constable walker had turned the crank and stepped into the rear seat what if the eastfield men fired on another company by mistake and killed a number of them constable walker spoke up for the first time thats not likely my nephew is one of the eastfield company and hed never cover up something of that sort and i knew each man in that company if theyd done wrong hed be the first to try to take responsibility and make amends that may well be but there were other things going on at the front like shooting an unpopular officer in the back during an attack you werent there constable walker persisted neither were you inspector norman retorted they had reached the police station and he got out as the motorcar pulled in by the main door well i dont know if mrs griffith clarified or clouded the issue but for what its worth ill see you get a copy of her statement when its drawn up and signed and then he was gone striding into the police station with the intensity of a man who knew he had long hours ahead of him his mind already busy with the two women killed by the intruder as they drove away constable walker said hes wrong as if that settled the matter rutledge let it go inspector normans remarks had distracted everyone from the subject of daniel pierce and rutledge was not ready for a witch hunt that muddled the case prematurely he said to walker i have a stop to make before we leave hastings you can wait in the car if you will yes sir walker replied his mind still on inspector normans charges rutledge found the military shop again and leaving his motorcar just out of sight walked in to collect more information about the man who had brought in the flint knife the proprietor was going through the pockets of an officers greatcoat as rutledge came through the door hallo looking for more flint knives surprised rutledge said do you have any others smiling the proprietor hung up the greatcoat and shook his head no mores the pity thats to say if you were looking to buy another one im after information this time im curious about the man who brought them in id like to know whatever you learned from him perhaps he kept one or two more such knives better made than this one the man shrugged i doubt he has any more hed probably have sold them with the original one would you like me to contact him for you thanks but id rather write to him myself he could feel the mans reluctance and added i dont mind paying a finders fee if hes got other examples this was not his inquiry and rutledge had no authority to invoke the power of scotland yard to ask for the shopkeepers cooperation the proprietor smiled youre a man after my own heart mr he let his voice trail away hinting my name is rutledge im from london im here in hastings on a matter of business then mr rutledge if youll give me five minutes ill look in my books and see what i have that will help you track down the former owner of a fine flint knife meanwhile is there anything else youd care to see not at the moment it took fewer than five minutes for the man to find the proper entry and he wrote the name on a sheet of paper in a bold clear hand even upside down rutledge could read the name charles henry it was what hed remembered from the first visit below were the rest of the details june grandfather east anglia dug up in garden not definite when found three years after the murder of the man found at stonehenge rutledge thought buton the summer solstice coincidence rutledge thanked him and after an exchange about the greatcoat that the proprietor had been preparing for sale he left walker said as he came through the shop door were you buying identity discs rutledge realized that the constable was quite serious and answered him in the same vein id asked if there were any for sale i was told that he didnt carry any because there was no call for them too bad it would have made our work easier walker sighed weve not made much progress on the whole its mostly finding out what isnt there like looking for trouble and finding none and then trouble turns up on the doorstep it was true but so far there hadnt been any other deaths and that in itself was progress of a sort when they drove into eastfield half an hour later walker said who pray is that a man was standing in front of the police station a grim expression on his face rutledge took one look and swore you know him the constable asked surprised yes and i have a feeling i know why hes here instead of leaving his motorcar in the hotel yard he drove the short distance to the police station and drew up there rutledge got out but stood by the motorcars door inspector mickelson he said in greeting mickelson made no effort to return the greeting ive come to relieve you he said coldly officially there have been complaints about your conduct chief superintendent bowles assured the chief constable that these would be taken seriously and youd be withdrawn before the day is out that was this morning and as you can see i am here he turned to constable walker and you are walker gave his name and looked from one man to the other i dont quite understand why inspector rutledge has been replaced misconduct sir of what sort thats a matter between the chief constable and scotland yard turning to rutledge he added your orders are to return to london immediately rutledge said ive several matters that need my attention first not anymore you have been relieved mickelson turned again to walker and said id like to see the statements youve taken from witnesses and the medical reports on the dead men id also like to meet mr pierce as soon as possible and also inspector norman he opened the door of the police station and constable walker hesitated you neednt look to mr rutledge for instructions man ive told you im here now and he strode into the station without waiting for walker or saying anything more to rutledge walker behind his back began sir but rutledge said only im leaving for london keep an eye on things until im able to return he got back into the motorcar and walker had no choice but to step inside the station after inspector mickelson furious rutledge drove first to the school and asked to see mrs farrellsmith the girl who opened the door said nervously shes not in sir she should not ask you to lie for her he replied quietly and took the stairs two at a time mrs farrellsmith looked up as rutledge opened her office door without knocking then her gaze went to the girl at his back i thought i told you she began but rutledge cut her short she told your lie for you i didnt believe her he turned to the girl still standing in the doorway her cheeks pink with uncertainty thank you he said gently please close the door as you go she hesitated and then did as he asked mrs farrellsmith said i have nothing to say to you but i have something to say to you youve made a serious mistake and it could easily get someone else killed will you rescind your complaint why should i i never wanted the yard to handle this business in the first place inspector norman is quite capable of clearing up these murders promptly and efficiently no doubt he could hes a good man but you havent got inspector norman instead you still have the yard mrs farrellsmith and i think youll find inspector mickelson is cut from a very different cloth she stared at him but i expressly told them he didnt wait for her to finish im sure you did but mr pierce insisted earlier on bringing in the yard and i expect the chief constable understands that it is mr pierces son who is among the murder victims not yours if you want to call off the yard then i suggest you find someone with more authority than a brewery owner to do your work for you he didnt wait for an answer he turned and went out the door this time she didnt call after him he packed his belongings quickly left the hotel and drove to london in a cloud of anger and bitter frustration hamish reacting to the tension in his mind reminded him that he had admitted that he had not come to any conclusions himself about the identity of the killer loose in eastfield and that hamish added as the motorcar finally reached the city is the only way yell find yoursel reinstated but rutledge didnt respond he found a place to leave his motorcar and once inside the yard took the stairs two at a time in search of sergeant gibson he found the sergeant in the canteen having what passed for his dinner a plateful of sandwiches and a cup of tea gibson looked up saw rutledge and said not here carrying the plate of sandwiches with him and balancing the cup of tea gibson followed rutledge to his office and as rutledge took the chair behind his desk gibson carefully set down first the cup and then the plate on the corner of a box of files sir superintendent bowles never liked the fact that he wasnt here to choose who was to go to eastfield and you gave him the excuse he needed to change inspectors i didnt give him any such thing rutledge retorted mrs farrellsmith has her own agenda i dont know what she expects to gain from it but at a guess i dont think its the murders that are worrying her its an earlier runin with the yard gibson stared at him how did you know i didnt it was the only explanation i could come up with on the long drive back to london there was an inquiry into her husbands death he died of a fall while walking in derbyshire the police felt that the circumstances didnt quite match the version of his fall that mrs farrellsmith had given them she was present you see but had sat down on a rock to catch her breath and her husband went on alone for some distance because he wanted to take a photograph from the overlook he fell just after she caught him up she said she admitted to having witnessed it what was the outcome the inquest brought in death by misadventure but mrs farrellsmith was still under a cloud as far as the police were concerned they couldnt find a motive for her to kill the man and without that they couldnt manage to charge her it would have been easy enough according to the sergeant i spoke with for her to tip him over the edge if he was busy with his camera the footing is uncertain at best at that spot rutledge was reminded of the drop from east hill in hastings the headland where theo hartle was killed was that because the derbyshire police couldnt come up with a reason that satisfied the crown or was it because they didnt care for her on general principles i couldnt say but there was no medical evidence that her husband had been struck or tripped no bruises and the like she claimed hed experienced a bit of vertigo that she put out a hand to him and he turned the wrong way he paused she had scratches on her hands from where he clawed at her as he went over but no one could tell whether they occurred as she tried to save him or whether it was as he tried to save himself and she let go either way she would have to move house and live where she wasnt known rutledge nodded very selfish of her to want the yard out of the picture but its understandable i need to speak to chief superintendent bowles hes not here hes on his way to testify in a trial in lincoln remember that one he had to examine the firms books himself damn it could be days before thats finished he debated following the chief superintendent north and then thought better of it all right ill go back to sussex and have a word with the chief constable id be cautious on that score sir the chief constable wasnt best pleased by mrs farrellsmiths complaint apparently hed wanted the inquiry to be left in the hands of the local police but mr pierce had been very persuasive he said as much to me and then when id brought the chief superintendent to the telephone he was still angry i couldnt help but overhear the chief superintendent blaming you for the lack of progress in the inquiry and he apologized for your conduct and your incompetence something was said about the fourth murder because i heard old bowels reply that if youd spent less time annoying people and more in finding the killer someone would have been in custody by now rutledge said only ill be careful it was late evening before he left the yard he had used the time to put in two telephone calls of his own he had managed to speak to the corporal in cheshire whose name had been on one of the other identity discsthe inspector there had been more than willing to find and bring the man to the telephone the corporal had never possessed identity discs and he knew nothing about the men of the eastfield company the inspector had come back on the line and vouched for the man that avenue had led nowhere just as rutledge had expected the second telephone call elicited the fact that the name on the fourth set had died of his wounds in england after a valiant fight against the odds hamish said as rutledge put up the telephone after the last conversation ye ken it was a trick and a verra good one but is the war a trick as well early days rutledge answered absently thinking that someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to draw the police into a lie if that was true then what secret had the discs been used to conceal was it a member of the company itself who was behind these murders when he left the yard the shadows were long and the heat of the sun already dissipating he started the motorcar and drove with only half of his mind on what he was doing still considering the case that was no longer his to think about hamish was silent and it was several minutes before rutledge realized that he knew the motorcar just in front of his it belonged to meredith channing a t the next intersection as mrs channing was preparing to turn left rutledge pulled up beside her vehicle its good to see you he called in truth the last time hed spoken to her hed asked her not to go away on the extended trip she was planning to take she had hinted at a year or more abroad in order to put her own life back together she had even admitted that there was someone she cared for and that that had been a factor in her decision all he could think of in the face of her sudden unforeseen decision was to say what he felt and then hed walked away refusing to look at what had motivated his words afterward he had avoided herher house mutual friends and any place in london where he had encountered her in the past now he searched her eyes for something to guide his next words prepared to drive on and then on the spur of the moment he added its late but would you care for a coffee she smiled yes yes i would actually he tried to think of a restaurant that was open the marlborough hotel he suggested neutral ground ill follow you she pulled back into the line of traffic just behind him he reached the hotel first and she quickly found a space for her motorcar as she caught up with him they entered the hotel reception together and she saw a small table in the lounge set in an alcove with a long window several other couples were having tea or coffee in the room and the atmosphere was quiet pleasant there he nodded they sat down and he ordered two coffees into the silence that followed rutledge said youre out late i went to a lovely dinner party she smiled reminiscing they had met at a dinner party he had been afraid that she saw into his mind her eyes seeming to read his thoughts it was his own fear he realized later but she had a way of understanding people that was unexpected in one so young and he had been drawn to her against his will their coffee came rutledge waited until the young man serving them was out of earshot then he said as she passed the sugar bowl to him why did you stay hed intended to keep his voice level but it had taken an effort to achieve that hamish had set up a deafening roar in his head from the moment hed recognized her motorcar she was playing with the silver spoon in her fingers paying excessive attention to it twisting it so that it caught the light and then went dark bright again in the lamplight dark again he watched it too thinking that it was very like their relationship fragmented by too many shadows ian she said finally not looking at him it was a warning not to open that door he drank a little of his coffee it was bitter in his mouth ive been in sussex he went on do you know hastings the water there is worth seeing he swore to himself it was hardly an exciting conversational opening but it was the best he could do in the circumstances is it no ive never been there after a moment as if she too was struggling to find common ground she added ive always liked the sea but ive never been fond of sea bathing im content to sit and watch the tides he searched for something else to say how is your shoulder it had been dislocated a few weeks earlier when a train traveling north to scotland had derailed on a curve killing or injuring more than a score of passengers he had been among the first on the harrowing scene quite well actually i thought at firstbut the doctors were very good and i stayed with friends in order to be near their surgery i quite fell in love with dr anderson he must be sixtyfive at the very least he has a way with patients i wished many times that hed been with us out in france i trusted him and did the exercises he prescribed to please him but i missed london i always come back here her voice changed on the last words rutledge took a deep breath toying with his cup shutting out hamishs warning do you know what shell shock is he asked she met his gaze ive seen it she answered warily he thought he couldnt go on after all he couldnt tell her he finished lamely my sister knows a doctor who treats it in much the same way by gaining the trust of his patients a rare gift she agreed setting her cup aside tell me more about sussex there wasnt much to tell without bringing up the murders that had taken him there but he scoured his memory theres a shop that sells all things military from lead soldiers to a noon gun including a flint knife she was interested you mean worked from flint how unusual is it very old very or so i was assured i bought it and sent it to a friend who wasintrigued by it he has just retired from the yard what had promised to be a pleasant hour had devolved into stilted conversation her coffee was half finished now she took a deep breath ian you know i served as a nurse in france he froze certain he could guess where this subject was heading that he would find out finally what she had seen when he was brought in to the aid station after nearly being buried alive he had been shellshocked barely aware of where he was or what he was saying he hadnt been aware of her hadnt even known she was there until hed met her last year at a new years eve dinner theyd both attended yes it was all he could manage he was wrong there was something else on her mind i went into nursing for a very selfish reason my husband was reported missing early on in the fighting near mons i thought if i could get to france myselfif i could be therei could find him or hear something useful anything was better than sitting at home with no news but i was in france for nearly three years and no one could tell me if he was alive and a prisoneror dead she had never mentioned her husband before this im sorry rutledge said and meant it meredith channing looked at him smiled briefly thank you and then her gaze moved on to the window watching the passing traffic on the street i call myself a widow she went on its moreconvenientin society but am i rutledge asked do you want to be a widow she pushed her cup away its late i really must go thank you so much ian he stayed where he was do you want to be a widow meredith she turned to face him i go to concerts held every year on the anniversary of his birthday i honor his memory in every way i can im close to his family and visit them often her eyes filled with tears and she looked away but its you i dream about ian and i cant go on living with that guilt before he could respond or stop her she had risen and was walking swiftly toward the hotel doors head down so that no one could see her face he started to follow and realized at once that it was the wrong thing to do a public hotel was not the place for a scene the waiter came to the table to ask if there was anything else that rutledge wanted watching meredith pass by the window on her way to her motorcar rutledge answered without looking up a whisky he said if you have it hamish said it doesna matter if shes a widow or no you couldna tell her the truth and those words were to follow him home echoing in his head he realized that it didnt matter how hed come to feel about meredith channing or how she felt about her own circumstances in the end there was nothing for either one of them t he next morning he stared at the paperwork on his desk awaiting his attention and decided he couldnt face it instead he drew out of his pocket the information he had collected about the flint knife and considered it charles henry that was the name of the man who had claimed his grandfather had found the knife in his back garden in east anglia miles away if it was true what had decided charles henry to sell it to a shop in hastings why not offer it to a museum or if it was money he was after there must be a dozen other places that would be interested in the knife in london for one why a small shop on a back street in hastings unless charles henry lived nearby cummins had been right it was hard to put the case out of his mind and the more rutledge seemed to learn the more the puzzle pulled at him and how to go about finding this man after so much time had passed he could have died gone to war or immigrated to australia the odd thing was charles henry sounded as if someone had given his christian names not his surname charles henry blake charles henry browning charles henry tennyson or perhaps it was simply charles henry and whatif anything at alldid charles henrys grandfather have to do with harvey wheeler the man who was found dead at stonehenge probably nothing at all rutledge drew pen and paper toward him and wrote a note to chief inspector cummins giving him the details that the proprietor of the military shop had provided he added this will provide enough information to lead you to no possible conclusions but should keep your mind busy for a few days guessing at answers he signed it put it in an envelope stamped it and set it aside for mail collection but he was unsatisfied and went down into the bowels of the yard to find the file that was stored there there was nothing more of interest in the folderduring their conversation cummins had given him a thorough summary of all the details all the same rutledge sat there studying the face of harvey wheeler in the photograph attached to the file what sort of person had he been in life the dead eyes told rutledge very little beyond their color and there was nothing in the face to indicate greed or kindness passion or cruelty honesty or slyness all expression had been smoothed away and yet there were details if one looked closely the eyes were wide set the jawline firm the nose straight the ears well shaped a pleasing face structurally hamish said ye canna be sure but dress him well and hed pass for a gentleman and that would be useful if the man had set out to swindle women of their life savings the appearance of trustworthiness at least if nothing else the police in kirkwall and in edinburgh had identified the likeness as wheelers but what if they were wrong they hadnt seen the man for several years after all hamish said ye ken two constabularies canna be wrong yes and that was the assumption that everyone had made they couldnt be wrong what if wheeler after his second brush with the police in edinburgh had turned himself around and lived an exemplary life thereafter it was not likely given his predilection for finding himself in trouble but stranger things had happened men sometimes married a woman for whom they were willing and even eager to change or had a child for whom a man would rethink his past and decide that being a proper father was worth the effort it entailed to transform himself into a hardworking honest citizen even an encounter with the church could make a difference sometimes or quite simply harvey wheeler might have fallen under the wheels of a lorry or taken ill of pneumonia and died in a charity ward an unknown consigned to a paupers grave aye but he died on yon sacrifice stone but what if he hadnt still chief inspector cummins was a seasoned and clever policeman if he had found no trace of wheeler then possibly there was none to be found verra like yon inquiry in hastings rutledge tried to ignore the comment if the dead man wasnt wheeler it would mean starting the inquiry at the very beginningso many years after the fact with witness memories uncertain with evidence tainted or lost with no assurance that any resulting conviction would be any more correct than the initial one person or persons unknown cummins had been obsessed because the answers were out of his reach it was the blot on his copybook a personal failure that he couldnt quite accept but by the same token rutledge reminded himself a man had died violently and the person or persons unknown who had killed him had escaped the workings of the law he closed the folder and put it aside to be returned to the files where old cases were kept setting his teeth he reached for the first of the reports awaiting his attention refusing to think about what was happening in sussex but hamishs remark about the murders in hastings still rankled and there was nothing he could do about it a trial in which rutledge was to give evidence was unexpectedly returned to the court docket after a long postponement and he was summoned to winchester the next morning sergeant gibson brought him word shortly after two oclock in the afternoon he left at once to pack and drove through the golden light of late evening to the hotel room reserved for him there was time after breakfast before he was scheduled to begin his testimony and he walked in the cathedral precincts for half an hour the constable who was sent to fetch him was an older man gray and stout as they walked back to the courts rutledge said do you recall the man who was found murdered at stonehenge in the case was never solved constable gregg frowned my good lord sir i havent thought of it these dozen years or more how did you come to know about it i knew the inspector who headed the inquiry he retired recently he was a good man if anyone could have found an answer it was him the salisbury police were first on the scene were they not it was a question designed to draw out his companion it was a winchester man constable dutton he was on his way back from giving evidence in a trial on his bicycle mind you and he had a flat by the time hed walked to the next village and managed to get the tire mended it was after dawn the people celebrating the summer solstice had sent someone to walk to the nearest villagethey happened to be one and the same this mans name was taylor clerk in a bank hed been sick at least twice and nearly fell flat on his face when he saw dutton coming toward him all he could manage to say was a body at stonehenge so dutton pedaled off and there it was hanging on that stone at the end of the avenue and a group of wouldbe druids were sitting on the grass looking like they wished they were back at home in their beds dutton didnt know whether to stay at the stones and send someone out on his bicycle or go himself in the end he sent the schoolmaster for help thats when it was turned over to salisbury all the witnesses were interviewed two and three times but they never saw anything of any use gregg shook his head marveling theres usually something you know you find the slimmest bit of evidence a piece of paper a pencil stub a footprint and it opens the inquiry right up i kept up with the case you see and someone looked into the background of each of the latterday druids oh indeed sir they were all what they appeared to be they had reached the courts and were climbing the stairs to the room where rutledges case was being tried as he stood there waiting to be called rutledge said was there a charles henry among the druids charles henry not precisely among the druids constable gregg replied i believe that was the name of the solicitor the schoolmaster sent for yes charles henry he was he turned as the door opened and the summons came rutledge was still looking toward gregg but he was moving away nodding as if to wish him well he had no choice but to walk on seeing the sea of faces turned his way in the crowded courtroom the judge in crimson and the kc in black their wigs properly appended to their heads and the prisoner in the dock his expression taut with concern rutledge moved to the witness box fighting to clear his mind of cumminss obsession which was fast becoming his own and to dredge up the facts in this case as he was taking the oath he felt the calm of duty settle over him and as he stated his name and rank as hed done so many times in this box he was ready for the first question half an hour later crossexamined and finally dismissed rutledge left the courtroom and went in search of constable gregg but he was told the man had been sent for and was on his way to take down a witnesss statement in another case the trial dragged on into the second day as the crown rested its case and the defense presented its view of events at long last the jury was sequestered and rutledge was free to go he could spare the time the days were long and so he drove on to salisbury in search of charles henry solicitor but it was as hed expected if the solicitor had been there in he was not there now rutledge asked at chambers he passed as he went up and down several streets and even stopped in the main police station the answer was the same no one recalled the name or the man himself it had been fifteen years and henry had played only a minor role in the case hamish said did he sell yon knife in hastings how did he come to have it rutledge countered no theres something else at work here i think he should have been on his way to london an hour or more ago but it had been important to track down charles henry if he could he walked back to where hed left his motorcar feeling unsatisfied but it hadnt been his case it had been someone elses still charles henry rankled he arrived in london later than anticipated held up by an overturned lorry blocking the trunk road and stopped by the yard to leave his notes on the case in which hed given evidence there was a message on the blotter waiting for him chief inspector hubbard wished to see him the note had been amended at the bottom indicating hed come looking for rutledge a second time my office please eight oclock in the morning rutledge knew hubbard had spoken to him from time to time but had never worked with him on an inquiry he had a reputation for strict adherence to rules a strong sense of fairness and a razorsharp mind it would be a refreshing change from chief superintendent bowles the next morning he arrived at the yard fifteen minutes before time and as it happened met chief inspector hubbard on the stairs he was a man in his late forties what he called the sunny side of fifty still very fit his manner brisk youre prompt hubbard said come with me well get started how was the case in winchester the jury was still out when i left but at a guess the crown expects them to see matters its way the evidence was clear solid thats what i like to hear i daresay the results will be in today they had reached hubbards office and rutledge was offered a chair hubbard set his hat on the top of the taller file cabinet and sat down at his desk he took a deep breath and said i hear that inquiry in sussex is a sticky one whoever the killer is hes clever nothing is what you expect it to be but id started ruling out possibilities when i was sent for constable walker is a sound man hell bring my replacement up to speed very quickly hubbard nodded then picked up a folder hed put to one side on his desk he opened it read the contents as if to familiarize himself with them and then set it down ive been informed that inspector mickelson is preparing to make an arrest in these murders possibly as we speak his comment casually spoken caught rutledge completely off guard im glad to hear that he said sincerely it was touch and go whether wed find the killer before he struck again can you tell me who it is yes one carl hopkins a german sympathizer i believe if hed been surprised before rutledge was stunned now hopkins i was about to interview him when i was taken off the case hardly a german sympathizeri was led to believe he was distraught because of what had happened during the war to his younger brother and his cousin yes well according to inspector mickelson hes good with his hands and obviously was able to counterfeit those identity discs to throw the police off how did inspector mickelson come to suspect him apparently mickelson drew up a list with walkers help of all the people youd spoken with and went back to interview them someone at the hotel remembered the owner of the chair firm calling on you mr kenton was very reluctant to discuss the conversation hed had with youhes related to hopkins i believebut in the end inspector mickelson threatened him with a night in gaol to rethink his reluctance and he gave a brief explanation of what had brought him to you in the first place rutledge didnt argue the matter he hadnt been therehe hadnt spoken to carl hopkins nevertheless the mans motive was plausible and it made sense that someone known to the victims could walk up to them in the dark without arousing suspicion or fear he wished he could put a face to hopkins to weigh what hed seen for himself against mickelsons certainty after all it had begun as his inquiry he still felt a responsibility for its outcome thank you for telling me sir inspector mickelson is to be congratulated hubbard said yes after a moment rutledge said i should like to have a day or two of leave for personal business would you have any objection to that not at all youre between cases i see no harm in taking a little time thank you sir he started to rise but hubbard motioned him to sit where he was we havent discussed the matter about which id summoned you rutledge sat down again his hat on his knee and waited the woman who reported you for misconduct a mrs farrellsmith i believe yes sir rutledge replied hed had no warning not from sergeant gibson not from curious stares or people turning away as he passed not even from his usually acute intuition but of course hed seen no one last night when he came into the yard only a skeleton night staff was on duty since there was no major london case on the docket that required every available man hubbards voice was chilly as he said i understand from sergeant gibson that you were interested in learning more details concerning her background was that a personal issue rutledge personal he repeated staring at hubbard hardly her late husband had known one of the possible suspects in the murders this was before the war i was curious about the suspects background and id hoped that she could tell me something about him even secondhand it could have been useful she refused got angry with me and i wondered why when i first met mrs farrellsmith she seemed to believe id come to see her about that suspect but i hadnt whats more she had objected to the yard being brought into the inquiry to start with any good policeman would begin to consider what if anything was behind her attitude three men were already dead the fourth victim would be found shortly most people would be eager to help us find that killer sergeant gibson tells me he warned you that she was complaining of your conduct but you still insisted that he find out what he could about mrs farrellsmiths husband her complaints were in my opinion a matter for the yard to deal with i needed information that i could use to pursue a killer not to coerce her into dropping her complaint rutledge opened his mouth and shut it again finally he said thats absurd is it sergeant gibson came to meand rightly sowhen he discovered that mrs farrellsmiths husband had died under suspicious circumstances she was cleared in the matter i was told he died in a fall i dont think thats any of your concern the point im trying to make is that it smacks of impropriety for you to be investigating the woman who filed the complaint about your behavior you also brought sergeant gibsons conduct into question by asking him to do something that he felt was unwise it wasnt my conduct rutledge said tightly she wanted me off the case and she was right the new man sent to eastfield has found the murderer in a very short time and this german hopkins has nothing to do with mrs farrellsmith or her late husband are you impugning inspector mickelsons ability to conduct this inquiry there was anger in chief inspector hubbards blue eyes and his tone was decidedly cold now perhaps if youd kept your objectivity none of this would have happened rutledge regarded him for a moment and then he said quietly we are getting nowhere what do you intend to do chief inspector hubbard realized that hed made a mistake he grimly got his temper in check then said you should take that day or two of leave coming to you while this is sorted out rutledge said nothing ian you asked for it yourself this is for your own good i quite take your point that you werent aware of mrs farrellsmiths complaint when you telephoned sergeant gibson and asked to know more about her background its the perception of impropriety here but hamish was reminding him that gibson had warned him about the complaint and he hadnt listened he had not in fact expected the yard to take it seriously then who had and why if you take a short leave of your own accord there will be nothing on your record after all this inquiry has come to a successful conclusion there was simply an unfortunate coincidence in timing in regard to the situation with mrs farrellsmith no harm intended nor done by your request she has been satisfied that you were withdrawn from the case and is unlikely to pursue the matter further suddenly he knew it was as clear as if the words had been spoken aloud but he thought hubbard did not know and that explained why he was dressing rutledge down not chief superintendent bowles hubbard had been chosen because he could be trusted to handle the matter with circumspection and convince rutledge to put the matter to rest nothing on his record just whispers that would never go away and it would not be seen as superintendent bowles playing favorites but it would clear the way for inspector mickelson to be promoted to fill chief inspector cumminss shoes he rose and this time chief inspector hubbard didnt stop him ill notify sergeant mitchell that ive asked for leave and will be away from the yard for the next two days on personal business mitchell was the man in charge of yard personnel records yes do that ian hubbard said cordially relieved to find rutledge so cooperative this will all blow over mark my words rutledge left strode down the hall to find sergeant mitchell and said as soon as he saw him im taking a few days of personal leave ive cleared it with chief inspector hubbard mitchells face gave no indication that he had been expecting this he simply took rutledge at his word the whispers hadnt started but it was too early for that in time they would very good sir ill make a note of it will you be staying in london sir in the event youre needed but he wouldnt be needed that was certain still he answered civilly no im visiting a friend in kent that had popped into his head but the more he thought about it the more he knew it was the answer melinda crawford lived in kent and she would ask no questions she would accept his visit as one long overdue there he could come to terms with what had happened and by the time he returned to the yard the molten anger possessing him would have cooled have a safe journey sir mitchell told him as if kent were in the wilds of africa and it would require days if not weeks of travel to get there but mitchell was a londoner and felt lost outside the crowded metropolis it would have been amusing in any other circumstance but not now rutledge thanked him and went down the stairs and out the door grateful not to meet anyone when he reached his motorcar he swore sitting there with clenched fists on the steering wheel chief inspector cummins had no doubt suggested rutledge as a suitable choice for his replacement cummins was well respected and his suggestion would carry some weight and so the chief superintendent had jumped at the chance to use mrs farrellsmiths complaint to put a stop to that possibility a charge of improper conduct was a serious matter it could follow a man for the rest of his career at the yard but hubbard had given him a way out a way to keep it out of the official record he had thought he was protecting rutledges future what he had unwittingly done was to ensure that everyone would eventually know why rutledge was being passed over for cumminss position rumor would begin soon enough quietly fed from above and most people would come to believe that chief superintendent bowles had in fact looked after his own shielding rutledge from public disgrace it was an adroit move r utledge drove to his flat packed his valise and shut the door just as the post arrived he paused on his doorstep to sort through the handful of letters and found one there from chief inspector cummins he put that into his pocket and set the rest of the post inside on the table where he habitually kept it then turned the key in the lock and walked out to his motorcar hamish had been busy in the back of his mind for some time and he tried to ignore the voice but it followed him out of london and most of the way to kent ye ken hamish was pointing out yon inspector kept his eye on the main chance from the start he was canny enough to study where youd been before him to appear he finished what you werena there to do and so he got full marks for your work all because ye let yon headstrong woman draw ye into a personal challenge mickelson had indeed done just that and would receive the coveted promotion aside from any personal feelings toward the man rutledge knew all too well that he was vindictive and shallow chief inspector cummins had been neither and he was respected for leading by example bringing out the best in the men under him all the same chief superintendent bowles would cover any mistakes if for no other reason than to make certain mickelsons failings didnt reflect on his own judgment as for mrs farrellsmith rutledge hadnt challenged her so much as hed threatened her in some fashion what was she so afraid of something she didnt want him to know or something that she didnt want to become public knowledge he couldnt stop dwelling on events in london and he knew that was because he was still very angry indeed it was a lovely summers day in what many called the garden of england the road unwinding at what felt like a hideously slow pace even though he was making good time he had not telephoned melinda crawford he had intended to surprise her now he realized that he should have been more courteous too late now hed have to rely on her joy at seeing him again when his sister had gone there for a visit recently along with his godfather rutledge had had his own reasons for not joining them the truth was melinda like meredith channing saw too much many years and a vast difference in experience separated the two women but in their own way they had much in common both had lost their husbands at a young age and had had to make peace with that loss was that why he had come here because melinda reminded him of meredith nonsense he told himself sharply melinda had been friends with his own parents and hed known her most of his life hers was a story that had appealed to a boys sense of adventure as a child shed survived the great indian mutiny and the bloody vicious siege of lucknow she had married her cousin against all advice and then after her husbands death she had not led a retiring life she had visited friends all over india traveling on her own finally she had journeyed back to england by a circuitous route that had been of her own choosing a shockingly forward thing for a wellbroughtup woman to do disappointing those who had expected her to be murdered in her bed for disregarding their dire warnings now she lived with her indian staff in a house that had been in her family for many years amidst a collection of treasures that she had readily shared with an inquisitive little boy at length he found himself at the foot of her drive the summer borders rampant with color melinda loved color and often said that she had lived too long in the desert stretches of india where the few trees offered only fragile shade and the land was barely fit for camels and goats when the door opened the indian woman standing there stared at him in disbelief and then said you are a ghost come to bring us terrible tidings but the smile in her eyes belied her words he returned the smile ive come to beg a room for a day or two do you think melinda will spare one for me she will be happy indeed its been too long leading him into the cool shadows of the hall she added i think you havent forgotten your way or must i come and announce you he said i know my way but still i will come with you if only to see the memsahibs face when she finds you in the doorway he tapped lightly on the first door in the passage across from the broad staircase and heard a voice call testily its about time i saw you come up the drive let me look at you and then give me a kiss laughing rutledge did as he was told crossing the room to kiss the wrinkled cheek of a woman who had kept her youthful beauty into old age her iron gray hair still framing her face and dark eyes as it had done for as long as he could remember and giving her a presence that few women possessed she held his hand for a long moment and then said whats happened nothing has happened i missed you your eyes are angry well youll tell me when youre ready im just grateful you are here and ill make the most of it go on your room is ready for youit always isand then come back and tell me about london rutledge did as he was commanded and brought down with him a book hed been keeping to give her she thanked him and set it aside ill read it when youve gone ive missed your company tell me all the news and gossip t he next two days flew by rutledge soon realized that melinda was making it her business to keep him entertained in an effort to counteract the seething anger that hed brought to her door she knew something about men and so she asked him no questions although she never spoke of it he thought shed guessed that he had turned from france with a wound that couldnt be seen or touched or healed what he didnt know was how much she knew certainly not about hamish thank god but possibly about his shell shock for she had worried about him for the past year or more and when he had survived and then found a way to live rather than die she had quietly applauded his courage he found himself telling her about the murder that had taken place in and she had listened attentively saying only on what was his last day at the yard why did this man cummins tell you about such a longago crime i think to get it off his chest he isnt the sort of man who accepts failure lightly no i expect there was another reason youve told him of your own discoveries what has he had to say about them in fact there was a letter from him in the post before i left london he patted his pockets found it and drew it out it was very brief a matter of a few lines he read them aloud my grandfather was charles henry cummins i visited his home as a child in east anglia his garden was his pride and joy what the hell is this all about well well melinda said after a moment i wonder why this man chose hastings to sell his murder weapon rutledge said slowly i dont know ive asked myself that same question it was deliberate you must see that melinda frowned if he went to so much trouble to make sure the knife was carefully documented then he had a reason perhaps it was his namethe murderers or the name of the victim he thought fleetingly of the salisbury solicitor who was nowhere to be found was it that connectionor cumminss thats a fascinating idea ill have to give it some thought but why three years later would a man who had successfully eluded the police and had nothing to fear leave clues that could lead to his arrest a guilty conscience murderers seldom have guilty consciences he told her wryly but if this was a sacrifice perhaps he did rutledge smiled you should have become a policeman melinda the yard would have benefitted from your cleverness oh no my dear the yard doesnt want women underfoot we could prove to be too much competition for men set in their ways her dark eyes sparkled as my late husband could have told you i have no ambitions he left the next morning reconciled to what lay ahead melinda crawford had kept him too busy to dwell on the yardhe had an uncomfortable suspicion that it was intentionalthat she had seen the tension in him and even without understanding it she had dealt with it by distracting him he wished he could have said something to her about meredith channing to hear her opinion there but if he had hed have had to tell melinda more about his time in france than he could bear to put into words her house was in the most western edge of kent and he had just crossed into surrey when a kent police vehicle quickly overtook him and waved him to one side rutledge pulled over assuming that the yard was searching for him he waited for the constable sitting beside the driver to get out and come to speak to him inspector rutledge the constable said bending his frame a little so as to see rutledges face more clearly he was a tall angular man with a scar across his chin yes im rutledge what is it hamish from the rear seat said ware youre wanted in hastings sir straightaway ive been sent by london to find you and bring you to sussex as quickly as possible surprised rutledge said im no longer involved with the inquiry there didnt london tell you that their instructions were to take you directly to hastings if you dont object sir ill ride with you to your destination rutledge said you arent a hastings man no need to waste your time there no sir im from rochester and we have our instructions sir rutledge was silent for a moment weighing that and then said to the constable get in the man nodded and walked around the bonnet to open the passenger door rutledge had expected the other vehicle to turn back but when he drove on it followed him at a distance it was still there when he headed south to sussex at the next crossroads the constable was staring straight ahead with nothing to say for himself whats this about do you know sir im not at liberty to discuss the matter giving it up rutledge fell silent an uneasy feeling beginning to build in his mind this was how a suspect was arrested if found on the road except that he would be asked to step into the police car leaving the constable to drive his there was the charge of improper conduct against him but chief inspector hubbard had all but told him that if he took a few days leave voluntarily it would be ignored what else had mrs farrellsmith found to say about him hed have thought she would have been satisfied to see him withdrawn from the case or had she learned that he had uncovered the facts surrounding her husbands death that was an old case not something that he had permission to reopen but did she know that it was another hour before rutledge drove through eastfield and down the old london road into the old town he hadnt expected to return here now that the inquiry had been successfully concluded the morning sun sparkled on the water touching the tips of the choppy waves with gold and catching the sail of a small private craft tacking down the coast a white triangle against the blue of the sky he reached the police station and pulled in behind another vehicle standing there and the constable accompanying him got out thank you for cooperating sir its much appreciated he gestured to the door this way if you please rutledge led the way inside and the sergeant on the desk recognized him if youll wait here sir ill send someone to fetch inspector norman i know the way to his office rutledge began but the sergeant shook his head if youll wait here he repeated yes all right rutledge said irritated now five minutes later inspector norman strode briskly into the room and said without any greeting of any sort inspector ian rutledge i am arresting you on the charge of attempted murder rutledge stood there speechless and then he was being led away and the constable from rochester was turning to leave what the devil is this all about norman hamish was warning him not to lose his temper and he held on to that advice with a tight grip inspector norman had nothing to say to him and rutledge had no choice but to go with the constables who escorted him to a room in the back of the station they asked him to empty his pockets give them his belt and his tie and his watch and then they wrote out a careful receipt for him there were holding cells in the back of the police station and as he was escorted there rutledge had the impression theyd been dug out of the bedrock because they were windowless and he could feel the dampness emanating from them there were four of them and they looked in fact more like a dungeon than prison cells there was no natural light no fresh air and they were too small to contemplate and before he was quite ready to face it the ironbarred door was swinging shut behind him and the two constables were walking away leaving him there he tried to think why he should have been arrested on a charge of attempted murder and then realized that if anything had happened to mrs farrellsmith the hastings police might wish to question him but an arrest it would have required the approval of the yard to send the kent police looking for him had they been to melinda crawfords house asking for him or had they been scouring the county for him and had just had the good fortune to spot him on his way to london he refused to consider where he was he refused to look at the dimensions of the cell the walls the furnishings he hated confinement and this was the ultimate of that he kept his eyes on the floor and wished for his watch it wouldnt be long before someone came for him he couldnt remain here for very long he could already feel panic rising he waited what he estimated to be half an hour his temper nearly getting the best of him before inspector norman came back to the holding cells and said ill not handcuff you call it professional courtesy one officer to another but youll have to give me your word that youll not cause me any trouble while i take you to my office for questioning theyre sending someone down from the yard but this is my patch and ill do my own questioning thank you very much i give you my word rutledge said through clenched teeth and the cell door was opened without looking back he followed inspector norman to his office and took the chair indicated what are the charges against me ive a right to hear them norman walked around to his own chair sat down and considered rutledge ive told you attempted murder very likely murderits going to be touch and go on that dr gooding holds out little hope when we put in a call to london with word of what had happened chief superintendent bowles ordered us to bring you in he himself spoke to the chief constable in kent where you were said to be staying and the kent police went looking for you now london is sending someone down hubbard i think the name was and who is it im said to have attempted to kill inspector norman said where were you these past two nights i was staying with a friend in kent mrs crawford he gave directions for finding her house and then said again who is it im said to have attempted to kill norman finished his notes and set them aside inspector mickelson was struck on the head night before last and as we have one carl hopkins in custody for the other murders we couldnt look in that direction the finger of guilt seems to be pointing directly at you i was told there was bad blood between the two of you rutledge stared at him stunned why should i wish to kill inspector mickelson he asked finally i understand he was being considered for a promotion that you wanted rutledge stopped himself from swearing thats hardly a reason to commit murder it defeats the purpose in fact i told you when i spoke to london chief superintendent bowles informed me that you and inspector mickelson had had trouble before this he also said youd agreed to a short leave after disciplinary action and walked out of the yard in something of a temper telling sergeant mitchell to look for you in kent if he needed to find you thats to say practically on our doorstep and then you dropped out of sight this wasnt a garroting mind you the case is very strong rutledge it was indeed when was he attacked where i cant discuss the murder with you those are the instructions i received from scotland yard this is nonsense and you know it let me drive to london ill speak to chief superintendent bowles myself and clear it up he was angry enough to face the man down you know id be in trouble if i allowed you to leave norman sat there studying rutledge the two of them had had their own disagreements was he gloating rutledge couldnt tell did he agree with the yard it was impossible to be sure he said after a moment what were your views on the arrest of carl hopkins did you find the garrote when you searched his residence it was inspector normans turn to be caught off guard hopkins he repeated as if hed never heard the name before i dont know enough about the facts of the case to make a judgment dont tell me you havent kept up with events in eastfield especially after one of the victims died right here in hastings you know as much about the murders as london does inspector norman flushed slightly caught in a lie and handed an uncomfortable truth rutledge went on id have done the same in your place id consider one death on my patch reason enough he sidestepped the question there is the fact that the killing stopped after hopkins was taken into custody hardly stopped if you count inspector mickelson and i do he got in the way if you think about it whoever has been killing these men could well have been afraid that mickelson was about to change his mind blaming hopkins would have been very convenient if our murderer had finished whatever it is that hed started rutledge didnt believe it was finished but he wasnt about to weaken his own arguments by adding that mickelson wasnt garroted whats more why didnt our murderer kill you you thwarted him by locking up those village men he broke off it was an admission that hed kept up with the inquiry rutledge ignored the opening at the moment he wanted norman on his side i hadnt made an arrest i was useful as long as i didntmy very presence promoted fear of more deaths and he got to hartle but mickelson did take hopkins into custody and if thats the wrong man in your cell then we havent finished with these murders what we dont knowunless mickelson took constable walker into his confidenceis whether he stumbled on something that either clears hopkins or brings up serious doubt about his guilt either way mickelson had to be stopped before he reported that to the yard if the killer had used the garrote wed have had proof wed gotten the wrong man dont you see there were no discs in mickelsons mouth and that was interesting im not surprised rutledge told him considering the comment it means he wasnt one of the chosen or you didnt have any of them to put there true he didnt argue after a moment he went on i have witnesses you know that i never left kent until this morning very reliable ones in fact someone should have asked about that before having me stopped and brought here it smacks of leaping to conclusions unless your witnesses were sleeping in the same room with you it doesnt preclude leaving in the middle of the night you could have slipped out and back in again with no one the wiser inspector norman countered rutledge said only well see can mickelson be questioned yet i dont think hes regained his senses youd better pray he doesnt die norman rose preparing to take rutledge to his cell when there was a flurry of voices from the sergeants desk in the front of the police station they paused where they were norman undoubtedly believing that chief inspector hubbard had arrived but it was not hubbard the flustered sergeant on the desk came to the door saying i tried to stop her sir but she insists she has information on inspector mickelsons murderer and they looked beyond him to see mrs farrellsmith coming through the doorway behind him she took in rutledge standing there in the passage with inspector norman and said thats the man i saw in eastfield the night inspector mickelson was attacked i saw him drive up speak to that poor man and then drive away with him they were in front of the church and my bedroom window looks out toward the gate to the rectory for emphasis she pointed directly at rutledge as if she were already in the witness box rutledges mouth tightened and then he said are you so certain that daniel pierce is the man were after that you are willing to lie to shield him she retorted i know nothing about daniel pierce rutledge turned to inspector norman this is mrs farrellsmith headmistress at the misses tate latin school if she really wanted to protect someone she could have looked back into the schools records to see if anything happened in the past that could have some bearing on these murders all the victims were together there for at least two or three years if it isnt the war and it isnt the present that caused someone to start killing it could very likely lie in the distant past id prefer to be escorted to my cell now she opened her mouth and then shut it again inspector norman nodded to the sergeant and rutledge went with him already regretting his impatient request he said to the sergeant trying to delay entering his cell am i the only prisoner here no sir theres another man at the end of the row we were preparing for the inquest to be held this very week but it must wait now for the inspector to recover this must be where carl hopkins was also being kept as hed thought and he said under his breath poor devil he went into his cell and watched the door swing shut with a clang and the large key turn in the ancient lock it sounded like a death knell this time he couldnt ignore his surroundings he had no idea how long it would be before hubbard arrived and he was faced with the possibility that he would remain in this place for several days at least until it was certain whether the charge was going to be attempted murder or murder he wasnt sure he could manage it the cell contained a narrow cot a bucket and a basin on a shelf with a pitcher standing in it near the flat ugly pillow a tin cup lay on the blanket that covered the cot what little light there was came through the barred square in the door the walls were painted a dreary dun color that had faded into a shade like cream gone off although the cell was clean enough and the water in the pitcher fresh there was a lingering odor of urine that rose from the floor and the smell of fear that seemed to cling to the walls he hadnt noticed it before hed been too intent on matters being set straight in a hurry nownow his fate lay in the hands of inspector mickelson hamish said derisively yeve been inside a cell before this but always knowing that he wasnt the occupant that when he was ready to leave the door would open and there would be a reprieve from the panic now rutledge was battling his claustrophobia fighting the urge to promise anything if they would leave that door unlocked he thought about the night to come and shuddered then began to pace in the dark the walls would begin to close in hamish cautioned theres no help for it ye ken sit doon and close your eyes ye willna see the door then im going to make a fool of myself he thought when i start screaming and then theyll know but after a time he sat down and shut his eyes as hamish had counseled imagining the room to be as long as the drawing room in melinda crawfords house counting first one and then another of the furnishings and treasured objects that filled the space it helped but only a little against the rising tide of dread a constable brought him a meal later as well as fresh water and he realized it must be noon or possibly one oclock the food was hot plentifulfried fish roasted potatoes fresh bread and peas he wondered if inspector norman was hedging his bets by treating his thorny prisoner with some care in the event the yard had to eat its words the afternoon dragged by and rutledge set himself the puzzle of why there was murder being done in eastfield if inspector mickelson had taken the wrong man into custody the murderer had only to bide his time and then kill again it would have made mickelson look a fool why then had he targeted mickelson what had the man done that had angered the killer from the time that scotland yard had arrived in the village whoever was behind these murders knew he was risking being unmasked he must also have known that dispatching one inspector would only bring another in his place someone even more determined to search him out what had made it necessary to rid himself of mickelson before the inquest rutledge had told norman that it was what mickelson knewor was about to do but was that true or had kenton trying to persuade mickelson he was wrong about hopkins lost his temper and acted rashly something as simple as that he went to the door and raised his voice but only loud enough to reach to the last cell down the passage he had heard the door being unlocked and a lunch tray passed to the prisoner there but the man had been quiet if he had spoken at all it was so softly that the words hadnt carried carl hopkins there was no answer rutledge tried again mr hopkins im a policeman i was in eastfield before inspector mickelson i remember there was a pause why are you in a cell inspector mickelson was attacked for lack of a better idea they think im involved i didnt like the man the feeling was mutual meanwhile im waiting for my movements to be cleared up he hoped that was true its a trick of some sort well it wont do you much good i didnt kill anyone i have nothing to confess its no trick but hopkins wouldnt say anything else and rutledge let it go i didnt kill anyone rutledge sat down on the cot staring at the walls hearing in the back of his mind the distant french guns and then the artillery from the english lines before very long he knew hed begin shouting commands to his men and then he would be lost he wasnt sure how much time had passed he had even lost track of where he was the tramp of mens boots as they formed a line in the trench waiting their turn to go up the ladder and follow their officers into battle had seemed so real he could smell the stench of the water in the bottom of their trench and hear the whispered prayers of men who knew they could die in the next five minutes he was preparing to blow his whistle for the charge when the present intruded the sound of voices drifted down the passage and then grew louder after a moment the constable appeared to unlock rutledges door the relief that swept over him as the door swung wide was almost physical and for a moment he had to struggle with the images fading into the back of his mind youre wanted in inspector normans office the man said and stepped aside rutledge got up from the cot and walked out the door he knew that hubbard must have arrived and when he stepped into inspector normans office the first person he saw was the chief inspector a mistake has been made the chief inspector was saying to him im sorry rutledge stood by the doorway waiting inspector norman said to rutledge come in he pointed to the other chair rutledge joined them but still he said nothing chief inspector hubbard turned to inspector norman chief superintendent bowles was misinformed inspector rutledge was visiting friends in kent when the murder occurred weve spoken to mrs crawford she was quite clear inspector rutledge couldnt have left her house driven to eastfield and returned without the staff or she herself being aware of his absence whats more his leave had been requested before the subject of mrs farrellsmiths complaint had been brought up with him it was an outright lie blandly told shes made a second statement this morning she claims she saw rutledge speaking to mickelson and then taking him up in his motorcar the night before the attack was discovered how do you answer that hubbard was clearly unprepared for this information he recovered quickly she reported this to constable walker norman hesitated not straightaway no had you sent your men to look for rutledge in eastfield after you spoke to the yard i saw no harm in sending constable petty to keep an eye on things until someone arrived from london he shot a glance in rutledges direction then returned his attention to hubbard and mrs farrellsmith didnt speak to constable petty about what shed seen hes still in eastfield norman said grudgingly i dont know she didnt mention having spoken to him chief inspector hubbard said i must wonder why she felt it necessary to leave the school and come directly here to you when there were other avenues in eastfield open to her mrs farrellsmith it appears prefers not to deal with underlings norman said you havent read her statement but youre convinced her evidence is flawed hubbard took a deep breath inspector i shall be speaking with mrs farrellsmith myself in due course but understand this if mrs crawford swears that rutledge did not leave her house as a witness she is more reliable than mrs farrellsmith and who is mrs crawford when shes at home i know nothing about her mrs crawfords veracity is vouched for by neville fitzthornton at the home office on the other hand its possible that mrs farrellsmith has lied to the police before this rutledge smiled to himself the police and the yard answered to the home office he wondered how melinda had come to know fitzthornton but the fact that she did cheered him the thought of returning to the confinement of that cell left him feeling cold inspector norman said my advice is to leave matters the way they are until someone is able to question mickelson then the veracity of witnesses wont come into it and very good advice it is but im told that the inspector is on the point of undergoing surgery to relieve the pressure of the swelling on his brain he may not be able to speak to us at all in the end hubbard got his way by rank if not by persuasion rutledges belongings were accounted for and returned to him as he signed the receipt inspector norman asked what am i to do with carl hopkins it was a question designed to irritate hubbard it failed hubbard said blandly he stays where he is until the inquest and at the moment that must wait on mickelsons recovery id like five minutes with hopkins rutledge interjected speaking for the first time as he accepted his watch and his keys from the constable hubbard hesitated i dont think that would be wise it isnt a matter of wisdom come with me if you prefer but if im to take over this inquiry again i need to know where hopkins stands take overit was understood that i should carry out inspector mickelsons brief rutledge turned to him you know why i was removed from this case you know why i found myself in these straits today you owe me a chance to redeem my character this is not the time nor the place to decide this propriety propriety be damned he turned and walked to the door continuing down the passage toward the cells at the rear of the police station listening for the order to stop and none came he found carl hopkins lying on his cot one arm over his eyes rutledge wished he had had the forethought to ask the constable for the cell keys but it was too late to go back he looked at hopkinss cell it was a mirror of his and he could feel that frantic sense of being closed in sweeping over him again he had been buried alive on the somme when their salient had been blown up by a shell falling short of the german lines the miracle was he had lived through it but lying in the suffocating darkness pinned there by the weight of the body under which he lay and the heavier earth above them both he had known no one could reach him in time he could hardly breathe as the minutes turned into what seemed like hours and then just as the small pocket of air that had sustained him was used up and his mind was beginning to struggle to keep track of where he was in that cold black void help had finally come hands dug frantically the weight lifted and as he was pulled out loose earth cascading from his hair and uniform like water he had seen the face of the man who had saved him it was hamish macleods dead body and the pocket of air that had been a gift of life had been created by hamishs clothing the shock had left him unable to speak and his rescuers had put that down to near suffocation it was not until hed reached the aid station and was given a few hours of rest that hed heard hamish macleods voice in his ear taunting reminding him that his men were dead and he had no excuse for being alive getting a grip on the memory now rutledge called hopkinss name and the man dropped his arm swung his legs to the floor and looked toward the barred window of his cell he hadnt been asleep that was obvious what do you want is this another trick he was a tall man slim and very fair nordic fair rather than english with dark blue eyes but he had broad shoulders and was at second glance a great deal stronger than he first appeared deceptively so rutledge thought were keeping you here for a few more days rutledge told him for your own safety but i need to know what was your relationship with the four eastfield men who have died did you go to school with them i was apprenticed at the furniture works when i was young we were in school together for perhaps three years and then my mother taught me in the evening when i came home with mr kenton at the end of the workday what do you remember most about them hopkins didnt need to think about his answer they were all of an age except for the pierce brothers and good at sports less so in the classroom i was far better in mathematics i remember and better at spelling as well were they troublemakers no more so than most boys he changed the subject im told you hated the english for what happened to your family during the war hopkins got up from the cot and crossed to where rutledge was standing at the door it made me ill for a time i hadnt been able to serve you see i wasnt there to help them id try to sleep at night and id wonder what their last thoughts were if theyd called to me and were hurt that i didnt come i didnt even know when they died until weeks afterward id been living my life talking with friends or workingeven sleepingas they were struggling for their last breath when id see a british soldier id want to ask were you there did you try to save them did you even care some would boast of the germans they had killed callous bastards i wanted to hit them make them suffer too he shrugged it was stupid of me but there was so much pain i couldnt think straight i even considered suicide but when i spoke to rector about what comes after he didnt know all the words he preached and he didnt know what was on the other side what use was it to kill myself if i couldnt be with them again the happiest days of my life were spent with those two my english brother and my german cousin and when people called my cousin a butcher a hun and hoped hed gone to hell i hated them with all my heart he stood there not crying not cursing his shoulders slumped rutledge said after a moment did you hate them enough to kill them i thought about it if id known where to find a gun i might have tried but i didnt i could only curse them all he looked away that takes courage acting on what you believe i didnt have it hamish said he wouldna creep up behind a man and garrote him but rutledge silently answered him not in the cold light of day but after a sleepless night his intent on coming back here to the cells had been to hear hopkins defend himself facetoface hed almost believed the man earlier now he was not so sure hamish argued ye were in yon cell yoursel and no thinking clearly rutledge considered the prisoner he looked older than his years a defeated sallow figure with nothing to buoy him up and carry him through the loss that was eating him alive it was possible that carl had taken his own sense of worth from that brother and the cousin and was unable to find his way alone would killing alleviate some of the pain or would it only add to the distressing burden of guilt that hopkins already shouldered who do you think attacked inspector mickelson rutledge asked the man from scotland yard he badgered mrs winslow and made old mr roper half ill mrs jeffers came into eastfield and told constable walker that the inspector had made her cry wanting to know about the war then he discovered from someone at the hotel that mr kenton had come to speak to you there and soon enough he badgered me too i live alone i didnt have any proof i hadnt killed those men he was a policeman and thats what policemen do when theyve got the upper hand they badger he looked rutledge in the eye for the first time i didnt like him well enough to mourn when i was told hed nearly been killed and i hadnt cared for what i saw of him when he was alive maybe i wasnt the only one with that he turned his back on rutledge and went to sit again on his cot his head in his hands rutledge stood there watching him then walked away w hen rutledge came back again to inspector normans office it was clear that the two men had been having words he could almost feel the tension and their faces were flushed i didnt learn anything of interest he said and with a nod to inspector norman he walked out to where he had left his motorcar after a moment chief inspector hubbard joined him is there somewhere we can talk privately he asked rutledge said by the water they drove toward the stade pulling over where they could the fishing boats were in and the air smelled of salt tar and fish the tall net shops were black against the sun almost sinister and the headland above them was a deep rich green thats where they found mickelson in one of those sheds hanging from a hook chief inspector hubbard told rutledge good god after a moment rutledge said i assumed hed been found in eastfield small wonder inspector norman was unwilling to step aside as it is hell keep probing that man of his petty is very good the fleet goes out very early hubbard went on that means he must have been put there while it was still dark the killer brought a length of rope from somewhere to pass over the hook or he found it in one of the sheds hubbard turned to face rutledge if carl hopkins hadnt been in custodyand if mickelson had been garrotedi might find myself wondering if you hadnt been very very clever he very nearly got you killed twice over if i remember rutledge laughed grimly you know damned well i didnt touch him you also know what chief superintendent bowles was playing at calling me to book for misconduct he must have panicked when he heard about mickelson he must have thought he was next hubbard said only i wouldnt joke about that if i were you he was protected by bowles if id been tempted to kill the man id have done it in london and put his body into the river somewhere east of the poole by the time theyd fished him out there would be no way of knowing how he died where he died or by whose hand they would be lucky to know who he was i might as well have hung a placard around his neck with my initials on it leaving him in that net shop im not that much of a fool and i have no wish to hang then who met him outside the churchyard and lured him into a motorcar assuming that is mrs farrellsmith is remotely telling the truth who found the body fishermen coming for their nets must have scared them out of ten years growth i should think why the hell are they so tall and narrow these net shops a blow to the tax man im told when the town tried to levy new taxes on building footage here the fishermen looked at their long drying sheds and thought why not build them vertically they did the taxes were eventually revoked but the sheds stayed they must burn from time to time or fall over in a gale but the fishermen thumbed their noses at the authorities you havent answered my question about the motorcar hubbard pointed out if its true if mickelson was met by someone then the killer came looking for him he gestured toward the dark red bonnet of his motorcar in the dark that could be red or green or even blue or black she saw the shape of a touring car not the color or possibly she saw the two men talking and invented the motorcar to throw suspicion in another direction why should she do that she could have thought it was daniel pierce shes been waiting here for him to return since before the war and he did come home to stay in eastfield only a matter of a few weeks shes in love with him hubbard asked i dont know rutledge said whether she wants to have him or kill him it depends on whether or not she killed her husband for him quite hubbard said as rutledge turned the motorcar and drove out of hastings as they climbed toward eastfield he added but mrs farrellsmith is not our business at the moment are you certain these killings arent war related im sure of nothing someone knows the answerbut that someone may not realize the importance of it whatever happened it appears not to have made a deep impression on the victims of these murders that makes it all the more personal to the murderer then i should think this man hopkins fits the bill very well indeed from what i was told he held a grudge that no one else knew about they were silent for the rest of the drive but as they were coming down the hastings road into eastfield hubbard said im not comfortable leaving you to cope alone then you still believe i struck mickelson be reasonable man it was a misunderstanding but rutledge remembered the feel of that cell and the walls closing in on him and the miasma of fear and hopelessness embedded in the very paint he stopped the motorcar at the hotel and said ill find someone to drive you to the nearest railway station after you finish your business here as he got out of the motorcar he added ive lost the promotion i understand that even if mickelson lives to clear me you can tell chief superintendent bowles he left the sentence unfinished and walked away chief inspector hubbard had the good sense not to follow him of all the people he could think of who would talk to him theo hartles sister seemed to be the best choice he found her just clearing away the tea things and she said as she came to her door weve just finishedwould you care for some tea thank you no i need to talk to you mrs winslow its a pleasant afternoon will you walk a little way with me she cast a glance over her shoulder i think my husband has nodded off in his chair i ought to be here if he wanted anything when he wakes up hes just had his tea i shouldnt think hell need you straightaway she came reluctantly wheres the other man then if youre back again didnt you hear but he could see she hadnt were not often in the village she explained i only go when i really need something he was nearly killed like those other men she stared at him horrified no someone fractured his skull hes a policeman she said as if that made it all the worse that authority itself had been flouted and threatened with chaos i didnt care for him but still and all she looked over her shoulder as if there was someone following them were all that afraid of going out at night hardly anyone stops by the pub they say thats not why im here tell me about your brothers life he was a bouncing baby thats what mum always said full of vinegar from the start she smiled tears welling in her eyes but he was never in any trouble just mischief that sort of thing i didnt like it when he was teasing me about my freckles but he meant no harm she shook her head teasing can hurt he said it did sometimes she admitted he called them my spots and told mum to wash my face in buttermilk and he tried it once but they didnt go away youve got spots hed say and sometimes id cry mum said he was just being a boy they went away when i was older my freckles i mean and i was glad of it boys will be boys where else had he heard that was it constable walker who had said it rutledge stopped turning to face her did he tease anyone else or were you his favorite target because you were his sister oh they were always teasing one another she said it could be cruel sometimes you know but they didnt mean it to be its just that children see things that adults try to pretend dont exist jimmy ropers ears stuck out when he was small and they told him he looked like a jug and mary wills sister stuttered theyd mimic her something fierce which only made it worse this was in the school yard when the schoolmistress wasnt in hearing or on the way home sometimes miss tate helped her overcome her stutter but it must have been hard to do and there was another boy i forget his name but they tormented him too when no one was about we never told we didnt dare although i said to theo more than once that it was unkind she shaded her eyes to look up into rutledges face boys dont always think do they that words can hurt and the other boysjimmy roper will jeffers even anthony piercewent along with tormenting other children anthony didnt like it but he was too afraid to speak up he was a little younger and not as big then as the other boys could we turn back now i really shouldnt have walked this far they had reached the churchyard rutledge said as they reversed their direction youve been very helpful mrs winslow if you think of anything else will you leave word for me at the police station yes i will she walked back into her house and closed the door on the narrow world that encompassed her life now he thought how pity mistaken for love could ruin lives it was what he hadnt wanted from jean which reminded him of meredith channing but he shut his mind to that memory and went to find the constable walker was glad to see him speaking no ill of a man unable to speak for himself he said after greeting rutledge and asking if he was taking over the inquiry but inspector mickelson was not pleasant to work with i cant think why the yard would replace you mrs farrellsmith complained of my conduct she also believes i tried to murder inspector mickelson walker smiled how would she think that you werent in eastfield that night had walker said as much to hubbard rutledge wondered she claims she saw someone in a motorcar meet mickelson by the churchyard and then take him up if shes right then that someone owns a motorcar very much like mine now thats odd walker said the smile vanished as i remember thats what daniel pierce drives only its dark green i didnt know hed come back to this part of the world its not an unusual motorcar rutledge pointed out but i rather think mrs farrellsmith is afraid it did belong to pierce i didnt think she knew him how well do you remember daniel as a child was he bullied by the older boys or was he spared because he was pierces son if they did bully him it never came to my ears i do remember a time or two when daniel came home from school bloodied and his father was angry with anthony for not protecting him anthony told his father that daniel had deliberately started the fight daniel as the aggressor didnt make sense rutledge said did pierce come to you i was young and green i talked to daniel but he was stubborn even then i got nowhere but i told his father i thought hed learned his lesson i want you to bring in two or three of the men we incarcerated ill talk to them see what they can tell me now before dark ill see that they reach home safely afterward he left walker and went to the hotel where he was given a room he asked if inspector mickelsons room was on the same floor and the young woman behind the desk said heshe wasin number seventeen constable petty and then a man named hubbard were here asking about it id expected as much he said smiling he took his key and went up the stairs two at a time it didnt take him long to discover that his key also fit number seventeen after a little jiggling he opened the door and stepped inside the bedclothes were turned down but the bed hadnt been slept in mickelsons clothes were hung tidily in the wardrobe and his razor toothbrush and soap were on the washstand the towels on the side rack appeared to be fresh untouched where had mickelson gone between his evening meal and that appointment at the rectory gates rutledge opened the desk drawer there was stationery inside and a few sheets had been used to jot down notes rutledge read through them for the most part they consisted of brief references to what he rutledge had done while in eastfield r to pierce r to rectory r to fs k to r as mickelson retraced his predecessors steps in london chief inspector hubbard had mentioned that mickelsons method had been to revisit rutledges progressor lack thereofand draw new conclusions under the list hed already scanned there was a question mark and then the comment kenton says hopkins is obsessed lives alone no witnesses to his comings or goings motive strong enough talk to him again and a later notation gave his permission to search premises not surprising no garrote denies making discs but good with tools could have stamped them out after hours when other employees had left on a separate sheet were listed the names of the murder victims and below that another of potential victimsall of them the men rutledge had kept in gaol while he was trying to locate the exsoldiers whose names had been imprinted on the identity discs shoved into their mouths after death near the bottom of the page was a larger question mark drawn in heavy strokes doesnt feel right mickelson has scrawled just below it what if im wrong and the killing begins again after weve all gone away the final line was ambiguous why hastings ask r rutledge set the sheets back inside the drawer and closed it did the second sheet represent uncertainty on mickelsons part before or after hed arrested carl hopskins they werent numbered why hastings ask r standing there looking down at the street below rutledge considered that r he found it hard to believe that mickelson would have contacted him about hastings who then was the r the rector opening the door a crack he listened but the passage was quiet and he stepped out of the room shutting the door again glancing at his watch he could see that he just had time to call on the rector before dinner but the rector wasnt at home and his housekeeper an elderly woman with a plain face informed rutledge that he was with the elder roper the second victims father hes been feeling rather down since jimmys death rector takes a book and goes to sit with him from time to time poor soul can you tell me if inspector mickelson called here at the rectory two nights ago it may have been rather late hes the one they just found in hastings she said and shook her head i dont know what the worlds coming to has he died then hes still unconscious was he here do you know i leave after setting out rectors dinner she said unless hes ill i live with my sister and we sew of an evening so i wouldnt know who comes to call later than seven he thanked her and left walking through the churchyard as the suns heat dissipated looking up at the church tower and the weather vane swinging slightly west in the light breeze it occurred to him that the rectory housekeeper often knew more about events in a village than anyone elsesometimes including the rector himself retracing his steps he knocked again when the housekeeper answered a second time rutledge said i wonder if you could help me since mr ottley isnt here have you lived in eastfield most of your life all my life she told him complacently save when mr newcomb and i went to cornwall on our wedding trip she invited him inside leading him to the parlor and offering him a chair with the simplicity of someone accustomed to receiving the rectors visitors and making them comfortable until he returned but when it came to sitting with him she was clearly ill at ease perching on the edge of her own chair how well did you know the murder victims i wonder if you could tell me what they were like as schoolboys were they often in trouble or were they generally good youngsters not troublesome precisely she answered considering the matter lively id say thoughtless sometimes as when they set fire to the old mill the fire could have spread you see but it didnt except for mr anthony his brother daniel and theo hartle they were farmers sons and eager to be outside not shut up learning history and latin and the like not that some of them werent good students the elder miss tate told me once that jimmy roper could have made something of himself if he hadnt been the only son and expected to inherit the farm theo was very good at numbers and if he hadnt had such a gift for working with wood i think mr kenton would have made him bookkeeper here finally was the information that mrs farrellsmith couldshouldhave found for him in the school records ive heard he said choosing his words carefully that there was some problem with young daniel pierce he got his nose bloodied a time or two she said nodding but he was a sweet boy nevertheless he just never wanted to be a brewer that was mr anthonys life he was always underfoot there the foremans wife told me once that mr anthony wanted to go hop picking to learn more about them she smiled at the memory his mother put a stop to that when youre older she told him were the brothers on good terms with each other they got on well enough together they were just different mr daniel was always adventuresome and mr anthony more bookish in when there was all this talk about going out to africa to grow coffee i told mr newcomb it was a shame mr daniel wasnt old enough to give it a try but he said if the boy didnt care for the brewery then he wouldnt be one for growing the coffee beans rutledge brought her back to the subject at hand who bloodied mr daniels nose if it wasnt his brother it was the other boys if you ask me theyd band together sometimes and tease mr anthony or mr daniel about their clothes or their accent or their manners mr anthony would ignore them but mr daniel was not one to turn the other cheek i remember rector had a word with him about that was there much teasing or taunting do you think if they turned on the pierce brothers who did the other boys harass people tell me boys will be boys but sometimes its cruelty well beyond the bounds of teasing yes sometimes it did get out of hand i remember that poor summers lad he was overweight to begin with and afraid of his shadow not good at sports his face all blotched clothes never together properly mr newcomb worked on the wormwood at the school one september and he told me the boy was the butt of all manner of jokes and pranks and never stood up for himself mr newcomb wanted to say something to the elder miss tate but it wasnt his place mr newcomb did speak to constable walker when mr daniel got into trouble about fighting defending him like but nothing came of it rutledge had heard some part of this story before from mrs winslow yes as she talked about her brother theo tormenting her about her freckles he asked what became of the summers boy does he still live in eastfield oh heavens no his father was a clerk at kenton chairs and he was made a better offer by a firm elsewhere lincolnshire staffordshire i cant remember just where but he packed up and left there was just the two of them a boy and a girl their mother died when they was very young shes buried in the churchyard here walkerspeaking about the neardrowning of a boyhad said the family moved away do you remember the childs first name i believe it was tommy tommy summers i havent thought about him in years i hope things worked out better for him wherever he went yet sometimes a child was marked and other children sensed it like wolves turning on the weakest member of the pack it was a poor analogy perhaps but it served i wonder if inspector mickelson came here to ask mr ottley about the summers boy where would he hear about him mrs newcomb countered i daresay half the people in eastfield have forgot about him by this time i had myself but tommy summers may not have forgot eastfield or the wretched years hed spent here they talked for ten minutes or so longer but mrs newcomb had very little to add to what shed already told him or hed learned elsewhere and so he took his leave walking back down the rectory drive rutledge asked himself if tommy summers a grown man now could be slowly wreaking revenge on his erstwhile playmates but then what about carl hopkins r utledge encountered constable petty on the high street as he was walking back to the hotel petty stopped saying i was about to report to inspector norman did you take anything from inspector mickelsons room when you searched it earlier today no sir i did not i made an inventory of his personal belongings inspector norman was waiting for instructions from scotland yard regarding their disposition is mickelson in hospital in hastings i was told he had been transferred to chichester theres a man there who knows a good deal about head injuries it wasnt considered wise to try to move him to london no i understand i want a daily report on his condition if youre here to keep an eye on things for inspector norman then you might as well serve me too sir i yes yes i understand youre hastings police but ill have that report each day i think youll find that inspector norman will raise no objections yes sir did chief inspector hubbard leave he found someone from the hotel willing to take him to the station or so i was told how did you get here petty bicycle sir theres something else you can do keep an eye out for motorcars similar to mine but the color scheme may not be the same id like to know where theyre going and who is driving them if theres one in hastings old town that doesnt belong there i want to hear about that as well ill do my best sir rutledge nodded and walked on petty had only one loyalty but rutledge needed his eyes he brought back to mind the man hed seen at the white swans most likely daniel pierce not tommy summers the descriptions differed hamish said aye but ye canna judge how the summers lad looks now and that was an important point as agreed constable walker had collected his nephew billy tuttle hector marshall and alex bullock and they were waiting for rutledge in the eastfield police station they sat on the bench stony faced as if expecting rutledge to lock them up again already resisting what he was about to say but there was new information since he had summoned them and so he asked do you recall a village child called summers he and his sister attended school with you they stared at him his father moved north when the boy was about ten i should thinknot all that many years ago tommy summers tuttle turned to bullock i dont think there was a summers lad do you looking back to rutledge he added he must have been younger or older even marshall said summers there was a girl by that name my sisters age long blond plaits down her back was she the summers girl i thought she was dark they argued amongst themselves but the upshot was they had no recollection of tommy summers at all rutledge said you tried once to drown him as a witch something stirred in marshalls eyes but he shook his head tuttle shrugged bullock looked at the far wall as if expecting more to follow and this was somehow a trick to lull them they were more interested in the present than the past rutledge said someone fought with daniel pierce for defending the boy walker said i remember that was summers his name he pulled out his watch and added its growing late yes all right take them home constable there was no use pushing the issue he watched them go grumbling amongst themselves at the waste of time as hamish was pointing out it was high summer and their busiest months and as if hed overheard the remark marshall said in a voice intended to carry to rutledges ears he hasnt volunteered to milk the bloody cows now has he londoner but there was bravado in the words walker admonished him and followed the men into the street they had gone no more than twenty yards when tuttle turned and glanced at rutledge as if of half a mind to call to him or go back but walker said come along then its getting dark as if he were all too aware of inspector mickelsons fate the sanctity and authority of a policeman had been shattered he was taking no chances being out in the night alone rutledge waited until hed returned reluctant to leave the police station until he was sure walker was all right the constable came in after rutledge had lit the lamps and shut the door with undue haste as if he were shutting out the shadows waiting in the street youre still here then i waited to ask you the same question id asked the others you told me once i think about a boy being bullied do you remember any other details not bullied exactly he was just one who never quite fit in id have intervened if theyd done any real harm he said dismissively they were young lads it happens but words could hurt as much as blows where did the father go to take up his new position did i tell you that walker was surprised north i think staffordshire has constable petty left for hastings half an hour ago he hesitated and after a moment asked is the killing over do you think we assumed after hopkins was taken into custody that it was then inspector mickelsonit doesnt make sense does it which was precisely why the police had come for rutledge but he said nothing walker added i did tell the others to take the same precautions as before to be on the safe side he grinned marshall called me an old woman but his wife told me once its dark hes under her feet well patrol the streets until inspector mickelson regains consciousness and can tell the police what happened did he call on the rector that night before he was attacked or was it a coincidence that he encountered someone near the rectory walker shook his head rector never mentioned it i think he would have under the circumstances ill take the first four hours as soon as its full dark it was the most dangerous time based on the earlier killings ill come for you shall i when its your turn walker opened his mouth and then shut it again ill be awake good evening sir he called finally as rutledge was about to close the police station door behind him hamish said as rutledge was on his way to the hotel it would ha been best to give yon constable first watch or to share it yere no a trustworthy witness ye ken that the ithers will believe what he tells them but no you hes older rutledge almost said the words aloud stopping himself just in time and not as fit and what if theres no trouble atall ive wasted four hours of sleep he recalled his impression of carl hopkins whatever anger the man harbored rutledge couldnt quite imagine him using a garrote physically he could probably have managed it but was there the strength of mind needed to kill four men with it but ye havna seen him in a frenzy only despondent in yon cell which was a very good point there had been three days between each of the murders three days in which a man could whip himself into another killing temper it willna be easy returning to the yard hamish warned if mickelson doesna recover and hopkins is convicted as he put out his hand to open the hotel door rutledge heard someone call his name turning he saw that tyrell pierce was coming toward him he paused and waited for the older man to catch him up id expected you to call today pierce said without greeting him sad business about inspector mickelson but i would be lying if i said that i wasnt glad to have you back in charge what happened anyway you were here and then you werent walker wouldnt tell me anything so i had to assume he knew nothing to tell rutledge didnt answer him directly who do you think attacked the inspector i daresay it was the killer im not particularly happy to be out at this time of evening myself as he reached rutledge light spilling from the windows was reflected in his face there was tension around his eyes a grimness to the set of his mouth then why didnt he use the garrote rutledge asked him yes i wondered about that myself i decided he must not have had it with him well i shouldnt care to be walking around with the damned thing in my pocket in the event i was stopped because i was a stranger in town walker stopped someone just yesterday did he tell you a man on his way to hastings as it happened thats what my foreman told mehed witnessed the incident according to him the man might have been able to handle a garrote but hed have been hardpressed to use it on theo hartle he gestured toward the door have you had your dinner i was just going to the hotel hoping to find you they walked in together and as they paused on the threshold of the dining room they saw mr kenton sitting by one of the windows he looked up at the same time and beckoned to them they joined him and as rutledge sat down kenton said i didnt expect carl to be taken into custody i merely told you about him out of a sense of duty he had ordered his dinner but it hadnt arrived the woman serving meals that evening brought over a menu and rutledge after scanning it made his selection while pierce was considering his choice rutledge turned to kenton i never passed on that information to inspector mickelson nor to walker someone else saw you with me he could tell that kenton didnt believe him i should have thought that what happened to mickelson proved beyond a doubt that carl isnt guilty we dont know if that attack and these murders are connected any fool will tell you that there arent two murderers running loose in a village the size of eastfield carl is one of my best workers im going to have to find a replacement soon and i dont want to do that i wish id never come to you i expected you to ask him a few questions clear the air but that wasnt the impression rutledge had got when kenton first approached him hamish said second thoughts pierce turned to them and said whats this about carl i was just saying he was one of my best workers ive known him all his life i cant see him committing murder rutledge thought that when kenton was speaking to him about hopkins earlier he had been driven by his own uncertainty perhaps even the fear that if the killer was shown to be an employee as well as a personal connection of the owner of kenton chairs it might seem that kenton had protected him pierce said im of two minds there anthony would have trusted him if hed come into the brewery looking for him it was to pierces advantage rutledge knew to distract the police from any interest in his son daniel but would the man go as far as letting another person take the blame he reminded himself that pierce might have attacked mickelson if he had been on the verge of finding new evidence that pointed in daniel pierces direction kenton scowled and why pray would carl need to find your son in the brewery or out of it im only saying he broke off as their soup arrived and then added how is inspector mickelson any news in that direction just that hes alive and holding his own rutledge told them he hoped that it was still true pierce said nasty business i suppose he hasnt spoken yet the question wasnt as casual as it seemed rutledge understood now why pierce had sought him out when hed failed to come to the brewery he was found in hastings im told just as young hartle was kenton put in i dont see why that shouldnt clear carl they argued through the first course and well into the second rutledge was heartily sick of it and then kenton asked when is daniel coming back to take his brothers place hell require some training i should think he was never as interested in the business as his brother was although i wondered if that was only a facade he said to me once before the war that there was no room for him at the brewery and it was all he knew what has he been doing since the armistice new interests of some sort pierce said shortly when hes ready hell take his place at pierces youre not growing any younger kenton pointed out id considered leaving kenton chairs to carl before all this happened now im not so sure if its the right thing to do last thing i heard about daniel he was going into business with someone mrs farrellsmiths husband as i remember but then the man died rather suddenly and nothing came of it race horses was it he was goading pierce using rutledges presence to keep the moment civil rutledge thought kenton has heard rumors about daniel pierce and the fathers smugness has irritated him pierce was outraged race horses good god where did you hear that nonsense i grant you they were at school togetheranthony was there as well as for any business venture they were hardly of an age before the war to be thinking about such matters in fact as mrs farrellsmith can attest she and her husband were only just married and daniel was considering the law as a profession my mistake kenton answered smiling shall we take our tea in the lounge pierce signaled to the woman who had served them its late and i really must look in at the brewery he rose and said good night kenton watched him go hes in trade as well as i am but youd think the brewery set him up higher than the rest of us i never could abide selfimportance you rode him hard rutledge said his son is one of the victims he was prepared to believe that carl had been to the brewery the night anthony was murdered kenton retorted anthony moved in such exalted circles he probably wouldnt have recognized carl on the street ironic isnt it pierce wanted the yard here in eastfield and i trusted the yard to my sorrow rutledge left shortly thereafter it was nearly time to start his patrol of the streets and he went first to his motorcar to fetch his torch the shops had closed hours before and the sun had vanished behind a bank of clouds shadows had deepened along the high street and beneath trees there were already pools of blackness a gray cat trotting past a stationers shop disappeared around the corner leaving him alone as he left the hotel behind and turned toward the brewery he turned again to walk down the side street by the misses tate school and doubled back toward the hastings road before moving on in the direction of the rectory it was a random pattern his ears attuned to the silence around him his faculties alert hamish said its an uneasy quiet it was a warm evening usually drew couples out to walk holding hands in the darkness or men talking together and laughing as they headed to the pub or sat on the bench outside the bakers having a last smoke instead doors were shut closing the sound of voices and laughter in rather than letting it spill out into the night occasionally hed seen a curtain twitch as someone looked out then quickly pulled it across the window again the gate to the rectory was just ahead he looked up at the long window that marked the staircase to the first floor a hanging lamp glowing softly through the glass as he did out of the corner of his eye he thought he saw movement in the churchyard beyond and he turned his head for a better look it was that time of night when objects lost their color beneath the trees in the churchyard were patches that seemed impenetrable they were so thick with shadow gravestones irregular splotches of gray the church itself a stark silhouette beyond he stepped through the rectory gates crossed the lawn to the wicket into the churchyard that rectors time out of mind had used to reach the church the gate hinges squeaked a little betraying his movements but he walked on wishing he could turn on his torch to prevent himself from stumbling over the settling ground and the footstones nearly hidden in summer grass but to do so would mark his progress and take away his night vision it was near that tree he thought using a beech to keep himself oriented he couldnt tell whether someone was still near the thick trunk or if the figure had moved on after a moment he stopped trying to listen hamish said there by the corner of the kirk his eyes were adjusting to the gloom and he could almost swear there was a figure disappearing toward the south porch used sometimes for funerals when it was raining he changed direction and followed nearly sprawling headlong as the toe of his boot caught in something tripping him up swearing silently he reached the corner of the church and paused one hand on the cooling stone it was very dark here the grass and wildflowers heavier under foot he could barely pick out the thicker blackness of the church porch against a patch of sky the hair on the back of his neck seemed to rise someone was there he was sure of it but in the porch or in the darkness on this side of it hamish muttered ware but rutledge was already debating the wisdom of going forward was he being lured as the first victim william jeffers could have been or was the unseen figure as eager to see him turn away as he himself was to go he moved on keeping one hand on the church wall as he walked he was halfway to the porch when he heard the slight grating of the door into the church as if someone had gone inside but he wasnt convinced he thought the man must still be inside the porch waiting for him i know youre there he called softly into the shadows come out and let me see you silence followed and then movement again as if someone had slipped out of the porch and was going east toward the apse but then a footfall on pavement a shoe scraping in the gritty entrance as someone turned back to the porch came to him a trap then set with care for him for walker did the figure ahead of him know who was following forewarned he kept his eyes on the porch one hand still brushing the stone wall of the church his feet thrusting through the thick summer grass with care sinners and saints alike wished to be buried as near to the church wall as possible and on that thought his felt his foot strike the edge of a gravestone his quarry must have heard it as well and this time the figure ahead of him slipped out of the porch and disappeared rutledge continued until hed reached the porch himself he kept one hand on the wall as it jutted out to form the porch guided himself to the opening into the porch and with one hand out before him made certain that the small space was empty he stepped out of it again using its shape to judge where he was going and moved on toward the apse but he sensed now that there was no one ahead of him while he had been investigating the porch the fox had eluded the hounds slipping around the apse and up the far side rutledge rounded the church himself and moved quickly up the north side and on toward the gate in the churchyard wall he had left it half open but it was standing wide now stepping through it he closed it and crossed the rectory lawn again fairly certain that he had lost whoever it was but where had he gone up the hastings road or down it there was no way of guessing which hed chosen and his head start had allowed him to vanish up a side street or into the shadows of a doorway why was he out in the night his movements had been furtive and that boded trouble rutledge turned back toward the fishermens arms trying to recall any detail about the figure that would help identify him tallish he was sure of that and quick as a cat on his feet because he had either known the churchyard well or had eyes better adjusted to the night and then in the distance behind him he heard a motor turn over he whirled but could see nothing not even the flash of headlamps no vehicle came his way and after a moment he was fairly certain that it had disappeared in the direction of hastings there was no way he could catch it up by the time he had reached his own motorcar this one would have too great a head start disappearing into the busy streets of the town rutledge went to find constable walker wearing shirt and trousers his mouth wide in a yawn he came to the stairs in the police station as rutledge called his name im up here whats happened i was just dozing off someone was in the churchyard rutledge gave him a swift account of what hed seen and by that time walker was wide awake ill just fetch my tunic he said and disappeared a lamp was turned up and when walker came back to the stairs and started down them he had his torch in his hand rutledge was already out the station door ahead of him they searched the churchyard carefully and even went into the church there their torch beams were lost in the high ceiling arching over head and the pews were dark shapes that cast long shadows the spaces between them stretches of pitch blackness their footsteps echoed on the bare paving stones as they moved forward in concert the pulpit looked like the prow of a ghost ship and the choir stalls could have concealed half a dozen bodies but there was no sign the intruder had ever been inside even the choir loft was empty whats more there was no body tumbled into the high grass or hidden behind a buttress or a gravestone it took them a good fortyfive minutes to be sure as they were on their way back to the high street walker said he saw you that probably saved someones life but whats this if carl hopkins is in gaol in hastings we dont know why he was here he looked up at the rectory as they passed that light in the rectory stairwell its been burning for some time is that usual no its not walker turned to rutledge alarm on the pale oval that was all rutledge could see of his face you dont suppose its rector hes after my god they reached the gate between the churchyard and the rectory in long strides going through it to the house door walker was there first his fist pounding on the wood panels rutledge staring up at the long window watched the stairs but no one came he said try the latch the door was unlocked rutledge swore mr ottley had far too much trust in the sanctity of his officeor too much faith in the goodness in human beings they went in rutledge took the stairs two at a time calling ottleys name while walker went through the ground floor searching each room he was soon at the bottom of the staircase calling any luck hes not down here nor in his bedroom or in the other rooms im going to the attics but in spite of his torch that took longer than hed anticipated he came back to where walker was waiting hes not here where would he be at this hour at mr ropers jimmys father hes taken the loss of his boy hard to save time they went back to the hotel for rutledges motorcar and drove out to the roper farm the house was dark not even a light in an upstairs room do we knock at the door walker asked in a low voice staring up at the bedroom windows if ottley were here there would be a light showing no lets not frighten the old man the rector must have gone elsewhere he backed carefully down the drive until they had reached the lane i dont know where else to look walker said unless we start a search of the village is he dead do you think rutledge said why would someone kill the rector i dont know that motorcaryou said it was driving toward hastings do you suppose the rector was in it that he was destined for those net shops or the cliffs it doesnt make sense rutledge turned back toward eastfield mrs farrellsmith saw that motorcar just outside the rectory gates she saw inspector mickelson talking to the driver and then leaving with him the rector could know something about that walker argued if he had hed have told you theres that walker agreed the rectory was just coming into view walker peering through the windscreen said who is that rutledge could see the man some twenty yards from the rectory gate he pointed the motorcars bonnet in that direction so that the headlamps pinned the man in their great twin beams walker exclaimed look its rector is he all right rutledge slowed as they reached the man standing staring into the light as if mesmerized by it i was just looking for you he said as he recognized rutledge and the constable in the vehicle but they told me at the fishermens arms that youd gone out ive remembered something i think it may be important r utledge said sharply you shouldnt be walking out alone at this hour of the night mr ottley said i cant neglect my duties inspector not if there were six murderers in eastfield god walks with me exasperated rutledge felt like telling the man that god helps those who help themselves he bit his tongue instead beside him constable walker said ill walk you up the path to your door rector and mr rutledge here will drive his motorcar back to the arms then hell join us id give much for a cup of tea yes i could do with one myself he waited for walker to join him and rutledge watched the two men safely inside the house before driving on ten minutes later he was standing in the rectory study there were not many feminine touches here and he remembered that the rector had been a widower for many years what softness there was he put down to the good offices of mrs newcomb there was even a slender vase of roses just opening out of the bud and the silver tea service shone the rector poured and constable walker passed the first cup to rutledge they had chosen to sit in the half circle of chairs facing the cold hearth but the brass fan that concealed the grate was polished to a high sheen rutledge said after the rector had handed them slices of cake that mrs newcomb had baked for his dinner where were you tonight rector id gone to see theo hartles sister and her husband youd think that being paralyzed also meant being free of pain but its not true and she must bathe him in warm water and manipulate his limbs to keep the muscles from atrophy sister kenny was a strong proponent of exercising wasted muscles sister kenny was the australian nurse who had made advances in the treatment of polio cases that upset many established medical opinions there were many reasons given for her successes none of which included credit to her methods rutledge had seen newspaper accounts suggesting that a nursing sister did not have the qualifications required to make strides in the field peggy works hard constable walker agreed theo was often there to help lifting winslow is no easy task rutledge trying to bring them back to the subject at hand said and this pastoral visit was what brought back the memory you spoke of in the road well it was something virgil was saying that when he was first struck down by poliomyelitis he had prayed to die that he couldnt contemplate living if he couldnt use his legs for the rest of his life and he admitted to me that when i came to visit he was afraid to tell me what it was he was praying so hard for he thought i might use my powers as a man of the cloth to intercede with god and prevent his dying later when he was older he was ashamed to confess his prayers in that moment of crisis constable walker set down his cup i daresay it was normal for an active lad to think his world had come to an end what inspired him to tell you now rutledge asked we were talking about theo and virgil wanted to know if theo had ever confessed to me that hed nearly done something unforgiveable mrs winslow was very upset i told him that he was mistaken that theo had had nothing to confess and virgil answered that he was only curious having just told of his own secret guilt you see virgil sometimes likes to shock its his way of making people notice him to say horrible things and then they pity him and he manages to escape being brought to book for being abrasively outspoken i know there were times when i myself was unwilling to add to his burdens and let small transgressions go and of course as a result hes never been held to ordinary standards i feel responsible for the way he uses his wife she doesnt deserve it did hartle ever confess to you do you know what it was that hed nearly done rutledge asked that was what i remembered just as i was leaving it was as if a light had gone on in my head illuminating the incident it was before hartle went to france with the eastfield company he came to see me because he had something on his mind he said that he didnt want to die unshriven what did he confess can you tell us i thought about that all the way back to the rectory it was a confession though not in the strictest sense and im not sure i was told the whole story but my own conscience was clear on that issue by the time i saw your motorcar coming toward me tonight he looked up at the clock on the shelf above the hearth well its nearly tomorrow isnt it i hadnt realized it was so late rutledge said are you certain you are comfortable telling us what hartle said for it appeared that mr ottley was postponing the moment of revelation as long as he could almost as if he regretted making any mention of it to them at all as certain as i can be but you must promise me that this will not be made public that if it helps you in any way you wont use what i told you in a courtroom i wont have peggy winslow suffer on my account and i have a feeling thats why virgil brought it up i think he was tired of seeing her mourn he wanted her full attention and if he had to ruin theos memory to do it he was willing rutledge said nothing waiting constable walker said for my part i give you my word peggy wont learn of it through me the rector put his own teacup down and walked to the windows the wind had picked up as the clouds moved nearer and the first rumble of thunder rolled through the darkness theo came to me because when he was about ten hed frightened another boy to the point that the child almost leaped to his death to get away from him the story was that theo had played truant one day and cadged a ride to hastings on the back of a hay wain hed intended to explore some of the socalled smugglers caves to see if he could find any treasure this child wanted to go too and theo couldnt get rid of him he called him an ugly little toad pushing in where he wasnt wanted and still the child clung to him theo who was large for his age had expected to pass as an older boy but now he thought that with the other child in tow someone would take more notice of them and send them home with a flea in their ears he lured the other boy far out on east hill and told him that there was smugglers gold below and if hed go down and look for it hed be given half of all he discovered ottley walked aimlessly about the room not looking at the two men listening to his story and found his way back to the window but of course he went on he lied there was no pirate gold to divide the cliff face was extraordinarily dangerous and hartle was hoping the other child would walk too close to the edge and then his weight and gravity would carry him over i dont thinki dont believethat hartle understood the consequences he was frantic to enjoy his day of freedom and he just wanted the other boy to go away at any rate the child found himself out on the very edge became frightened and froze he started to cry begging theo to give him a hand to hold so that he could make his way back but theo walked away and left him there the child finally made it to safety by crawling out of danger and then he was late for his dinner and his worried father disciplined him to teach him a lesson he too was a truant remember gentle god who was the child closing the window finally and turning back into the room the rector said theo hartle wouldnt tell me he said that there was no making amends and the other boy would probably have begged him to keep his mouth shut perhaps he would have perhaps not rutledge said and so hartle for his sins was killed there on the headland and his body rolled over the edge the rector said i know itthe circumstancesare too close to hartles death for comfort i didnt remember you see i dont think i wanted to remember are you certain constable walker asked that the child wasnt virgil himself i think thats very unlikely if it had been then i think hed have said so then how did virgil winslow come to know about this story rutledge asked i cant imagine hartle bragging to anyone about what hed done i mean to say if hartle had gone back to that headland and found it empty found that the other boy wasnt there it must have given him an appalling shock he couldnt have known where his victim had goneover the edge or if he had pulled himself out of his paralysis of fear and found his way back to safety and surely when theo reached eastfield and discovered that the child was alive he must have expected the police on his doorstep at any moment that the boy had told someone a teacher his parents even other children i asked him just that question ottley replied hartle told me that he expected retribution at any moment but the longer it was delayed the more hed thought that the child was afraid to tell what had happened that day hartle felt enormous relief he said and swore he would never again do anything hed be ashamed of besides he had had his own irate father to face when the school wanted to know why hed played truant and youre sure he said nothing that would tell you who this other child was just the phrase he was an ugly little toad as if that explained everything constable walker spoke up do you think it was the summers boy he had spoken to rutledge but the rector said was he still in eastfield i did asktheo told me summers had already left to take up his new position hartle must have lied to you he probably knew thats why summers left here the boy must have told his father something about what had happened hed been terrified after all hartle didnt want to take the blame for that as well his confession had its limits the rector said he was the butt of much teasing im sure a very unpopular child never could put a foot right but do you think he really was hartles victim there was lingering doubt in his voice still theres the problem of how virgil winslow knew i dont think winslow knewnot this story at least i think tonight he may have been whistling in the dark wed asked his wife if her brother had any secrets winslow must have assumed that he hadbecause hed been murdered rutledge added thank you rector for telling us this well use the knowledge to look into the matter if nothing comes of it then i think perhaps hartle exaggerated what happened that with time hed blown it out of proportion and it seemed more ominous than it was the rectors face brightened to tell you the truth i found it hard to believe that young hartle could be sovicious he was a good man he would have made a good father but there were dark places in many a childs life temptation was hard to resist when it was something that a child very badly wanted the ability to know right from wrong wavered in the face of longing the lemon drop at eye level in the greengrocers shop the toy that another child played with the larger biscuit on the plate the biggest apple in the bowl these seldom led to attempted murder but a child who had planned his truancy carefully was already half frightened by his audacity but intent on finding smugglers gold would be desperate to rid himself of what he perceived as an intruder someone who was about to ruin everything hed longed to do in this one glorious escape from authority consequences never entered his head only being caught before he could find treasure would he have gone as far as murder or would he have considered it murder if the boy fell over the cliff without his help who could say they thanked the rector and left warning him to lock his doors walker said as they were out of earshot you let me lie to him the story will have to come out perhaps perhaps not meanwhile what good would the truth have done do you think the first drops of rain struck them in the face blown by the wind great wet drops that promised a downpour lightning illuminated the rectory gate and thunder followed almost on its heels well have to speak to ropers father to see if jimmy knew this story and mrs jeffers i dont know if well get much joy from tyrell pierce anthony could do no wrong the heir and hope walker said as they dashed through the gate and ran for the fishermens arms there was another flash of lightning and then the rain came down in earnest they arrived damp and breathless ill borrow an umbrella walker cast a glance at the sky are we still patrolling the streets no i think hes gone whoever he was then ill say good night he went into reception where there was a porcelain stand filled with umbrellas for the use of guests chose one and with a nod to rutledge trotted out into the rain hamish said yon priest he didna want to remember ye ken these were lads and it was a very long time ago rutledge said aye now they must judge the men the lads became and that was true the men had turned out well theyd served their country with honor and distinction they had respectable lives ahead of them and the foibles of the past were forgiven rutledge said its late theres nothing more i can do tonight are ye forgetting the white swans he stopped in his tracks halfway up the stairs he had forgot without a second thought he went pelting down the steps and out to the motorcar the drive to hastings in the heavy rain was not pleasant and he felt his tires slip several times as he ran down the twisting road into the old town the white swans was quiet most of the guests in their beds he walked into the lounge and beckoned to the sleepy attendant at the far end whisky he said and chose a table that was secluded enough that his presence wasnt obvious as he sat down he remembered another hotel the marlborough in london and meredith channings last remark he took a deep breath trying to put it out of his mind but he couldnt hed tried for days but it was there underlying everything he did during the day and his last thought as he fell asleep at night he couldnt imagine a future with her he couldnt imagine a future without her that was the dilemma there was something about her the poise that was so unusual in one so young the quiet understanding that had seen him through a rough afternoon the willingness to help even when she didnt particularly care for the fact that he dealt with murder and violence her voice low and soothing hed fallen in love with jean because she was pretty she was of his own social class and she was amusing he had slowly fallen in love with meredith channing because she was herself what sort of man had her husband been the war was over had been for two years if channing had been missing for fourfiveyears it was more than likely he was dead but she refused to accept it had she loved him so much and was her guilt the growing realization that she must admit he was dead rutledge didnt know but he was a policeman and solving riddles was bread and butter to him a good many men had gone missing blown up their bodies mutilated beyond recognition by shells and gunfire rotting in no mans land under the summer sun until the black bloated body held no resemblance to the living had she loved him so much the attendant brought his whisky and rutledge paid for it on the spot the harsh swirl of his first taste seemed to burn down his throat and he set the glass aside this had been a wild goose chase if the man from st marys churchyard had come to hastings he wasnt here or if he was he was in bed and asleep where he himself ought to be now but he waited all the same and just before dawn after hed finished his whisky and was fighting the fatigue that was slowly dulling his senses he heard footsteps brisk and male crossing the marble floor of the lobby he turned his chair very slightly so that he could see the elevator but the man didnt use it he took the broad carpeted stairs two at a time rutledge reached the lobby about a dozen steps behind him and setting his hat on his head at an angle that shadowed his face he went up after the man he reached the first floor in time to see his quarry disappearing into the fifth door on the seaward side rutledge followed leaning lightly toward the door to listen a warm female voice said youre late my dear and a man answered but im here now she laughed a silvery sound pleasant come to bed then rutledge looked at the number on the door he moved silently away from it and then walked back the way he had come down the stairs to reception where he rang the bell for the night clerk the man limped as he stepped out of an inner office his face slack with sleep may i assist you sir rutledge said scotland yard you can verify that by contacting inspector norman if you like i just need information at the moment and my request will not fuel the morning gossip is that understood he set his identity card on the mahogany counter who are the guests in number eight he repeated it as if trying to take it in then he opened the book and scanned the entries number eight the guests in that room are a mr and mrs pierce is there any problem sir the last thing rutledge wanted was for this man to wonder about the occupants of number eight and so he said someone in london must have made a mistake they arent the guests i was expecting to find in that room theyve been here for several nights newlyweds im told surprised rutledge said indeed i wish them happiness he turned and walked out to the terrace and down the broad steps to the street the rain had stopped but the waves invisible in the darkness were rolling in with the wind still behind them he could smell the sea and feel the spray on his face he turned in the street and looked up at the hotel facade counting windows and focusing on what must be number eight and as he watched the lights went out and someone drew the curtain wide letting in the sound of the sea rutledge turned away wondering if hed been seen he walked on to his motorcar without looking back daniel pierce was in hastings new town and with a wife a new wife according to the clerk at reception that hardly sounded like a murderer and yetand yet the man had been out very late alone hamish said drily this willna sit well with mrs farrellsmith w hen rutledge awoke in the morning the sun was well up as hed crested the ridge coming out of hastings he had seen the first hint of dawn struggling for a foothold among the clouds scudding east the sun apparently had finally won although there was no strength to it as if it held on by a thread he ate a hasty breakfast and drove first to the home of jimmy roper it was early for a social call but not for the police to knock at the farmhouse door the housekeeper opened it a crack and peered out if youre wishing to see mr roper hes not himself this morning call again if you will later in the day scotland yard its important that i speak to him grudgingly she opened the door to allow him to come inside the passage was furnished simply one narrow table with cut flowers in a black glass vase a portrait above them and across the way by the stairs another portrait facing it looking at that one a man and a woman in wedding clothes he thought this must be the elder roper himself and his wife young and happy and unaware of what the future might bring the housekeeper led rutledge to a small parlor opening the door to usher him in it faced west and on this dreary morning was still filled with shadows rutledge thought he was expected to wait here but as he turned he saw that roper was seated in a chair by the window a rug across his knees his head tilted at an angle that indicated he was dozing mr roper the woman said crossing the room to nudge him gently theres an inspector from scotland yard to see you the man lifted his head and looked up at the woman bending over him what did you say sadie the words were slurred scotland yard to see you i thought the bastard was dead he replied in clearer tones as far as i know hes still alive rutledge answered coming forward so that roper could see him in what light there was i spoke to you in the village shortly after your son was killed roper turned to stare at him so you did what brings you here id like to talk to you about your son do you feel like answering a few questions my son is dead he said flatly whats the use of talking about him it wont bring him back will it it wont rutledge agreed but in remembering you may find a little solace roper was quiet for some time and rutledge had almost despaired of an answer when the man said he was a beautiful baby my wife said so and even i could see that he was a good one too never any trouble well that changed when he started walking nothing was safe hed clamber on anything and never cry when he brought it all down with him more surprised than afraid as if hed expected it to hold a flicker of a smile touched his mouth pride in his son he was a good student he wanted to go on to university but of course there was no money for that he said that farming was changing and we had to change with it or be left behind and then there was the war when he marched away it was the blackest day of my life but he came back like he said he would though it changed him i could see that i thought he might marry and settle down but he said he needed to forget first he didnt say what he needed to forget but i expect it was the horrors did the misses tate feel that he should go to university they spoke of him as promising he never had to study long hours he just listened to his lessons and remembered what hed heard he took after my dear wife there she was a great reader and read to him of an evening in winter i liked listening to her voice she could make you believe the story was real did he get on well with his fellow students rutledge probed patiently oh yes he rose to corporal in the war did you know but he didnt like soldiering very much rutledge had no choice but to bring up names was he friends with theo hartle or william jeffers or young tuttle did he get on well with virgil winslow or tommy summers or the pierce brothers roper turned to look at him imagine you knowing all their names id not say friends so much as they grew up together still theres a bond in that he didnt care much for winslow he said he traded too much on his illness some do you know others never let it change them and summerss name was conspicuous by its absence in his recollections rutledge said what about the summers boy as i remember he left eastfield early on i doubt i could put a face to him now i dont think jimmy much cared for him it was sad you know the girl was such a pretty little thing took after her mother and the boy was plain as a fence post with a nature to match i dont think ive ever met such a disagreeable child jimmy told me he could never keep up and was always whining whats more he could never see when he wasnt wanted was there ever any particular trouble between tommy summers and your son roper shook his head jimmy was never a troublesome child well there was the fair in battle as i remember tommys father had given him a pony for his birthday and tommy was to show it at the fair for a lark jimmy and the other boys painted the ponys hooves purple the night before the fair they thought it would wash right off jimmy said but of course it didnt and they were sorry for that it wasnt meant to keep the pony from being shown they just wanted to see tommys face when he walked out of the barn that morning what did tommys father have to say about this prank he was that upset of course but i said to him they are only lads they didnt know the paint would stain the way it did even blackening the hooves didnt help when the sun struck them the purple showed i sent jimmy over to apologize to tommy and that was that but of course that was that may have satisfied the father but what about the boy and roper answered as if rutledge had spoken aloud tommy was the butt of more than one prank now that i think about it but its all part of learning to get on together in my book the lad just seemed to have the knack for making a nuisance of himself rutledge found himself wondering how roper would have felt if the shoe had been on the other foot but he said only was jeffers one of the youngsters who painted the hooves i believe he was it was such a long time ago and my memory isnt what it used to be i do recall sending jimmy to apologize to his credit i dont believe he was as thoughtless after that it was a good lesson learned what about anthony pierce did he take part in these pranks jimmy said he didnt care to join in but he never told on any of them either when one of the misses tate asked him about some difficulty tommy was having with his books and belongings disappearing jimmy told me that anthony professed ignorance of the whole episode and of course miss tate believed him he was a good sort jimmy said never ratting them out and that had been anthonys sin hed wanted to belong as well and he stood by while the torment went on rather than trying to protect the summers boy or telling the misses tate what was happening many a bullied child suffered in silence afraid to ask for help enduring what couldnt be stopped rutledge was beginning to see why tyrell pierce had sent his sons off to public school in surrey the sons of brewery workers and farmers and the like were not his sons peers farrellsmith must have been more to his liking mr roper was tiring and rutledge rose to leave thanking him for his time the man said his dry thin hand shaking rutledges hes still dead it didnt help rutledge said sadly driving back to eastfield hamish said this was in the past ye canna crusade for justice for tommy summers its too late i dont want to crusade for him i need to find out now if hes turned to murder to settle old scores if its old scores why did he put yon discs in the mouths of the dead to put us off the track and if it was he nearly succeeded but there could still be a connection weve overlooked r utledge went next to hastings new town he arrived at the white swans to find that the clerk at reception was not the same man hed spoken to the night before he asked for mr daniel pierce but he was told that mr and mrs pierce had gone out he waited for an hour but they didnt return rutledge went back to reception could you tell me please how long the pierces intend to stay at the white swans the clerk consulted the register the rest of the week at least he said would you care to leave a message i think not id like to surprise them the clerk smiled they should be dining in the hotel this evening rutledge thanked him and then left he stopped next at the police station to ask after inspector mickelson the latest report confirmed that he was holding his own but only just he had come to his senses very briefly during the night but had had no idea where he was or why that hamish pointed out boded ill for clearing rutledges name inspector norman was in and rutledge asked to speak to him norman received him with illconcealed distaste if youve come for carl hopkins youre wasting your time i need your help rutledge told him i want the loan of constable petty we need to patrol eastfield at night and constable walker cant do it alone if you want petty to spy for you you can spare him for my purposes as well ill see that hes put up at the fishermens arms after a moment inspector norman said with evident reluctance he has a cousin there works in the brewery he can stay with him i dont want him beholden to you which hamish was pointing out went a long way toward explaining how inspector norman had been keeping an eye on eastfield rutledge answered thats fair enough ill expect him there tonight it wont stop your murderer if thats whats in your mind even with three of you you cant be everywhere at once it takes no time at all to garrote a man and then walk away its better than nothing rutledge answered shortly there was someone in st marys churchyard last night i followed him around the church itself where i lost him and then i heard a motorcar leaving without its headlamps turned on normans manner changed is that the truth where was it heading which direction did you see toward hastings there were lights on in the rectory as well but the house was empty we searched for mr ottley and finally met him walking toward us as we came back into eastfield from the roper farm he sometimes goes there to sit with the second victims father but for a time we were afraid he might have been the next target ottley is a good man he said defending the rector but sometimes he puts duty before common sense he nursed the spanish flu victims in eastfield day and night without thought for his own safety before that one evening when he was in old town we had a ship in trouble off the east hill he went to the lifeboat station and offered his services if they needed another man hed kept a sailboat here in his youth hed have gone out with them he may be at risk all the same if carl hopkins is innocent im not convinced that these murders are connected with the war they may have to do with someone with a long memory for the past thats the trouble with educating a policeman inspector norman said youre easily distracted by ideas rutledge laughed carl hopkins is your war connection but you havent found the garrote and you havent found where or how he managed to create those identity discs it shouldnt have been hard to do mind you but hed need the same type of fiberboard and the same type of rope as well as the names of men in other units show me those and ill go back to london inspector normans mouth twisted sourly early days he said as rutledge took his leave he went back to the white swans to look for daniel pierce but he still hadnt returned using the telephone rutledge put in a call to london sergeant gibson was wary and rutledge could almost hear the man trying to work out whether the inspector was back in good odor or not rutledge told him what he wanted its a needle in a haystack gibson complained his father went north to work when he was nine or ten years of age start with the war office if he was in uniform they should know where he lived in and unless he has married somerset house wont help us ill do what i can gibson told him and asked how to reach him leave a message at reception here in the white swans but he was not destined to be there when it came through as he was driving to the stade a police constable spotted him and hailed him rutledge drew to the verge constable inspector rutledge inspector norman asked us to be on the lookout for you someone telephoned hastings police from the pierce brothers brewery office theyve found another body rutledge swore all right thank you constable im on my way he drove out of hastings and made good time to eastfield constable walker his face marked by sleeplessness and strain was waiting for him at the police station its hector marshall he said as rutledge walked through the door he was garroted like the others and a disc was found in his mouth weve taken the body to dr goodings surgery he says theres no doubt the wounds are much the same very little struggle left where he was killed as far as we can tell where was he found he raises pigs out on the road to battle he goes about eastfield with his cart collecting scraps people save for him and he takes milk from the dairy herds that they cant sell he was on his rounds before first light and stopped in a copse of trees just north of the turning for hastings it appeared his horse was lame or he thought it was and he drew up out of the road or someone hailed him well never know but the horse is indeed lame a stone in its shoe we found that out when we tried to turn the cart for a better look at marshalls body my motorcar is still outside show me the copse was some hundred yards past the turning to hastings just as constable walker had described it on the far side where the trees began there was a small grassy opening among the trunks and walker pointed to it just there the body was still warm and if you look hard enough you can see the roof of marshalls barn beyond the treetops in that direction he died within sight of his own farm rutledge turned there was indeed a barn roof nearly hidden by the leaves of a stand of trees have you notified his family not yet do you want to deal with that and afterward see the body theyll be wondering where he went well go there first what sort of family did he have a mother who lives there with him his wife and three small children he always claimed he made up for the war years as soon as he got home he was wounded early in and by the time he was fit to return to active service the war was over they could smell the pigs as they approached the farm but the house was tidy and there were flowers along the track that led to the door an elderly woman opened the door to their knock fear in her eyes and then she clapped a hand to her mouth as she read their faces hes dead it wasnt a question when he didnt come home with the cart i knew something must have happened her voice was low almost a whisper ushering them into a front room she added my daughterinlaw is upstairs nursing the little one let her finish she glanced up the stairs and then shut both doors quietly rutledge identified himself im afraid weve come to confirm your fears mrs marshall your son was found this morning in the copse down the road he was murdered like the rest of them i told him i said you mustnt leave so early she pressed her knuckles against her mouth as if to stifle the scream rising in her throat a low moan escaped and she sat down suddenly and then with an effort of will she raised her head and said where is he now my son at dr goodings surgery constable walker answered her he lived through that awful war and now this it was an echo of what mrs winslow had said i want to see him i think constable walker began but she cut him short i brought him into the world ill see him out of it again she looked upward as if she could see through the ceiling to the room above how am i going to tell her in the silence that followed rutledge could hear the faint rhythmic sound of a rocking chair moving back and forth and a low hum as if someone was singing softly mrs marshall stood up ill just call up to her and then well go the rest can wait i want to see my son now they couldnt dissuade her in the end she did as shed said she would she called to her daughterinlaw im just stepping out rosie ill be back shortly mind the soup on the fire then she led rutledge and constable walker to the motorcar and sat beside rutledge as walker turned the crank rutledge had a moments panic as the constable turned and opened the rear door but he couldnt look to see where hamish was he felt the motorcar shift as the man settled in his seat and then he had no choice but to drive on pointing the bonnet back to eastfield mrs marshall sat in stoic silence her eyes straight ahead neither rutledge nor walker could find words of comfort none seemed adequate people on the street turned to stare as they passed rumor had already run ahead of them and villagers knew who was in the motorcar as well as where they were going rutledge pulled into the drive in front of dr goodings house and before he could step out and open her door mrs marhsall was already out of the motorcar and striding toward the surgery she was a tall rawboned woman in a faded apron over a blue dress patterned with small white sprigs of flowers her graying hair drawn back into a bun but she moved with the dignity of a spartan woman preparing to receive and bury her dead rutledge watched her and was moved dr gooding was surprised to see her looking over her head at rutledge and the constable she wished to see her son rutledge said and gooding said ergive me a moment and ill take you back he disappeared and mrs marshall showed no sign that her resolve was weakening dr goodings nurse came out of an adjoining office and asked mrs marshall if she would like a cup of tea before her ordeal no thank you mrs davis ill be all right rosie is waiting at home for me the doctor came back just then and escorted them to the room where the body had been examined it was tidy and hector marshall lay under a sheet drawn up to cover the ravaged throat ignoring the others mrs marshall walked straight across the room without faltering and looked down at her sons face after a moment she touched his hair which dr gooding had combed then she bent to kiss him her voice was audible but not the words as she addressed him she stared at him a moment longer and before the onlookers could stop her she stripped back the sheet nodding at the body as if she understood something she gently pulled the sheet back into place id thank you to take me home now rutledge moved to her side but she walked out of the room without help down the passage and out to the motorcar thanking the doctor for taking care of her son walker was there to open her door and she got in without another word when they had delivered her again to her home rutledge said would you like us to help you break the news to your daughterinlaw thank you no shell be able to cry if were alone she turned to constable walker could you send someone to feed the pigs today they will be hungry by now he promised and with a nod she disappeared inside shutting the door quietly rutledge said will she be all right should we send someone to look in on her later best to let them mourn walker said rutledge turned the motorcar hearing hamishs voice like thunder in his head and as he started off down the track he heard a womans scream so full of pain he winced t hey went back to the surgery but dr gooding could tell them very little more when was he killed rutledge asked gooding said later than the others by a good four hours after the rain ended i think marshall was on his back and his clothing was wet from lying in the leaves his chest was dry of course the killer had to wait for him to start his rounds that may account for a change in timing or the killer had been thwarted unable to reach the victim he had been waiting for i was driving back from hastings close to that time rutledge said slowly im surprised i didnt meet anyone on the road but daniel pierce had walked into the white swans just before dawn broke where had he been its a tragedy the doctor finished after showing rutledge the identity disc from marshalls mouth i cant believe theres no way to stop this madman and what about carl hopkins i thought he was the killer is he still in jail surely the police will have to let him go after this hes still there rutledge said our murderer would have been smarter to let well enough alone and let hopkins take the blame pierce wont like it he was so certain his sons killer was in custody i ran into him just after inspector mickelson had taken hopkins to hastings you could almost see the relief in pierces face as if a burden had been lifted gooding covered the body again my nurse wondered if perhaps hed been worried about daniel having some role in this business she asked if daniel would be coming for anthonys funeral and he all but snapped at her where is daniel does anyone know i havent seen him since just after the war walker said mr pierce hasnt said do you remember tommy summers rutledge asked the doctor summers dr gooding frowned oh yes i do remember him he was a clumsy child and his father brought him to me to see if there was anything to be done some children are just naturally poorly coordinated he wasnt a very prepossessing boy sadly such children are seldom popular at that age and they seldom grow into swans do they nature is often unkind what did he look like do you recall rather pudgy and short for his age sandy hair i think he couldnt have been mistaken for either of the pierce boys then gooding smiled no of course not far from it what are you driving at rutledge said how would you describe daniel pierce the last time you saw him daniel hed just come home from france and he was quite thin he couldnt settle to anything apparently because he was away again soon afterward hes a little above medium height brown hair the description would have fit a dozen men rutledge had seen on the streets of hastings except for the thinness it fit the man hed seen at the white swans i dont understand why you should be asking about pierce im curious about anyone who lived in eastfield at one time and who isnt here now rutledge answered easily there was someone in the churchyard last night before marshall was killed i never got a good look at him but he didnt move like a heavy man yes i see gooding replied but rutledge didnt think he did they left the surgery and went back to the police station constable walker said youve asked a good many questions about this summers boy and now youre asking about daniel pierce have you made up your mind that the killer isnt someone in eastfield i havent made up my mind about anything rutledge countered but if carl hopkins isnt our killer who is there are the other survivors of the eastfield company i asked my nephew just last night if he could make head nor tail of this business and he refused even to consider anyone from the war unthinkable he said hed served with them theyd gone through too much together in france besides if one of them believed he was still in france killing germans hed have used a shotgun thats probably true and i understand what tuttle is telling you battle is a mans testing ground walker nodded well then i asked him about tommy summers and he laughed summers wouldnt have been able to overpower theo or hector or even jeffers people change rutledge reminded him but walker shook his head inside sometimes outside seldom rutledge didnt argue ill collect kenton and well go to hastings to bring back carl hopkins id leave him there a little longer constable walker said hes safer but rutledge remembered the bleak cells and shook his head where does our murderer go between killings he went on we need to find out he can hardly be staying in eastfield under the circumstances a stranger would have caused considerable comment ive wondered about that constable walker agreed theres no derelict building he could hide in no castle ruins or such for that matter no rough land he must come up from hastings or over from battle there you can wander the abbey grounds at will you know still someone hiding there would attract notice what about these smugglers caves in the old town well thats possible not all of them have been explored although boys must have poked about in them long before this and never said anything caves and treasureirresistible my own father told me the caves were still in use when he was a lad i wasnt sure whether to believe him or nothe might have been making certain i never ventured into them it might be wise to have a look if inspector norman can spare the men by the way hes letting us have constable petty for the duration on his terms of course but we need an extra pair of eyes it didnt do a hell of a lot of good last night did it our watch the devils determined and he finds a way the question is why was he in the churchyard if hed already set his sights on marshall rutledge looked at his watch i must go back to hastings im expecting a telephone message from the yard mr kenton came down the street hurrying in their direction i say there you are rutledge he hailed them rutledge turned to him just the man i wanted to see you had a clerk some years ago by the name of summers he left for another position do you recall where he went caught unprepared kenton said what summers my god that was fifteen or more years ago somewhere in staffordshire i think or was it shropshire yes it must have been shropshire a firm of wardrobe makers the name escapes me never mind summers ive come about a far more important matter ive just been told about hector marshall i want carl out of that jail do you hear me i wont take no for an answer i was just going down to hastings follow me in your own motorcar and you can bring carl back to eastfield kenton spun on his heel and went back the way hed come watching him go walker said hes happy mr pierce wont be c arl hopkins was almost dazed with relief when he was brought to inspector normans office they say im free to go has there been another murder then hector marshall kenton said dear god hopkins shook his head when is it going to stop inspector norman said yes its a good question rutledge he ignored the taunt after the formalities were complete rutledge walked with hopkins out of the station followed by kenton i didnt think i could manage another night in that cell hopkins was saying id started to imagine things is there any news on inspector mickelson nothing new kenton said from behind them hopkins sighed looking up at the blue sky and then his jaw tightened and he said do i still have a place at kenton chairs kenton had the grace to look ashamed but he said i never doubted you my boy you must believe me then why didnt you come to see me why didnt you bring me bookssome writing paper rutledge walked away leaving them to sort out the changes in their relationship he drove to the white swans and asked at the desk for any messages there were none after a brief hesitation he went up the stairs to the room belonging to mr and mrs pierce the maid was just closing the door after cleaning the room and rutledge said to her i just wish to leave a message she looked uncertain but he handed her a few coins and she pocketed them almost before her fingers had closed over them ill just be across the way then and she gave the door a little shove to open it again rutledge walked in the room had been serviced and there wasnt much to see it was well appointed in a french provincial style that was suited to a bridal suite long windows overlooked the street and beyond that the strand and he remembered someone opening the curtains last evening he walked over and looked out it was indeed a beautiful view far out to sea sunlight glistened on the water sparkling as the waves rolled inland and the salttinged air blew the lacy curtains against his face turning back to the room he considered it a wardrobe a desk tables on each side of the bed drawers below one could hardly hide a garrote and a supply of identity discs here and risk having a maid or ones bride stumbling over them crossing to the desk he picked up the scrolled silver frame that stood there and looked at the man and woman standing by the white swans that guarded the terrace they looked happy carefree holding hands and smiling for the camera he recognized the man at once a high brow strong straight nose firm chin hed seen him before only not as clearly as here in the photograph the first time hed been standing at reception staring when rutledge had stepped out of the telephone closet and he was the man rutledge had followed to this room only last nightor early this morning to be more precise had he also been in the churchyard last evening hard to say yes possibly daniel pierce looked nothing like his brother a good face but not attractive as anthony had been even in death hamish said the second son second in all things the woman beside him was fair and very pretty dimpling into a smile that made her seem almost beautiful he recalled hearing his sister frances saying something about all brides being beautiful and here it was certainly true at her feet was a little dog tongue out as he panted in the warmth of the summers day of indeterminate breed fur overhung his dark eyes in a fringe that was almost frivolous and he looked up adoringly at his mistress her dog then rutledge walked to the wardrobe and looked inside there was a pair of suitcases without monograms her clothes and his side by side shoes below hats on the shelf above shutting the wardrobe doors he saw the small dog basket next to this side of the bed and in it folded into a square was a blanket handembroidered with the name muffin leaving everything as hed found it he walked out of the room and shut the door the hotel maid smiled at him as he passed and he thanked her again outside in the bright sunlight he decided to put in a call to sergeant gibson and turned back into the hotel but the sergeant was not at his desk rutledge didnt leave a message hed learned his lesson he went back to the stade and looked again at the strange black towers that held the drying fish nets how long would it be before gibson found his man the sergeant was very good at what he did always thorough rutledge debated going to london to see what he could learn for himself but he knew that would get him nowhere and he wasnt prepared yet to deal with chief superintendent bowles or face the curious glances of everyone at the yard the story had got out it was bound to and he knew any shouting match with the chief superintendent was sure to feed the rumor mill he was still furious about the charges brought against him and even if he could rein in his temper he would be hardpressed to pretend that he didnt know why they had been brought because bowles was suddenly afraid that his machinations had led to murder and meredith channing was in london as well he didnt want to know the answers to the questions that wouldnt go away not now inspector norman came up looking with him at the odd black structures youre no closer to the truth than you were when you left and men continue to die are you saying that inspector mickelson didnt make it as far as i know hes not out of danger nothing has changed look if it wasnt carl hopkinsand it appears that he isnt our manthen bring the rest of that eastfield company in and keep them there until someone admits the truth they work for their living every one of them they cant afford to stay cooped up in a cell indefinitely rutledge thought about mrs marshall asking for help to feed the pigs every one of these deaths had created a hardship of some sort its tempting but i think theyre as much in the dark as we are i cant believe that if youve fought side by side with a man for four years you learn very quickly what hes made of it was an echo of constable walkers words why would the survivors keep their mouths shut when one name would make the rest of them safe these murders are as deadly as sniper fire men are picked off at will because theres something none of them wants to come out whats the worst crime a soldier can commit thinking about hamish rutledge said desertion under fire theyd hardly cover that up shooting prisoners shooting one of their officers in the back then why did anthony pierce die he wasnt in their company point taken im glad you were sent back here i wont have to face the blame for coming up emptyhanded on this one thats in your future not mine would this become the case he couldnt solve like cummins and the murder at stonehenge hed already considered that possibility ill let you know youll be happy to come and gloat inspector norman laughed if we werent so much alike we could be friends he turned and walked away rutledge watched him for several minutes then went back to the motorcar the leather seats were hot from the sun and there were holidaymakers strolling along the promenade and the stade the lush grassy slope of the east hill spoke of peace and plenty he watched three young girls flirting with a young man their own age carefree pretty faces shaded by parasols they were dressed to suit the fine weather in white or lavender or palest green if he squinted his eyes he thought he could almost pretend it was and the war was only a shadow to come and then hamish said something and the image was shattered h e went to see mrs jeffers and found her in her kitchen bottling plums the child who had answered the door and conveyed him there went skipping out into the kitchen garden chasing butterflies they can forget for a time i wish i could she said her gaze following her daughter she had auburn hair that had been pulled back out of her way and her hands were red from working with the boiling water and hot jars i have to keep at this or theyll spoil she told him to tell the truth i dont know what good talking to me will do i wasnt there when will was killed and i cant think he had any enemies how could he have he hadnt done anything to be ashamed of he was a good man i dont know how were to get on without him her eyes filled and she wiped at them with the cloth in her hand i tell myself i cant possibly cry any more and the next thing i know im crying again did your husband know tommy summers well tommy i doubt anyone did he was not easy to know i think his feelings had been hurt so many times that he just locked himself deep inside and let nobody else in it was a crying shame how the boys treated him will among them i sometimes thought if he dropped off the face of the earth tomorrow who would care his father or maybe his sister but thats all she sealed two jars and turned to fill a third now his sister i liked a pretty girl and sweet natured she was younger than most of us her mother was dead and i was sometimes paid to keep an eye on her after school id have done it for free if it hadnt been for tommy always lurking about as if he was spying on us i wrote to her for a time after the family moved away i thought it a shame she had such a wretch of a brother but then i was a child myself and hardly knew better now thinking back on it after such a long time i can see that he wasnt nearly as bad as we liked to make out he had this look about him of having bitten into something bitter sour thats what it was i didnt trust him do you still have those letters rutledge asked realizing that he might find the sister faster than sergeant gibson would oh i never kept them after i got married i didnt see any point in it did i we hadnt seen each other in so many years wed have been like strangers when we met with nothing to talk about but the weather and our children but i did think about inviting her to my wedding it wouldnt have worked out but when youre happy you want everybody to know it dont you do you remember how to get in touch with her oh yes it was such an odd name regina summers old well house iris lane minton shropshire i couldnt think what an old well house must look like and my sister said it must be a hole in the ground because tommy the slug would live in a hole she thought it was funny but i didnt was your husband friendly with daniel pierce mr daniel whoever told you such a thing will knew him of course we all did but mr daniels father had money and our fathers didnt thats a great barrier to friendship even when youre young not that mr anthony or mr daniel put on airs it was understood they were different even when they were doing what we were doing as he thanked her for her time mrs jeffers said finding wills murderer is the only thanks i need leaving a brief message on constable walkers desk with a schedule for the nightly patrols he packed his valise left the fishermens arms and set out for shropshire he had fewer than three days to find an answer rutledge stopped in london for clean clothing and found a letter waiting for him from reginald hume im still with rosemary the thought of this empty house filled with maxs ghost was too much for her i think and caring for me has given her something to do im no trouble and i stay out of her way as much as possible the doctors here are trying to persuade me to go to america and a place called arizona they believe the dry air there may help but i dont believe i could survive the journey at this stage and i have something to do before i die just wanted you to know that rosemary is beginning to accept but theres a long road ahead and then he was on the road north and west to find minton shropshire i t was late when he neared his destination rutledge had had to stop and ask for minton half a dozen times before he finally learned that it was the next village over but one he stayed in a small inn that boasted no more than five rooms and the next morning drove on to minton hed always liked shropshire sitting on the welsh borders the river severn divided the rolling land to the north from the southern plains and just below buildwas was the tiny village of minton it looked down on the treelined river and huddled together as if half afraid of disappearing if it spread out iris lane was just that a short track edged its entire length with beds of iris the broad green swords of their leaves unmistakable although there were no blooms now old well house was a pretty cottage windows open wide to the morning air and a line of wash already hung out at the side of the kitchen garden rutledge tapped lightly at the door and a young woman came to open it her face was flushed as if shed hurried down the stairs oh she said encountering a stranger on her step looking over his shoulder she saw the motorcar i thought you might bewell never mind you arent have you got yourself lost she was of middle height with soft fair hair done up in a knot and she wore a damp apron he wondered if hed caught her at the washtub im inspector rutledge from london scotland yard he began dear heaven theyve found tommy was he missing rutledge asked surprised by her shock he never came home from the war well not really he was in hospital for a time but then went back to france in october of i had a letter or two from him and after that nothing she realized she was chattering on the doorstep and said im so sorry please do come in she led him to the front room youre from london you said thats a long way to come to bring me word of my brother as a matter of truth he said ive come to ask you about your brother you lived in sussex when you were young yes and i cried for days when we left i was so sad my father had a better position but i sometimes thought hed left because of something else my mother is buried in st marys churchyard you see i thought perhaps he wanted to leave his memories behind how did your brother like moving across england he was so excited i thought it will be the same hell annoy the other lads and theyll play tricks and then hell be unhappy again and nothing will change it was his fault that he didnt get along with the boys in eastfield she frowned he didnt try im sure he didnt other boys managed it didnt they that onewhat was his namewhose legs were crippled he was the same way never trying a smile would have helped or a willingness to be friendly but tommy surprised all of us didnt he he lost several stone of weight his face cleared up and he got along just fine and i told him its wonderful how youve changed he said the oddest thing thenhe said i had to change and i hated it you would have thought hed been forced to do something awful how did he fare in the war he was a good soldier he did everything that was asked of him he told me he had learned that others wanted to make him over in their image and so he did it for them only it was merely on the surface and they were too stupid to see and after the war he was wounded in late spring of and he went to a clinic in bedfordshire i saw him there and he seemed to be excited about what hed done in the war he was eager to go back he admired the ghurkas those dark little men from nepal he wrote that they were the best at what they did which was killing people he would have liked to be a ghurka officer they had english officers didnt they he stayed in france for six months after the armistice when he did come back it wasnt to minton he was searching for his nurse from the bedfordshire clinic it was closed of course the remaining men sent elsewhere and no one knew just where she was such a pretty girl i was happy for him i hoped he would find her that was in and after that there has been nothing it was as if hed vanished i reported it to the police in buildwas they asked me if i suspected foul play but of course i had no reason to think any such thing he was just missing they were polite and kind but they did nothing perhaps he found his nurse and together they left england hed have told me wouldnt he hed have wanted me to be happy for him her eyes filled i was beginning to think he could be dead people sometimes arent identified straightaway are they rutledge said gently we make every effort to find a name do you have a photograph of him it would help he didnt like being photographed theres one with my mother but he was only a year old she smiled shakily you wouldnt be able to tell what he was like as a man would you and id rather not part with it anyway i dont have many photographs of her rutledge cast about for a better way to broach his next question but there was no way to soften it im curious did your brother harbor any hard feelings toward his schoolmates in eastfield did he talk about them or wish he couldumpunish them for the way hed been treated or didnt it matter after hed grown used to another life i asked him that once he told me it was all right that hed cursed them i suppose it made him feel better but of course thats all it did their lives went on and i doubt theyve given him a thought in all these years he didnt matter as much to them as they did to him you see youll keep looking for him wont you im to be married soon my fathers dead it would be lovely if my brother could give me away he promised to do his best and left she went with him to the door and watched as he reversed down the track regina summers was serene in her certainty that her brother bore no ill will for whatever had gone wrong in his childhood and perhaps he didnt but mens lives were in the balance rutledge stopped the motorcar got out and walked back to the cottage door your father he said do you think he saw how wretched his son was and decided to take him away from eastfield her eyes widened in surprise that never occurred to me for tommys sake oh no tommy never told him about the things that went on at school he never told the misses tate either he thought they would see and they never did why not surely someone recognized the situation after he nearly fell off the cliff at east hill my father was so busy mourning my mother he saw very little and as for the school staff no one liked tommy he didnt fit in the misses tate saw him as a troublemaker and you did nothing she smiled sadly i was too young to understand i just knew that people liked me and they didnt like my brother i was glad they liked me and i didnt want to lose that did daniel pierce take your brothers part when he was being bullied sometimes he did i think it was to be contrary not because he liked tommy my brother saw mr daniel after the war he told me in his last letter he expected mr daniel to remember him and his feelings were hurt when mr daniel didnt but he said mr daniel had changed that he was thin and not himself he thought hed been ill do you know when this was or where may or june of in london i should think he thanked her and walked back to the motorcar hamish said this is a verra fine cottage with yon flowers and a just as she likes it she only needs her brother to walk her doon the aisle no here but if that brother was the killer what after all these years had set him on this road h is route south and east took him within striking distance of chaswell and rutledge decided he could afford half an hour out of his way to call on rosemary hume although hed received reginalds letter his duty to maxwell was personal as reginald had noted some of the sharp edges of the anger that had made her bitter had been blunted and when rutledge was shown into her sitting room he could just see the telltale redness around her eyes from tears shed in the night still she greeted him with cool civility he hadnt been forgiven you find extraordinary excuses to come by chaswell i thought you had been sent to sussex thats a fair distance if i recall my baedeker he didnt take offense i think youll find that wales and shropshire are in your vicinity but yes it was sussex business that took me there she had never been comfortable with the fact that he was a policeman and not a solicitor or even a barrister if he chose to deal with crime at all it had seemed to be a step out of character and out of class relenting she smiled and asked if he cared for tea it was too early she suggested to offer him a drink thank you but no i must be on my way is reginald still with you if you stopped in london to retrieve your mail you will know that he is i posted a letter for him not three days ago im glad he seemed in great distress at the funeral i think maxwells death is partly to blame and his lungs the rest stupid war she said with some heat and where did it get us poorer than we were and the world changed beyond our wildest expectations it isnt reginalds fault that he was gassed he reminded her but he knew what was in her mind that her husbands cousin should have been the one to kill himself not max anyone but max anything but this drastic alteration in her world do you think he would wish to see me while im here hes in the garden you know the way youll forgive me wont you for not walking out with you she rose and held out her hand it was good to see you ian thank you for coming by he took her hand held it for a moment when reginald isgone if you need me ill come ithank you he turned away before she could know that hed seen the tears welling in her eyes reginald was sitting in a deck chair in the shade of a large maple he appeared to be asleep but the painful rise and fall of his chest told rutledge he was not youve become quite the man of leisure rutledge said as he came nearer so as not to startle the ill man this is a surprise hallo ian its good of you to come have you seen rosemary yes just now she thinks ive mistaken my baedeker chaswell is nowhere near sussex reginald began to laugh and it was cut short by a spasm of gasping for breath that was painful to watch when he had control of his breathing again he said im glad you will be looking in on her im not doing as well as the doctors had expected nonsense rutledge began in a rallying tone i saw the doctor this morning doctor bones i call him he is forever telling me that i shant make old bones but hes right its more and more of a struggle and one day it will be over i could be at peace with that save for two things rosemary is one of them and the other i dont want to be alone but i dont want rosemary to have to face it with me ive already promised i know but theres the yard your time isnt your own ive left instructions in a letter my solicitor keeps for me and if you arent here theres another letter meant for you for old times sake im glad you told me i shall be here if its at all possible he rose and took reginalds hand would you prefer to be at home no no i think the decision to stay on here was a good one whether she wants to admit it or not sometimes when i rattle about the place she can pretend that max is just in the other room or upstairs or sitting out here in his favorite chair hed taken to smoking a pipe out here every afternoon did you know smelled like the very devil but he thought it might steady his nerves rutledge said then youve done the right thing he left soon afterward wondering if he was likely to see reginald alive again but hed meant his promise and he would try to keep it hamish was his companion on the rest of the drive back to sussex and they debated the whereabouts of tommy summers and daniel pierce before the discussion moved on to reginald and the war rutledge could feel the tension mounting as the voice grew louder in his ears and he could feel himself slipping back into the waking nightmare of the trenches he couldnt remember much about the last one hundred miles but it was late when he rolled into battle passing the great gatehouse of the abbey ruins eastfield was not far away he dreaded to hear that there had been another killing tuttle or one of the others where the bloody hell was tommy summers he knew where to lay hands on pierce n o one had died in his absence and constable walker was relieved to see him theres no better news of inspector mickelson he told rutledge but inspector norman has asked to set up the inquest without him now that carl hopkins has been released waiting for the inspector to recover doesnt serve any purpose now yes all right and send word by constable petty that hartles body can be released perhaps we can tempt our murderer to attend the funeral service he had said it wryly but constable walker asked do you think thats likely that depends is there anyone in eastfield who isnt well known to you a distant cousin come to visit a mate from the warsomeone we could have overlooked nobody ive been thinking about it id recognize tommy summers if i saw him i doubt it rutledge told him of the visit to regina summerss cottage youre remembering the child not the man he could be someone we see every day but never think twice about constable petty walker asked with dry humor hes a great help i dont doubt that but the man gets on my nerves always creeping about its as if he knows where hes not wanted and pops up there on purpose if there are no strangers what about someone who has lived quietly here for the past year or less a new worker at the brewery a laborer on one of the farms someone at kenton chairs above suspicion because hes been accepted theres the groundskeeper at the school constable walker said suddenly galvanized i hadnt thought about him what is his name where does he come from he called himself ned browning exsoldier looking for work never any trouble kept himself to himself i saw him once or twice in the conqueror but he wasnt a drinking man as far as i could tell when i asked mrs farrellsmith how he was getting on she told me he knew something about gardening and pruning and did what he was told without complaint deferential she said knew his place he was allowed to live in that tiny cottage behind the stables where the coachman lived in the misses tates day rutledge could see another cottage old well house with its long beds of iris and other plantings he had assumed that regina was the gardener or had she just kept up the work that her brother had begun he hadnt thought to ask landscaping was landscaping except to admire the results what does he look like constable walker said with a shrug not as tall as you are as i remember brown hair shaggy falling into his face looked like it had been trimmed with his own secateurs ordinary features if he was on the street or at the pub hed wet it down and slick it back making it appear much darker rarely looked you in the eye but not hangdog more like the life had been sucked out of him i doubt i heard him speak a dozen words an exsoldier but not with the eastfield company no from the north i was told my nephew wondered if hed been shellshocked but i didnt see any signs of that youd know wouldnt you rutledge felt a frisson of panic at the words shell shock as if the constable could see in his own eyes the shame that haunted him he managed to say where is he now you used the past tense thats the devil of it he only stayed a few months and left in late winter giving mrs farrellsmith the opportunity to hire someone else before spring she said it was very considerate of him and gave him an excellent reference that reference where was he going with it he said he had an offer from one of the large estates in staffordshire i didnt know of any but thats neither here nor there staffordshire kenton had had trouble remembering where the elder summers had taken up his new position he had dithered between staffordshire and shropshire another connection they had been plain to see if one had just known where to look rutledge said theres moseley old hall at bushbywolseley hall at colwichpillaton hall near penkridge its possible but is it likely we must speak to mrs farrellsmith then there are two tasks i must see to first he left directly for hastings and the white swans when he got there he learned that sergeant gibson had returned his telephone call as expected but he had left no messages and your guests mr and mrs pierce are they still here im afraid they left yesterday morning unexpectedly the housekeeper told me they were unhappy with their room unhappy with itor had they learned of rutledges intrusion the maid could have said something hamish was an angry buzz in the back of his mind never mind he said far more pleasantly than he felt do you know where they were intending to travel next he left a message for anyone who asked after him mr pierce said he was intending to travel to brighton rutledge thanked the clerk and went to the telephone closet where he put in a call to the yard sergeant gibson was away from his desk rutledge rang off he went next to the police station did you know he asked as he walked through to inspector normans office that daniel pierce was staying at the white swans with his bride was he indeed well ill be damned does his father know i doubt it the happy couple never came to eastfield but that isnt to say that pierce didnt come here to see them how is he connected with this business id find it easy to believe that he had some part in it evidence is slowly but inexorably pointing to one thomas summers the problem is he doesnt appear to be in sussex and pierce is but in his case theres the question of motive why would pierce turn to murder to rid himself of his brother norman said unequivocally then why does he continue to kill norman shrugged the excitement he couldnt have expected that could he the hunt for victimsavoiding the police he was a sapper wasnt he thats perilous work a man can miss danger it was possible it was also possible that hed come to his senses finally and walked away from temptation no word on mickelson he appeared to be awake for a quarter of an hour this morning the doctors sent the constable charged with keeping an eye on the sickroom to alert the local police but by the time they reached the hospital mickelson had slipped into unconsciousness again damned incompetence if you ask me im glad to hear theres been some improvement because you care about the man or because whatever he can tell the police stands to clear your good name ill let you decide rutledge hadnt taken a chair now he turned to leave the room what are we to do about this summers person we must find him first constable walker wonders if your man petty could be summers shutting the door behind him he strode out of the building and to his motorcar even the five minutes hed spent there had forcibly reminded him of his cell if he never saw the police station again for the remainder of his life it would still not wipe away the memory back in eastfield he went to call on tyrell pierce do you bring me news he asked as his clerk showed rutledge into his office not at present i would like to ask you several questions the first is about your son anthonys connection with mrs farrellsmith i had hoped he would look in that direction i wont lie to you she comes from an excellent background and she has money of her own from her late husbands estate there was no fear she was after anthonys inheritance and shes very attractive i could see that for myself pleasant well educated good company at dinner a fine hostess she would have been a very good match for anthony hamish said hes verra attracted to her himsel and it was true rutledge considering him realized that he was still young enough to marry again and have a second family rutledge wondered if pierce knew anything about the shadow hanging over the late farrellsmiths death probing he asked what happened to her husband yes a pity he died so young she told me privately that he drank too much anthony mentioned that hed been at loose ends after he left school moody his temper uncertain he felt that farrellsmith had married before he really knew his own mind about what he was going to do with his life but young men in love are often impulsive rutledge could see that mrs farrellsmith had cleverly sown seeds of doubt about her husbands state of mind if it came to pierces ears that the man had killed himself he would understand why he abruptly changed the subject have you met daniels wife wife where did you hear that daniel had married he was in hastings with his bride and her little dog the elder pierces face flushed with anger its not true i can tell you its not true why shouldnt he wish to marry the war is over he wouldnt be the first man to look for an anchor in his life because the woman he has been in love with since he was sixteen is already married pierce answered goaded and i was glad of that damn it she wasnt suitable and i told him so i thank god on my knees every night that her husband is still alive and i pray that he stays amongst the living until whatever passion it is that my son feels for her has burned itself out who is she mrs winslow rutledge sat there and digested what he had just been told does she return his feelings she did when she was sixteen but i put a stop to that and a good thing too because just before the war she chose to marry winslow im sure shes regretted it every day since then martyrdom is best enjoyed briefly a vicious remark but then peggy winslow had threatened this mans view of how his sons would prosper as he had prospered climbing the social ladder with their looks their charm and their money hed seen mrs farrellsmith as eminently suitable for anthony he didnt seem to know she preferred the younger brother where is he now your son i dont know but thats why he left eastfield again so soon after coming home from france he couldnt bear to be in the same village with winslow he was afraid hed do him a harm and if you pass that on to anyone even constable walker ill tell the world you lied that hamish was pointing out explained why pierce had been distraught when village men began dying hed been terrified that their deaths even his own sons had been random to make winslows death when it happened seem part of a pattern that had nothing to do with the mans wife rutledge said tightly its not my intention to gossip unfortunately i cant walk away from potential evidence however odd or unimportant it appears to be did you see mrs winslows cat pierce asked cat no im afraid not should i have done he gave it to her a tortoiseshell named the damned thing arrow after our firm and told her that as long as she possessed arrow she had his heart in her hands hed found it as a kitten in a corner of the brewery wall one winters night he had a soft spot for cats i never could understand that with any luck arrow has used up her nine lives and has gone on to whatever heaven god reserves for animals rutledge thanked him and was walking to the door when pierce added still fuming over rutledges allegations about daniel i know youre lying to me i can prove it daniel cant be in contact with dogs they make his eyes red and he wheezes and so you may tell inspector norman that this trick wont wash standing in the doorway rutledge said im sorry we had him to specialists in london daniel dogs and chocolates we were warned that either of them could kill him by choking off his air closing the door rutledge stood there his mind flying if that hadnt been daniel pierce and his bride with her dog muffin who the hell had it been r utledge turned on his heel and knocked at the door behind him opening it almost at once before pierce could deny him entrance do you have a photograph of your son he asked the man behind the desk as recent as may be pierce said warily not here at my home why do you need a photograph i have told you daniel isnt a murderer to eliminate him finally from the queue of suspects ill bring it to the hotel later in the day shall i rutledge had to be satisfied with that he asked the clerk starret for the use of the brewery telephone he thought at first that the man would refuse for he looked toward pierces office uncertainly it took some time to reach gibson at the yard and his voice was testy ive not found this thomas summers the army records show that he enlisted in buildwas shropshire he was wounded twice in france he was demobilized in early because he was attached to the details reburying the dead his current residence is still in shropshire they dont have a more recent one ive been there rutledge said hamish hammering in the back of his head to the point that he could hardly think hes not there what else i was at somerset house and after looking up lieutenant pierces marriagethere is no record of iti took the liberty of looking up corporal summerss records i see his birth right enough there in eastfield he was married in brighton three weeks ago to one edna stallings spinster from bedford he put down shropshire again as his residence rutledge swore with feeling hed had the man within reach and hed lost him hamish said he used another mans name and how had he convinced his bride to allow that my friends will track us down theyll stand on the terrace and serenade us it will be shockingly embarrassing everyone will stare daniel is a good friend he told me he doesnt mind as long as we dont leave him to settle up she would laugh and find it exciting to be someone else she had a sweet face shed stared up at her husband adoringly in that wedding photograph was she the nurse hed gone in search of did you by any chance look into edna stallings i did that sir when i discovered who her father was matthew edgeworth stallings shes a little younger than summers at a guess and was a nurse in a clinic in bedford during the last two years of the war before going to live in hertfordshire with an aunt until she came of age this past spring matthew stallings it seemed had made his modest fortune in footwear and the army contract for boots had sealed it hed died of a stroke six months after the armistice leaving a large sum to the national trust and another to a fund for war widows the bulk of his estate went to his only child his daughter it appeared was an heiress well done rutledge told sergeant gibson it was praise well earned there was more he wished to say to gibson but not with half the brewery office staff listening with one ear putting up the receiver he thanked starret and left the brewery constable walker was not in the police station when rutledge stopped there and so he drove on to hastings with all the speed he could muster he caught inspector norman just as he was leaving his office and said there have been developments i need to speak to you not now norman told him ive just been informed that inspector mickelson is showing signs of coming to his senses again and im not letting this opportunity slip through my fingers i can tell you your developments can wait and he got into the motorcar waiting for him one of his constables at the wheel rutledge watched them pull out into the afternoon traffic then returned to his own vehicle for the next six hours he called at every hotel of any size between the white swans and the town of brighton and as he searched he tried to think through this swiftly evolving situation so much was explained now how summers could afford to live at the swans as daniel pierce how he had been able to reach eastfield and disappear at will how in fact he had managed to learn the details of his victims lives where he could find them when he was ready to kill them and how he had been invisible because the lowly school groundskeeper who kept to himself roused no interest in the village there was always a social hierarchy a groundskeeper at the school was in effect a laborer the farmers and their wives the tradesmen and their wives would have nothing in common with him and people like the brewer and mr kenton who felt they had risen above both classes would hardly be aware of his existence though they would know where he worked it was that which gave him his place in the village not his face or his qualities or his hopes and dreams the rector would be kinder the doctor would treat the man and whatever family he had and the mrs farrellsmiths of this world would see that he was paid but barely know his name at each hotel he came to rutledge requested the list of guests scanned them for any name that was familiarstallings summers pierce hartle jeffers roper ottley gooding even his ownand each time drew a blank but of course summers could have used his wifes mothers maiden name or that of his sergeant in france and rutledge would have no way of connecting it with the man he was seeking hamish said go back to what ye know its the only way all right then summers had left a forwarding address of brighton but was he telling the truth there were still men alive who went to school with him he couldnt have finished his work surely he wouldnt have gone much farther than brighton he had too much invested already in his revenge where then rutledge thought about the case that chief inspector cummins had never solved and how misdirection had served a different purpose there it had almost seemed that cumminss murderer had wanted to leave something behind for the sake of his own conscience if not for the police but this sussex killer had no conscience if he had hed have stopped with william jefferss death rutledge looked up at the exotic lines of brightons glory the prince regents pavilion almost foreshadowing that his niece would one day be empress of india why would summers leave such a message the most logical answer to buy time to send rutledge on a wildgoose chase in the wrong direction while he went in another rutledge was already sprinting toward the hotel hed just left oblivious of the stares of strollers along the promenade his mind keeping pace with his feet hed been outfoxed and it angered him hamish pointing out his failure was like a demon at his shoulder could summers still be in hastings new town in another fine hotel or had he turned east instead of west or north it was impossible to guess and what was the man telling his bride how could he explain cutting their wedding journey shortor flying off in an entirely different direction would he suggest that now his friends had caught up with them theyd play a trick of their own hamish said ye ken he left her alone at night he used a false name at yon hotel would she no grow suspicious after a while rutledge felt a surge of apprehension is that what had happened had there been unexpected difficulties over his behavior what had prompted that marriage in the first place was it a love matchor was it the fact that summers needed his new wifes money he hadnt held a job in months and the white swans was one of the most elegantand expensivehotels along this stretch of seaside towns rutledge reached the regency hotel and slowed his pace striding into reception and waiting impatiently as an elderly couple spoke to the woman behind the desk about the availability of rooms yes they had a telephone the woman told him when the couple had left for the use of their guests this is an urgent police matter he told her curtly and reluctantly she pointed to a door just past the desk he put in a call to the yard silently cursing the delay as someone went in search of sergeant gibson while he waited rutledge was already scanning the map of sussex and of kent in his head there was an isolated church st marys out in the marshes near dymchurch one could hide a body there but of course in time it would be found and if it was identified then the police would begin to look for summers that was true almost anywhere else corpses had a way of returning at the most inconvenient of times whether left in marshes or the sea besides if the man wanted his wifes money hed have to keep her alive until he could persuade her to make a will in his favor but what if summers had already worked out a contingency plan leave his work unfinished until the hue and cry had died down disappear into france meanwhile and return at a later date the southern parts of france along the mediterranean sea had been untouched by war though strongly affected by the state of the french economy in general still it was warm lovely expensive and increasingly popular and his wife might find such a suggestion exceptionally attractive dover then and the ferry across the channel and he rutledge was already six hours too late if the kent police could find rutledge himself after hed left melinda crawfords house they might be lucky enough to find tommy summers for him he told sergeant gibson what it was he wanted and then went in search of his motorcar several streets away the motor almost misfired as he turned the crank and he had to start again once behind the wheel he made a looping circle through the streets and drove as fast as he dared through the holidaymakers heading east behind him the clouds were gathering and far out to sea the wind had picked up he could feel the cloying heat that presaged a storm the road ran along the coast for the most part one seaside community after another the congestion at its peak at this hour the storm was catching him up as he drove bits of paper and little swirls of dust marking its progress and before very long the sun was half hidden in the haze before hed reached hastings the sky was dark and the rumble of thunder followed him hamish gave him no peace seeming to gather strength with the storm he paused at hastings just long enough to leave word with inspector norman and then turned toward eastfield the rain found him just before he got there huge winddriven pellets and the lightning was fierce at the police station constable walker listened to what he had to say then handed him a framed photograph that tyrell pierce had left at the fishermens arms rutledge looked at it and damned the man the sun was behind the subjects and he could just recognize anthony pierce smiling beneath his officers cap one arm around his brothers shoulders daniels face was harder to make out and rutledge had to be satisfied with his general build pierce must have spent an hour or more searching through photographs to find one that was so useless he handed it to walker i should have the man arrested for obstruction and then he was gone again driving through the pelting rain and the early darkness he stopped for petrol in one village and to have a tire inspected in another praying that the dover police had found their man hamish reminded him its no certain that hes even there summers might as easily have chosen london or southampton and taken ship anywhere but france was closer and the man knew the country it made sense in the predawn hours when he reached the dover police the skies were clearing the fishing fleet had put out to sea their sails tiny dots on the horizon and the first ferry to france was just pulling out but dover had nothing for him the inspector he spoke with said you realize he could have sailed before you reached us yes yes thats very likely i was hoping that wed been in time he rubbed his face hearing the scrape of beard on his chin all right keep looking ill be at the hotel did you reserve a room yes the nancy bell its run by a retired policeman we try to give him a little business now and again rutledge found it a small inn at best almost at the outskirts of town but sergeant bell greeted him took one look at him and said go up then top of the stairs ill bring hot water and hotter tea he was as good as his word a bluff graying man his shoulders still broad and the line of his jaw firm he carried the tray in one hand and a pitcher in the other setting them down on the table youll want to sleep he told rutledge if theres word theyll send for you here but after shaving and drinking his tea rutledge was restless unable to settle and he left the nancy bell and went out to walk dover sat at the foot of chalk cliffs and was divided into two parts beneath the towering bulk of the castle was the port with the residential area south of it the war had not dealt well with the town for it had seen thousands of men and ships coming and going expanding almost faster than the town could absorb the dramatically increasing population and then the war had ended after four hard years and dover had had to shrink into itself again finding the fit difficult eventually he reached the strand and walked down on the shingle hard packed from the heavy rains of the day before there were others doing much the same enjoying the morning air fresh and cool off the water this was not a bathing center like the towns along the southern coast but he like the others out this morning enjoyed the smell of the sea the wind buffeting his face and the sun just warming his skin he thought that darwin had not been too far off the markmen must remember coming from the sea whether they realized it or not he noticed a dog racing along the strand far ahead running to greet the handful of hardy souls walking just above the tide line he watched it for a time and then it began to strike him as odd that the dog showed no interest in chasing the gulls scavenging for food and starting up in a fluster of wings as humans approached instead the little dog seemed frantic dashing up to someone racing around then moving on to the next walker rutledge started to jog toward it feeling a growing certainty that he recognized it and as he grew nearer and the dog looked his way he realized that it was trailing a lead what was the name on the dog bed hes seen in the white swans hotel in the room occupied by mr and mrs daniel pierce muffin he whistled and the dog stopped ears pricked listening he whistled again and called its name the dog stared at him uncertainly and then came bounding toward him only to stop puzzled as he drew close enough to pick up rutledges scent on the errant breeze rutledge called to him again and the dog came forward slowly warily as if half afraid head down it begged for assurance and had no reason to feel any rutledge stopped letting the animal come to him and when finally it did whimpering belly dragging he bent down to fondle its ears it was the same dog hed seen in the photograph of the bride and groom nestling among the folds of the womans skirts he was prepared to stake his life on it after a moment the dog rolled on its back and rutledge scratched the animals chest and then it leapt up half afraid again and looked past him down the beach toward another couple strolling some twenty yards behind it had been abandoned here on the strand he was almost certain of it and he reached down to pick up the end of the lead if this was the same animal where was mrs summers t he dog refused to leave the shoreline he struggled against his lead and even growled as rutledge lifted him into his arms it took half an hour to make any progress with the animal and even then he thought it was more a reflection of the dogs growing despair than his own blandishments the fact that rutledge knew the animals name seemed to weigh because when rutledge made to move back toward the road the dog stood there whining torn between waiting and going and finally he came forward head down and let rutledge pet him again still it was an uphill battle back to the nancy bell and when rutledge arrived on sergeant bells doorstep both he and the dog were out of breath bell staring at the two of them said and whats this rutledge explained and bell got down on one knee ruffling the dogs ears then led it to the kitchen where there was a little roast beef left from the night before but the dog was back at the door after wolfing down the beef scratching the wood paneling and crying to be let out thats pitiful bell said watching it its known only the one mistress you can see and wants none other she may be dead rutledge answered i dont think he would have left her side otherwise if she were alive shed have fought to keep him with her the sergeant scratched his chin if they took the boat over to france he said thoughtfully your man could have told her that the dog had to stay below and she wouldnt know would she until she landed and went for him that he was not there dear god thats precisely what he did i need to speak to the port authorities and ask them to contact france he left the dog with bell and could hear it barking frantically as he drove away after three hours at the port being passed from office to office he learned that mr and mrs summers had indeed embarked for france on the channel crossing the preceding day at first he was surprised that summers had used their real names and then it was clear why there had to be a record of mrs summers leaving england for france for her solicitors to see later that all was aboveboard the couple happy and still enjoying their wedding journey the harbormaster said it was a rough passage right in the teeth of the storm grinning he added thered be decks to swab after that one made landfall while youre at it ask the french if there was a small dog with them long haired black and gray with some white rutledge added the harbormaster got in touch with the french authorities and was told that mr and mrs summers had landed safely although both were the worse for wear from seasickness the message ended madame was very ill monsieur had given her something to help the nausea and it was not working we recommended an hotel in honfleur and he told us he felt he could drive there no dog accompanied them rutledge left the office still worried the fact that mrs summers had landed in france surprised hima seasick woman leaning over the rail needed only a small push to send her into the sea as the boat tossed and twisted in the storm something was wrong with the picture painted by the french authorities they didna see her hamish pointed out they saw a verra distressed woman and that was true rutledge thought as he drove back to the nancy bell she could have been drugged or she could have been anyone wearing mrs summerss clothing but there was nothing he could do without authority from the yard to have the couple taken into french custody they had left the port by now and were no longer under its jurisdiction and they had broken no laws there was not sufficient evidence to hold summers at all misdirection summers was a master at it rutledge went back again to the dover police and used their telephone to call the yard explaining the situation to sergeant gibson he added i want a watch on all ports for someone coming in under the name summers or pierce or any other on this list and from the sheet of paper hed made out he read the names of anyone who was associated with this case he may return as a single person or as a coupleit will depend on how safe he thinks he may be with an ill wife thats a tall order gibson pointed out something will be said about the number of men required for that clear it with the chief superintendent this man hasnt finished hell kill again ill do my best gibson said doubt heavy in his voice he cleared his throat and asked have you heard what inspector mickelson had to say he regained his senses there hasnt been an opportunity to ask anyone rutledge responded if he got into a motorcar with his killer he ought to be able to provide a description youd best ask inspector norman gibson answered cryptically and rutledge had to be satisfied with that the problem of the dog was more easily dealt with sergeant bell agreed to keep it until it could be used to identify summers or reunited with its proper owner that done rutledge turned back toward hastings he had had no sleep to speak of and he was feeling it but he drove through kent back to the sussex coast by the time he had reached eastfield he knew it was too late to find inspector norman in his office he went to his room at the fishermens arms and slept for seven hours i nspector norman met rutledge at his office door and said lets walk with foreboding rutledge turned to follow him they left the station and had nearly reached the stade when norman said i was there when inspector mickelson was questioned he could remember most of what happened before he was struck on the head he said you had sent a message that he should look at the net shops before dawn that you had a feeling that hed find the garrote there and so he went with the man youd sent to find him and when he reached the sheds something hit him that marches with what mrs farrellsmith claimed she saw two men talking near the church and they drove away together exactly his first mistake rutledge said crisply i can show i was far away from sussex at the time i could have arranged to have him lured to hastings but i wasnt there to deliver the blow it was a trick and it worked inspector mickelson had carl in custody but hadnt been able to lay hands on the murder weapon yes it worked a treat was he able to give you a description of the man in the motorcar a hazy one at best the reflection from the headlamps cast shadows besides mickelson was busy trying to decide how youd worked it out about the garrote when he hadnt the question had to be asked does mickelson believe i lured him into a trap my impression was he is still of two minds about that his accident after all brought you back into the case yes it did rutledge gave it some thought as they walked along the road above the net shops norman hesitated the man in the motorcar told mickelson his name was daniel pierce and that youd asked him to handle this because his own brother was among the dead mickelson had no reason to doubt what he was told the elder pierce is an upstanding member of the community after all and mickelson wasnt intended to live long enough to tell us that have you spoken to tyrell pierce about this not yet i wanted to hear what you had to say before going to him you still maintain that this man youre chasing is not pierces son i went to the white swans whoever had stayed there registered as pierce and the description could fit him with a little stretch of the imagination he was never the man his brother was to look at it was as if anthonys features had been passed on to his brother only a little blurred a little less distinctive and summers had known that hed also known that daniel pierce hadnt returned to sussex for two years it was a safe enough gamble rutledge related what had transpired in dover and inspector norman whistled any chance of bringing him back from france on what evidence rutledge asked whatever i can prove it isnt strong enough to convince the french police damn norman glanced up at the headland where theo hartle had been found and said you make a good case for summers the question remains what do we do about the inquests into these deaths now that we know inspector mickelson will survive do we wait until hes well enough to present his case or do we look to you adjourn them again if you have to but keep your eye on eastfield thats where our killer will turn up as soon as he returns to england mark my words they turned back toward the police station rutledge stood there on the street for a moment after inspector norman had gone inside debating what to do waiting in eastfield would accomplish nothing the best course open to him was to return to the yard and make certain that the watch on the ports was kept in place as long as need be w hen he arrived in london rutledge found another letter from chief inspector cummins waiting for him opening it he lit the lamp and sat down in the chair by the window although the day had faded into dusk rutledge youre a marvel ive considered everything youd uncovered and i decided having the free time to do so to drive to east anglia and visit my grandfathers house it was sold shortly after his death but i remember it quite clearly the present owners have kept it up amazingly well even to the gardens that were his pride and i sat for some minutes in my motorcar remembering a very happy childhood the man who lives there now happened to see me as he came back from marketing and he asked if i were looking for someone i explained about my grandfather and to my surprise this stranger invited me inside i must have an honest face he allowed me to walk about and reminisce then to my even greater surprise told me he had something he thought belonged to me he was gone several minutes while i strolled in the back garden and then he reappeared with an envelope he handed it to me and i was stunned to see my name on the outside i asked where in hell hed got this and he said that in a young man came to the door his mother was living at the time and said he was quite polite asking if my grandfather still lived here she told him that he had died the man explained that he was looking for me the grandson of the previous owner and he asked if he might leave a letter here for me in the event i came back to the house one day she told the young man that shed be glad to take the letter but considered it was unlikely that i would ever return but he claimed he might miss me in london and it would be a kindness to know that one day id find the letter and know that he cared and so being the trusting soul that she was she took the letter and kept it before she died she mentioned it to her sonthis was nearly ten years later and the letter was still in her possessionand asked what to do about it the son wondered if id been abroad and felt that someday if i retired from whatever post it was that had taken me away i might come here looking for it and so he took on that charge in his mothers stead and she died a few months later he and his wife then moved into the house and the letter waited i could hardly believe anyone would have been that considerate of a strangers request but apparently the mother had been quite taken with him at any rate i left soon afterward letter in hand and the mans last comment to me was he hoped that i would be in england to stay now i didnt open the letter until i reached london it was a confession ian a confession to that murder at stonehenge but the man wasnt fool enough to give me his name he wrote that the man who was killed had deserved to die but in fact his death had been an accident now ian id seen the body and that wound it couldnt have been more accurate that knife slipping in how pray could it have happened by chance but the writer went on to say that the man had done terrible things and his death had protected others from further cruelty i found that selfserving he did explain that the body had never been identified properly because the victim had been on the point of leaving the country and everyone just assumed he had without fanfare he was not liked well enough for people to wonder why he had moved up his departure and the feeling was he had not expected a sendoff a farewell dinner that sort of thing and so he had decided not to put himself in a position where people might assume he wanted a show of regret at his leaving there was no one in england he cared for and there had been some quiet speculation that his continued employment might soon be in doubt those who could have spoken out about his private life and assured his dismissal were too frightened to do so i was one of them he wrote at the end of his confession i killed rather than endure silently as so many did i took the knife he used as a desk ornamentsomeone had fashioned a handle for it to please him he saidand struck out blindly i was astonished to see him fall and thought it a trick i left him there and went directly to a trusted friend for my sake he and one other person helped me dispose of my victim i write this to ease my own conscience and to leave a legacy for you since the crime has not been solved but the clues i have left were obscure and i wonder ifeven to ease my consciencei really am ready to face the horror of what i did well then ian my friend i wonder what you will make of this rutledge put down the letter what indeed to make of it he agreed with cummins that the author of the letter had purposely made the clues difficult to follow still if cummins had happened on that flint knife in the course of another case would he have followed the same steps toward finding an answer was that the point that the killer had felt he had done his duty secure in the knowledge that his role would never come to light whats more were there clues in that letter that might lead to the name of the victim if not the murderer without the original he wasnt able to make an educated guess about that but surely cummins would examine all the possibilities hamish said ye canna see yere ain way you canna worry oer much about the ins and outs of anither mans inquiry but rutledge said its a puzzle like this one of summerss doing god knows how long he has planned his revenge but so far hes carried it out without so much a qualm the men he killed the woman he took to france the dog hed abandoned if ye had never gone to yon hotel room at the white swans you wouldna ha known about yon dog it was true and the dover police had been particularly interested in how he had known about the dog and how he had come to learn what it was called hed replied simply that he had been several times to the hotel where the pierces were staying true as far as it went rutledge took a deep breath hes coming back i can feel it he said aloud into the silence of the room and sooner than we expect and i dont know how to stop him hamish said with any luck ata hell drown on his way back across yon channel i was never sea sick mysel but ithers were and dying was a cheering thought but thats the problem he could come back through a dozen different ports and hovering in the back of his mind was the inescapable knowledge that if he hadnt believed the false lead to brighton he could have reached dover in time rutledge let it go there was nothing he could do this night and sometimes an answer came more readily if he ignored the problem he went out to find his dinner choosing a restaurant where he wasnt likely to encounter anyone from the yard the food there was edible the clientele older and quiet and he didnt linger over his meal when he came home again there was someone huddled in the doorway of the flat only a thicker shadow among shadows his first thought was summers orhis wife bracing himself he called who is it who is there the shapeless figure turned taking on the outline of a woman and then a voice he knew said ian please i need your help it was meredith channing and he went forward quickly taking her arm with one hand opening the door of his flat with the other thank god he thought hed left a lamp burning he put her into a chair closed the door and went to find a handkerchief for he could see that she was crying he gave it to her and as she pressed it against her eyes he said what is it whats wrong i didnt know where to turn she answered him after a moment her eyes still hidden behind his handkerchief and then as if she had found the courage to say what she had come to say she set the rumpled white square of cloth aside he could read the anguish in her face my friendsi could ask any of them and they would help me but then they would know you seeonce the words are spoken i can never take them back and when they look at me ill know that they remember and i couldnt bear that he took the chair across from hers ive never judged you he said quietly and waited shall i tell you a story ian she said when she was calmer it seemed like hours later but perhaps no more than ten minutes had passed she had stopped crying now resigned much of it may be familiar its about a young man marching off to war he was deeply in love he said he wanted to marry because even if the war only lasted until christmas he had a feeling he wouldnt come home again i asked him how he could say such a thing and he smiled and said i just know i begged him not to go i even promised i would marry him if hed refuse to join the army but he had to you see all his friends had already enlisted they were excited and buying uniforms and talking about glory and he was a man he couldnt bear to be left behind and i married him because i thought if i do hell have a reason to keep himself safe a reason to defy that silly superstition and hell come back i didnt love him ian i liked him immensely and so i was willing to do this for his sake even if it meant spending the rest of my life with him i thought it will be worth it we can be happy i was youngi thought if hes killed ill never forgive myself she leaned her dark head against the back of the chair and stared at the ceiling he went missing shortly after the first gas attack at ypres i was suddenly neither wife nor widow and i blamed myself for not caring for not loving him in the way he loved me i kept telling myself that he knew that somehow hed realized why i had married him and hed lost his talisman so to speak i couldnt bear the guilt and so i thought ill find him and save him and so i trained as a nurse and i worked very hard i did my best from mopping ward floors to keeping my nerve in the operating theater and soon i was shipped to france but i went for selfish reasons i see that now i never found mark among the unidentified wounded i could find no one who had seen him die it was as if he were in a limbo of some sort and no one had the key it was hard to listen to her confession rutledge had wondered time and again but never asked he realized now that he hadnt really wanted to know her marriage was in the past let it rest there but he said nothing i paid for my folly for not having the courage to tell mark the truth for thinking that i could save him for thinking that i could find him her gaze came back to him one day in france i saw someone who had been brought in for superficial wounds he was dazed and i was told hed been buried alive when a shell fell short and exploded in his sector he was the only survivor all of his men were killed but he kept asking for them he didnt want to be treated until he was sure they were seen to an orderly took him away to rest for a little while and i asked someone the officers name i looked in on him later and he was sleeping i could see the shadows under his eyes i could see that hed been in the line through some of the worst fighting and i knew i could love this man i wanted to hold him and keep him safe all i could do was ask that he be given a little longer to recover but every man was needed i was told to wake him up and send him back i couldnt i asked someone else to do it she took a deep breath i never saw him again after that though id hear some snippets of news from time to time and knew he was safe i never asked but i listened for his name it wasnt until this past new years eve that i found him again i thought we could be friends it would be all right she added wryly i was still lying to myself you see he didnt reply he knew she didnt want his sympathy or his compassion i kept telling myself that i could always go away if there were problems after all i was still married and i couldntwouldntlet myself deny that this time when she fell silent he said meredith would tea help sherry she shook her head that poise hed found so attractive had deserted her now he could see her hands shaking even though she clasped them tightly in her lap a little while agono it must have been this afternoon she went on frowning there was a telephone call a group that works to find the missing has kept in touch from time to time they told me they believe theyve found mark hes in a belgian hospital very badly damaged in fact for some reason theyd believed he was a belgian a fleming from bruges there were a few who fought with the british you see but when he improved a little last week they realized he doesnt seem to understand flemish he responded a little to english and so the hospital called in someone who could speak to him in english it was necessary you see so that his answers could be taken down accurately her voice broke as she added i must go to belgium ian i need to see this man and i cant go alone will you come with me as a friend he could hear only hamish in his head merediths words a distant hum and yet he knew what she was asking he didnt think he could do it not with this inquiry ongoing he told himself not when i care too much he added facing the truth someone was saying yes of course ill do what i can if the yard will allow me to take leave a thought flitted through his head the last time hed asked for leave of his own accord it was to attend max humes funeral he expected her to cry again then instead she looked down at her hands and replied quietly thank you ian from the bottom of my heart ill speak to them tomorrow he took her home soon after touching her only to help her into the motorcar seeing her to her door and saying good night when her maid had opened it she smiled a little and went inside the next morning he was as good as his word he went to the yard ignoring the stares and the whispers as he passed along the corridors chief superintendent bowles was in his office and was caught quite by surprise by his inspectors sudden appearance rutledge faced him grimly knowing bowles for what he was giving no ground as the man behind the desk seemed rattled for a moment then collected himself i thought you were in sussex bowles said gruffly or failing that in dover theres nothing i can do in dover and as long as summers is in france then sussex is safe ive come to ask for a few days of leave bowless face brightened but he said i thought id just given you leave its been some time since then this is a personal matter he could see bowles mulling it over vacillating emotions flitting across his face like shadows the good fortune of being rid of rutledge at this impossibly sticky time the realization that if summers reappeared in england while rutledge was away he could send another man to cope with it the knowledge that rutledge was the butt of gossip and speculation which bowles himself could do withoutthey were all there he had even heard one rumor that rutledge had had his revenge for mickelsons interferenceembarrassing the chief superintendent yes all right bowles declared finally take your leave and report back in four days by that time something should have turned up at the ports he clearly expected rutledge to be satisfied for he picked up the paper hed been reading when he was interrupted but rutledge stood his ground and said with something in his voice that made bowles look up sharply about inspector mickelsons theory that i was involved in the attack on him i would suggest that its an aftereffect of that blow on the head you know as well as i do that i was not involved i couldnt have been i had no reason to be whatever my personal feelings may be about inspector mickelson a combination of misinformation and mistake bowles agreed hastily rutledge left it at that he would never have an apology from this man and while hed been angry enough to beard him in his den and tell him publicly what he thought about him he had more to lose than bowles his position at the yard which was still his lifeline to sanity he didnt want to call on meredith channing last night was still too fresh in his mind but he drove to her house anyway and knocked at the door and she had foreseen his difficulty her maid answered his knock and he gave her the message for her mistress mrs channing would like to leave for dover this afternoon if thats possible the maid replied will that be convenient the sooner it was over the better he thought but said only ill be here at one oclock thank you sir she closed the door he stood there for a moment then turned and walked away hamish was giving him no peace a reflection of the strain he was under as a precaution when he went home to pack a small valise he added some things to his clothing and shaving gear one oclock came all too soon and he was outside the channing house five minutes early and she was ready the door opened almost at once and he went to meet her taking her case and adding it to his own in the boot she said ian and then shook her head stepping into the motorcar when he opened her door they drove through london in silence and were soon on the dover road they arrived in good time for their crossing and rutledge took a few minutes to call on sergeant bell the laddie is still restless he said i took him for a walk along the strand today and he was searching for scents wanting to run up to anyone he spotted theres no word on mrs summers none bell said well then well see that hes fed and kept safe the boat left on time meredith stayed below while rutledge stood by the rail watching the water pass under the hull he had sworn once that he would never set foot in france again and here he was not on police business after all but to support a friend friend he ignored that thought and instead considered the letter that had come into chief inspector cumminss possession what sort of man would have a flint knife sitting on his desk what kinds of interests would he have historian schoolmaster world traveler expert in ancient weapons geologist even a collector of oddities it would take hundreds of manhours to find likely men in those fields and interview them schoolmaster hadnt it been a schoolmaster who had brought the latterday druids to stonehenge for the summer solstice he was above suspicion cummins had said when rutledge asked about him but where had he taught and were there other masters in that same school had cummins interviewed any of them but of course at the time cummins hadnt had the benefit of rutledges find of the flint knife he had been completely in the dark about the murder weapon hindsight seldom caught murderers he walked along the deck watching the white cliffs of england recede the castle a gray mass on the top of the highest cliff france was still a blue smudge on the horizon the wind striking his face was warm and sometimes laden with salt spray skirting the busy crew coiling ropes stowing gear and seeing to the general running of the ferry he paced for a few minutes deep in thought if the killer considered the victims murder well deserved what had the man done to earn it rutledge recalled studying the photograph of the dead face and thinking that the victim looked far more intelligent and of a better class than harvey wheeler was said to have been there was only a small window of time when the body could have been carried to stonehengeor the living man brought there to be dispatched after all this was the shortest night of the year and the situation was complicated by the latterday druids celebrating the summer solstice he could have been there when the druids arrived depending on what route they had taken to cross salisbury plain to the site in fact he must have been put there as soon as it was completely dark too much activity by the heel stone after theyd reached the stone ruins and the killer could have been discovered in the act of tying his victim there but had the killer and his accomplices known about the celebrants or had they left the body there because it was an isolated place and it was unlikely to be discovered for several days the letter writer hadnt mentioned the druids but the druids had been drinking mead and chanting to distract them from what was happening just out of sight he must write to cummins again and open a new avenue to explore pausing by the railing he could just make out the coastline of france now someone stepped to the rail beside him and he turned to see that meredith channing had come on deck staring at the landfall in the distance she said i shouldnt have come i should have listened to my better judgment this wont be mark none of the others were i shouldnt have brought you into this but i was afraid this time i dont know why very cowardly of me her shoulder was touching his her unconscious need for human comfort overcoming her reticence im glad you did he said and wondered if it were true when it seemed that you werent at home i didnt know what to do i couldnt go to frances or to the yard and ask where you might be how did you know where to find me ive known for a very long time where you lived id just never had occasion to go there until last night they were silent for a time he could feel her shivering whether from the wind or from nerves he didnt know after a moment he put his arm around her shoulders and she leaned into him until the shivering stopped when the boat had docked and they had cleared the formalities they turned north on the road to ypres and belgium to make conversation rutledge said i lost a murderer to france this week and he told her how the dog had been found and what the french had had to say about mr and mrs summers do you think she was just ill from the crossing or had he given her something to make certain she didnt say anything untoward she was probably given something i cant see how she would have let her husband leave the boat without bringing her dog to her most certainly shed have created a scene and why get rid of the animal unless he intended to do away with her as well he slowed to pass a procession of villagers carrying the small statue of a saint and bouquets of flowers they appeared to be on their way to the church on a slight rise he neednt you know rid himself of her there used to be these little convents scattered about where the nuns took in the ill or the mad and if there was money to pay for her board she could stay indefinitely in their care it was an interesting thought they were driving now on what had been the road where the german army and the small british expeditionary force sent to stop their progress had clashed roofless ruins shattered walls toppled church towers still marked where the fighting had been most intense and some fields lay fallow and torn villages and towns were striving to rebuild life was struggling to return to normal but as rutledge looked around him he felt a surge of tension of memory this was what hed lived with for four bloody years and had hoped never to see again but night was falling covering what they didnt want to see in blessed darkness rutledge stopped just before the belgian frontier for dinner and found a small pension that smelled of new mortar and paint as if it had just been refurbished where they could spend the night the food was not up to french standards but they had very little appetite rutledge saw mrs channing to her room and she wished him a good night he waited until her door had been locked from the inside before going on down the passage to his to sit by the window instead of going to bed they reached bruges the next day and found their way to the old city inside its ring of canals in the southern part on a side street not far from the begijnhof a large house had been turned into a hospital that cared for the human detritus left behind by war it was a tall building and broader than most rutledge thought it must have once been the town house of a wealthy merchant family even here were the scars of warbullet holes in the facade a niche statue of the virgin by the door decapitated the hasty repairs of damage from shrapnel still visible someone had repainted the door to hide the nicks and scratches in the wood as he reached for the brass knob meredith channing stopped him putting out her hand ian i must do the rest myself will you wait he agreed and went to sit in the motorcar after a moment she resolutely turned the knob and disappeared inside an hour passed and then the second he walked for a time but never out of sight of the motorcar hamish was his constant companion the voice dinning in his ear the war seeming to crowd in on him and then she was coming through the door her face so pale he went to her at once and took her hands she had left her pretty hat somewhere was it very bad he asked worse thanoh ian you should see him hes lying there looking at nothing his poor face so scarred i hardly knew him they were in a very public place people passing on the street around them faces turned to stare he led her to the motorcar and put her inside she said as he got behind the wheel i was told there was a little church near the gruuthuse palace could we walk there do you think he found it for her after going astray near the begijnhof where the benedictine sisters lived in their little white cottages in a treelined courtyard two or three were sitting in the sun warming themselves a small cushion on their knees weaving the fine webs of their lace bobbins flying in nimble fingers there meredith bought a small handkerchief to cover her dark hair in the church the church of our lady was known for its tall striking tower it soared above the surrounding buildings and rutledge found himself thinking it was an ideal mark for german artillery firing on the town down a side aisle was a chapel with a small but perfect white marble statue standing on the altar it was he realized michelangelos madonna and child she was seated the child at her knee the smile on her face movingly sweet rutledges godfather the architect david trevor had traveled in europe on a grand tour as a young man and he had told rutledge that this face young serene without shadows was the same as that of the virgin in the pieta in romes st peters only there it was marked by sorrow and loss the comparison he had said was heartwrenching rutledge stood in the back of the chapel staring up at that face while meredith knelt near the altar head bowed but not he thought in prayer if she was looking for anything here it was strength or courage hamish had been there in the back of his mind ever since the night meredith channing had come to his flat a dull unceasing monologue of despair the words nearly indistinguishable but he knew them by heart fiona he could hear that whisper as hamish lay dying before the blessing of the coup de grace you took my happiness from me ill take yours rutledge had tried to shut out all feeling after jean had walked out of his life in the spring of he hadnt wanted to feel again he didnt want to feel anything now but he watched meredith come to grips with what she had seen and he wondered if she had wanted this man to be her husband or if he was either way here was her chance for atonement after a time she rose and walked toward him there were no tears now just the resolve he was dreading and she said will you take me back to the hospital now it was too short a distance to say anything important and so they walked in silence when they reached the hospital with its frivolous roofline of chimneys she asked that he carry her valise to the door theyll find somewhere for me to stay close by i can visit every day he did as she asked numbly knowing he had already been shut out as he set the valise down with a click on the marble step she said im so sorry but this is something i have to do her voice was steady but only just a little deeper in note as well from the tears she was holding back duty is bitter company he said quietly i dont know how long he will live months years but ill close the london house and live in bruges for now meredith i wish i had met you then i wouldnt have been so foolish as to marry without love she rose on tiptoe and kissed his cheek goodbye ian someone opened the door as if he or she had been waiting to admit mrs channing she stepped inside and it swung shut again behind her he stood there for a moment longer as if hoping she would change her mind and then he went to the motorcar france was just miles away and he knew where hamish had died his service revolver was in his valise it was time to end it r utledge crossed the frontier between france and belgium and soon after found a deeply rutted road through devastated countryside that led in the direction of the river somme approaching it from what had been the german lines the land was healing after a fashion grass and weeds struggling to reestablish themselves nature seemed to find a way to cover up the scars of tragedy but men had marched down this road to kill other men and the land was rough and desolate as if no one cared to live here where so many had died he couldnt blame them if ghosts walked anywhere surely they did here and he felt that nothing grown in such bloody soil would ever prosper again he could see across the twisted landscape to where he and so many others had fought and yet he found his sector of that fateful night hard to recognize rains had washed down trench walls the stench had gone and somehow it all seemed so much smaller in scale now without the men who had served here among the wire the hellish pits of shell craters and the tools of war whether guns or tanks or trenches it seemed to have changed he stopped the motorcar at one point and got out listening there should have been shouts and the cries of men the whistle of shells and the chatter of machine guns the deafening roar of battle the deeper throb of aircraft overhead instead there was only a light wind hardly stirring the ridged and torn landscape he could still name the men hed led to their deaths here as he walked he thought he could see their faces but it was only the tightness in his throat and the tension across his shoulders that made him lightheaded it wasnt long before he found the place hed been searching for hed always had a good sense of direction and even without markers he knew it was here looking down he saw the lace of a boot sticking through the soil next to a struggling clump of grass and he felt ill how many times had a heel or a buckle marked all that was left of a man who had been living and breathing seconds before hed been told that farmers in some places still dug up the dead with their plows hed seen them lying rotting in the sun shrouded with the first snowfall twitching in the pelting rain the revolver was heavy in his coat pocket well oiled and loaded he was not likely to miss and hamish he realized had been silent since he left the motorcar waiting he took the weapon out and held it in his hand its feel and its weight were familiar comforting he was raising the revolver his head bowed for the shot his eyes closed when the image of that single boot lace came to him it would be obscene to kill himself here he realized to add one more body to the thousands upon thousands who littered this land a desecration to fire a revolver here in this stillness even france had failed him after a time the revolver still in his hand he turned back toward his motorcar and then drove back the way hed come r utledge landed in dover and collected his motorcar from the bowels of the ferry when his turn came to present his identification he was asked to step aside and waited impatiently as others behind him were cleared and sent on their way eventually a uniformed constable from the dover police came up to him mr rutledge sir will you come this way wary after his last encounter with the kent constabulary rutledge left his motorcar where it was and followed the man inside one of the dock buildings stood former sergeant bell he looked at rutledge and then smiled yes thats him all right he told the constable standing to one side he added for rutledges benefit youd said to watch for certain names on ships manifests when yours showed up we werent precisely sure who was coming in from france the constable here sent for me because i knew you by sight yes good work he told the two men it was in fact reassuring that someone had taken him at his word as he and bell walked toward the motorcar he added how is the summerss dog muffin bell made a face silly name for a dog but he answers to it right enough still he looks for someone every time i take him outside and he sleeps by the door as if to be ready if anyone knocks sad really hes devoted to someone we manage well enough mind you but i can see where his heart is can i give you a lift rutledge asked yes thank you sir have any luck in france rutledge realized bell believed hed gone there on police business no luck he replied simply and where are you off to now sussex ill look in at eastfield and at hastings then back to london as he ran down the road along the water he said you know this coast bell where would you come in if you didnt wish to attract attention to yourself there must be a thousand coves and inlets from the scots border to the welsh rounding this part of england and none of them requires more than a boat sufficiently sturdy to cross the channelthe smaller the betterand some knowledge of where one is heading i doubt your man knows this coast and so hed have to ask some frenchie to bring him over during the war we worried about the germans setting spies ashore in the dark of night sneaking in like where nobody was looking the coast watch was all very well and good but there was no way to prevent them if they got past the navy a good fog works wonders if you know your landing our man could be here already very possible if you ask me rutledge left bell at his door and continued down the coast toward hastings vast stretches of marsh interspersed with habitation and villages that had been part of the old cinque ports trusted with the defense of england marked this road he ran through winchelsea and tiny dymchurch then detoured to st marys in the marsh desolate and isolated with its scatter of cottages he went into the church itself and found it empty at rye he turned inland and came eventually to eastfield constable walker greeted him with some relief constable petty has been withdrawn sir i was told tommy summers is out of the country he took the boat across from dover to france it appears but for how long he may already be in sussex again damnation walker shook his head id never given that lad credit for being smart enough to outwit the police the way hes done i dont know what to make of it and thats the truth hes had a long time to plan his revenge if thats what were dealing with he knew it would be a risky business he must have considered every contingency shall i ask for constable petty to come again an extra pair of eyes wont come amiss if youre right and summers is on the prowl again with any luck well find him first rutledge said grimly but where to look he went to the fishermens arms and paced his room thinking if i were tommy summers what would i do he said aloud but hamish gave him no answer the cottage where the man had lived before as groundskeeper for the misses tate school but surely that would have been given to whoever had taken his place in the position still it was worth finding out rutledge left the hotel and walked to the school the property ran deep backing up to pasturage on the outskirts of eastfield to one side of the main door was a small wooden gate leading into a tradesmans passage to the rear of the house here were the kitchen gardens he saw as he rounded a corner of the building a path led on between the beds to the barnyard and outbuildings behind these was a small walled orchard apple and pear trees heavy with fruit to the left of the orchard gate was another that opened into a small plot of ground with a smaller cottage set in it empty by the look of it but all the same rutledge went up to the door and opened it after knocking there were two rooms and a tiny kitchen with a woodstove the furnishings were simple and well worn a table and chairs a cluster of other chairs their padded cushions faded with age he could see the bedroom through an arch without a door it contained a bed frame with a rolled mattress on it some chests another pair of chairs one of them on rockers and a cradle a patina of dust lay over everything and as he walked to the bedroom his own footsteps left faint impressions in the dust on the floor it was likely that the present groundskeeper lived not on the property but at his own home in eastfield a wildgoose chase he went out and closed the door behind him and then latched the gate as he crossed the barnyard he found himself facetoface with mrs farrellsmith she stood there watching him approach along the path there was something in the way she held herself that raised alarm bells in his head she said policeman or not youre trespassing im sorry he said keeping his voice level if id known you were in the school today id have asked permission to enter the grounds what are you searching for something to identify the groundskeeper you believe was tommy summers i thought he might have come back here rutledge answered its familiar and that means safe but it appears no one has been in the cottage for some time the greengrocers son has agreed to work for us he still lives with his parents besides i doubt summers would even try to slip into the grounds the staff know him by sight well i suppose you must start somewhere she watched a dove circle the barn roof and then perch there its voice soft on the summer air is it true is it this tom summers who has done these murders as far as we can tell yes the trouble is we cant find him thats why i came to look in the cottage you wont be arresting daniel pierce then are you in love with him he asked she sighed and to his amazement appeared to answer the question honestly i think ive always loved him sadly he didnt love me i thought perhaps in timei was foolish i know that now i even thought i could use anthony to make him jealous but you cant make someone jealous who doesnt love you at all you defended him fiercely enough she flushed i had a very good reason after a moment she met his gaze and said come with me he followed her back to the school building and through a side door into a shadowy passage this led in turn to a staircase and at the top he found that they were in the foyer outside her office the door was standing wideit was obvious shed seen him walk to the school and go through the tradesmans gate she had made a point to follow him to find out what it was he was up to pointing to a chair she went to her desk and with a key on a chain around her neck she opened a bottom drawer looking up at him again she asked do i have your word that you havent lied to me about daniel or tommy summers you have my word he replied she reached into the drawer and brought out a thick envelope then closed the drawer again you asked me to look into any event here at the school while members of the eastfield company were students i couldnt tell you that id already learned something about one of them it had been in my aunts personal papers and i stumbled across it in my first year as head mistress although it was rather shocking it had no immediate importance then you see except for a personal interest in the child this once belonged to she upended the envelope and something fell out onto her blotter rutledge looked at the tangle and then felt cold as he recognized what it was a garrote no not really a garrote a clumsy crude imitation of one daniel she went on was apparently very different from his brother anthony was a gentleman in every sense daniel washe was more at home with the sons of tradesmen he fought with them played with them felt comfortable in their presence my aunts referred to him as a little ruffian he enjoyed the army as well i think ive been told that he was very popular with his men her fingertip touched the garrote according to my aunt felicitys note on the last day before the pierce brothers were to leave eastfield and go to the school in surrey daniel brought this in and during the morning he threatened his classmates with it the boys that is not the girls aunt felicity was quite shocked when she overheard him swearing hed slip into their houses in the dead of night and dispatch them and she took the garrote away from him she insisted on summoning his father but daniel begged her not to he swore hed done it to protect someone its all there in the file the fear of god he told my aunt was nothing to the fear of death and so hed used the threat in the end she was dissuaded against her better judgment so she wrote an account of what had transpired kept the garrote with it and told daniel that if he didnt behave himself in surrey and become a fine example of the misses tate school like his brother she would go directly to his father he gave her his solemn promise rutledge reached for the garrote picked up the length of rope and the two short carefully whittled sticks tied at each end crudely made though it was it was still too close to the mark for comfort where the devil did a small boy daniels age come to learn about garrote aunt felicity wrote that daniel had already made a friend at the new school and had been invited to stay with him one weekend the friends father had served in india and had books on thuggee the bandits who preyed on caravans quite the sort of thing a boy would read if he had the chance daniel told my aunt that he had tried to make a garrote like the one described in the book only he didnt have a mans head scarf or a handful of rupees to tie at each end he only had some rope hed found in a shed at the brewery and two sticks hed been whittling rutledge tested the rope between his hands snapping it taut but the threads of hemp were worn and gave under the pressure it wouldnt have worked of course he said ah but the other boys werent to know that were they no one locked doorsand daniels version of thuggee would have been appropriately bloodcurdling who was he trying to protect which boy he asked daniel refused to say of course my aunts werent blind according to aunt grace it had to have been the summers boy daniel defended him sometimes still aunt felicity believed daniel was showing off just to be bloodyminded her word and in return thomas had discovered garrote learned what it was and then used one years later to kill his protectors brother it was a measure of the feelings that drove him that summers owed nothing to daniel pierce not even a modicum of gratitude and had used his name at the white swans apparently without a qualm gentle god rutledge said quietly indeed mrs farrellsmith agreed hamish said in france indian soldiers served although the british had crushed thuggee these men would have known about itsome said it still existed in dark corners of the countryand very likely could have shown summers what a proper garrote was if he hadnt found sufficient information on his own if you had learned of this report when first you came to eastfield you would have suspected daniel it was damning mrs farrellsmith was saying i think his father must also have feared this would come to lighthe must have been worried sick when anthony was killed for fear that in revenge id betray daniel my aunts would eventually have told him about the garrote still he needed to know that one son hadnt killed the other and so he had wanted scotland yard less prejudiced than inspector norman to investigate daniel was his favorite and now he has only one son but you werent pleased that the yard was brought in why did you think id uncover this why were you afraid of me and not of inspector norman he set the garrote back where hed found it she smiled for the first time he has no imagination you do would it have made any difference if mrs farrellsmith had trusted him sooner impossible to say still marshall might still be alive hed learned as a policeman that people held their secrets close and the common good often failed to have any bearing on that need to protect them must this come out if summers is arrested she asked after a moment im afraid so and then he said mrs farrellsmith where is daniel the shadow of an old grief settled over her face i wish i knew hes loyal to my husband you see they were friends at school he thinks my husband killed himself because he was jealous of me did he have cause to be she shook her head impatiently you dont understand michael didnt kill himself because daniel loved me he killed himself because daniel didnt love him and you never told the police this i didnt mind suspicion falling on me it was daniel i didnt want to drag into the inquiry besides it would have crushed any hopes i harbored in that direction did anthony know you loved his brother not in the beginning when i did tell him he warned me that daniel wasnt the sort to settle down and he wished me luck i think daniel still has the war on his mind if you want the truth but ive waited six years i can wait six more if i must and ill be here in eastfield if he ever decides to come home again she returned the garrote to the envelope and locked it away again dont let me down she said as she came around the desk to see him out find summers i dont want another scandal keeping daniel away i dont want another cloud over our names at the door rutledge said if your aunts knew what was going on why in gods name didnt they protect young summers or punish his tormentors why did they allow the bullying to continue for so long she frowned they were oldfashioned they believed that a boy should be able to take care of himself sticks and stones and all that they felt that it was important for him to develop a backbone stand up to his tormentors but when one is so young one doesnt have the skills to face down a bully and teach him a lesson does one she considered rutledge for a moment then added in my opinion there was something else as well their father my greatuncle the frenchman who founded the schoolwould have considered tommy summers slovenly and unfit hed have taken him in hand and made a man of him my aunts werent capable of that and they must have felt that tommy was a rebuke and so five men had died he left then letting himself out and as he walked back toward the hotel hamish said do ye believe her ill have the answer to that when i catch summers for all i know she hates daniel pierce and sees this as a way to punish him for his rejection of her at the end of the street he stopped and looked back at the school feeling as if he were being watched mrs farrellsmith was standing at her window as if to be certain he had left the premises he was about to walk on when out of the corner of his eye he saw a shadow at a window above hers he kept going showing no sign of having noticed the school was closed for a week was it daniel pierce waiting for rutledge to leave or was it tommy summers back in sussex and using the empty building to hide from the police out of sight of the school rutledge stopped and considered how best to extract mrs farrellsmith without alerting whoever it was at the window above hers surely she would remain in her office a few minutes longer he had a little time moving quickly he went down a list of people he could trust constable walker would arouse suspicion coming on the heels of rutledges visit mr ottley from st marys neither seemed to be the best choice summers would be on alert coming toward him was mrs winslow she was walking with her head down eyes on the road but she carried a marketing basket over one arm he thought there was a good chance that mrs farrellsmith would let her in but with what excuse she had no children in the school no reason to call just behind her was tyrell pierces clerk starret hurrying in the direction of the brewery with an envelope in his hand rutledge touched his hat to mrs winslow and after she had gone on her way stopped starret sir the man asked looking up at him i need a favor starret will you go to the misses tate school and hand a message to mrs farrellsmith shes there at the moment id like it to appear that mr pierce has asked to speak to her but he hasnt and i have this account to return to the brewery office rutledge smiled id like to invite mrs farrellsmith to dinner but we got off on the wrong footing and im afraid she wont see me perhaps youd help me lure her out of the school where i could speak to her ill explain the subterfuge when i see her i really cant oblige you sir mr pierce was most strict in his instructions rutledge said and i am most strict in mine he reached for the envelope in starrets hand and as the clerk expostulated he wrote on it i must see you at once please come he signed it simply tyrell and prayed she couldnt recognize the mans handwriting inspector rutledge lost patience the sooner you deliver this the sooner you can return to the brewery he said and make it look as if you really came from pierce if you fail me ill have something to say to pierce about your conduct the man gave him a reproachful look and then walked on without a word rutledge watched him go five minutes passed time enough rutledge thought to deliver the message but neither starret nor mrs farrellsmith appeared he thought if its summers ive given the man a second hostage but there had been no choice as hamish was pointing out another five minutes passed rutledge paced impatiently ignoring the stares of passersby it was time to take action he thought and prayed that he hadnt sent two people to their deaths he was just turning away when around the corner came starret with mrs farrellsmith at his side rutledge breathed a sign of relief she saw him waiting and at once called did you speak to tyrell i thought i could trust you she was very angry he nodded to starret dismissing him and when mrs farrellsmith reached him he took her arm and led her toward the hotel dont say anything more he commanded in a low voice just come with me she stared at him about to pull away from his grip on her arm and then something in his face alerted her youve found daniel she began anger fading hope taken its place im afraid not at least i dont think i have when i left the school i saw you standing in the window there was someone else by the window on the floor above you she stopped stockstill and he urged her on not here the hotel weve drawn enough attention already she relented and said nothing more he took her into the hotel lounge and found a chair for her are you sure she asked keeping her voice low a trick of the light perhaps id have sworn the school was empty id have heard someone walking around i know every sound im not mistaken are you certain theres no one else in the building and the greengrocers son isnt working today no one should be there the only reason i was there was to return some papers to my office and then i decided to spend half an hour working she shivered what if id encountered him when i went to sixth form for the marks my god he knows the school inside and out doesnt he how many doors are there in the main building let me think theres the main door of course and the side entrance you know about the door to the kitchen gardens the terrace with french doors where we hold our teas and of course one into the coal cellar thats too manyhell be out through one as soon as you enter another in force we must wait until dark it will take that long to collect enough men from inspector norman to cover the school will there bedamage to the school i answer to the trustees theyll hold me accountable she twisted a ring on one finger my aunts thought i was too young to have sole responsibility and i was but now from reception came the sound of voices and he looked up it was inspector norman in search of him rutledge excused himself and went to intercept him weve just finished searching the tunnels beneath the castle ruins but hes not there still i think you ought to come and see what weve found in one of the caves yes give me five minutes rutledge returned to mrs farrellsmith i must go is there someone you can stay with where youll be safe i dont think its a very good idea to go home she was frightened her face pale surely you dont think he was in the school to kill me i wasnt even there when he was taunted rutledge said under the circumstances its best if you come to hastings with us if you dont mind sitting in the inspectors office youll be safe if not precisely comfortable relief washed over her face and she went with him to where inspector norman was waiting ill explain on the way at the moment mrs farrellsmith is in protective custody norman said just hurry thats all they left for hastings and after dropping his charge at the police station rutledge went with inspector norman to the caves that ran under the cliff on which william of normandy had built his first castle there was a warren of the caves spreading out from shorter tunnels and rutledge was reminded of what lay under dover castle in kent nature had contrived them but man had made use of them at the mouth of one such cave a man had set up a sideshow to accommodate the curiosity of holidaymakers looking for something to do on a rainy day a painted donkey crudely made from wood and plaster of paris was harnessed to a wooden cart laden with packets of silk and tobacco kegs of whisky and other contraband on the wall behind was a painted canvas drop showing smugglers offloading an array of goods from the decks of a french fishing boat drawn up close into the shore goods were passed from hand to hand by men standing kneedeep in water then shouldered to carry to similar carts waiting to take the contraband to the caves norman led rutledge quickly past the other exhibits continued beyond a barricade blocking the way and soon came to a small offshoot of the main cave where a constable stood guard over a lamplit scene a small camp bed a flattopped chest bearing a lantern and a chair stood out against the surrounding gloom the smell of damp mixed with the cave odors of stale air norman stepped forward into the shallow area and opened the chest it was obvious as he shone his torch at the contents that hed seen them earlier before summoning rutledge dark workmens clothing a pot of what appeared to be black grease paint rags and a thermos of water lay inside a pair of chimney sweep brooms stood in a corner and a workmans lunch pail hung beside it he could come here change his clothes and go out again as a different person norman was saying a laborer on his way home a sweep with brooms over his shoulder whatever little vignette he chose not a very clever disguise but effective rutledge could feel his claustrophobia mounting but he held up a shirt gauging the size yes it could be the man i saw medium height medium build how does he come and go i shouldnt think it would be too difficult after dark to get through the lock the showman has put on the grille across the entrance this exhibit isnt officially allowed but the man does no harm and his presence here deters others from using these tunnels for more nefarious pastimes rutledge turned to leave fighting down rising panic summers could hardly walk into the white swans in these garbs but hed be equally suspicious wandering about eastfield in a gentlemans clothing did you find the garrote no damn it hed be a fool to leave it in plain sight more importantly he probably has it with him for that matter norman pointed out there are no identity discs here blank or otherwise he must have taken those as well i think hes preparing to kill again at the end of the war he was on burial detail did you know hed have seen enough of the discs then to copy them exactly as for names he could have collected them from any soldier he met he didnt want the names of the deadghosts dont kill and he wanted us to search half of england looking for those men dust thrown in our eyes but i think i know where he is and ill need your help getting to him norman nodded to the constable on guard and the three of them left the shallow depression back into the sunlight again rutledge told norman what he suspected i can bring enough men to cover the entrances but whos going in we dont know if hes armed i wouldnt be surprised if he is ill go in i think he wants to garrote me not shoot me by the way theres a message for you from the yard norman said after a moment mickelson is feeling better and hes pushing the doctor to release him he wants to take the case back from you wanting is not having rutledge answered and with any luck at all if im right well catch our elusive friend tonight but in the back of his mind he heard hamishs words what if hes cleverer than you r utledge escorted mrs farrellsmith back to eastfield and she sat beside him in the motorcar in pensive silence most of the way she had already agreed to take a room at the fishermens arms as a precaution but now she said there must be something else i can do after all some of this is my fault do you know where daniel pierce is he asked not looking at her it was some time before she replied when he came to tell me that he was leaving eastfield for good that he was never coming back i was so angry i picked up the first thing to hand and threw it at him it was the paperweight from my desk and it actually hit him in the face i was appalled i stood there unable to say anything and he just turned and left my office she coughed to ease the constriction in her throat i tried to tell myself it was the war the danger he lived with every time he went into one of those abominable tunnels or perhaps it was blowing up so many men i dont know but he neednt have lied to me rutledge was wary now had daniel pierce told this woman about peggy winslow or had she guessed the truth what lie did he tell you he asked when she didnt go on it was ridiculous daniel the most exciting man id ever met always a scapegrace always fun never dullin france even his men adored him and he stood there in my office and told me he was converting to catholicism and becoming a lay brother in a contemplative order if he didnt love me if he didnt want to marry me i could understand that if he needed to put the war behind him id have done everything in my power to help him what was even worse he thought id believe him it wasnt until the killing began that it all made sense id found the garrote of course and i thought he left me because he was starting to lose his mind and didnt want me to know and i thought if i can find him before the police do i can still save him she turned to him grief in her face wanting to hear rutledge make light of the lie and tell her that daniel loved her as much as she loved him and would come back one day that explains why you told the police it was my motorcar you saw by the rectory gates when you thought it must be daniels yes im so sorry but id do it again if i thought it would protect him rutledge considered what shed told him and he thought daniel pierce must have given this woman the literal truth that he was withdrawing from a world he couldnt facenot because of the war as she wished to believe but because of the illfound marriage of peggy and virgil winslow about which he could do nothing it would explain too why the yard had failed to find him the police had looked in the wrong directions all along he said he may have told you the truth you know that he was looking for a peace that you couldnt provide anabsolution he had meant the carefully chosen words to give her a little peace as well but she was blind to what he was saying seeing it as a reaffirmation of her own belief mrs farrellsmith sat back reassured then he was letting me know hed be all right wasnt he and that i must try to be patient until hes healed rutledge let it go she would be happier living with forlorn hope than with bitter truth it was obvious how fiercely she could love and he had a feeling that she could hate just as fiercely and peggy winslow was vulnerable time was not always a healeras often as not it was just a measure of how long someone had waited as they turned into the hotel yard she said please find something for me to do im responsible for the school what if he decides to burn it down who knows what he could do to try to cover his escape ill be worried sick until its over after she had been given her room key rutledge asked the desk clerk for paper and pen and told mrs farrellsmith what he wanted then he went to find constable walker he would have given much to put a watch on the school long before this as soon as mrs farrellsmith was safely out of it he had learned a grudging respect for the man they were after well aware that summers was capable of circumventing any plans the police chose to make but walker agreed with rutledge that there was a greater risk of losing their quarry altogether if he got the wind up and slipped away besides in daylight there was no way to guard the rear of the property without being seenthe pastures beyond were flat and empty of shelter if he thinks you saw him hes already gone away constable walker pointed out what im counting on is that he wants his revenge so badly hell take a chance that you didnt notice him rutledge tried to picture the street in front of the school theres the first floor in the greengrocers house walker was skeptical you can see the main door from those windows but theres not a good view of the alley then we wait until dark and box him in with an eye to that plan there was something else rutledge needed to attend to he spent quite some time closeted with an assistant at the ironmongers shop and left there well satisfied with their knowledge of what he wanted restless now with nightfall still hours away rutledge patrolled the village and outlying farms on foot staying well clear of the school but covering as much ground as he could there was no indication that summers had left the school building but rutledge spoke to every man whose name might appear on the killers list telling them to be alert he found all of them save tuttle whose mother informed him that her son was in hastings until the morrow theres a girl shed said he cant stay away from her all the same as a precaution rutledge ordered walker to be on the lookout for his nephew in the event he came back to eastfield earlier the course of true love seldom ran as smoothly as expected at length night fell and inspector norman and his men arrived in eastfield in the sunsets afterglow that soft light that was always slow to fade they went directly to st marys church as agreed where they were not as likely to draw attention to themselves he had brought a sergeant constable petty and two other constables whom rutledge hadnt encountered before this both were sizeable and quiet at rutledges request mrs farrellsmith had spent her afternoon sketching maps of the school and marking the exits clearly after each man was assigned to guard a specific door constable walker explained how to reach their posts unseen carefully describing landmarks to help them find their way in the dark the main door was the most difficult to reach even using the shadows for cover it was decided to leave that to the last once the other men were in position youll have only a few minutes to reach your destination i want you in place by the time its completely dark mark me dont go inside the school no matter what happens the point is to bottle him up ill do the rest rutledge told them this is a dangerous man youre not to take any chances if he comes your way use your truncheons to stop him if need be here are your signals one long blast of your whistle if he comes your way two short if you need help one short and one long if you see hes got out of the building understood good any questions rutledge led them outside to the apse of the church to accustom their vision to the gathering dark then saw them off he turned to inspector norman who was taking the main door im going in that side door i showed you on the map because i know my way there your task is to back up anyone who gets in trouble but stay outside if anything moves in that building ill be assuming its the killer you dont want to get in the way you ought to be armed rutledge said grimly i am he watched inspector norman disappear into the dark shadows of the churchyard and then heard the squeak of the rectory gate as he passed through it there was nothing to do now but wait until his men were in position five minutes passed it was time for him to move the squeak of the gate reached his ears again it stopped almost at once hamish said ware there was no reason for norman or his men to come back to the church he had been standing not far from the church tower facing the rectory and now he moved toward the gate picking his way through the heavy summer grass and the scattering of tombstones it was as dark as the back side of hell in the churchyard and there was no way to know whether someone had been coming into it or going through into the rectory grounds misdirection rutledge knew then that hed been right summers had seen him leave the school had seen him turn and look back at the windows shortly afterward someone had come for mrs farrellsmith that had had to be done rutledge had had no choice but his quarry taking no chances must have slipped out the back way across the kitchen garden the barnyard and out through the orchard before mrs farrellsmith had even reached safety and now he was loose but here in the churchyard or at the rectory rutledges hearing was acute but hamishs had always been far sharper on the steps of the rectory rutledge could just make out the soft footfall and then it came down the steps again and was lost in the grass after a few seconds rutledge realized that someone was moving around to the side of the rectory facing the church where was mr ottley the rector at this hour in his bed most likely but was he for now rutledge could see that although the drapes had been drawn lamps were still lit in his study just then the rectory door opened throwing a shaft of light across the lawn and mr ottley was saying im glad you came tuttle i think youve made a wise decision if miss lang accepts your proposal ill be happy to post the banns and marry you when the time comes tuttle constable walkers nephew and what the hell was he doing in eastfield he must rutledge thought have arrived at the rectory while it was still dusk and the police were gathered inside st marys damn and blast the man thank you rector tuttle responded im that sorry to have come so late but we lost track of time didnt we nan and i he laughed lightly one good thing about getting married i shant be traveling all the way to hastings and back of an evening mr ottley laughed with him and then they said good night the door closed and the shaft of light vanished leaving rutledge blind for several seconds but he could hear tuttle moving down the path from the rectory door and then turning toward the gate into the churchyard a shortcut to his houserutledge had spoken to his mother only that afternoon a lorry rumbled down the hastings road and its headlamps swept the churchyard wall as it passed the main gate as if in a tableau rutledge could see tuttle stop his head turned toward the vehicle and in the shadows by the rectory wall he could just discern the outline of another man frozen in place not ten yards from where tuttle was standing tuttle was the victim this time and rutledge had two choicesto call out a warning and risk losing summers or to put himself between tuttle and the killer tuttle was opening the rectory gate whistling to himself as he stepped through it and paused to shut it behind him somethingsome tiny movementcaught his attention and he turned to stare at the rectory wall now in darkness again whos there he asked sharply a voice said softly so as not to disturb the rector behind his closed doors do you remember me tuttle the low churchyard wall was between them now tuttle said warily i dont know your voice who are you what do you want to say hello for old times sake youve got the wrong man then tuttle answered and began to walk swiftly toward the far gate and the betterlit hastings road careful to keep on the smoother ground between rows of gravestones he passed within ten feet of where rutledge was standing but his attention was wholly on the man behind him as he listened for the telltale squeak of the rectory gate he began to pick up his pace now anxious clearly beginning to realize the danger he was in the hastings road was safetydoors he could pound on people who would hear him shout for help even the sanctuary of the fishermens arms if he was quick enough behind him rutledge saw the killer vault the wall rather than use the gate landing lightly in a crouched position then he straightened and started forward rutledge turned his head tuttle by this time was some fifteen feet from the main gate and he cast a worried glance over his shoulder unable to see where in the shadows his hunter could be the wind up now he made a frantic dash for the gate and was through it into the hastings road running for the hotel ware it was hamish who saved him in an instant rutledge realized that summers must have caught a glimpse of him there amongst the trees watching tuttle walk on and on the spot changed course altering his intended target to the one at hand there was a fleeting movement of air a sound that had barely registered before rutledge dropped to his heels out of reach of the garrote intended for his throat it scraped across his head and he heard the man behind him swear rutledge surged to his feet again catching summers off balance and the two men fell hard against a footstone flailing at an adversary neither of them could see in the thick shadows of the church tower for an instant rutledge had a solid grip on the mans upper arm spinning him as they got to their feet but his boots slipped in the bruised grass and summers broke free he ran only to fall headlong over something underfoot rutledge lunged forward missed him and saw him race toward the church porch and the deeper shadows of the apse beyond rutledge gave chase launched himself at the figure just ahead and brought summers down knocking the wind out of both of them rutledge was the first to recover but the other man was fast and breathing hard he set off again back the way he had come toward the west door of the church he got it open before rutledge could stop him and then tried to slam it shut catching one of rutledges hands as he did setting his teeth rutledge pulled at the edge of the door bracing himself and when summers suddenly let the door go it opened so fast that he was flung against the carved stone arch he nearly cracked his head against the protruding foot of a saint but using the wall as a fulcrum rebounded with such speed that he was inside the entrance to the church before summers could manage the inner door into the sanctuary something brushed his face and he grunted with shock at a touch so close and so human then he realized that it was not a hand but the frayed end of the bell rope he caught it again somehow and leapt high on it coming down with all his weight on it high above in the tower the bell clanged with a deafening discord two short blasts of a whistleit was the nearest he could come to the signal for needing help but before he could ring the bell again summers was on him knocking him to one side rutledge whirled as he crashed into the wall expecting summers to be in front of him now he judged it wrong the garrote this time brushed his ear and he jerked sideways knocking against the low table where church information and items for sale were usually kept it went over in a crash and summers yelled in pain as one of the legs unexpectedly clipped him and he went down they were fairly equally matched although rutledge had the advantage of height he felt for the wildly swinging bell rope caught it and leapt high a second time but summers reached up as he was scrambling to his feet and seized rutledges ankle pulling him back still he managed to keep his grip on the rope and again the bell sounded a harsh note rocking on its cradle to ring a second and then a third time before summers could stop him kicking out with his free foot rutledge caught summers in the throat for he choked on a cough and released his hold letting go of the bell rope rutledge dropped to the stone flagging trying to pick up movement and locate summers but he waited a second too long for something brushed his shoulder then a fist slammed into the edge of his jaw rutledges head snapped back and he saw stars the other man was on him then pinning him half against the wall half against the door into the sanctuary shaking his head to clear it rutledge broke the hold lashing out in his turn and summers stumbled backward over something that had fallen from the overturned table sending it bouncing across the floor and he went down it was the break that rutledge was looking for and he caught at the fabric of the mans lapel held on hard with one hand and with the other went for where he guessed the mans body would be the blow sank into yielding flesh and he heard the whoosh of air as summers fought to breathe again rutledge was on the point of following up his advantage just as the outer church door scraped open and the beam of a torch swept them both combatants froze then turned as one to stare into the brilliant light as mr ottley said sternly this is a house of god get out of here now the man in rutledges grasp using all his strength broke free spun the rector into rutledges arms and was gone the rector lost his balance and went down taking rutledge to one knee as the torch went skittering across the stone floor like a wild thing the spinning light blinding both of them rutledge heaved mr ottley away and was out the door after summers unaware he had not gone far this time the garrote didnt miss it whipped over rutledges head and drew across his throat so quickly he was helpless to stop it and summers pulled hard with a force that was backed by anger and an intense will rutledge spun jerking his revolver from his pocket and raising it in the same motion the barrel caught summers with such force across the temple that he went down the garrote slipping through his hands just then the church door opened and the rector barreled out torch in hand shouting rutledges name the beam caught rutledge in the eyes and ottley stopped short at my feet damn it he snapped and the torch swept downward who is that mr ottley asked peering at the slack unconscious face ive never seen him before there was astonishment and relief in his voice at a guess one thomas summers the rector moved closer frowning are you sure that doesnt look like the summers lad you havent seen him in fifteen years hes changed hes a man now not a boy ottley pointed to the blood on the side of the unconscious mans face did you kill him no but hell have one hell of a headache when he comes to his senses rutledge said with some satisfaction shoving his revolver back into his pocket his tone brought the flashlight upward so that ottley could study his face but it stopped at rutledges throat what in gods name the garrote he tried to kill me ottley was about to say more when they heard shouting from the direction of the hastings road and norman came charging into the churchyard what the hell is happening as he reached the small tableau picked out by ottleys torch he added we heard the bell but from where petty stood he could see a light in the school he was certain someone was moving around in that room finally i went inside myself we found a candle lit and a piece of paper on a string hanging over it when the candle flickered the paper moved we came here norman ran out of words staring from rutledge to the rector and finally noticing the third man lying in the shadows at rutledges feet he left the school before we got there rutledge said hes been following tuttle from eastfield to hastings and back to eastfield i should think i got in his way norman stepped across to take the torch from the rectors hand and shine it down at summers hold it steady rutledge said and stooped to go through summerss pockets there was no identification in any of them only in a breast pocket a single identity disc intended for his next victims mouth rutledge looked at it saw the name and said nothing he passed it on to norman who brought the torch up to see it more clearly well we neednt ask if youre this man bertie grimes corporal the yorkshire rifles as he handed it back to rutledge he saw what was around his neck what the hell did he do to you constable walker asked stepping forward for a closer look rutledge unwound the garrote and passed it to inspector norman the murder weapon yes thats the garrote walker was saying as he took it but whats that around your throat rutledge reached up and touched the flanged band that encircled his throat it was what he and the ironmongers assistant had spent most of the afternoon devising the only thing he could think of to protect against a garrote a gorget of a sort its meant to be similar to the armor a knight wore around his neck and shoulders to protect them the ironmonger will have to cut it off and the sooner the better meanwhile we ought to take summers to dr gooding in the event i hit him harder than i meant to but as they trooped toward dr goodings carrying summers on a table the rector brought from the church the man came round dazed and at first hardly coherent and then finally aware of where he was he started to struggle only to be forced down by the ungentle hands of the constables carrying him subsiding he lay there with one arm flung over his eyes gooding roused from sleep pronounced summers well enough to be taken to hastings and charged with multiple counts of murder rutledge looked at the men surrounding the patient and said norman if youll contact dover police and ask that a former sergeant named bell bring the witness he has in his keeping to hastings at his earliest convenience well have one more piece of our case settled who is bell and whats the name of the witness norman asked this is summers isnt it yes thats summers bell will explain will you give me five minutes alone with the prisoner after a moment they did as they had been asked but it was clear that inspector norman was not best pleased when they had shut the door behind them rutledge said to summers is your wife still alive it wont save you from hanging if you tell me but there is someone very much interested in her condition summers was staring at him his eyes intent why should i help the police do you hate her as much as you hated the others i didnt hate her at all i needed her money he said coldly you cant inherit any of it if youve killed her if shes still alive and you havent treated her too badly she might be induced to pay for your defense not bloody likely he said harshly i killed her confounded little dog as good as which told rutledge that mrs summers was still alive where ill give you until nine oclock in the morning to think that over and tell me where she is summers gingerly touched the side of his head a red welt marked where rutledges revolver had struck him you neednt have hit me so damned hard there was almost a whining note in his voice your fault for trying to garrote me rutledge said unfeelingly why didnt you stop the killing when you could why not let hopkins take the blame did your revenge matter so much that it was worth hanging for at first it was vengeance id thought about it long enough i decided it was time to show i had the backbone to do it when they died they were as alone as i was all my childhood a lonely death in return for a lonely life summerss face changed something in it that gave rutledge pause at length he said as if it was unfathomable to him then i found i liked planning and stalking and killing my victims it brought the war back again i hadnt realized it then but it was probably the happiest time of my life i felt so alive he considered rutledge you were in the war at a guess do you know what im talking about did you feel it there was an eagerness in his voice a need to hear that others had been caught up as well rutledge remembered the trenches the stench of war the broken bodies of the living the torn bloated corpses of the dead the nightmare of trying to survive against all odds and watching those under his command decimated day after day no he said i never did and i thank god turning on his heel he left the room telling norman that the suspect was all his what did you talk about norman demanded i want to know about the war rutledge said and walked out of dr goodings surgery t hey brought the little dog into inspector normans office the next morning he had already sent for summers who was sitting in a chair stubbornly silent now bell dropped the lead as rutledge opened the door and muffin ran in stopped short cast a glance at summers and then rapidly swung around the room frantically searching for the one person who wasnt there summers stared at him as if hed seen a ghost but as the dog came full circle he stopped in front of the mans chair and began barking surging forward and then back again head down neck outstretched and taut bell watching said my god get him away from me summers demanded drawing his feet under the chair out of reach the bloody dog bites rutledge spoke over the ferocious display of anger as muffin all but attacked summers teeth bared ears back where is she or ill lock him in the cell with you damn it call him off but rutledge stood there grimly watching as muffin leapt closer challenging the man in the chair desperate summers kicked out and muffin got his ankle holding on with the tenacity of his terrier ancestors summers screamed stood up and tried to shake the dog off but it was impossible bell just behind rutledge started to step forward but rutledge put out an arm to stop him summers cried all right for gods sake ill tell you get him away from meshes in the convent of the claires south of paris i swear it please meredith channing had said something about convents why is she there rutledge asked holding up his hand to stop bell i told them she suffered hallucinations after a head injury he said rapidly that what she remembers is confused erratic there was never a pet dog we were never in sussexthey pitied me bell hurried forward and caught the dog by its collar his voice firm pulling muffin back it took some doing and summerss ankle was bloody by the time bell had separated them summers reached down and gripped it swearing bell turned reproachfully to rutledge that was not right it was the only way rutledge answered harshly he killed with impunity hed have left her there she was no further use to him nor was her money now he turned on his heel and walked out of the room while bell soothed the dog and carried him down the passage to the motorcar that had brought him from dover norman left summers slumped in his chair and followed rutledge youre a cold bastard when you want to be and youve put mickelsons nose out of joint bringing the suspect in hes to be released tomorrowmickelsonand sent to london to finish healing he refuses to clear you you know he claims hes uncertain but weve found summerss motorcar its very like yours mrs farrellsmith was right on that score i dont think youll have much trouble over that business it doesnt matter rutledge said refusing to admit to norman or anyone else that it did norman said after a moment im curious when did you bring your service revolver to eastfield rutledge said i took it to france with me force of habit with that he walked away leaving norman to stare after him a fortnight later when rutledge had given his testimony at the inquest and returned to london he asked chief inspector cummins to meet him for lunch at a quiet restaurant where they could talk cummins came in sat down and greeted rutledge cheerfully im glad to see you survived it must have been touch and go according to my sources for an instant rutledge thought that cummins was referring to that moment in the wasteland of the somme when hed considered his future and decided against dying there and then he understood the reference was to eastfield it was a closerun thingwhether id be hanged for murder or would bring in the real killer why did he target mickelson apparently hed seen inspector mickelson standing in the churchyard by his mothers grave he was afraid mickelson was looking into his familys past it wasnt true of course but it nearly got mickelson killed all the same by the time hed retrieved his motorcar and stopped mickelson by the rectory gates there was no opportunity to garrote him and so he used a spanner i hear mickelson is being bloodyminded about clearing you of any role in his attack hes had an epiphany so ive been told the kc trying summersjulian haliburtonhas informed mickelson that the crown takes a dim view of muddying the evidence inspector mickelsons statement has officially exonerated me of all blame rutledge didnt add that it would be some time before his arrest on a charge of attempting to murder a fellow policeman had faded from the collective memory of the yard that anyone believed him capable of such an act still stung cummins chuckled yes haliburton is a stickler for accuracy his amusement faded you understand that you wont be promoted to fill my shoes bloody stupid of bowles but there it is i hadnt expected it rutledge said and yet he knew that he would have liked to follow a man like cummins on a more interesting subject than the chief superintendent i havent thanked you for your help with the stonehenge murder this is more information than id ever hoped to find theres something more rutledge replied i think i know the name of the murder victim cummins was aghast i dont believe it how in hells name did you ever get to that wed wondered why the knife was left in hastings it occurred to me that there must be another connection at least a name to be going forward with and whats the most popular name in hastings robinson turner johnson william the conqueror the first of the norman kings of england theres an inspector norman there as well while i was there giving evidence at the inquest i asked one of his constables if there was anyone in the inspectors family who had gone missing in at first petty thought i was trying to cause trouble with the police in hastings but then he told me that there were several families named norman in that part of sussex and one of them a william norman was lost in peru in he was a schoolmaster who was eager to find another lost city of the incas as it happened an american hiram bingham actually did find a lost city machu picchu this william norman sailed for peru on the twentysecond of june the family was told hed reached peru safely had gone into the jungle and was never heard from again he was declared dead seven years later to reach peru hed have had to take passage on a ship going out there did he yes apparently he did someone did well then he isnt our william norman is he rutledge signaled the waiter to bring their menu the report said that the captain of the ss navigator had described norman as the worst sailor in christendom he never left his cabin throughout the voyage he was as green as anyone the captain had ever seen and when he stepped off the ship his legs would barely hold him upright but he insisted that he was all right a great disguise seasickness cummins said dryly you forget the ships captain had never seen norman he was nothing more than a name on the manifest and the few glimpses anyone had had of him hmmm who then took his place the killer rutledge said i expect well never know but if it was the killer then hes dead he paused he was a schoolmaster in a prestigious public school in dorset norman not so very far from stonehenge what was his field history was his journey to peru carefully planned or spur of the moment it was apparently arranged some months before his departure cummins shook his head where did the schoolmaster who planned the druids trip to stonehenge teach youve seen the file at a public school in dorset coincidence he was cleared he couldnt have killed the man nor roped him to that bloody stone he was within sight of his fellow druids at all times no possibly not but perhaps someone knew about his adventure to stonehenge and thought it a very good idea to take an inconvenient body there but what about wheeler he was identified you know how uncertain identifications can be at a guess the edinburgh police were happy to see the end of wheeler ive done some research there was a wheeler from orkney killed at gallipoli hed immigrated to australia from belfast in did he by god where is your schoolmaster now do you know cummins made a wry face dead of cholera in india hindsight is a wonderful thing rutledge but it doesnt solve crimes he himself had said much the same one day in eastfield cummins took up his menu without opening it he said i was so sure about wheeler even so we could find no motive to explain why hed been killed and without the identity of the victim we were still stymied as to motive it was a vicious circle thats what bothered me all these years in spite of the loopholes in your arguments i expect youve come closer to finding answers than i ever did how do you suppose someone discovered your grandfathers name was charles henry cummins gave it some thought there was a solicitor connected with the case his name was charles henry i remember remarking to someone that my grandfathers name was charles henry charles henry cummins who overheard you oh i know who was there at the time our druid leader the schoolmaster he smiled before you leap to conclusions that charles henrythe solicitorwas up in years in fact he died soon after the inquest he was probably dying at the time and no one realized it weak heart he set aside his menu and raised his glass i always knew you were a very good policeman ian bowles is a fool damn his eyes the waiter was hovering and cummins looked up at him yes yes all right how is the fish here when rutledge returned to his flat at the end of the day he found a letter waiting it was from rosemary hume and it was brief its time ian can you come he left a message for the yard and set out straightaway for chaswell when he got there it was late but rosemary was waiting up for him even as he walked through the house door he could hear reginalds forced breathing rosemary took him directly up the staircase to the room her husbands cousin had been given he asked to see you alone she said as she turned back toward the stairs reginald was in a chair leaning forward struggling for breath he greeted rutledge with a weary smile and a nod im sorry to see you in such straits he said sitting down by the invalid chair is there anything i can do a paroxysm of coughing nearly doubled reginald in two and afterward he lay back against his pillows drained but he lifted a hand and pointed to his desk it was a tall affair with bookshelves above and then the dropdown front that formed the writing surface rutledge walked across the room opened the desk it was all but empty and he turned to reginald left there were cubbyholes on either side of a small central alcove and rutledge looked in the left one he saw an envelope pushed deep into the narrow space and hardly visible he pulled it out maxwell humes name was scrawled across it in a firm hand and then more recently that had been crossed out and his own name had been written above maxwells from the state of the envelope rutledge realized that reginald must have written this some years earlier for the original ink was already fading this reginald nodded rutledge went back to sit by him shall i open it now reginald said briefly later and so they sat together for the rest of the night mostly in companionable silence although at times rutledge talked quietly about their lives about the war and about max shortly after dawn reginald put out a clawlike hand and gripped rutledges arm with surprising strength rutledge gave him his own hand and waited forgive me the words were hardly more than a whisper he said youre forgiven with all my heart truly as god is my witness after a time the room fell quiet the struggle to breathe finished rutledge held the thin hand for a while longer and then laid it gently in his friends lap and closed reginalds eyes he took the letter then remembering put it in his pocket where rosemary wouldnt see it and he went down the stairs to where rosemary her eyes red with crying was drinking tea she passed a clean cup to rutledge and he poured his own it was lukewarm but he drank it for her sake a little later she said i finally slept and then i awoke with a start i didnt know where i was it was then i heard the silence ill speak to mr gramling soon he didnt want a priest at the end he said it would be wrong to ask for anyone to save two souls his as well as maxwells she hesitated did he kill himself ian no god no rosemary hesimply stopped breathing i thought that was why he wanted a policeman at the end i wasnt a policeman upstairs tonight i was a friend ive sat with the dying before this she reached out and put her hand over his im sorry thank you half an hour later he left her still sitting at the table and went out to find mr gramling r utledge didnt read the letter until much later that day when he had gone to visit maxwell humes grave max i hesitate to put this on your conscience as well as mine but i face my first battle tomorrow and if i die i dont want to carry this with me into whatever hell i find and so im writing to you and when you read this you will know im dead and out of any mans reach i must tell you that when i was much younger i killed a man i should have taken my chances with the courts but i was very frightened and the people i turned to told me that given the circumstances i would ruin the rest of my life if i went to the police i listened to them not because i really believed them but because i wanted to believe them and so through circumstances that aided us and the careful planning of two other people we carried it off the victim was william norman do you know the name he went exploring and never came back only it was a poor man who worked for the school whom we dressed as william norman and sent to sea with the promise of a return ticket two weeks after he landed for our sins he died of a fever instead and never came home i blame myself for that as well william norman was a schoolmaster who hurt people for his own pleasure sadistic and clever he forced his boys to make choices lie about a friend or he would tell the headmaster a worse lie in its place steal money and swear that it was one of the servants who would then be sacked without a reference or he would fail someone we liked whose marks were already poor and see that he was sent down when it was my turn the choice was particularly heinous i refused i said id die first and he told me he could arrange for me to die and showed me the knife he also told me who would be blamed for my death i didnt know where to turn he told me hed leave me for a quarter of an hour to make my decision i did i took the only course i could see i picked up the weapon from his desk and then bent over it as if weeping he came in took my hair in his hand and pulled my head up i drove the sharp blade into his body by some fluke it nicked the great artery and he died i dont know where i found the strength or the courage to watch it happen i cleaned up as best i could and went to find my housemaster he and one of the younger masters and i sat there and decided to cover up the crime i asked if william normans family would suffer and they thought not hed been estranged from them for some years that was all i needed to know if i survive this war ill burn the letter dont blame the others will you they hadnt known what he was doing but when i told them they believed me and did their best to save me i was always grateful and below reginalds signature was a postscript forgive me ian for exacting a promise once i discovered you were a policeman in truth our friendship was genuine and i have tried to make up for that night short of confessing does that mean william norman won after all rutledge read it again then folded it and returned the sheet to the envelope would he take it to cumminswho knew much of the story already he himself had been zealous in search of a truth not for the sake of that truth but because he was a good policeman and it was his duty to pursue the guilty what truth would be served by closing the case when the principals were beyond the laws reach rutledge didnt know just now his duty was to bury the recent dead and mourn them with honor hamish said do ye regret giving your forgiveness before ye knew why you were being asked rutledge said i dont god knows i need forgiveness of my own he walked back to the house rosemary was ready and it was time to follow reginald to his final rest
