michael ennis byzantium the gods make mighty him who bows to their yoke homer the iliad foreword in the first half of the eleventh century while europe lumbered fitfully towards the end of the dark ages the byzantine empire stood at the apex of its power direct heir to the might and glory of ancient rome the empire of byzantium already could look back on seven uninterrupted centuries of world dominion the hub of this enduring and seemingly invincible power was constantinople the magnificent fortress capital founded in ad by constantine i the first christian emperor of rome invulnerable behind miles of towering walls the queen of cities was a luxurious metropolis of a million inhabitants at a time when london and paris were squalid overgrown villages of ten or twenty thousand presiding over the splendour of byzantium was the most powerful man on earth lord of the entire world the byzantine emperor was thought to rule literally side by side with the lord of the universe christ the pantocrator but the emperors divine prerogative was coveted by many and this alltoofallible mortal often feared for his life even in the staggeringly opulent sanctuaries of his vast palace complex for this reason the byzantine emperors surrounded themselves with an imperial bodyguard of viking mercenaries men of unquestioning loyalty and unyielding ferocity known and feared throughout the world as varangians these few hundred viking warriors became essential to the stability and survival of the worlds mightiest empire the most famed of all varangians was a young norwegian prince named haraldr sigurdarson who would play one of the most fateful roles any man has ever undertaken on the stage of history this is his true story while this is a work of fiction it has been based very carefully on historical fact a truth more extraordinary than any fiction all except the most incidental characters actually lived and died almost a thousand years ago and all of the major events actually took place in the interest of authenticity various measurements and terms actually used in the eleventh century have been retained here the units of measurement most commonly used by the norse were the thumb about an inch the ell a span of eighteen inches based on the measurement between the elbow and forefinger the bowshot a distance of roughly two hundred yards and the rowingspell a distance of about seven miles the byzantines used the fathom six feet as well as the roman foot the stade a measurement based on the length of the hippodrome track was about two hundred yards the vikings of the eleventh century never referred to themselves by the sobriquet they earned in later centuries they called themselves simply norsemen while the word viking described an activity roughly translatable as adventuring in search of wealth the word varangian which was widely used in scandinavia as well as byzantium literally meant pledgemen as the norse warriors obeyed an inviolable pledge to defend one another and their sworn leader to the death the norsemen called the byzantines griks and their empire grikkland or grikia the city of constantinople was often called miklagardr the great city but the byzantines who in fact spoke the greek language and incorporated all of greece in their empire emphatically considered themselves and their empire roman constantinople was often referred to as new rome the byzantines frequently referred to norsemen in general as rus because the norse usually reached byzantium by a route that took them through rus land which later became russia in elegant court circles norsemen were also known as tauroscythians a condescending and affected anachronism that meant scythians ie savages from beyond the taurus mountains of course in the eyes of the byzantines all foreigners regardless of status or place of origin belonged in one basic category barbaroi or barbarians prologue stiklestad norway august reduced to predawn embers the hundreds of campfires speckled the stilldarkened meadow like a constellation of dying stars each was the site of an anxious communion as a thousand men whispered a question only one man could answer will we fight today the cumulative sound of this hushed speculation was an eerie detached sibilance as if giant wings slowly fanned the darkness above the king of norway stared into the faintly pulsing coals at his feet and repeated the name he had murmured a moment before ingigerd jarl rognvald brushed the shag of frostwhite hair from his forehead the jarl was well into his sixth decade his walrustough skin slit with deep creases like the king sitting beside him he was dressed for battle in a kneelength coat of chain mail called a byrnnie my king he asked absently king olaf sat erect the links of his byrnnie chinged in a tiny sad note the instrument and its music suited to the man olaf was thirtyfive huge with the face of a scowling oversize boy who had shed his baby fat and become a tough overbearing bully and yet his painfully blue eyes were gentle and haunted not a sensitive boys eyes but those of a man long pursued by an unkind fate the last time i saw ingigerd said the king i promised her that before i died i would hold her in my arms again he stirred the coals with his boot and sparks flew up as if sucked by the vast whisper in the air i held her in my arms last night a dream so real that i could taste her flesh and feel her heart beneath mine jarl rognvald knew then that the king had made his decision ingigerd the king of swedens daughter had been the love of olafs youth though olaf had never admitted it jarl rognvald was certain that they had slept together perhaps for that reason the king of sweden had always despised olaf and had married ingigerd to yaroslav great prince of the rus olaf and ingigerd had not seen each other for almost twenty years where will we fight them asked jarl rognvald here when they see how few we are they will come down from the high ground the two men stood and looked to the east the forest began on a small slope at the edge of the meadow where olaf had encamped his army it seemed filled with an unnatural incandescent orange mist that illuminated the bases of the pine trees all night long olafs scouts had gone out into that forest and returned with a grim accounting of their enemys strength so evident in the massed light of their campfires they were seven times as many men as olaf had mustered a mercenary mob hired by an unlikely coalition the owners of norways largest estates who envisioned a norway fractured into their own sovereign principalities and knut king of denmark and england who envisioned a norway shackled to his empire and once norways king was out of the way knut could easily impose his vision on his erstwhile allies we could still pack our gear bags and leave this field before dawn olaf said and live to meet them at a time of our choosing but as word spread that king olaf had run their ranks would increase we would simply die on another day but in retreat rather than with honour no king could ever follow me except a foreign king olaf turned to face the jarl my choice is simple if i live to fight again norway will die if i die today norway lives jarl rognvald removed the conical steel helm from his leather gear bag and cradled it in his hands his rough fingers tracing over the intricately scrolled dragons engraved round the rim the dragon of nidafell the jarl silently noted the gianttaloned serpent that would fly in the last black night of the world the creature with the jaws of infinity the beast that would draw all creation the works of men and gods alike into its endless maw jarl rognvald still believed in this pagan apocalypse despite olafs relentless campaign to establish kristr as norways god olaf watched the jarl deal with doom in the fashion of his youth i know you still believe in the old gods he told him softly i wish i could have placed your feet on the ladder to paradise but when you drink at the ale benches in the valhol this evening tell norways kings that i tried to honour them with my death and that no man honoured me more with his life than jarl rognvald the jarls thick neck pumped with emotion what of norways next king olaf strapped his sword belt around his waist yes where is haraldr haraldr sigurdarson was olafs fifteenyearold halfbrother and next in line for the throne haraldrs father sygurd syr had been king before olaf but olaf had been much more than half a brother to haraldr sygurd syr had died when haraldr was only a small child and olaf had become by any measure haraldrs father haraldr is with the skalds said jarl rognvald the skalds were the court poets he will want to fight all boys who have never fought want to fight it is time for haraldr to learn that sometimes it requires more valour to live than to die where will you send him his life will be worthless in norway kiev in rus ingigerd will look after him there they will hunt him down in rus even every hired thug sand wanderer and danes slave will want to earn the price on the head of the prince who did not die at stiklestad he will take a new name within a year he will probably grow so much he will look entirely different i am not worried that other men will take him for the prince of norway if he can keep quiet about who he is olaf glowered the light of the dying fire on his troubled eyes making him seem more haunted than haunting i am worried that haraldr himself will forget he is the king of norway steadfast will we feed the gullsofblood the skald pulled anxiously at his whiskers contemplating his newly minted verse if he had to recite it this morning he realised it would probably be his last gullsofblood repeated haraldr sigurdarson in his piping occasionally cracking adolescent voice he stood next to the pensive skald no such doubt reflected in his swaggering version of a court poets elegant oratorical pose he was immature for his age his lean finefeatured face all pale down his long golden hair almost as beautiful as a womans his blue eyes were said to be the image of his brothers his metalstudded canvas byrnnie swallowed skeletal limbs only his mansized hands and feet hinted at the stature he might acquire that is the kenning for raven haraldr said authoritatively kennings were the elaborate metaphors favoured by norse poets the gull is a bird and the bird that drinks blood is the raven we will feed the ravens the danemens blood the skald ignored haraldr and squinted at the men approaching in the dim light he dipped to his knee when he recognised king olaf the king was attended by jarl rognvald and two of his housekarls members of his personal guard olaf jarl rognvald listen dark nigh the dread of arrowstorm haraldr broke off when he saw the grim set of olafs face haraldr olafs beefy hands engulfed his brothers frail shoulders this morning i am going to ask you to serve your king and our norway with a hard task it is the most difficult i will ask of any man this entire day haraldr had already imagined so many acts of his own heroism that he hardly knew which image to supply now that his years of daydreaming had culminated in reality what feat did his brother and king require you cannot enter the shieldwall today haraldrs head snapped back as if he had been struck he was too shocked to say anything guaka and asti olaf indicated the housekarls are going to take you to rus you have heard me talk of the rus queen ingigerd i want you to stay at the rus court in kiev until you are told it is safe to return home your name will be known only to guaka and asti and to ingigerd and her husband olaf squeezed haraldrs shoulders so hard that the boys eyes glazed with pain you must swear to me on your fathers soul that you will tell no one else your name until you are able to return home to norway no one if anyone discovers who you are you will never come home i can promise you that haraldr sniffled and tried to force his shoulders up and his chest out i wont go to rus my wandofwounds will feed the ravenwine to those danesucking dung haulers olaf squeezed haraldrs shoulders again haraldr you have not passed fifteen summers i never intended to let you fight no boy your age will ever die for me you went aviking in your twelfth summer i carried water skins to men who had gone aviking the skald thorfinn munnr says you killed a man that same year olaf shook his ponderous head wearily when a man becomes king he magically grows two ells taller and suddenly he has ploughed the bellybarley of a different woman for each night since he was a swaddled infant the truth is that i became strong because i was not asked to pull an oar until my back was ready for it that is how i intend it for you my back is ready if you are going to fight here i am staying with you i do not have the time to convince you that i am not jesting little brother we are not playing games at nidaros i am aware of that olafs hands gripped so hard that haraldr thought his bones would be ground to meal you are about to shame yourself if i have to have you tied up i will and if i have to tie my sword to my hand i am going to fight today haraldr was momentarily startled by his own shrill shouting his face was suddenly brilliant with outrage olaf reached swiftly for haraldrs sword and whipped the blade out of his brothers scabbard haraldr leapt like a springing cat his eyes wild he clamped both hands on olafs wrist which was as thick as a small tree and wrestled it with mad fury as if it were indeed a tree he was trying to uproot with his free hand olaf tried to prise haraldrs astonishingly powerful grip but after a moment gave up he drew back his immense fist and clobbered haraldr just behind the ear haraldr dizzied and fell to his knees sparks popping in his head you dont have to truss me up he said meekly this isnt finished he told himself olaf gave haraldrs sword to guaka you must go before it gets too light he brought his bristling burly face close to haraldrs and his eyes were dark endlessly deep as if fate had somehow chased the entire starflecked universe into their void this cant be happening haraldr told himself but olafs eyes said it was do you swear on your fathers soul not to reveal your name to anyone haraldr swallowed thickly a cold stone seemed to be stuck in his throat i swear it olafs eyes filled again not with life but with the swirling mists of memory haraldr when you get to rus you must remember me to queen ingigerd tell her she was with me he snatched his brother into his arms and held him against his massive metalled chest i will always be beside you olaf said no matter where you are no matter where i am i love you little brother the next thing haraldr knew he was walking into the pall of the new day guaka and asti flanking him and the tears on his cheeks were cold ill carry it guaka shrugged and handed haraldr his sword the dense forest was dappled with midmorning light the patches of sky visible through the trees were like glazed cerulean tiles the ether of the pine resin was intoxicating to the right only fifty ells away the woods parted and a field of large jumbled black rocks descended to a nearly dry creek guaka i have to piss guaka turned to asti the towering armoured housekarl shook his head as if to ask we have to go all the way to rus with him haraldr pointed to a dark almost mysterious clump of pines to his left i need to go in there guaka grinned knowingly at asti and again shook his head you can go right here we dont mind haraldr hiked up his byrnnie and tunic his urine splashed over the pine needles for a moment and then he turned quickly and directed the stream over guakas bare knees kristr damn shouted guaka and he danced backwards several steps haraldr immediately dashed to his right through the woods and onto the field of boulders in spite of his gawky frame he moved across the big rocks with the grace of a panther the housekarls followed bellowing obscenities but they had nowhere near haraldrs agility or speed on such crude terrain haraldr crossed the trickling creek loped over the rocks on the opposite side and disappeared into the forest haraldr crouched behind a parapet of smooth black boulders on a small hill overlooking his brothers encampment the meadow was like an emerald platter before him at one end half a dozen huge fractured black boulders lay on the grass as if tossed there by a giants hand olafs men had already set themselves in the classic shieldwall defence a circle three men thick and five hundred men round shoulder to shoulder an enormous ring plated with steel and bristling with spears inside this human fort were the king his skalds and his housekarls haraldr could easily distinguish the tiny jewellike figure of olaf he wore a blue silk tunic over his lacquered steel byrnnie and his white enamelled shield was embossed with a large gold cross three bowshots beyond this formation almost directly opposite haraldr the forested slightly elevated rim of the meadow teemed with the vanguard of the opposing horde in their predominantly brown canvas byrnnies they looked like a muddy wave silted with silvery steel blades and armour about to burst from the forest and crash down the slope the battle oath of olafs army was clearly discernible forward forward kristrmen crossmen the shieldwall advanced towards the line of trees virtually without distortion of its immaculate geometry from the forest came a vast exhalation thor crushes all the metalflecked turbid wave of the danes men came out of the trees multihued battle standards carried along like the masts of a vast miniature fleet dense clouds of arrows rose up from both armies flying as swiftly as passing shadows spears and javelins darted in quick glittering volleys the wave surged against the shieldwall and halted haraldr watched the miniaturized conflict in utter fascination forcing himself to adhere to his plan wait until the crucial moment and then rush to his brothers rescue he had a vision of himself in the setting sun acclaimed on the field of fray amid the corpses of his foes the youngest marshal in the history of norway as he dreamed he vaguely wondered why the sky was darkening a small portion of the shieldwall buckled in and haraldrs heart thudded as his brothers goldembroidered standard ringed by his housekarls moved to buttress the defence but it was not yet time the breach was quickly repaired haraldr noticed that the cloud had still not moved from the sun and that it was a very dark cloud yet why was the rest of the sky a flawless deep cobalt blue he finally gave up a moment of his battle for a look over his head he gasped and stood gaping no longer concerned about revealing his hiding place it was another wonder a celestial parallel to the marvel at his feet in the stillbrilliant unmarred sky the sun was dying it was as if a crescent chunk had been taken by some great jaws he distantly remembered a man at court talking about a day when the sun had vanished and the midday became midnight much more distinct in his mind were the pagan tales he had raptly listened to jarl rognvald had often talked of ragnarok the doom of the gods when the wolf fenrir would swallow the sun only to be devoured in turn by the black dragon of nidafell in the last night of creation haraldr weighed the two theories and concluded that this portent was too coincidental with the affairs of men to be merely an accident of nature it was the work of the old gods he squinted at the sky until his face hurt fenrir only slowly ingested the sun but the day darkened more quickly than a sunset in a deep fjord the din of battle fell in concert to the fading light thousands of heads tilted upwards to watch an even more epochal confrontation the unearthly wails of the wounded no longer masked by the screams of combat carried across the meadow the landscape became coppery almost fiery as the mythic jaws swallowed all but a final desperately glimmering fragment of the sun haraldr looked at his sword his arms blood blood sun blood sky blood on the land his mind went blank perfectly suspended between wonder and fear the wind gusted from the meadow carrying with it the ferric scent of opened flesh the dying voices rose in a harrowing dirge haraldr plunged into fear he scrambled from his redoubt tumbled part of the way down the slope and then he was conscious only of the bloodtinted grass racing beneath him no one stopped haraldr from entering the shieldwall he looked about bewildered at the craning warriors a wounded man moaned only a few ells from him shouting began from the front of the shieldwall but haraldr could not see what was happening because the huge armoured backs of the housekarls blocked his view men pushed back towards him in large groups their faces drenched with sweat the shouts were louder still and they were joined by the shriek of metal on metal it seemed to haraldr that he could actually feel the noise like needles in his bones a housekarl staggered towards him like a careening metal beast coughing up blood his lips and chin glazed crimson and then they were all running he followed them to his right not really knowing why until they stopped abruptly he did not know where he was until he realized that the huge black boulders he had seen from his perch were now at his back he could reach out and feel the cold stone he saw olafs standard only half a dozen ells in front of him the gold dragon embroidered on it bloodied by the moribund sun the grip on his arm was like a sword stroke by all the gods where did you come from shouted jarl rognvald his byrnnie was smeared with blood and two deep open cuts intersected the seams on his cheeks the jarl bellowed almost frantically for olaf olaf finally shouldered through the crush of housekarls his demonchased eyes did not change expression when he saw haraldr he shouted in jarl rognvalds ear without looking at haraldr again he turned and immediately went forward jarl rognvald let haraldrs arm go but stayed by him it was too much for haraldr to acknowledge that this was all that was left that the shieldwall had been shattered and most of olafs men engulfed by the brown wave that the housekarls had set this last line of defence against the boulders instead a heedless bravado seemed to pump up his gangling limbs and he wriggled between the metal torsos of the housekarls pushing to the front the enemy separated from the housekarls by a no mans land no broader than two arms spans were a swordwaving spearthrusting barking howling wall teeming like an immense pack of monstrous deadly vermin he was close enough to see their gnashing teeth their eyes were thousands of fiery coals an eerie hush fell as five huge men stepped into the no mans land four of them wore steel byrnnies but the man in the centre the tallest and stoutest of them wore an armour of layered hides with the fur still attached berserks or bearshirts were said to wear such hide armour and when odin gave them the battlerage no man could stand before them the berserk took another step forward his black beard had white streaks his eyebrows hacked away in countless frays were bestial whiskered tufts above tiny red eyes the end of his nose had been sliced off in one of his previous combats his truncated nostrils were huge and upturned like a pigs snout i am thorir called the hound he said his voice strangely tranquil you are lost give up your king and your prince and our accounts will be settled the housekarls answered with a gale of obscenities sow fucker corpse lover the hound calmly waited eyes flickering until the outburst had ended then you will all die he said i know the king he pointed at olaf when we begin again i will kill him first the tiny red eyes began to roam among the housekarls as piercing as hot sharp irons and haraldr knew what they were searching for he was too mesmerized to look away and the moment of contact was like a knife slitting him from his groin to his windpipe ripping out his fools courage and replacing it with a cold leaden mortal dread i think the boy is the prince said the hound he turned to the silent army behind him for confirmation and several men nodded i will kill him as well olafs vast bulk hurtled from within his cordon of housekarls someone grabbed haraldr and pulled him back and he fell hard on his seat but before he went down he glimpsed his brothers sword pound into the hounds furry hide armour men stepped over and on him and he thought he would be trampled he heard a moment later the explosive collision of the two armies the screech of clashing steel and the desperate thundering oaths of doomed men then he could see olaf and thorir the hound again they seemed to move so slowly like figures in a nightmare olafs blade flashed in long rubytinted strokes again and again and yet the hound still stood then a third man entered the dreamlike vignette one of the huge men who had come forward with the hound this intruder crouched low and when his sword scythed parallel to the ground haraldr perceived it moving much more swiftly everything was speeding up and the blade struck olafs massive leg and recoiled and olafs knee seemed to disintegrate and he was falling another man stepped into haraldrs suddenly rushing nightmare and his spear caught olaf under his byrnnie jerking him up and sideways before it was pulled from his belly olafs hand clutched but he could not grasp and his slick coiled bowels began to ooze down his thighs a sword struck his neck and his head tilted freakishly to the side and blood pumped onto his shoulder the blow knocked haraldr on his back and something flew swiftly into his eye like an angry bird and his vision flooded with warm serum stand to fight shrieked a voice so loud it could only have come from inside his skull but his limbs were locked in an icy dread and a terrible truth quarrelled with the other voice i am a coward it said as his fright gushed out of him and soiled his breeches with a repulsive warmth a boot crunched with stunning force into his chest his heart painfully bruised by his ribs seemed to beg for death if only he would not have to stand and face it the hound was above him the huge nostrils the horrible sucking haraldr lay there frozen with terror his head screaming with the dark poetry of the last instant in time the hounds sword rose high lost in bloodtinted night it was no sword it was a creature a ravens beak descending falling from night into night then there was a terrific concussion as if the sun had exploded in its final dying fury and haraldr fell away from its heat and light falling falling endlessly into the vast airless utterly black craw of the last dragon the man from denmark grasped the jaw and turned the corpses puffy claret face towards him the head flopped as if no longer attached to the neck he fanned away the flies and slipped open the livid eyelids for a moment the blue eyes glared in a ghostly fury he stood and faced the hound this is king olaf now show me the prince haraldr sigurdarson the hounds chest heaved and the air wheezed through his gaping nostrils i struck him on the helm there was blood all over his face then two men attacked me when i finished with them i saw him still lying there i dont see how he could have got away but some men were able to flee no more than two or three cowards or men intent on saving their prince the man from denmark removed a bulging leather wallet from his expensive frisian wool cloak and shook out four gold bezants my king said he would pay you the bounty for the king of norway and his heir i give you partial payment as the task has yet to be completed but consider how much easier your errand has become the man from denmark hefted the wallet before today you had to kill a king and a prince to earn this now you only have to kill a fugitive boy the hound held the gold coins in his flat palm and gently prodded them with his scarred bloodsmeared fingers almost as if they were small delicate creatures of a species he had never imagined existed haraldr sigurdarson he said quietly and then he closed his huge fist isle of prote sea of marmara september learning is but foliage compared to the fruits of a holy life and the tree that bears nothing but foliage must be cut down and burned but the finest result is when the fruit is set amongst its foliage father katalakon permitted himself the vanity of a slight smile as he finished his impromptu recitation he was a tall man his long but neatly combed hair and beard the colour of the grey sea mist that on this bright day was blessedly still only a dreary memory of winters past and a foreboding of the cold months ahead indeed all of the fruits the pantocrator had delivered to his holy brethren on the isle of prote were on this day brightly lit by the brilliant candle of our lords glorious vault the september sun gleamed off the floor of roseveined proconesian marble and burnished the gold acanthusleaf pattern that bordered the lacquered coffered ceiling of the library father katalakon turned to the man next to him of course i do not intend to convey that your intimacy with the words of theodore the studite requires a restorative from my lips brother symeon wisdom is never disgraced by repetition father abbot as holiness is only cultured by our efforts to emulate it brother symeon the new chartophylax or archivist of the monastery at prote was content to allow the father abbot to meander towards their objective after all brother symeon reminded himself he would not have been summoned here to prote had he not long ago achieved the state of apathia that bridled impetuous worldly desires he looked about the library with admiration the sumptuous marble revetments and gilded scriptoria attested to the material abundance of prote while the shelves stacked with books some bound in oak many sheathed in carved ivory cloisonne or gems revealed spiritual wealth brother symeon peered through the clear glass panes of the gracefully arched windows beneath him sunwashed rocks fell away to the gemblue sea of marmara so what i have been told of prote was no exaggeration reflected brother symeon the island scarcely has enough arable soil to support a herb garden and yet the splendours of the establishment rival those of the monasteries at bithynia and chios ah well christ the pantocrator will no doubt soon reveal the identity of protes benefactor all things according to his immutable plan father katalakon appraised his new archivist like the father abbot brother symeon wore the long black wool frock and high round cap common to all the monastic orders of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith yes father katalakon was satisfied that his careful inquiries had indeed been rewarded the aged brother symeon had manifested no impatience on this deliberately circumlocutional tour of the facilities nor had he evidenced any curiosity as to the source of this magnificence of course brother symeon had become noticeably weary of the walking his thin shoulders slumping and his lips purpling against his snowy beard hopefully the new chartophylax would live long enough to finish his archival research here on prote most certainly he would not live long enough to speak of those labours elsewhere even if his worldly passions were somehow revived by what he might find amid the late father abbot giorgioss voluminous archives well it was time one could linger here in contemplation of these glories until the trumpet of judgement sounded father katalakon graciously extended his hand to brother symeon but i am sure you are curious to see the documents of which i have written to you the carved wooden door slid noiselessly to reveal a chamber lit by an ornate glassandgold candelabra and a single window looking onto an enclosed private court brother symeon virtually gasped in astonishment the floor paved with mosscoloured thessalian marble was almost entirely obscured by dozens of stacks of unbound parchments some of the bundles wrapped in silk cords rose almost to father katalakons lofty chin surrounded by these thousands upon thousands of documents was a marvellous little writing cabinet with an ivory and niello top and gold fittings on the lacquered wooden drawers yes you see that i did not embellish fact when i wrote to you that father abbot giorgios may christ the pantocrator bless and sanctify his soul was an extraordinarily prodigious correspondent and certainly you can see why a chartophylax of your eminent repute was required father katalakon slid the door closed his hazel eyes took on a flinty texture in the light from the window his voice lowered and lost its unctuous buoyancy father abbot giorgios was a man of unusual energies and occupations not only did he correspond copiously with other holy men from places as distant as cappadocia and rome but he also exchanged letters with many eminent persons in the world our lord has inveighed us to turn our backs upon no doubt he diverted many souls from the foul paths of perdition to less errant if more arduously inclined avenues of righteousness father katalakon looked out on the courtyard a blueandgoldtiled fountain lofted pearly spray father abbot giorgios gave these weary souls the accumulation of his own holy wisdom and they in turn gave to his holy establishment at prote from their wordly accumulations father katalakon looked directly into brother symeons eyes if he saw any retreat there he would send the man away the foremost patron of prote was the purpleborn eudocia resumed father katalakon after his searching pause niece of the late emperor and autocrator basil called the bulgarslayer daughter of the late emperor and autocrator constantine sister of the empress and basilissa zoe the purpleborn and sister of the augusta theodora under the blessed eudocias generous auspices the typicon granting our establishment its current rights and privileges was signed by the emperor and autocrator basil the bulgarslayer father abbot giorgios was eudocias friend and counsellor it was he who persuaded her to renounce her temporal ambitions and their concomitant woes and join the sisters of the convent of the theotokos in protovestiary father katalakon paused again and lowered his steelcoloured eyebrows father abbot giorgios was also the purpleborn eudocias confessor the fountain in the little courtyard faintly gurgled over the long pause i am not a hesychaste a silent monk brother symeon finally offered in a soft yet implacable voice but in the matter of the archives that christ the pantocrator has placed in my keeping my silence has been vowed for many many years yes said father katalakon as he slid the door open and prepared to leave his new chartophylax to his holy duties i knew that when i asked the pantocrator to send you to us father katalakon quickly left the library and walked past the towering domed apse of protes splendid church of the holy apostles through the colonnaded arcade that fronted the barrelvaulted cells of the monks and entered the lovely cypress grove that carried the procession of the arcade out along the wooded green spine of the little island he walked swiftly savouring the rich sea air his step lifted by the conviction that he had acted both decisively and prudently if the sisters of theotokos in protovestiary were not overly apprehensive and he had never known them to be so then the purpleborn eudocia would soon escape the miseries and blandishments of the flesh and take her place at the feet of christ the pantocrator and then who would prevent protes generous typicon from being redrafted by the new emperor unless of course there was an heir to whom the rights to the holy establishment at prote might be transferred the tiny convent at prote lay just beneath the point where the verdant spine of the island again dipped a rocky flank into the sea the chapel had three small domes and the cells refectory and larder were wrapped round the landwardpointing apse like a bent elbow the mouldy stone complex was deserted having been occupied only once for less than a year and that seventeen years ago father katalakon had been on prote then though he had only been cellarer at that time as such he had not been privileged to visit the little convent still he had heard the play of promiscuous lips among some of the brethren father katalakon descended to the flagstone path in front of the stark empty cells the plaster had begun to chip from the walls and here and there weeds prised apart the underlying courses of bricks the wind came from the north in the woods behind the empty convent leaves rattled the wooden doors to the cells were rotting and the father abbot decided not to open one i am certain it was the purpleborn eudocia who resided here thought father katalakon as to the rumours of the child born here i am certain of that as well and i expect brother symeon to provide me proof but that will not be enough to save our establishment what brother symeon must uncover are the names who was the father and yet more important vastly so where is the child the wind gusted and eddied swirling leaves against the doors of the cells father katalakon looked north towards the unseen but profoundly felt presence of mighty constantinople he shuddered despite the dazzling silver light on the heaving sea having taken this step he now had to admit to himself that it was not simply the fate of their holy enterprise on prote that was at stake if father katalakon succeeded in finding this child the fate of the empire was in his hands i kiev rus land ad i am condemned to spend my life looking out of windows elisevett sighed trying to sound as weary of life as possible for a fifteenyearold virgin she settled into the embroidered cushion she had placed in the deeply recessed window seat her scarlet silk robe was varnished with the candlelight diffusing from the adjacent clerestory she pressed the tip of her longbridged nose to the glass and looked out into the night past the dim outlines of the domed and peaked palace roofs and down the pineshrouded bluffs of the citadel of kiev the dnieper river looked like ink striated with gold the shimmering reflections of the hundreds of torches that flared along the sandy beaches the pounding of the shipwrights hammers and the shouted commands to the porters were a muffled distant din if she were the merest furtrader or strugpoler elisevett reflected or even a reeking tork slave girl she would be able to journey down that river but of course the princess of rus would not be permitted to go no she would spend her life in terems and churches first waiting upon her fathers bidding then upon whomever he chose for her elisevett thought of her mother so dry and wasted like a tree with the sap drained that would be her fate as well to look out of windows while the life ran out of her but on this night she would escape that fate on this night she would journey go away for ever right here in the very cathedral where they had so often paraded her dressed like a jewelled silkwrapped little rusalka doll for every gaping miuzhi and liudi in the entire world to stare at in slackjawed wonder no tonight would not be at all like that tonight she would kill the little doll come here she said you can see the lights by the river she turned come here haraldr looked back through the low arched entrance of the tiny storage room on the third floor of the church of the tithe praying that the cathedral was indeed empty he squeezed awkwardly into the window seat he had never been this close to her before her sandy hair pulled back and tightly coiled on either side of her head in the greek fashion seemed streaked with gold he could smell her rosewater scent and hear her breathe he tried to suck air into his constricting lungs he could not imagine what the touch of her would do look at them haraldr watched the points of light swirl like fireflies as the workers moved among the blunt prows of the beached river ships the dark forests beyond the left bank of the dnieper stretched off to an eerily orangefringed horizon the corona of thousands of campfires haraldr shuddered the pechenegs were on the land jarl rognvald told my father you are not going down the river with him my father was not pleased why are you staying elisevett leaned away from haraldr and ran her fingers over the luminous pearls that studded her high silk collar taunting her earnest nordic swain to answer the question she knew he would not while she observed his torment she considered how extraordinary it was that christ she doubted that the lords sinless mother would have interceded on her behalf in this matter had answered her prayers by providing the hapless detskii haraldr nordbrikt he was a suitable vision of course tall and silky golden and so broad in the chest and shoulders with those dazzling blue eyes and that interesting scar that pulled his right eyebrow up slightly but then rakish nordic giants were a plague in rus these days due to her fathers relentless ambitions no what was truly wonderful and extraordinary was the manner in which haraldr nordbrikt affected her mother and father she saw the way her father glared and gasped if this mere detskii in his lesser druzhina offended him so much why didnt the great prince just send him off against the pechenegs and be done with him instead of keeping him around kiev to collect tolls and her mother she all but reached out and caressed haraldr with her eyes not in a leering fashion as an older woman might but with this strange glimmering ember deep within but if haraldr were her mothers lover then her father would also send him off against the pechenegs or could he how mysterious and how wonderful it would be if haraldr nordbrikt were her mothers lover elisevett lowered her thick dark resincoated lashes an utterly feigned expression of modesty i think you are staying because of me haraldr wanted to clutch desperately at this great secret that had just been wrenched from his breast and yet its leaving also filled him with immense joy and relief nothing will ever take me from you his head sang triumphantly but dry chalk seemed to fill his throat and he had to strangle a pathetic creaking whimper elisevett silently acknowledged this initial milestone on her journey and forged ahead she removed a tiny folded parchment from the sleeve of her tunic when haraldr recognised the scrap he became vertiginous with panic and for a moment he imagined himself pitching forward through the window and plunging to his death elisevett squinted over the awkward slavic script what is goldwreathed goddess she asked haraldr raised his hand in the feeble gesture of a dying man and finally forced a syllable out your his palm fluttered near the ornate gold bracelets that twined her arm arm rings you are wreathed in gold i did not say for you to point at me as if i were a serving maid elisevett snapped my father could have you flogged in the podol square if he knew you sent verses to me she lowered her head for a long moment and wondered what she would see when she arrived at her destination it did not matter as long as it was not this she wondered if he would be fearless and foolish enough to follow elisevett looked up at haraldr again her smokyblue eyes wide the embassies have come since i was four months old three weeks ago the prince of hungaria last autumn a king of langobardia i am the third daughter of the great prince to be auctioned off like some shackled kholopy in the podol market in order to bear the swinish brood of some petty tyrant with filthy habits the gifts they have sent my father already fill a chamber her voice lowered to a mysterious wistful sigh you are the first to send me something forbidden she hissed conspiratorially your own verse haraldrs heart rose in his chest like a desperate caged bird the life that had ended four years ago at stiklestad could begin again goldringed cherished snowy vision i am not worthy of you but you have accepted my verses touch me like some wizards conjuring the scarlet robe slinked fluidly past her knees to reveal several inches of firm pale thigh her whisper was like cats fur touch me haraldr inhaled sharply even the damp air seemed to stick in his throat not in this holy place and with the axe her father yaroslav held over his head if you dont i will tell my father that you did haraldr was conscious only of a bead of sweat rolling down his back he watched his trembling hand reach out with the sickening fascination of a boy watching his first execution elisevetts eyes were spikes but his hand crept closer more assured of its desire her thigh was like a rose petal summerplush smooth and warm her white hand pulled his higher his insides were liquid and his skin was pelted with sleet higher downier softer if he went farther his heart would stop stop elisevett pressed her legs together and slowly pulled his hand from between them she knew now that he would have to go with her you could die for what you just did she told him she brought her lips closer and her eyes were fierce manic you know what we must do now she pressed haraldrs face with her silky hands her heavy lashes folded down and her face turned up in bitter triumph it would be over soon haraldr watched her eyes pulse beneath her pale almost translucent lids her winered lips twitched he distantly remembered one of olafs skalds using the word dangerous to describe a woman like an attacking beast her arms were around his neck overwhelming his senses the smell of her the petalsoft cheek the hot breath he spasmed at the first lancing touch of her lips against his and then flesh melted and fused they held gasped teeth grinding then she pushed him away her high breasts heaving beneath her silk this was the moment her eyes found his and made certain that he would obey you know i am as pure as the mother of white christ she said you must teach me the rest was a dream in a pile of white priests vestments silk sliding hard lilac nipples probing the hot downy centre each contact excruciating she was so slick like curiously hot ice one slip and he would be gone it ended suddenly with consummation still in progress haraldr could not believe the paralysing surge in his gristled loins before with the whore jarl rognvald had purchased for him all the ale he had consumed to prepare for his initiation had dulled him sufficiently to allow for what had then seemed a lifetime of wondrous exploration but with love and without ale lovemaking was clearly different their hearts pounded in concert for a moment then elisevett heaved with a single sobbing inhalation she had rid herself of the detestable innocence that tied her childhood the little doll had been smashed by his bludgeoning manhood but there was this strange new sorrow where would she go now the still wet new wings of womanhood began to wilt and suddenly she had a maddening desire to undo all this to go back to the him she had renounced for this new him haraldr clutched his new life in panic why had she begun to cry like this he tried to caress her but she wrenched away and furiously pulled her robe out from among the scattered crumpled vestments she stood tears welling over her dark lashes her scarlet silk draped in front of her im going to have to tell my father what you did she said sobbing two guards preceded him and two followed the noise from the river was now an assault the musicians had started a tinny rehearsal the warmth of the day lingered in ponds of still air as haraldr and his gaolers ascended the steps to the summit of the citadel of kiev they turned beside a stack of freshly quarried granite blocks and entered a colonnaded walkway bordered with newly planted cypresses finally pausing in front of a bronze door embossed with a trident the family crest of the great prince yaroslav of rus haraldr was ordered to wait in an antechamber the guards locked the doors as they left the candelabra were not lit and the only light came from two brass oil lamps hung on opposite walls along the far end of the chamber scaffolding had been erected by visiting greek artists and the chalk outline of a mural traced a phantom image in the faint light he waited on his feet too stunned with terror to begin an accounting of his misery after what seemed like hours he heard footsteps and voices then nothing his legs ached and he slumped against the wall then sat on the cold marble floor his resurrection last night had ended so quickly it might never have happened a butterfly that had flickered across his vision one summer afternoon and was gone kristr was cruel he gave pleasure and then punished for it no this was odin the prophet of fate had finally come to claim the ending that had been stolen from him four years ago the thought provided a melancholy comfort the terrible dark fall that had begun at stiklestad was almost over nordbrikt get up you hamstereating moron youd sleep on the gibbet the lamp flared and yaroslavs scarfaced bailiff kicked at his feet you kissed the devils arse this time he gave haraldr a shove towards the double doors the great prince yaroslavs office was lit by a single flickering lamp set on a massive ivory table inlaid with silver tridents leather and ivorybound manuscripts were stacked at yaroslavs left elbow and he pushed them away the great princes stubby larvaelike fingers crept over the tabletop as if he were fumbling for something in the dark finally he looked up his face had a greasy slightly jaundiced pallor that closely matched the colour of the tabletop purple folds almost like separate appendages hung beneath his wide henseggs eyes haraldr nordbrikt haraldr sigurdarson said yaroslav in a weary rattling voice it was as if he were deciding which of the two names offended him the most i spend too much time dealing with yaroslav paused and gasped you yaroslavs right hand snatched a small jewelled replica of a cathedral and his busy fingers went to work on it now i understand that you have brought some sort of suit to my third daughter the great princes voice was so introspective that haraldr was not certain he had heard properly did he dream this he soared on a gust of bewilderment and hope the great prince rose stepped round the table with his jerky lame gait and stood with his stout belly aimed at haraldrs belt his glaring pop eyes offered no hope at all you are the opposite of me in every way god in his ineffable wisdom made you tall and straight i am short and crooked your father and then your brother worshipped you as if you were the sacred skull of st andrew my father the blasphemous fornicator banished me to rostov and then still tried to extort tribute from me and i fought my brother syvataspolk he of the foulsmelling grave for ten years for the right to rule this city the great princes voice was steadily rising his face darkening and yet i am the one called the great prince and all europe comes to me and even the greek emperor calls me friend and you yaroslav gulped for air like a fish out of water you are a prince without a name much less any subject who would raise any sword for him or tithe a grivna to his cause your rank is detskii in my lesser druzhina i believe you now have the lofty responsibility of collecting the toll at the lybed bridge and i can tell you on good authority that you will never be promoted even to pasynok haraldr boiled in the acid of four years humiliation another voice screamed at him but it was not yaroslavs i know why you regard me with such contempt yaroslav paused like a man on the brink of a sheer promontory then gulped and stepped forward you affront the great prince because you know as indeed the scabrous tales are recited in every court in the north because your brother yaroslav stuttered with rage your brother knew my wife because your brother fouled my wife with his stinking lechery your brother put his hands all over my wife and spoiled her and after all i did for him he rutted her like the drooling satyr he was he ruined her with his filthy lusts haraldr had not known this yes his brother had always spoken of ingigerd with reverence but haraldr had never imagined that they had been lovers his frigid leaden stomach plunged towards the floor now he understood the sin for which he had been punished for four miserable years stop this husband haraldr peered with terrified wonder into the dark corner of the room gaunt wraithlike a cloak wrapped round her like a burial shroud sat ingigerd queen of rus haraldr had not even noticed her when he had entered the outline of her broad angular shoulders became visible as she rose from her chair you knew that i was not pure before you ever held me i have given you four sons and three daughters it was my father the same who forbade me to marry the man who touched me first who sent as my dower the swedish mercenaries who defeated your brother syvataspolk it was my lover she spat out the word olaf who sent his friend eymund to take novgorod for you ingigerd stepped towards the light and clapped her hands to the breasts now low and shrivelled that men had once called the great snowy joycliffs of sweden your dynasty is built on this corrupt flesh great prince yaroslav returned to his chair and sat with a cringing posture he deeply regretted that the sight of norways royal excrement had caused him to vent his old jealousy in this unfortunate display he considered again the counsel his wife had offered him earlier in the day when his daughter elisevett had come to him with another of her endless vexations haraldr as ingigerd had pointed out was norways rightful heir and reliable norse military assistance such as might be provided by a grateful soninlaw was essential to the survival of yaroslavs dynasty and then elisevett was no prize she was a mere third daughter an intractable child whose precipitate temperament might break an alliance as easily as her precocious loins might build one but the problem with this marriage was as were all problems of statecraft pecuniary currently haraldr offered nothing but liabilities the reclamation of his throne would require a considerable fortune and at the moment haraldr was worth more dead than alive the purse now offered for the head of haraldr sigurdarson was a staggering one thousand gold bezants and it seemed that virtually every norseman in rus was intent on winning that bounty save the most ardent norwegian patriots yaroslav himself had been tempted more than once to solve several of his problems by surrendering the fugitive prince of norway of course his wife would have bitten his balls off so it was just as well he had resisted haraldr however was not the kind of man who seemed likely to win mens loyalty so it would be pointless to risk a single silver grivna on the chance he might reclaim his throne but if haraldr could finance his own reconquest of norway he would be worth the risk of a third daughter of course haraldr would need the money quickly while elisevett was still young without an heir to bind norway to rus the exercise was pointless and there was only one place in the world where a layabout like haraldr could acquire a fortune virtually overnight and if haraldr never returned from that journey what would have been lost even elisevett had dozens of other suitors haraldr my father married no less than the daughter of the greek emperor do you know what he gave the emperor in exchange for his bride kherson the entire city of kherson haraldr stared maniacally at yaroslav it was all he could do to keep from shouting ill give you a nation denmark or angleland or bulgaria haraldr it would be enough for me to know that norway was a grandsons birthright but presently you are sovereign of nothing beyond your own boots and i cannot worry about defending you against your legions of enemies when my own cities are besieged by pechenegs and i need the cooperation of all norsemen in ridding rus of the eternally menacing pagan horde yaroslavs throat rattled and he sighed as if he could hardly go on you are aware of course how valuable your corpse is i feel that if you stay here it is only a matter of time before you are found out yesterday i received a correspondence from a jarl of denmark who has served me ably in my druzhina in novgorod i wont reveal his name to you as i will not reveal yours to him a correspondence inquiring if i harbour the prince of norway at my court a week ago my own podiezdnoi asked me if i had heard rumours that the lost prince of norway the one who ran from stiklestad is a fugitive in kiev yaroslav paused and looked at haraldr searchingly are you beginning to understand haraldr was too stunned to think an alarming metallic buzzing echoed in his ears yaroslav sucked in a weary rattling breath haraldr my concerns are those of statecraft he glanced surreptitiously at his queen had your brother paid more attention to that discipline and less to he hesitated well yes had your brother been more careful he would not have confronted king knut when he did in the way he did and perhaps i would not at this time be concerned with your enemies he stopped distracted i forget myself yes well then as you might know the pechenegs have blocked the dnieper for eight years now so now my primary concern is to open the river to commerce once again employ our profits to summon additional military assistance and exterminate the pechenegs as we have the avars and chuds and most recently the poles your countryman jarl rognvald has gratefully accepted my commission to lead the trade flotilla to constantinople perhaps you could in some small fashion contribute to the success of this enterprise the words were like an axe thudding into haraldrs neck the journey down the dnieper was a game of chance that few would win even jarl rognvald admitted that he himself would be unlikely to see the walls of constantinople the jarl would risk the deadly voyage on the slimmest wager that norway might profit but he did not think norway would gain if her prince slept in the dnieper haraldr had in turn hardly pushed to go and not simply for her since stiklestad he had known sorrow and loneliness until they were like faces before him and even as his breast ached at the thought of leaving elisevett he knew that he could somehow endure this terrible extra measure of longing but on the river he would have to look at a face he knew he could never confront again he would have to look again at fear and fear would humble him before the whole world because fear had been with him that day at stiklestad even now the blooddark nightmare flew before his eyes and fear knew him for what he was a coward yaroslavs small ragged teeth appeared briefly cheer boy many rewards wait at the rivers end surely even an idler like yourself has dreamed of service in the emperors varangian guard indeed we have received an eminent representative of the emperors guard this very afternoon a man of greek subtlety and refinement hakon called fireeyes you would do well to emulate his industry haraldr turned from the nightmare past to the nightmares that waited ahead on the river hakon fireeyes second in rank to mar hunrodarson the widefamed commander of the great kings varangian guard and next to mar himself the most feared and brutal warrior in the world for weeks now it had been rumoured that hakon would join the expedition to miklagardr and that he would bring with him five hundred handpicked candidates for the varangian guard now fear would have five hundred faces and a demon to lead them so there said yaroslav rising and holding his stubby fingers out to haraldr lesser men than you have ventured to constantinople and returned with a kings endowment so might you so goodbye to haraldr nordbrikt let us hope that if we see you again you will be someone else ingigerd followed haraldr into the antechamber she caught his arms and turned him the long wilted stems of her fingers about his wrists you know it is the only way now jarl rognvald will care for you and elisevett and i will pray for you she surprised haraldr with a wiry intense embrace she had never even touched him before always staying back as if his flesh might rouse some banished spectre i will miss you more than elisevett shall she is young i am finished her irises were like melting blue ice she took his face in her hands and gazed into his eyes as if this were the last time she would ever consume that lifegiving draught her throat corded with a sob your eyes said ingigerd queen of rus as softly as a deathbed prayer in your eyes he lives the slap on the back of his head was playful but haraldr wrestled for his sword with hands clumsied by wine leave that in your scabbard riverfarers and womanpraisers need their fingers jarl rognvald grinned he had also been busy at the mead trenches but the jarl lost only his melancholy in the ale jarl haraldr held up his sloshing wine bag in mute apology i know i talked with yaroslav but youre sailing with me tomorrow well be on the dnieper you leave nothing here my boy nothing but think what you might return to haraldr tried to focus jarl do you think that yaroslav will really consider my suit haraldr my boy in the morning we put out for miklagardr miklagardr to seek the widest fame and goldest glory a man can seek the grik emperor can bestow a princesss dower as easily as a norse king might give his man an arm ring your dreams await you there yes my dreams thought haraldr for a chilling instant sobered jarl rognvald observed the shadow on his wards face and grinned foolishly while the demons of his own mind soughed and shrieked tomorrow morning he would lead almost five hundred ships and twenty thousand men down the dnieper if odin were extraordinarily lavish with his favours a third of those ships and men might return to kiev jarl rognvald had accepted yaroslavs onerous charge through the same rigid sense of duty that had driven him throughout his life he was the best man norse or slav to command the flotilla and as far as he was concerned that alone obligated him to lead however ill advised the great princes venture might be but that was before norways fate had been cast upon the murderous dnieper haraldr we all fear the river the jarl wrapped a big rough hand around haraldrs neck why do you think that every man of us has tonight summoned the heron of forgetfulness he grabbed haraldrs arm lets walk i must find the grik trade ambassador and the entire world is here to see the flat sandy plain just north of the bluffwalled citadel of kiev was strewn with acres of cargo lit by moving torches corded stacks of furs endless buckets of beeswax and honey and groups of predominantly darkhued resigned slaves enough for an army roped together at the feet farmers dragged their sledges full of cabbages turnips and onions barrels of ale and salted meat were rolled along the maze of timber paths to the dnieper screeching from their canvas booths merchants did a lucrative lastminute business in tools armour and burlap for tents and awnings strange foreign tongues clashed like flocks of exotic birds yaroslavs military band filled the air with the whirling tinny melodies of pipes tambourines and horns the fatbodied river ships lined the ghostly grey sandshore like an enormous herd of beached leviathans the jarl pointed out two silksheathed figures he straightened his own tunic and fastened the top two buttons of haraldrs jacket his voice returned to its usual gravity haraldr the grik trade ambassador will have an interpreter with him a grik likewise but this man speaks our tongue as well as you or i like many grik courtmen this interpreter has been gelded so that he may serve the emperor without aspiring to his throne he will have a face as smooth as a womans please do not stare at him he still has his dignity the byzantine trade ambassador wore an anklelength tunic of red silk dark tightlyringed hair and a curling beard framed his high feminine cheekbones he seemed to peer through the norseman as if he were looking through a pane of glass the little hairless man beside the ambassador robed in plainer silk smiled broadly the ambassador still evidenced no awareness of the two norsemen after an awkward moment the eunuch spoke in a high humming voice greetings jarl rognvald haraldr was astonished at the flawless pronunciation and undetectable accent the eunuch cleared his throat for ironic emphasis and his eyes sparkled conspiratorially we both greet you at least i am certain that the august ambassador would greet you if he were not so busily engaged in ignoring you gregory offered jarl rognvald i want you to meet haraldr nordbrikt i ask you to treat him as you would my son youll find him different from most young men of our race he has a special passion jarl rognvald pounded his breast strong but gentle he writes verse the jarl rustled haraldrs long silky hair sometimes we say that our skalds drink the ale of odin well tonight haraldr has drunk only ale a poet said gregory appreciatively then he must learn of homer the ambassador wiped his mouth as if trying to remove some contamination and spoke sharply to gregory in the flowing interminably circuitous rhythm of the greek tongue his comments went on for several minutes gregory nodded respectfully from time to time jarl rognvald it is sometimes argued that in our government a man rises on the accumulation of his words said gregory when the ambassador had finished the little eunuch struggled to combat a smile of course that is not true if it were our august ambassador already would have ascended to the imperial throne what he has said is this first i am not to exchange inessential pleasantries with you northern barbaroi forgive me but i am afraid you will have to become accustomed to that term more pertinently the documents for the entire fleet of four hundred and eightysix ships are now in order there is nothing to prevent our departure unless of course the august ambassador decides to deliver an address to inaugurate our voyage jarl rognvald forced himself not to laugh he presumed that the ambassador would be only too eager to take offence have you seen hakon i dont want to wait until the morning to speak with him gregory lifted a wry eyebrow i am afraid i have seen more of the manglavite than i had hoped manglavite asked haraldr hakon fireeyes holds the official title of manglavite he symbolically clears the path for the emperor in official processions said gregory it is an extraordinary honour he did not add that it was a particularly extraordinary honour for a barbaros and a frightening testament to the enormous malignant power of hakons patron mar hunrodarson gregory led the jarl and haraldr to the varangian encampment it seemed as if all of the five hundred swaggering young warriors had assembled in a rollicking mob around some central attraction haraldr reluctantly followed the jarl into their midst though he was taller and broader than all but a few he felt as if his cowardice were a physical defect they would immediately recognize and ridicule at the centre of the crowd was a naked woman a coarsely ruddy farm girl with shortcropped slaves hair firm heavy buttocks and small breasts with boyish nipples she stared numbly at a man sitting on an ale barrel he was huge even by norse standards he wore a short lacquered gold byrnnie but was naked below the waist his legs were so thickly muscled they seemed like the pillars of some colossal temple his head slumped towards his chest and his long golden hair concealed his face he held a hand to his crotch as if he had been injured it was a moment before haraldr realized that the giant was actually stroking his own genitals apparently trying to coax an erection so that he could publicly penetrate the unfortunate slave girl then haraldr noticed the other naked slave a slender girl who sat forlornly in the sand blood smeared her inner thighs she was no doubt the reason for the giants temporary impotence several more slave girls roped together and wearing coarse wool tunics stood behind her dreadfully waiting their turn the giant looked up his long golden beard was plaited into dozens of tiny braids and spangled with shimmering bits of gold the eponymous orange flecks in his blue irises were clearly visible hakons fireeyes swept about crazily as dangerous as weapons and finally targeted jarl rognvald hakons thick brutish lips parted offering a huge ivory grin jarl rognvald he said casually it seems my quiver is temporarily empty his head slumped again and he returned his attention to his limp penis jarl rognvald was rigid with disgust to capture own and trade in slaves was accepted in the north but to abuse them particularly in this fashion was an outrage but there was trouble enough waiting for him on the dnieper and he could not afford a row with the leader of the five hundred most able warriors under his overall command ill speak with hakon in the morning he told haraldr wearily a young man with wispy chin whiskers bounded from the crowd and began a recitation in the strident tones of the skald saterofravens fullstrong arm of the great king he whose foreheadmoons glow with the starsofhearth he raised his arm and flourished his hand as if scattering gold dust into the sky hakon looked up at the young skald grettir he chortled have you found me fresh meat something to temper my freyspike yes heretichewer grettir moved his hands in suggestion of a womans curves itrvaxinn good lines like a wellcrafted norse dragonship the naked farm girl was pushed aside two varangians dragged the next victim through the crowd at the sight of her haraldr knew he could not leave though she was cloaked in a dirty burlap tunic and bound at her wrists and ankles this young woman obviously had not been born to accept slavery her skin was as lustrously white as her uncropped hair was black she snapped like a badger at grettirs hand and he had to wrestle her chin up for hakons inspection her agate eyes were brightly polished with anger her nose was long and fine with a delicate sharp tip even in the face of the humiliation that awaited her she had an unmistakable nobility haraldrs breast ached with her loveliness and her terrible fate a voice whispered at him then faded he did not know what it said a torrent of obscene speculation followed from the crowd imagine the dark foliage that garlands her thighgorge heretichewer grettir grimaced as he struggled to steady the girls writhing head you had better expect a fight if you try to sail up this fjord hakon grinned the blood from the wound freyja hews will bless our journey his disproportionately small penis now stood with plumhued stiffness he reached out with an enormous apelike arm seized the girls long black mane and forced her to stumble between his massive spread thighs she became curiously acquiescent and merely glared as he brought her mouth to his there was a moment of contact and then her head jerked violently hakon bellowed and almost pitched backwards off his perch blood streamed from his lacerated nose hakon dabbed at his nose with one hand the other wrapped almost entirely around the girls neck jarl rognvald decided that he would intercede if hakon tried to kill the girl the lewd chorusing of the varangians quieted hakons eyes wandered as if he were looking for a signal the clearly voiced verses lilted over the crowd sablehaired plundered from the strand that is sea dauntless to spill the wine of ravens swanwhite stands she a fair snippet of verse thought haraldr as he savoured the skalds words the poet has imagined her coming from the desert which is said to be a sea of beaches and because she has spilled the brutes blood she can yet wear her hair uncovered like a maiden and so is still white and pure why are they all looking at me haraldr wondered then he realised what had happened and his veins iced he was the poet he had spoken aloud perhaps not in his own voice but the words had certainly come out of his mouth hvat bellowed hakon as astounded as he was furious grettir took two slow paces towards haraldr and looked at him as if he had just seen a serpent talk jarl rognvalds heart soared in the instant before he furiously began to reason how to get haraldr out of there alive haraldr felt the pressure of hakons dagger against his windpipe almost before he saw the gleam of steel im sorry jarl rognvald but your bodyguard has mocked me hakon growled there was no sorrow in his voice im going to have to ask him if his sword is as sharp as his tongue hes carved from a tall tree jibed grettir but it looks as if the wood is still green hakon jarl rognvalds hand gripped the pommel of his sword hold back this boy is my ward he is not paid to defend me but i am bound by honour and love to defend him hakon weighed his own decision the satisfaction of butchering a meddlesome old jarl against the huge bonus he would receive when he delivered his recruits in constantinople and he needed the jarls rus pilots to ensure that delivery but when they reached the rus sea and no longer needed the river mens expertise he vowed that the lobsters would taste old norse meat and as for the jarls turdchewing ward he would never see the rivers end hakon dropped his sword and he shrugged and sniffed contemptuously yes grettir this wood is too green to whittle perhaps he added ominously a few weeks on the river will season it the varangians hooted with derision too green to whittle echoed through the crowd grettir turned back to haraldr it would have been an honour to die at the hand of hakon but listen to the praise theyre singing you now youve a hard tongue but a soft back the laughter rose like the thunder of a coming storm a wind screamed inside haraldrs skull whipping humiliation into a suicidal frenzy haraldrs wet palm slipped against the bone handle of his sword but almost at the same moment hakon flung his arm towards the sand and something thudded against haraldrs foot he felt a minute searing as if he had stepped on a spark he looked stupidly at his feet and saw a gold pommel staring up at him hakons dagger had sliced through the sole of his heavy boots and had just nicked his big toe haraldr reflexively tried to pull his foot away but his boot was pinned to the firm damp sand and he stumbled he lost his balance and fell to his knees the laughter shrieked like a tempest hakon has toppled the tallest tree with a nick of his dagger grettir chortled greenwood bellowed hakon thats his name greenwood echoed voices from the crowd greenwood next time i see you with your hand on your sword ill aim two ells higher ill make you the tallest geld in the east hakon paused hawked and spat a great yellow wad on haraldrs hand and then ill make you shorter by a head the howling north wind blew away the drunken haze haraldr recognized a voice that he knew but had not heeded since that terrible day four years ago when he had shut his ears to it it was strange so thunderous and yet so intimate as if it not only knew him but also was of him as if another soul separated from him at stiklestad stood partially inside him and partially outside sharing some of him and rejecting the rest there had been times when haraldr had sensed that he could completely enter this twin soul and share his power which he knew to be considerable for he had on occasion felt the others fist as hard as an iron ingot yet as light to lift as down still he could not simply take a slight step and embrace his fugitive twin he knew that he had to cross through the spirit world cold and ancient filled with the furies of the old gods and the beasts of the deepest abyss so he had long feared the other and had struggled against him fettering the part of him that wanted to begin that journey now for the first time in four years he pulled against those bonds somehow feeling that the fetters might at last be broken if only his will to do so was great enough his vision darkened with a ferocious mind storm and his hand flexed and trembled and strained for the handle of his sword if only he could reach it jarl rognvalds hands clutched haraldrs arm like a vice but it was not that which was able to restrain him wait whispered the strange inner voice which for an instant was his ownwait his imperial majesty the emperor basileus and autocrator of the romans the empress zoe sat up the head of her chamberlain symeon framed by the leaden silk curtains of her canopy and illuminated by the single oil lamp he had brought into her bedchamber seemed to float in the darkness an ancient hairless mask of white parchment she nodded quickly and the curtains swished vaporously aside zoe stepped onto the thick carpet beside her bed she was entirely naked and for an instant her generous bosom and satiny flank gleamed like honeytinted white marble a second eunuch wrapped her in a gauzy robe her already erect nipples dark and thick pressed against the sheer fabric the two eunuchs left a lamp on a small table and swept silently out of the room their slippers whispering on opus sectile she met the emperor in the more intimate vestibule of her cavernous domed bedchamber the miniature eagles embroidered all over his robe flickered dully like gold insects flitting in the moonlight she could see at once the hint of weariness in the otherwise impeccable carriage of his broad shoulders and muscular chest she pressed her lush bosom against him and kissed him fiercely she had become accustomed to his slight almost palsied recoil i i came to say i will be unable to stay with you he said when she took his hand and urged him to the direction of her canopied bed his voice deep and resonant had a natural command but this was offered without inflection he was apologising though he did not wish to you are still working i could work for the next ten years and not repair the damage done by my predecessor i had no idea what he had done no one did not even my brother the substance of it yes not the extent of it the emperors lustrous dark eyes contracted for a moment hardening even if the rus trade resumes we must institute another surcharge to the window tax the dhynatoi will do everything they can to oppose us the dhynatoi were the empires enormously powerful landed aristocracy among the myriad imperial exactions the window tax based on the number of windows in a dwelling was one of the few levies that fell more heavily on the owners of large estates than it did upon peasant freeholders the empress zoe brushed the dark curls from her husbands forehead and again drew him towards her bed the emperor did not resist he sat on the edge of the enormous sleeping couch his back perfectly erect he relaxed his shoulders and exhaled audibly through his nose zoe began to unlace his robe at the back she unlaced the fine linen undershirt as well and peeled away both layers to expose her husbands muscledimpled back she slipped out of her wrapper and pressed her breasts to his flesh his back tensed stay with me zoe whispered into his ear he turned his face fixed with a kind of horror as if her breasts were diseased he was murdered the emperors tone was now vaguely frantic your husband the emperor i am certain of it you are my husband you are now the emperor romanus was your husband when you when you and i the emperor seemed to strangle on the words when he asked me about us i lied to him in the sight of the pantocrator i perjured myself on the holy relics and then i turned away while he was murdered does mere acquiescence make the mark of cain upon me any less indelible zoe pulled her robe over her breasts her recitation was ritualistic an oftrepeated exorcism he was near death the last of his innumerable follies was his final ablution his doctors warned him not to bathe he simply drowned you saw the corpse perhaps the servants were inattentive but they were not assassins they say someone held his head under a varangian the hetairarch they say they say the hirelings of the dhynatoi who will repeat anything for a price there are many powerful men who would have preferred a far less vigorous successor to romanus this is how they attack you and the men who stand between you and their obscene ambitions if any hand held my your predecessors head beneath those waters it was the hand of the pantocrator himself romanus was a plague your hands cured me of him now they will cure my people and who will be physician to my affliction the emperor stood up pulled his robe over his shoulders and stepped away from his wifes bed for even if i wash seven times in the river jordan i cannot heal the infection of my soul dont touch it the arrow had drifted lazily out of i the sky like a wounded bird and clattered harmlessly on the deck it might be poisoned jarl rognvald walked to the foredeck crossing the planks that covered the main cargo hold he carefully picked up the metaltipped neatly feathered shaft and held it up for all to see what a bowshot he looked across the still yellow river toward the startlingly green thickly wooded bank id measure it over five hundred ells gleb shouted jarl rognvald to his slav pilot call for a tight file haraldr squinted at the mysterious dense wall of foliage ten days already on the river the placid monotony of the waters like the sultry unsettling stillness before a lightning storm each day with its whispered drifting warning of the hidden enemy the eerie tranquillity of the starflecked nights and the creeping subtle terror that one might awaken to find that ones boat has drifted from anchor and thudded into the bank into the hands of the unseen demons it had happened to one crew last night the watch had got drunk and in the moonless night no one knew until they heard the screams jarl rognvald was increasingly withdrawn when he was not preoccupied with command staring down the river like a seeress struggling to spy the future and for haraldr dreams so many dreams here not only of a dying sun and blood on the land but also of a place of wind and cold and endless blackness the voice always that voice now whispering cajoling drawing him into that deepening dark void where his fears stalked on nightmare feet on the river the beasts of those inner depths had become more fierce and his fugitive soul seemed ever more distant haraldr was certain he saw a glint of metal in the distance another yet another far ahead the left bank lowered and the verdant screen was interrupted by a dun patch filled with colours and flashes of steel and bustling movement larboard bank larboard he yelled pechenegs gleb the pilot limped along the gangplanks coming forward to stand in the prow with haraldr and jarl rognvald he was a short greyeyed man who shaved his head save for a long grey lock above each ear gleb had obtained his limp on his first dnieper trip when his boat had been tossed on the rocks after that he had lived to vanquish the river and that was why he had taken three more trips but it was said that yaroslav had had to make glebs sons and grandsons rich men before he could persuade gleb to become lead pilot for this expedition a man needs the luck of the whole world to go four times down the dnieper gleb had told jarl rognvald by the time he starts his fifth trip he will have used up all the luck there is theyll be giving us a show now muttered gleb jarl rognvald looked at him quizzically that crew they captured groused the pilot be sure that they havent yet killed all of them a distant shout boomed across the water the famished eagle feeds at last haraldrs stomach roiled several ships oars churning had moved up fast on the larboard from the prow of the lead boat gold returned the sunlight byrnnie helmet and goldtinselled braided beard hakon little had been heard from hakon since they had left kiev he had communicated with jarl rognvald through a messenger and his men were quietly disciplined on the water now just when haraldr was beginning to think that hakon was simply another of his deviling dreams here he was jarl rognvald we must moor our ships up ahead hakon was commanding not requesting the skeletoncopulators are sure to entertain us i want them to know that we also have artskills jarl rognvald cocked a frosty eyebrow at gleb the pilot nodded fear is the pechenegs sharpest blade we need to show them that our steel is just as good the pechenegs had trampled a path to the river like a vast herd of giant lemmings only a dozen or so trees at the waters edge stripped to mastlike shafts and curiously paired rose above a river of human and horse heads thousands of ells wide and long enough to disappear over a hill far in the distance the warriors had dismounted and stood in their own rough clothes as well as the plunder of a dozen other races homespun robes with leather caps and jerkins skin and fur tunics spiked and conical helmets over glossy black hair tattered frisian cloth byrnnies of chain mail and iron discs even a cluster of pecheneg potentates in silk robes and gleaming armlets the makeshift horde erupted into a cataclysmic shrilling droning welcome hakons ship drifted closer to shore bring me the instruments on which ill play my ditty hollered the gilded giant five dark little men roped at hands and feet were brought to the prow of the ship the varangians had captured some pechenegs just outside kiev and intended to sell them as slaves in constantinople if they did not find more expedient uses for them hakon began to speak again but his words were lost against the screeching gale from the shore there was a flurry of movement round one of the pairs of tree trunks the two towering shafts were bowed towards each other until their tips crossed forming a crude arch the rus boats buzzed with speculation gleb spat angrily and his jaws clenched a struggling flailing man his naked white skin clearly visible was hoisted up and tied between the tree trunks his arms and legs spread wide so that he looked like a huge white spider amid a rope web the pechenegs howls ascended and then abruptly drifted away until only a single sound floated across the water the sound of one man screaming a pecheneg sword flashed like a silver spark at the base of the nearest tree trunk the crossed tops of the trees twitched almost imperceptibly then with a terrifying suddenness the shafts snapped apart and the white spider exploded in a burst of crimson a torso seemed to spin slowly through the air the trees snapped upright each dangling one arm and one leg hakons face was sunsetpurple amid the ashen complexions of his varangians without speaking he selected his instrument the dark little man let out an unworldly shriek until hakon clamped one huge hand around his windpipe in his other hand hakon held a broadaxe polished to an antimony gleam he turned the pechenegs back towards the riverbank and laid it open with two lightningquick strokes along either side of the spine before the blood could really flow hakon had dropped his axe and cracked open the ribs and peeled them back with both hands he scooped into the body cavity and drew out the foaming pink lungs he held the pecheneg by the hair and spread the lungs like wings over writhing shoulders the little mans mouth spewed pink froth and hakon let him slump to his knees then tore away his loincloth he grabbed a spear and carefully probed the pechenegs rectum after several deft shoves the gory tip sprouted between the spread lungs hakon seized the spear shaft with both hands and held his creation aloft like a winged battle standard the blood eagle marmotfuckers he screamed the blood eagle wives of dogs he shook his macabre standard in fury the blood eagle well strangle you with the cunts of your women the pechenegs on the shore had prepared another victim the trees snapped and limbs dangled again hakon raised another gory standard in response the ritual exchange continued until five varangians held the purpling blood eagles aloft and the pechenegs had run out of trees an almost palpable silence descended as if the air had become thick with some soundabsorbing ether one of the blood eagles twitched like a fish on a pike finally a group of silkrobed pechenegs moved to the waters edge the vividly coloured chieftains held pinkish hemispherical bowls in their hands they raised the vessels and chanted a salute to the wallowing rus ships before emptying greedy draughts into their upturned mouths theyre wassailing us asked haraldr numbly gleb spat no they are showing us their new drinking vessels cut from the skulls of our men hakon shifted his grim fireflecked gaze to the remaining pecheneg he yanked the wideeyed little man in front of the first of the blood eagles his dagger flashed and severed the impaled pechenegs testicles well fatten him with bellyoysters crowed hakon as he popped the surviving pechenegs mouth open with one hand and shoved the bloody morsel down his throat with the other hakon went down the row of blood eagles harvesting each man until his dinner guest stuffed mouth clamped shut by hakons massive hand writhed and gagged his throat gurgling obscenely finally the pechenegs bulging eyes mercifully closed and he slumped blackfaced with asphyxiation to the deck no one speaks gleb raised his hand to command silence the ships had strung out down the river again and the crew lolled in the lateafternoon heat listen drugged by the torpor haraldr at first allowed himself the thought that they had already reached the sea the barely audible noise like the muffled crashing of distant waves entranced him and for a sharp moment his breast longed for norway do not sleep barked gleb haraldr started along with most of the crew thats the name of the first of the rivers seven cataracts explained gleb do not sleep now we begin to game with the dnieper he eyed the descending but still whitehot sun no use starting now the last ships wouldnt make it through the first cataract before dark if we set out at dawn tomorrow we can all pass the first four cataracts before the sun sets then gleb spat and rasped so softly that he must have been addressing only himself of course we will be a much shorter file by then the river was icesmooth and ravendark haraldr held the night watch occasionally a scream lifted from hakons boat and pealed into the night apparently the days blood had whetted hakons appetites the boat rocked in the current a reminder of the relentless force that haraldr knew carried him towards an inevitable reckoning haraldr haraldr started and turned he was relieved to see jarl rognvald the jarl looked out over the blackonyx surface of the dnieper for several minutes he knew that there was little time to say what he must haraldr you know i have never lost my faith in the old gods haraldr nodded that does not mean that i do not believe in kristr i think that all the gods exist and the only difference between them is the gifts they present to the men they favour now this kristr grant you is probably the greater god he is a builder in norway he has built roads and bridges for his priests and a kirke in every town you can also see what kristr has enabled yaroslav no very great man to do in kiev and of course kristr has helped the griks build miklagardr by that measure alone kristrs power is superior to any other but sometimes i think that kristr loves buildings more than he does men jarl rognvald theatrically spread his hands out over the water odin he said expansively is the more generous god the tale is told that kristr hung from a cross for one day in order to show men the way to paradise but odin hung himself upside down from the rootless tree for nine days waiting to snatch the mead of poetry from the depths of the underworld he has shared that drink with men with those who dare to accept his gift jarl rognvald looked intently at haraldr his eyes glaring in the blackness like winter ice that verse you recited on our last night in kiev so sharp and true and it came as quick as a thunderbolt it is a madness a madness given by odin just like the battlerage haraldr said nothing his thoughts smothered in fear he had witnessed the battlerage of the berserks at stiklestad the hound the sucking nose the red eyes he had even worn the skin armour told of in all the tales yes haraldr reminded himself the rage is more than a pagan fable it exists and it is indeed a madness the other night in kiev i watched you something held you back from striking hakon which took a greater valour than foolishly spilling the winebag courage in your veins perhaps even odin himself held your arm well i know it was not my hand i think the wounds of stiklestad have finally healed i think that you are ready to accept a second gift from odin the gift of the battlerage you were with me in my last battle jarl haraldrs tone was selfaccusatory would you want me beside you in your next i could wish for no better comrade havent i taught you all i know indeed the jarl had endless hours of drills with sword axe and spear and swimming and wrestling and riding as well if kingdoms were won in mock combats haraldr would own more subjects than the greek emperor but jarl rognvald could not teach him the inner defences a man needed in real fights greenwood a strong arm but a weak breast the fault isnt with your teaching jarl you know that that has meant more than anything to me but i have a battlefetter that no skill of yours or mine has been able to remove if i thought odin could release me then i would ask his help but i know that the strength to break that bond has to come from within the gods cannot answer every question in a mans mind jarl rognvald looked over the river for a long time a feathery insect flew against his face and he brushed it away finally he spoke haraldr i have been a warrior all my life and that is most of what i know of life i am not a poet like you and i can only tell you what i know the jarl paused and examined his hands i have been to the spirit world believe me it is an inner landscape inhabited by anything the imagination can provide and yet it is no less real for that each man conjures his own inner beauty his own hidden demons and the gods only guide him to them men think that when possessed by the rage a man becomes a beast that is wrong the berserk in fact is a beastslayer he enters the spirit world and confronts the demonbeast that has held his soul captive that beast is his fear and when he has faced it or even slain it when he has put his faith in his own force his own will then all things are possible even miracles of the sort that are ascribed to the gods haraldr knew then that he and the jarl had looked out on the same desolate landscape of mind and memory and that his own spiritjourney over that strange and terrible terrain could no longer be postponed yes i know that a beast waits for me there a fear as terrible as the worlddevouring dragon itself and when i awaken in the middle of the night i am certain that if i ever face it i will die you are ready to face it even the last dragon itself you are a poet and a warrior you showed that the other night in the podol and you have learned far earlier than most men how bitter is the outer world when a man seals off his inner world thinking that the demons he never confronted will no longer trouble him you know that that is no life to be clung to not at the cost of a pure and honest soul the jarl turned away from haraldr and faced north thinking of the cool emerald and azure summer in a land he would never see again haraldr even when you were a boy i knew you had a mind that someday no man perhaps even no god could ever command i choose to believe that odin will guide you to your beast and help you confront it but your own will is equally capable of leading you through the spirit world chosen by odin chosen by your own will what does it matter i only know that you are ready to stand before the dragon jarl rognvald said nothing more he left haraldr to his thoughts and the deathdark murmuring dnieper maria mistress of the robes fanned the eunuch away her milky hand moved like a ghost through the thick steam despite her utilitariansounding title she was the second ranking lady at court only the empress zoe and the augusta theodora who no longer resided in the palace precincts were accorded more prestige maria studied a rivulet of perspiration as it descended from her cleavage to her navel she pressed her finger into her navel and drew a liquid line to her glossy black pubic triangle she pulled her legs up and thrust her arms between them a curiously simian posture for a disturbingly beautiful woman her blue eyes were like tiny miraculously illuminated grottoes in the heated mist your husbands brother has sent irene away she said languidly her voice chimed against the marble walls of the bath the empress zoe towelled her moisturebeaded breasts we are already surrounded by spies she sounded drowsy and our companions are no doubt happier elsewhere but i will miss irene remind me to have symeon send her something maria turned to the empress who sat next to her on the marble bench their shoulders touched lightly she decided not to ask the question she had considered zoe would speak of it when she wished but it had been two weeks now since the emperor had spent the night in his wifes bedchamber ata came to see me yesterday said maria he advises that i have neglected the amorous component of my nature zoes eyes opened they had a lovely amethyst cast ata oh yes the palmist who came to us out of the orient in the company of that rather charming yet woefully disenfranchised emir she paused to recall the name salah we havent seen much of emir salah since my husbands brother extended the generosity of our treasury i believe he has taken his pension and has bought some estates near nicaea i presume this ata still finds our court rewarding darling wasnt the emir one of your amusements i will never allow a darkskinned creature to crawl into my bed again he wanted to impale me from behind like one of his goats and when i insisted otherwise he was finished before i could draw three breaths he then remarked that his wives were more submissive i told him that if he was at all representative of his race the appropriate custom would be to have one wife for twenty emirs instead of the other way around i could not understand what he said next i arranged to have him ejected from my chambers as quickly as he had spewed his dubious manhood into me the next time i saw him i spat in his face and told him i now presumed to have given him as much pleasure as he had given me little daughter you know i worry when you are so vehement the empress spoke gaily but her eyes winced showing fine wrinkles at the corners my next lover will be entirely western in concept golden skin and hair there are some athenian types in the scholae who so closely resemble the ancient statues that one wonders if they were hewn from stone the scholae was the elite imperial household cavalry zoes eyes had forgotten the moment of melancholy her vividly red lips curled salaciously darling i can only assume that you have already been reconnoitring can i also assume that my use of military terminology is rather apt i have heard that you were a spectator at the pentathlon last week i was intrigued at your sudden interest in athletic contests until i learned that this was an intramural event for officers of the scholae all those oiled young gallants and all of them lodged here in the palace precincts i have found the perfect pair hermes and apollo i call them they are beautiful as vain as narcissus and insufferably arrogant they are also inseparable though whether it is a friendship in the style of the ancient greeks whom they so closely resemble i am as yet uncertain of course i intend to separate them i am dining with them both tonight little daughter you are scandalous but so deliciously inventive how i envy your freedom not from convention may the holy theotokos forgive me i have never been constrained by that but to be able to make love and yet be untrammelled by love how i envy you that aeifor yelled gleb the pelican roost the fourth cataract the most deadly but the noise of aeifor was not that of any water it was that of a living thing a monstrous baleful groan as if some titanic beast had been stirred from sleep as the sound rose the rus oarsmen looked anxiously at one another in one morning they had already passed through a lifetime of terror the walls of giantset stones across the river the sucking dizzying mortally cold eddies ships disappearing behind the foaming veils and timbers showering up over the great rocks as ships exploded the hideous flotsam shattered strakes cargo pods and the limp seemingly boneless pulp that even now chased them down the deathstrewn dnieper like shrieking ghosts perhaps a hundred ships and their crews had been lost already what lay ahead aeifor first appeared as a white haze over the river a few herons and pelicans emerged like snowflakes from the mist and flew overhead in greeting within minutes the current began a rapid acceleration and then huge jagged rocks loomed towards the starboard the pelicans swarmed clouds of spray boiled into the air between two massive cathedrallike rock upthrusts was a vast swirling maw the ship seemed to hit something solid the steering oar at the stern jerked like a giant arm and swatted the steersman into the river the hapless rus shot past with both arms raised almost as if he were waving goodbye then surrendered to the dnieper haraldr dashed for the wildly swiping steering oar as the ship spun and then heeled almost capsizing with gleb virtually clinging to his back he put all his weight against the bucking shaft the oar settled and the ship fought the current heading hard larboard over his shoulder haraldr saw a ship disappear into aeifors white shroud the deadly mist parted for an instant and a prow then the entire ship shot high above the lip of the great whirlpool men leaping overboard the abandoned oars flailing like the legs of a desperate centipede then the prow lurched down and the ship simply vanished swallowed whole by the beast aeifor the beach that ran along the larboard bank was sandy with periodic eruptions of jutting rocks the oarsmen rowed for their lives the iron grip of aeifor never slackened as it had near the banks skirting the other cataracts they would have to come fast against the suction to ground the ship firmly on the beach fifty ells to the shore haraldr braced for the shock an oarsman lost his grip and slumped from his seachest the shaft of an arrow sprouted from his neck crimson rivulets oozed from the wound seconds later the ship jolted timbers swayed and the prow lifted haraldr swung his shield around from his back and jumped to firm welcoming sand to his right hakons ship slid onto the strand the arrow blurred past haraldrs ear for an instant buzzing against the terrifying groan of aeifor the rus set their wall of shields in the norse fashion crouching and anchoring their long spears against the sand a very long time seemed to pass haraldr feared that aeifor only masked the shrieks of the pechenegs certainly they were a few dozen ells away in the thick brush readying a massive charge but the wall of foliage beyond the wall of shields was quiet the leaves hung motionless the sun glinted off them like a reflection in a stagnant pond jarl rognavald knelt beside haraldr i think we have surprised them he yelled they havent been able to assemble for an attack the jarl located the lone pecheneg sniper and signalled for an archer after the rus bowman had fired two arrows the jarl stood up lifted his helm and stroked his sweatmatted white hair haraldr felt as if he had miraculously escaped another humiliation and yet he also had a strange haunting sense of disappointment as if he had taken the wrong road and would now miss some extraordinary marvel the ships were lifted over log rollers and moved along the old portage trail with surprising speed hot dust clogged windpipes and the sun glowered through a metallic haze the afternoon wore on an orchestration of endless groaning motion the portage followed a relatively cleared path through a generally wooded area porters cut away the brush and small trees that had grown up in eight years occasionally runners trotted up to the jarl with reports of men lost to pecheneg archers but there was no word of any concerted attacks along a line of ships that now extended down the river front for half a rowingspell varangians detailed to various potential trouble spots along the line came and went in groups of fifty or a hundred marching in smart order in their gleaming byrnnies haraldr was surprised to hear gleb announce that the portage was almost threequarters complete defences relaxed a few men at a time could now slump for a rest on a pile of furs or a barrel of pickled meat hakon trailed by his dogs wandered the beach dragging the gilded spear point of his enormous goldinlaid broadaxe in the sand he saw jarl rognvald gleb and haraldr and walked over grinning like a beaver jarl rognvald he called out as he approached you see what has happened dont you the turdsuckers know mar hunrodarson well and it seems that they have also heard of his man hakon fireeyes he raised his axe to his chest they wont come against us with comic emphasis hakon warily rubbed a finger over his immaculate axe blade folkmower here is angry with the corpseeating savages he is thirsty for the wine of ravens then hakon swivelled his sparking eyes towards haraldr with feral menace why greenwood i hardly recognized you in your battle toys and on your feet instead of your knees he rapped haraldrs breastplate you must have bashed up some old womans kettle to make this haraldr was annoyed at his own passive silent response it was as if his body and mind were suddenly drained of will even thought bored with this game hakon wandered back to his ship detailed some more of his varangians upriver then talked with his two concubines and some slave girls before returning with his hawk on his arm pelican harrier he announced to everyone within earshot his grin boyish and proud he removed the plumed golden hood from the sturdy chevronbreasted bird gleb wrinkled his red swollen nose i dont like that smell my hawk smells better than you louseeating slav snapped hakon gleb ignored hakon and looked at jarl rognvald he had not been referring to the bird the hawk spiralled into the air and gleb continued to sniff haraldr noticed that hakons dogs had pricked up their ears he retrieved his spear a puff of feathers in the coppery haze hakons hawk fell towards the river like a stone shieldwall shouted gleb the wailing shriek that came from the woods pierced even the monstrous plaint of aeifor the first wave of pechenegs seemed almost deliberately to fall on the upraised spears of the hastily constructed shieldwall though in fact they were pushed by the crush from behind within moments the shieldwall staggered back from the sheer weight of the pechenegs then fractured the horde poured through and this time unlike in stiklestad haraldr watched death stalk in the searing light of day he was pushed back inexorably towards the river a witless participant in a mortal dance he watched with idiotic clarity as the polychrome pecheneg horde surged to the rivers edge on his left and hakons dazzlingly metallic varangian force retreated with shocking alacrity even farther to the left falling back upriver disappearing through a clump of trees he could see the figure of hakon in his golden byrnnie as distinctly as a magically animated little statue running the hostile dnieper was the only refuge for those who had not fled or already fallen to the swarming pechenegs haraldr jarl rognvald gleb and maybe half a dozen varangians who either had had the misfortune to miss hakons precipitous retreat or had the good sense to protect the expeditions pilot before his boots were even half submerged haraldr could feel the icy current swiping at his legs when the rushing snowmelt seized his testicles haraldr heard the dark voice from the pit of his soul you are going to die the vanguard of the pecheneg horde stood at the waters edge a jeering riot of antic brown limbs and flashing blades they were less than thirty ells away an archer wearing only a loincloth came out to test the water and made it halfway to the tight cluster of norsemen before he shot down the river as if yanked on a string a hundred ells downriver his head went under not to be seen again but the dnieper offered a precarious sanctuary even for the huge norsemen one of the varangians lost his footing and the entire group staggered before they could make common cause against the rushing river when they had steadied somewhat the tallest varangian spoke he was about haraldrs age and size and impressively handsome his voice was as calm as if he were sitting on a stump whittling a stick hakon will be here within a quarter of an hour he assured his comrades he was wise to fall back and summon the rest of the varangians from upriver soon the corpses of these shitheads will be colder than we are jarl rognvald turned to the varangians yes all we need do is stay on our feet until then but inwardly the jarl suspected not what he had seen looked more like a treacherous desertion than a strategic retreat aeifor roared on the pechenegs jittered and waited occasionally launching a few spears or arrows the varangians fielded the missiles on their shields as though playing a game the game became less amusing as the current continued its numbing assault haraldrs legs were turning to dead stumps finally there was a commotion and the teeming mass of pechenegs was parted by a silkclad chieftain accompanied by three or four byrnnieclad subalterns and dozens of variegated retainers including some women in expensive frisian cloth robes apparently just looted from the rus ships the turd on top of the dung heap said the handsome varangian in a remarkably laconic voice the pecheneg chief had wide thick shoulders a scowling beetlish face peered out beneath a finely embossed norsestyle helm he stood with his hands at his hips and shouted furiously at the norsemen then at his own men he stomped up and down the beach for a few minutes every now and then pausing to exhort the heavens or kick at the sand this exhibition concluded he simply sat on his haunches and waved his retainers away the varangians began to discuss a breakout but the handsome young varangian was adamant in his faith in hakon were pledgemen he reminded his comrades thats what varangian means men who pledge their lives in defence of one another it is an inviolable troth it was as if this varangian believed the invocation of this pledge would almost magically transport hakon and the rest of the varangians to their side maybe they are pinned down upriver offered a shorter thicknecked varangian with boyish rockcrystal eyes haraldr admired the loyalty of the varangians theyre good men he decided they deserve a better leader the pecheneg chief suddenly leapt to his feet screaming and gesturing as if he had been seated over a fire almost immediately the pechenegs swarmed the nearest ship upriver from the norsemen the blood that chilled in haraldrs aching limbs seemed to crystallize cold water turning instantly to ice weve got to move now shouted haraldr he did not bother to explain why and only distantly wondered why he was giving commands if we clasp arms and form a ring we can drift together until we get to the rocks the handsome varangian quickly appraised the situation like industrious ants the pechenegs had already lifted the massive hull from the log rollers and were creeping towards the water thats the best plan now he calmly agreed his eyes had a wounded look not of fear but of betrayal hakon has lost something more valuable than all the gold in grikia thought haraldr the ship was almost floated due less to organisation than to the numbers and the verminous frenzy of the pechenegs thirteen ells at beam fifty ells long and careening down the river the big river craft would crush the norsemen like snails the desperate human raft floated away just as the looming hull began to bob towards them the dniepers suction drew them on at a fantastic speed but the ship a more seaworthy craft came on faster the white water was just ahead haraldrs foot smashed into a rock but his feet were so numb that he hardly noticed his head went under and water surged up his nostrils like solid plugs of ice the ring broke up insensible feet scrambled to gain a foothold on the treacherous bottom the ship whooshed past seconds later a series of muffled cracks announced its destruction on the rocks make the boar yelled jarl rognvald the boararray was a wedge of men driven into the heart of the enemy the varangians quickly found their places jarl rognvald took the snout grabbed haraldrs arm and placed him at his right flank the handsome varangian took the same position on the jarls left the essential gleb was tucked safely in the middle of the wedge the boar moved warily through the spiky foaming shallows the pechenegs crowded the bank spears thrusting and sabres waving follow my cadence growled jarl rognvald the pechenegs were only a few ells away voices were screaming deafeningly both inside and outside haraldrs skull fast jarl rognvald lurched forward at a near run his axe rose and fell like a woodcutters haraldr pushed against the mass of pechenegs with his shield but it was as if the beast of his fear had seized his sword he still could not lift it he struggled to keep moving forward against the weight on his shield he could see a rockstrewn rise ahead and promised himself that if they made it they would live then sunflared metal showered over the rise not norse steel but pecheneg mail jerkins and captured hunland swords the pechenegs had brought up their best footmen the pecheneg footmen pushed forward crushing their lessheavily armoured comrades against the norse boar the wedge quickly became a circle a desperate shieldfort the crystaleyed varangian took a spear in his thick neck drew a final desperate arc with his axe and fell another varangian raised a forearm lashed to a limp red rag by the pecheneg sabres jarl rognvald smashed two pechenegs with his axe and sent them reeling in a mist of blood but three more leapt forward and clutched at his shield and the jarl could not throw them off thin sabres whirled around him like furious shrilling birds and long red streaks appeared on his face a spear drove into his byrnnie and he fell something struck haraldrs chest so hard that his lungs emptied and he thought he had lost his sword in the darkness the noise of the battle was like a great wind that kept him from regaining his breath his upper arm touched something whitehot and his forehead tickled he shoved hard with his shield to keep it from crushing his chest but a greater force pressed back all he could see was blood not before him but in memory blackred blood stiklestad his body began to freeze he saw elisevett very clearly for a second and then his mother he fell not to the earth but in a great spiralling plunge to the abyss of his own being a spirit world haunted by mythic beasts given substance by the real horrors of stiklestad here riot in the realm of flesh would be haraldrs last battle here his tormented soul would finally be forced to confront its own demons haraldr knew he had been here before it was a dark featureless plain scoured by a bittercold wind that wet and stung his eyes someone told him that if he stopped to rest he would be warm for ever but another voice thundered and ordered him on against the ravening gale the fire exploded before him but it was colder than the wind and blacker than burned coal within the lightless magma he could see the great gaping black jaws the dragon you can run now for ever he told himself but the voice commanded him to stand and the creature blasted him with its cold obsidianhued flame he stood and faced it the journey ended as suddenly as a fitful dream he awoke to ice crystals in the sun steelice the pecheneg wore a conical norsestyle helm a steel jerkin sheathing his stocky chest haraldrs body was liquid and iron at once flowing changing between the two at some unthinking but complex suggestion his sword at last lifted blown by the cyclone from the spirit world and then it fell the pechenegs sword arm and half his torso were gone and the gaping slash spewed blood as if his heart had exploded it is not a rage haraldr thought very clearly but a will a cataclysmic necessity that must discharge itself as a storm cloud spits fire his sword lifted again no longer a thing of steel but a force of nature that beat like the ravens wing ripped like the eagles talon the pechenegs fell inexorably back from the horrifying circle that it described three varangians were still beside him and gleb was huddled at his back haraldr reached down and grabbed the collar of jarl rognvalds byrnnie and as he did he saw a force of armoured rus battling over the rise only sixty ells away dragging jarl rognvald and carving his terrible crimson path through the pechenegs haraldr led the rest to safety so we have ascertained that alexandras is no enthusiast of romantic verse marias eerily enchanting blue eyes roamed from alexandras the young man seated at her right to giorgios on her left her velvety tongue flicked at the gilded rim of her murreytinted agate goblet and what do you think of the digenes akrites giorgios giorgios extended his tautly muscled neck slightly as if he found the high pearled collar of his ceremonial robe too tight he had curly sandcoloured hair an elegant grecian nose and strangely innocent brown eyes his sweatglazed forehead glowed in the light of the huge pewter candelabra that floated high above the table he glanced nervously at his friend as if seeking direction the evening had not been what they had expected they had heard the tales about the mistress of the robes of course and they had envisioned an evening of sexual abandon that could otherwise be provided only by the poxeaten whores of the studion constantinoples notorious slum instead the mistress of the robes had confounded them with rigid decorum and a trying discussion ancient hellenist philosophers the several religious heresies with which the city was currently rife and the economic possibilities presented by renewed trade with the northern barbaroi it had been rumoured that a trade fleet might arrive from rus within the next few weeks now the subject was literature the digenes akrites was a popular epic of heroism and romance on the farflung borders where the empire abutted the saracen caliphates and emirates i would not think that the digenes akrites is an accurate depiction of life on the eastern frontier offered giorgios hesitantly maria had quickly concluded she preferred giorgios to alexandros though the latter had a piercingly blueeyed scarcely restrained lasciviousness that she found appealing but giorgios despite his studied scholae swagger had the gift of selfdoubt but truth and romance are two very different qualities said maria in a choreographed burst five silkrobed eunuchs swept away the large golden tureens containing the dessert fruits poured unwatered wine into the agate goblets and promptly vanished the heavy bronze doors slid silently shut behind them if we perceived only truth we would be incapable of love do you mean physical love or spiritual love asked alexandros perhaps a spiritual love could fool the senses but a physical love emboldened by the wine he allowed his eyes to rake his hostess she lifted her dark eyebrows slightly and focused on him he felt as if a current had swept from her eyes into his testicles you are asking in what fashion naked bodies can withhold the truth maria wryly pursed her livid glistening lips but if a lover could see the truth of his partners flesh its conception in the bowels of a woman and its decomposition into putrescent sludge and the trail of mastications and excretions and discharges that flesh will deposit in its transit between those two states then i fear we would all become eremites happy with the solitude of a barren cell giorgios leaned forward but isnt truth what is not what has been or what will be that is merely the state of a thing what cannot conquer time has no truth then beauty has no truth only decay and death giorgios frowned maria tilted her head slightly her sableblack hair was parted in the middle and coiled at either side of her head the coils were laced with pearls plato believed that beauty resides outside a thing in an eternal state or so psellus informs us psellus he is one of the hellenists at court the most gifted i think he is quite taken with this plato the hellenists are heretics alexandros said petulantly marias lips hovered over the rim of her goblet like a snake striking her hand flashed out towards alexandros the full measure of wine struck him directly in the face and he jerked with surprise flung his head and rubbed his eyes giorgios stared in astonishment maria rose without a word and went to alexandros she wiped at his eyes with her linen napkin after a moment she began to laugh an elegant musical sound your robe is soaked she said her teeth were like perfect pearls she unlaced alexandross robe and yanked it to his ankles giorgios stood up as if frightened maria pulled alexandross linen breeches down and took his penis in her hand he was almost immediately erect with her other hand she swept alexandross goblet and chased silver platter to the floor the clatter echoed harshly as if malevolent spirits were mocking her laugh then she pulled her scaramangium a tight robe of scarlet silk up to her waist she sat on the edge of the table spread her legs and guided alexandros inside her she gasped and wrapped her legs around his back unlace me she shouted to giorgios twice when her scaramangium was unfastened she threw it over her head she wore nothing beneath she had rounded womans breasts and delicate white skin but there was an athletic almost adolescent sinuousness to her arms and legs with the fingernails of one hand she raked alexandross pumping buttocks her other hand found giorgioss and she placed his trembling fingers to her searing breast his vitals have been pierced gleb shook his head almost in rhythm with the gentle rocking of the ship in the dnieper haraldr leaned over jarl rognvald and lifted the linen bandage they had applied to the gaping wound in the jarls abdomen they had given the jarl a drink of leekmash and now the escaping odour told them that the organs had indeed been punctured no man survived such injuries jarl rognvald opened his eyes his irises were dark as if already clouded with a vision of the waiting spirit world he parted his mistblue lips in a painful effort to smile the deathfragrance he said but i knew i would die before the spear struck me odins third gift is prophecy haraldr clutched the jarls cold rough hand he felt that if he spoke he would release the terrible sob clawing at his throat you took the gift today didnt you the jarls voice was weak but still commanding his business in the middle realm was not done haraldr fought for control had he really entered the spirit world where had the dream ended for surely his encounter with the beast had been a dream a dream in an incredible instant of sleep and the reality resumed and he had just as surely led them out of that ring of death other men had seen it yet those last moments on the beach had also been part of his dream where had the dream ended and what had reddened the wolfs jaws in that time of indescribable terror beauty and rage his mind or his arm he did not know but yes it had happened haraldr leaned next to jarl rognvalds ear this was their secret the bond that would tie them between worlds and beyond time i met the beast i stood but i think there is still a test ahead of me the jarl turned to him his lips barely moving there is always another beast to slay when the last beast is slain time will end i will be there then to raise my sword against the last dragon now i know that you will be there as well so i die happy the sob struggled out of haraldrs throat jarl rognvald mustered a final robust grip dont mourn this old pagan he said odin has already set my place at the benches in the valhol i will drink with your brother tonight honour me by listening to me now the jarl paused to marshal his strength im turning my command over to you the entire flotilla ive already talked to gleb and he agrees haraldr was shocked what did he know of command wasnt it enough that he now commanded his own courage jarl im not the jarl cut off haraldrs protest yours is the blood of kings and the gods king haraldr fairhair was your greatgreatgrandfather and he was descended from the god frey thats what gives you the power to command it was there today just like the rage is it considered haraldr wondering at the person he had discovered on this bloody day unable now to discount any possibility perhaps it is your father was a king from kings you sat in many times on your brothers counsel you did not always fear to lead anyway i am not asking my last command is that you assume my duties ill have you roped with the slaves if you disobey now bring me my seachest haraldr set the weathered wooden box by jarl rognvald the interior gleamed with the treasures and utilities of a lifetime tools knives gold and silver coins a walrus tusk a silver hammer of thor glass beads a robe of frisian cloth and another of silk a bear carved in wood and a superb byrnnie with tight heavy links polished and lacquered like new haraldr hadnt known that jarl rognvald had two byrnnies he never wore this one ive talked with gleb he says there is a place at kherson where kristrs wizards will clean the flesh off my bones and put them in another chest then ive arranged to have both chests shipped back to norway i wont lie in the rus sea or this cursed river or yaroslavs dirt ill go home at last haraldr started to close the chest wait there is something in there that i wont need in the valhol it belongs to you that shirt haraldr started to stir through the clothing in the chest what did the jarl mean the shirt the hammer sews haraldr was speechless he reached out tentatively and touched the cold almost silky smooth links of the byrnnie well put it on its grik steel and construction built to fit a norsemans size haraldr slipped into the byrnnie it fitted as well as a fine wool tunic so snugly and evenly that its great weight was hardly noticeable the shirt the hammer sews the invulnerable second skin of the mightiest warriors emma is her name said jarl rognvald i bought her for you in kiev when i learned that you would come with me i was going to give her to you when i knew she would fit now she does haraldr realized that if jarl rognvald had worn emma today instead of his own byrnnie the spear never would have pierced his side he knelt and put his head on the old mans shoulder he could not control the sobs its cold where im going said the jarl he shuddered and dark blood spilled from his wound the wings of the valkyrja are blocking the sun haraldr clutched the jarls hand again and felt the last surge of life there is a saying whispered the jarl wealth dies kinsmen die and a man himself must likewise die but wordfame never dies for him who wins it well the jarl coughed and shivered i am an old pagan who served the kings of norway the sons of the gods but i want to be remembered as the man who served king haraldr sigurdarson norways greatest king promise me you will go back and claim norway i swear it on my soul the enormity of the pledge swallowed haraldr and he felt himself plunge towards a distant unseen fate the jarl paused his grip slackened and haraldr thought he was gone but his ghostlips parted slightly and he continued yes i know you will keep your pledge odin is telling me that right now but youll need wealth you can get that from the griks and allies probably yaroslav with money he can be bought the jarl started to go off again but his grip was suddenly fierce as if all his life were now transferred to haraldrs touch remember what you promised your brother on the last day of his life he said raspily it is more important now than ever you know about the bounty on your head and how many norsemen hope to win it but you must also protect yourself against discovery by the griks they have a prophecy that a fairhaired race will destroy them and they have good reason to fear that a norse leader might assemble a great force against them it has happened before they will never allow a norse king to come among them much less serve their emperor and now you have men under your keeping if you are careless with your name you may condemn them as well i die knowing that you are haraldr sigurdarson again which is why you must be all the more vigilant in denying him the jarl seemed to collapse inwardly with the huge effort of his admonition i promise you as i promised olaf murmured haraldr jarl rognvald coughed blood his last words were like leaves rattled by the barest summer breeze goodbye my son ill see you next at the benches then his pale lips froze and the spirit visibly fled from his face when all human warmth had vanished from the jarls body haraldr released him from his embrace and gently folded the lids shut over the old mans empty eyes hakon pah gleb spat angrily into the black water haraldr stomped over to the pile of gear he had left on the deck his sword was beside his old slav breastplate he strapped his sword belt on over emma get the dinghy ready he snapped to a rus oarsman no gleb shook his head weve still got three cataracts and the ford at krarion ahead of us before we reach st gregorys island you might kill hakon but what about the five hundred with him we all need to work together for now gleb spat and looked off into the night then when we get to st gregorys island well think of some way to feed hakon to the pelicans after gleb retired haraldr said he would take the early watch and he stood for a long time at the stern of the ship looking down the faintly stirring deceptively tranquil dnieper trying to make sense of a day in which he had freed his own lost soul and had lost the dearest soul left to him on earth he sobbed quietly for a long while but eventually his agony lightened with the thought of the jarl already seated at the benches with odins chosen champions hoisting his mead horn with olaf and sigurd syr now haraldr would have to earn his seat alongside them in the valhol he had stood before the beast of his own spirit but he had not slain it and now he would also have to slay the demon who stood before him in the flesh hakon haraldr started what was out there pechenegs they would not go out on the water he searched for the point where he had heard the faint inconsistency in the rippling of the river merely a fish a dinghy haraldr tightened his hand on the pommel of his sword the shape took on contrast against the black dnieper two men from the size of them varangians haraldr slowly and soundlessly slipped his sword out of its greased scabbard with his left hand he removed his dagger from his belt the dinghy impacted the river ship with a light thud watch you came the urgent whisper from the water we want to see jarl rognvald and haraldr nordbrikt what do you want with them better to let them guess about the jarls fate bastards their treachery had been the deadly blade today not the pecheneg spear haraldrs grip tightened on the steel that would mete his vengeance he was not afraid he would enjoy this there was a long pause haraldr heard whispering below with whom do we speak a man trusted by jarl rognvald and haraldr nordbrikt as themselves another pause and a brief whispering you pledge it norseman i pledge it on the soul of the jarl what ruse were they about the two varangians engaged in a lengthy hissing discussion finally haraldr snapped tell me your business except for the handful who fought with them today jarl rognvald and haraldr nordbrikt have only cold breasts and colder steel for you varangians im one of the men who fought with them today ask them to come and see haraldr peered warily over the railing a man was standing in the dinghy face up kristrs mother it was the finelooking laconic varangian who had been with them in the river haraldr was still uncertain hakon could easily be this clever and a varangian this treacherous im haraldr nordbrikt if im wrong excuse the indignity strip the handsome man grumbled but both men complied there were no byrnnies hidden under their tunics put them back on and climb aboard with his sword haraldr motioned the two to sit on the deck my name is halldor snorrason began the handsome one in his tunic he seemed even more powerful than he had in his byrnnie but his features would have made a woman happy he had a thin graceful nose and the finest silken hair this is ulfr uspaksson the smaller man nodded he had a strong blocky face with big sensitive eyes were comrades from iceland from the same village haraldr nodded silently let them announce their intentions where is jarl rognvald asked halldor haraldr quickly decided that he needed a reaction a gauge of halldors sincerity he watched his face carefully jarl rognvald is at the ale benches in the valhol halldors face registered nothing then he said that shames us i and the men with me who survived owe our lives to the jarl and you but halldors voice was a dry drone as if he were idly passing off some clever ironic remark haraldr stared coldly and his grip welded his hand to his sword hakon could at least have sent an able performer ulfr looked nervously at haraldr and then at halldor halldor he said i think you had better let me empty our breasts ulfrs voice had the lowkey resonance of the carefultongued sincere sort of skald haraldr guessed that he might be a fellow poet ulfr turned anxiously to haraldr excuse my friend his voice is like a road in rus land never up never down just straight on for ever but as im sure you know the melody of a mans voice has little to do with the music in his breast halldor just shrugged at the comments in spite of himself haraldr was charmed by the relationship between the two men they werent lying when they said they were friends he went off his guard a bit and wished that he had been able to enjoy companions his age these past years but his only friend was an old man now lying under a canvas shroud what we would like to say ulfr went on is that we are all ashamed hakon easily could have saved your jarl and our own men the pecheneg helmethail did not pursue hakon he spent the afternoon executing prisoners and with the exception of halldor and those few who were with you we varangians spent the day kicking sand hakon never told us that there was any trouble up the beach he deliberately let those men die and we are ashamed to be pledged to such a man most of you seemed to enjoy your employment in kiev snapped haraldr angrily but now that a few of you have been offered up to the gulls of fray you come whining to me his tone implied the obvious question why were not all loudmouths and strandwanderers answered ulfr why you wont find better men certainly they scorned you that night in kiev but i can assure you they laughed the way the rooster laughs when the axe is over its neck well you did look foolish that night interrupted halldor ulfr shot him an uncomfortable glance but then he shrugged the mead horn has cut down more men than the sword haraldr cocked his eyebrow he liked this halldors tart candour if hakon had been interested in concealing a treachery behind flattery he wouldnt have sent this one what were saying began ulfr what were saying is this droned halldor theres not a man among us who enjoys the leadership of hakon he disgraced us all today and believe me none of us admire his oafish behaviour were not simple bumpkins but we are pledgemen and we made our oath to him and that pledge is the single honour we must preserve otherwise we are not varangians haraldr deliberately made no response halldor searched haraldrs face for a moment and then smiled besides he said hakon is an important man in miklagardr we dont want to be known as the unit that mutinied against an officer of the court the only honourable and acceptable way for us to eliminate hakon would be for one of us to challenge him to an islandgoing halldor looked over at ulfr but there isnt a man among our five hundred who would return from such an excursion with his head still attached to his neck so i shovel the varangians dung heap said haraldr evenly a spade carved from greenwood halldor looked haraldr right in the eyes yes then he smiled at haraldrs barbed jest i would think the main requirement for fighting your hakon would be feet swift in pursuit said haraldr halldor fixed haraldr with eyes as implacable as slate hakon did not run with fear dribbling from his breeches you know that ulfr says that after he deserted you today he deliberately let himself be surrounded and then killed a dozen pechenegs by ripping their windpipes out with his bare hands i will be honest with you i think you alone have a chance against him but a very slender chance still our honour commands us to risk a wager on your chance haraldr returned halldors obdurate stare it seems as if my life is a small enough risk for you what do you risk halldor paused making sure of his next words if you challenge hakon to single combat ulfr and i will stand as your seconds if you lose so will we but in that way our deaths will ensure that the honour of our unit will remain unstained haraldr nodded a few minutes ago he would have suspected that these men would second him with a dagger in his back now almost instinctively he believed he could trust them they had just placed their lives in his hands and if i win halldor and ulfr both grinned broadly if you win said halldor you take everything that is hakons his tunics weapons coins treasures slaves halldors laconic tone took on a droll hint his women too then he paused and his voice became grimly earnest and also the command of his five hundred varangians when maria awoke she smelled the sea she had left the arcade of her summer bedchamber unshuttered and the breeze warmed by the morning sun was already sultry the light flooded the open balcony overlooking the silverspangled water and blurred the white columns of the arcade into molten shafts she turned away giorgios was looking at her his fawnish eyes intent and adoring alexandros was still asleep she kissed giorgios and pressed her body fully along his revelling in his tension his heat and the steely erection against her thigh when he tried to enter her she pushed him away dont giorgioss eyes were wounded she had not allowed him to make love to her the previous night though she had let his hands explore wherever he had wished maria turned back into the mornings flaring apocalypse wrapped her hand around alexandross priapic dreamswollen shaft and squeezed tightly alexandross eyes shot open she mounted him swiftly and began a low churning ride her breasts swaying to the rhythm of her pleasure she looked down at giorgios and smiled her paroxysm came even before alexandross and she quickly dismounted and walked naked out onto her balcony giorgios squinted and could no longer see her it was as if she had been consumed by the white fire of the new day yes silki i could well pay that toll i could afford a hundred of you in fact hakon is no mean diminisher of iceofarm hakons skald grettir pointed to the silver arm bracelets that coiled up his left arm the girl smiled she was young and her healthy white teeth sparkled against her thin flushed lips of course continued grettir resuming his caress of her fine blond hair i would first have to see if freyjas pleasure hut is as well thatched as this and make sure that a good fire awaits me within with oily stealth grettir lowered his hand and stroked her linencloaked flank well there will be time for that after our hakon finishes his woodcutting he turned and gestured at the arena that had been prepared for the mornings combat a burlap cloth ten ells on a side had been spread over flat ground surrounded on three sides by trenches and then a rope fence outside the rope the enormous throng was already assembling despite the carnage on the river seven perhaps even eight thousand rus had reached st gregorys island as hakon had requested grettir had seen to it that the prettiest slaves were brought up closest to the rope hakon had mentioned something about wanting to see their white skins speckled with ravenswine no trench or rope ringed in the fourth side of the cloth at the suggestion of hakon and strangely enough the condition had been acceded to by that eaglemeat greenwood the fourth border of the arena was a drop of one hundred ells off the sheer rock cliffs that thrust the island up from the dnieper haraldr had ordered everyone out of his tent if his hands shook hed just as soon keep that to himself a highpitched steadily whining ring filled his head he had not slept all night over the past few days he had confirmed too many grisly tales of hakons prowess to think he could still defeat the demon who waited for him at the black centre of being he remembered an old saying no man lives to evening whom the fates condemn at morning haraldr had already honed his sword and now he took a piece of pumice and roughened the bone handle the sun slipped behind a cloud darkened his tent like dusk for a moment he had an ineffable vision of some vast catastrophe perhaps the vanishing of an entire age that he would join with his death he recalled another verse an axe age a sword age shields are ripped asunder a storm age a wolf age before the worldorb shatters man will offer no mercy or forgiveness and then the last dragon will fly in the darkness haraldr tested the sword handle ready the dragon waited for them all man or god even allconquering kristr would one day be swallowed there was no shame in that the important thing was to spit in the beasts eye haraldr stood up pulled his sword girdle around emma collected his spear and shields and walked out of his tent the sun suddenly emerged from the clouds and the brilliance of his polished byrnnie dazzled him he thought how happy he would be to see his father olaf and jarl rognvald again not here marmotmind i cant see im wagering fifteen grivnas thats him hes big enough hakon pulled the hearts out of the pechenegs with his bare hands and fed them to his women your tongue is drunk they say a giant snake fell from the sky this morning gleb led haraldr through the confused chatter of the traders and slaves rumours had buzzed in the night like mosquitoes most who knew anything at all were incredulous jarl rognvald dead and a member of the junior druzhina haraldr somethingorother challenging hakon for command of the fleet and what was gleb the pilot doing championing the upstart haraldr felt as light as down in the wind dizzied by the warmth dazzled by the multihued finery that the crowd had donned in celebration of their passage of the cataracts silk and frisian cloth bloomed like bright flowers pendants and arm rings sparkled like dewdrops on a bright spring morning the slave girl the ravenhaired one hed praised in kiev waited for him by the rope her lips as red as blood she was his valkyrja the blow on his chest almost knocked him over youre not here to nap gleb spat at his feet doughy mouth working pugnaciously he looked as if hed like to shove haraldr again and thats no mattress with a romancloth pillow he pointed to the dull brown burlap square and the ominous opening to haraldrs right ice frosted haraldrs bones he felt the anxiety not the gaiety in the crowd their fates hinged on this then he saw halldor and ulfr only a few steps away waiting to come forward and second him it was not so easy to die when other lives were at stake diminisher of the wolfs hunger hawkhill of the great king grettir strode onto the burlap square with arms raised hakons brutish head and oxen shoulders thrust above the crowd crushed herbs and dried petals flew in the air before him pipes skirled hakons byrnnie iridesced like golden glass his tallowed yellow hair gleamed his two concubines surprisingly lovely young women with ornate embossed silver belts cinched around their narrow waists massaged his huge shoulders grettir stood in the square and explained the traditional rules of the islandgoing contest battle to the death three shields only one spear one sword one axe a man can step into the ditch though of course he would be put at quite a disadvantage by doing so but if he goes beyond the rope voluntarily or not he must forfeit all of the stakes oh and one final point though it was rather obvious a man who goes into the river has also lost stanislav an assistant to the bishop of kiev who had come with the fleet as its spiritual leader stepped into the square and motioned the combatants forward hakons grin was mocking and a pungent oil glistened on the fine tight braids of his beard the gold spangles winked the thin sallow priest raised an ornate gold censer and swung it hesitantly a few droplets sprayed in the air god the father said in as much as i destroyed mankind with water because of their sins i will now wash away the sins of man once more through i met a man who knew your mother greenwood hakon barked over the priests invocation he says your father was a hound not a man though your mother rutted with a shipload of estlanders she couldnt whelp until your fleacrawling father vomited in her cunt its no seed of man you were born of greenwood the priest would have swooned but gleb rushed up and snatched him back into the crowd grettir came forward announce the seconds then let the valkyrja weave their crimson cloth hakons paintrimmed emberflecked eyes probed through the thickening din of the crowd and clutched at haraldrs soul his brutish nostrils flared and he turned to his entourage my seconds alfhild and inger hakon grinned and snorted the silvergirt silkskirted concubines stepped forward burdened under shields and weapons the crowd tittered nervously and some of the varangians guffawed stiffly haraldr calmed himself with the observation that the varangians had not enjoyed the joke at his expense nearly as much as they had the other night he turned and waved his arm to his side of the square my seconds halldor snorrason and ulfr uspaksson the veins at the corners of hakons eyes twitched wildly youre pelican meat he shouted to his erstwhile followers ill fly your skins from my mast but the buzzing among the varangians and the crowd did not offer a chorus to hakons outrage ravens flock and eagles gather folkmower prepares to sip the ravenwine with his thin lips grettir finished his overture with a bow out of the corner of his eyed haraldr saw a metallic flash and a blurring shaft hakon had already begun his attack the spear struck his conical helm with a dull clatter and caromed off into the crowd haraldrs head whirled and brilliant little sparks scattered in the descending night some reflex urged him to launch his own spear before his knees weakened and his vision darkened through a watery blur he saw hakon bat the flying spear away spin and raise folkmower flaring into the sky hakons axe thundered against haraldrs shield almost immediately shattering most of the wooden boards drop it haraldr screamed to himself its useless wheres hakon folkmower drew back to strike again haraldr leapt forward to defend himself with an attack his head woozy and his mouth coppery with fear his sword hammered against hakons shield three times in rapid succession and sharp linden splinters sprayed the gold giant stepped back mildly shocked at the impact of greenwoods fusillade he withdrew dangerously close to the open side of the square as haraldr continued his frenzied booming attack the crowd cheered wildly another step and the varangian bully would be on the fast trip down the dnieper hakon halted his retreat at the lip of the drop and crouched beneath haraldrs blows the giants shield was little more than an iron rim then incredibly his axe slipped from his hand he dropped folkmower haraldr exulted its over hakon swiped with a preternatural arm and haraldrs feet jerked out from under him as smoothly as if he had decided to leap on his own he saw a glimpse of cobalt sky and then below him sparkling white foam over bladesharp rocks some calm centre still functioning told him that he had just been flipped over hakons back and that only the rockstrewn dnieper would break his fall time was suspended for a fateful instant in which he might still save his life and his desperately flailing hand caught the collar of hakons byrnnie he clutched the metal hem with a deathcheating grip as his momentum sent him flying out over the roaring silver dnieper hakons crushing paws wrapped haraldrs wrist in an effort to pry him loose haraldr held on hakons counterweight arrested his fall and his knees smashed into the sheer rock face just below the lip of the cliff hakon looked down eyes afire and grimaced fiendishly as he attempted to snap haraldrs wrist haraldr could feel the bone scream with stress and he knew his respite would be brief and would end painfully there was no decision to be made he glared back at hakon and with all his force pulled down towards death trying to bring hakon over the edge of the cliff the embers fanned in hakons eyes but he could not combat haraldrs desperate weight unable to free himself and unwilling to share greenwoods mad fall hakon planted his huge legs pulled with a bestial grunt and with haraldrs scrambling assistance dragged his opponent back onto the burlap square haraldr sprinted for his seconds his knees were bloodied and he had lost his sword in the river he grabbed his second shield from halldor and his axe from ulfr his heart throbbing with delayed fear was strangling him he turned to face hakon again he felt as if his limbs were trapped in cold black pitch like a fly stuck in pine resin he could hear the carriondevouring ravens shrieking in his ears as folkmower destroyed his shield in two lightningquick flurries ulfr pressed a new shield on him your last shield ulfr screamed king from kings haraldr forced his body on his sword lifted but before he could get off a good stroke folkmower lashed out and haraldr had to parry with his shield hakons blade thudded deeply and stuck fast in the boards and the light of hope flared again in haraldrs eyes ive got it ive trapped folkmower haraldr twisted the shield with all his force in an effort to wrench the shaft of the deeply embedded axe from hakons hands an alarming resistance shocked back through his forearm kristr no the iron handle of his shield was ripped from his grip he watched with morbid detachment as hakon stood admiring the trophy folkmower had gaffed then blithely discarded the axe haraldrs last shield still attached hakon removed the goldpommelled sword from his scabbard he stood with his treetrunk legs spread wide grinning like the head of death ive yet one more surprise for you greenwood he slowly drawled folkmower was but my toy my sword is my weapon haraldr gripped the handle of his axe with both hands good hard oak it might shield him from at best a dozen strokes before it was hacked to splinters after that hakon would need scarcely more than an executioners skill hakon delicately stroked the luridly bluetinted almost phosphorescent blade come kiss these lips sweet greenwood he said mockingly pursing his thick lips and making contemptuous kissing sounds my wandofwounds will take your nose first then your ears then your hands then take my nose sowlover haraldr came forward screaming determined not to beg for mercy in the jaws of the beast determined to die with a courage worthy of the kings who had come before him and the good men who would soon have to join him in his death the blue light of hakons blade flashed before his eyes his cheek itched he struck hakons shield a glancing blow hakons retort skidded off the axe shaft and ripped into haraldrs forearm deep too deep haraldr could already feel the blood streaming down the sleeve of his byrnnie im whittling you away greenwood bit by bit greenwood ill cut you down until all thats left is your arsehole then ill make an arm ring out of it and give it to your mother now the blows came at haraldrs shoulders sapping his arms softening him up so that he could indeed be sliced bit by bit slowly without dignity a metallic ringing rose to a quick clamorous crescendo hakons blows were battering his steel helm resolve draining with every pulse of his ebbing lifeblood haraldr ducked his head and the strokes fell on his back and shoulders like ripping dogs the sun faded and he followed the echoes of memory into the night haraldr slowly began to walk across the dark tundra of death this time he went on farther than he ever had before his destination was announced by the roar of the beast the sound of all creation shattering into oblivion the blast struck haraldr and flattened him into the stinging slush his face was unfeeling solid ice and he could hear nothing except the voice whispering very faintly kill it kill the beast haraldrs arms were frozen in the ice but he strained and shattered them free and struggled to his feet his hands were numb and the axe handle burned like hot iron but he forced himself to grip it he peered into the endless blackness and there within the howling maw saw the dark heart of the dragon he hunched his shoulders and went in after it when haraldr returned to the light the pain in his arms was gone and for an instant he wondered why he was being slapped on the head then he knew he pushed forward with his arms and the weight that was on them flew away nearly flattened by haraldrs explosive shove hakon wheeled his feet as he struggled to stay upright he staggered back veering to avoid the drop to the river below his fireirises were rimmed with white wonder for an instant only an instant greenwood had been a beast but greenwood couldnt have the rage only mar has it only mar hakon steeled himself he was still hakon whose foreheadmoons glowed with the starsofhearth ravensater dinhastener arm of the great king second only to mar hunrodarson he advanced behind his shield and drew his sword back preparing to draw a final fatal arc through haraldrs neck in the spirit world the dragon let forth its monstrous death scream the earthshattering bellow came out of haraldrs throat hakons sword arm froze petrified by his opponents inhuman oath a sound known to any seasoned warrior the terrifying peal of odins favour haraldrs axe lifted high then struck like a thunderbolt hakons shield was air a mirage that had formed in the sun it blew apart like chaff his byrnnie was the barest sheet of glass twinkling as it broke his skin was a petal bruising and then ripping his bones were twigs haraldrs blade did not slow until the earth that would soon claim those bones finally resisted its descent there was no sound except the rushing of the dnieper over the rocks below hakons vivid arterial blood bubbled around the axe shaft that sprouted from the huge gash in his chest his legs jerked spasmodically haraldr bent over the fallen titan indigo lips parted and the ivory teeth chattered mar hakon said his voice rattling blood gushed from his lips and the teeth were no longer white mar avenge me thats the last of them said halldor as he lowered the flap of hakons silk pavilion blocking out the inky blue wedge of sky even halldors imperturbable voice was edged with weariness and irritation haraldr turned to ulfr seated on the simple camp stool next to him what do you think counsellor im satisfied said ulfr id say the loyalty of two dozen of the varangians will be suspect and perhaps one or two of those will have to be watched but i think your ears will tell you the feeling of most haraldr smiled the varangians were already rowdy with tales of the combat and with extraordinary inventions about the origins and background of their mysterious new champion and leader there were at least a dozen pagans young men from small rural communities in sweden who were steadfastly certain that haraldr was thor in the guise of a mortal and the rus well to my thinking as good as can be theyll all follow gleb at least until we reach the rus sea we have assurances from the leading traders and surely you filled their breasts with joy this morning yes what a moment there had been a hushed silence as haraldr knelt over hakon after the blood had pooled and hakons feet had stopped twitching no one had moved then gleb had walked forward sagging cheeks working stood over the corpse and ceremoniously spat on it with that the crowd had erupted in a delirium of joy and praise then the varangians had carried their new leader to the late hakons grandiose pavilion and had entered one at a time to pledge homage and loyalty and after that came the rus merchants and traders begging concessions and asking haraldr to settle disputes now we only need worry about the response of the griks said halldor he was carefully cleaning his nails with his short eating knife and the commander of the imperial guard haraldr nodded wearily the byzantine trade ambassador had been noticeably absent among the days endless procession of congratulants and supplicants gregory however had come by an unofficial visit haraldr nordbrikt the little eunuch had whispered hastily i want to express my singular delight in your victory over that gangster a joy that is only surpassed by the august ambassadors acute discomfort at the news of your triumph he hated the manglavite as he hates all barbaroi but he views with great trepidation the reaction that hakons death will evoke from mar hunrodarson a man far more powerful than even the august ambassador then gregory had looked about nervously i am not certain that i will have an opportunity to speak informally with you again i would like to be able to tell you what you may expect when we reach the empress city but i fear that fortune still spins that wheel i am certain that the fact that the manglavite joyfully acceded to your challenge in front of many witnesses is an element in your favour but much is changing in our empire the planets are reeling and what their final configuration will be even an astrologer could not say haraldr had been less concerned about the fate of the byzantine empire than the vastly more chilling certainty that he would soon have to come face to face with mar hunrodarson he remembered what jarl rognvald had said there is always another dragon and you should have killed grettir halldor continued to clean his nails as he delivered his admonition halldor you dont understand the bond among poets said ulfr and grettirs just a boy the bitter taste on his praisetongue today will make him a better man haraldr nodded his agreement grettir had come literally on his knees to haraldr begging forgiveness and a chance to serve haraldr had demoted him to a menial stewardship but had promised him consideration as a skald if he showed a more worthy attitude well said halldor drily its as useless to argue with poets as it is to butt heads with an elk thats my advice and i leave it at that he slipped his knife back in its sheath and stood up its not an urgent matter anyway sleep is he examined the bloodencrusted linen bandage around haraldrs deeply gashed forearm other than that and a quick rinsing of the blood from his face haraldrs wounds had yet to be treated ive found a healer for your wounds this healer is from somewhere to the east they say shes very skilled she speaks some norse haraldr thought he detected some signal in halldors implacable eyes ive told her to be available for as long as you need her halldor turned and left without further ado ulfr embraced haraldr and followed sablehaired and swanwhite thought haraldr as the healer entered the pavilion she was the slave he had praised in kiev her chin was cocked haughtily and her agate eyes confronted his her linen petticoat whisked over glimpses of white ankle her bare arms cradled a small carved wooden chest folded linen and a silver bowl she set the chest and linen and bowl on the camp stool next to haraldr standing while he was seated her eyes were slightly higher than his she was more beautiful than elisevett haraldr thought the closeness of her made his breath come with difficulty take off her voice was high and melodic with a thick accent haraldr had never heard before she gestured with elegant movements of her slender fingers haraldr blushed the healer seemed amused and politely looked at her feet while haraldr removed his sweatsoiled wool tunic he was wearing only breeches beneath she began with the lesser wounds he closed his eyes when she washed his forehead and he could smell her sweet skin faintly scented with myrrh she tended a shallow gash on his thigh and he was embarrassed by the stirring in his groin her eyes searched his with a seemingly innocent curiosity i call you jarl haraldr shook his head im not a jarl and you no longer have a master her eyes narrowed suspiciously you not master i gave all of hakons slaves their freedom haraldr spoke very deliberately so she would understand you are free yes she said proudly as if he had merely expressed the natural state of things she pressed her lovely fingers to her breast khazar so thought haraldr she is from the desert the khazars were a proud and noble people who had once owned a great empire round a vast inland sea to the east lately their power had been usurped by a race of horsemen said to be as dark and savage as the pechenegs but far more intelligent you dont belong here do you said haraldr almost to himself caught she said angrily apparently she understood norse better than she could speak it brothers she vehemently brushed the air with her hand they had been wiped out she probably had been sold to norse traders in khoresm she touched her breast delicately again princess the word seemed to strike haraldrs heart yes she had the air she probably had learned to heal by binding her brothers wounds shed certainly not been raised as a servant his breast pained for her as it had that night in kiev i already love you he silently confessed but i can see that you have another love and because of it you could never be happy with mine with one trembling finger he touched her chin she did not flinch when we get to the rus sea twenty of our ships will leave to dock at kherson ill send you with them and see that from there a ship takes you east home to your people she understood home she said her eyes shifted focus as if she could see some glorious vista far beyond the silk walls of the pavilion when she had finished with the small wounds she began to rummage through the gear scattered about the pavilion she finally located a halffull wine bag as she moved about the lamplight shone through her linen petticoat and haraldr could see the outline of her slender flanks and the contour of her breasts she took a small silver goblet from the chest and mixed an ochre powder with the wine she drank some first to show haraldr that it was not poison not hurt she said as she began to pull the bloodcaked linen from haraldrs forearm the wound was deep but clean she daubed ointment from a jar into it haraldr began to feel drowsy and very comfortable his head nodded lie she gestured at hakons bed it was an enormous intricately carved wooden frame covered with thick downpadded silk covers disgusting haraldr had thought when he had first seen it that morning just another reason why hakons varangians who would sleep tonight on hard ground beneath coarse blankets had so willingly endorsed the usurpation of their leader haraldr shook his head and looked for his own gear bag he couldnt find it amid hakons splendid clutter he did want to lie down the healer guessed at haraldrs reservations and dragged the down covers off the bed and spread them on the floor beside him haraldr wondered briefly if she had been forced to sleep beneath them he felt very good he slid off the camp stool and lay down on the covers the healer knelt beside haraldr and began to wrap clean linen around his forearm the light behind her gave her raven hair a golden aura he reached up and grazed her arm with the very tip of his fingers he did not feel her soft skin so much as a curious shock like the sparking when one touched a kettle or a knife on a cold dry day she shuddered at some similar sensation she studied the cup of medicine for a moment and then drank the rest of the narcotic draught the wine slicked her lips with a brilliant sheen swaa swaan she asked haraldrs groin tingled she remembered his words in kiev a swan is a white bird he answered drawing the curve of the neck in the air noble and white and soft he touched her again her erect torso swayed slightly serah she said touching her breast her name was unlike any norse sound and it made a beautiful and mysterious music he thought momentarily of elisevett but she was a distant thing of cold beauty a glacier diminishing into a sliver of icy light beyond the horizon serah serahs hand burned and chilled his chest his body lost weight as when he had flown above the river today but now there was no fear wizardquick serah rustled white revealing white she threw the linen petticoat aside dark hair fell around haraldrs face serah tugged at his breeches the still air felt like a summer seawind over his nakedness he was as hard as an axe staff serahs body settled over him like a silk drape this was different from the two times before the first a whore had been a meaningless lesson in the artskills a king must know elisevett had been a passion that had rushed along like a torrent before exploding in a moment of aching ungraspable ecstasy tonight was a deep pool dark and warm and in it serah slid against his tingling flesh drawing him deeper into the iridescent blackness there is another place haraldr whispered to himself not the cold dark place where the dragon lurks a place he had never sensed before a place where only a woman could take him he plunged deeper into these depths his pleasure more liquid and languid only a single steel core left to his body for an instant he wondered if there was danger in this place as well but serah gripped him and whispered and the thought drifted away on the warm current long after they had finished they held each other and listened to the sigh and hiss of the dnieper finally serah tilted her head to look into his eyes and said serah princess khazar her finger gently pressed against his chest har haraldr haraldr held her close again haraldr prince he whispered distinctly realising she was no threat wanting her to share with him the secret that he held as dearly as life like you i am far from my people she understood and this new bond brought desire to another pitch her hands began to brand his chest her lips devoured his face and neck haraldr prince she said next to his ear her voice urgent with passion her lips moved down his chest neither of them heard the slight stirring of the silk curtain or the lithe footsteps in the night i will see him nicetas the eunuch bowed and the doors slid shut behind him maria turned to ata her palmist this is giorgios the one i like ata grinned his teeth were very bad though he could not have been much older than thirty he stood up smoothed the wrinkles out of his robe touched his hand to his forehead bowed and also left the room giorgios was shown in a moment later he wore the uniform of the imperial scholae an embossed gold breastplate over a shortsleeved crimson tunic and a short leather kilt his tanned face was flushed with exertion he probably had been riding maria kissed him on the forehead and brushed his blond curls back why did you come is alexandros with you giogios eyes were wild like a pursued stags he stammered i i love you my every thought is of you you consume me i cant bear to watch you his neck corded i cant eat any more do you love alex alexandros disgusts me he is a boor there was no expression on marias face she was as serene as a marble aphrodite but more beautiful giorgios blinked rapidly as if he had been slapped then why why i want to inflict upon you the pain you will cause me to suffer giorgios blinked again ata says that for me fate and love have crossed once before though he could not know it he is right now he says that my next crossing will bring together fate love and death he says that a man will destroy me with his love a fairhair perhaps you are that man she paused i am almost certain that i love you giorgios wavered as if he would topple it was a moment before he could speak i would never i adore you i worship you i would die before maria put her fingers to her lips her eyes were like blue flames i know she whispered now go i wont see you for several days but know that when you are thinking of me i am thinking of you now go giorgios made his way to the vestibule with intoxicated steps as the eunuchs slid the ivoryinlaid doors open he turned and looked at maria pleadingly i am sleeping with alexandras tonight she told him that hole is no deeper than a mans member said halldor his words were whipped by the stinging salted gust but many a man has fallen to his death within it he nodded at haraldr staring morosely out over the deep blue swells of the rus sea its a good thing that khazar girl went off for kherson she only had him for five days but by the end of that time i feared for him more than i did when he was in the deathsquare with hakon ulfr smiled fondly three weeks ago they had sailed out of the broad estuary of the dnieper into the rus sea and they had dispatched the contingent of twenty boats bound for kherson haraldr had arranged transport for the khazar girl and when he had bid her farewell he had kissed her all over her face and hair and then tears had visibly streaked his face as he watched her ship disappear into the eastern horizon many of the men present had been shocked by this weakness in their new hero a warrior was supposed to bid his woman farewell with a smile and a wise remark let her do the pining but ulfr himself knew how a poets heart was and he had gone among the men to explain that the same passion that had crushed hakons chest like a birds made haraldrs own breast tender to a womans touch within a few days it became the fashion among the varangians to lament lost loves they had hardly thought about for months haraldr remained statuestill in the prow gleb looked at him then at ulfr and halldor and spat well he growled he is about to meet a woman who will make him forget all the rest he paused for effect the empress city he gestured south where the coastline was just a dark greenish line on the horizon to the west the ascending sun punched a brilliant hole in a seamless sheet of smoked blue by midmorning well reach an opening on that coast its a strait the greeks call bosporus at the end of it half a days sail south is the empress city ill never forget my first sight of her look another one said halldor he faced the stern and pointed into the steelhued sky a messenger pigeon made one last spiralling turn before heading off to the southwest thats the fifth bird the grik ambassador has sent out since yesterday morning hes telling them to prepare our welcome said gleb what nature of welcome asked haraldr he had left his lonely perch while ulfr halldor and gleb had been distracted by the pigeon thats what troubles me well im glad something besides that girl troubles you said gleb he spat and smiled like a father forgiving a foolish son then his malleable face puckered with concern id say were in danger if only because theres no knowing the mind of these greeks theyre a nervous people theyve never trusted the rus and this business with their manglavite which they surely know of by now has got to alarm them its obvious from the way their ambassador has acted indeed thought haraldr for the past three and a half weeks the byzantine trade ambassador had rebuffed every attempt at communication with the curt message maintain course in fact they had seen neither the ambassador nor the interpreter gregory since leaving st gregorys island can we fight them asked ulfr gleb tugged at his doughy jowls long before i made my first trip down the dnieper a rus fleet attacked the greek navy right in front of the empress city but these were swift warships manned by thousands of varangians swedes i believe they were even then the greeks were able to call on their lightning from heaven and set the water on fire they say you could walk across the shores of the bosporus for a rowingspell and your feet would never touch anything but the bodies of sailors both greek and rus ten ships returned to kiev thats when the emperor and the great prince decided a treaty was preferable to such slaughter then that treaty will protect us said ulfr hopefully unless they view the death of their manglavite as a breach of that treaty indeed an act of aggression against the very emperor whom hakon served added haraldr we dont even know who the emperor is now said halldor its fairly certain that basil bulgarslayer is dead the bulgarslayer had ruled byzantium for so long that he had become a legend even in the far north long before haraldr had been born all we know beyond that are reports of mutterings made by hakon when he was drunk of a second and even third emperor after basil bulgarslayer and something about a bitchwhore who has had a very great hand in this succession of emperors halldor looked around at the group and gave his usual insouciant shrug there are times when a man finds himself far from shelter on a moonless night with his tinder wet theres nothing he can do but wait for the sun haraldr envied halldor his innate calm as much as he hated his own gutchurning helplessness he was no halldor but he knew that halldor was right they could only wait and watch whos got the sharpest eyes he asked gleb send him up the mast gleb snapped an order and blud a young slav oarsman clambered up the mast like a monkey and stood atop the single crossspar from which the billowing square sail was suspended blud waved happily at his comrades below and then intently began to study the empty rus sea bosporus gleb pointed to the now clearly visible fissure in the green band of headland he called out for the following ships at last count there were one hundred and fiftyfour vessels remaining of the close to five hundred that had left kiev to make a broad starboard turn and close up formation the sun was rising to its zenith and the water glittered the sky was an immaculate cerulean soon it became apparent that the bosporus was a good fourth or even third of a rowingspell in width dozens of small boats with square and triangular white sails cruised along the coastline scattered clusters of white buildings gleamed on the high grassy treespotted escarpments of the nearest shore some of these apparent suburbs of the great city were more extensive than any town haraldr had ever seen save kiev after an hour or so the bosporus narrowed to several thousand ells the immense buildings scattered on the headlands became clearly visible domes like those of yaroslavs cathedral though much larger rose from yewcoloured woods aheaaad aheaaad off the prow blud looked like a mad seabird leaping up and down on the crossspar flapping his free arm and screaming himself purple haraldr dashed to the mast grabbed a rope and pulled himself up the timber spire at first it seemed like a necklace on the water flashing in the sun within a few minutes the jewels could be distinguished as gilded swoopnecked prows dragons like the ships of norse kings but there had been only a handful of such ships in the entire north now there were hundreds out there spread across the entire width of the bosporus gleb came scrambling spryly up the mast his limp no handicap in the rigging he frowned as he appraised the dancing gold on the water the fleet was approaching rapidly haraldr counted perhaps a hundred large ships surrounded by several hundred smaller supporting vessels though still too distant for an accurate gauge of length the biggest ships were clearly of enormous size with double banks of oars twin masts and what looked like huge gold beasts perhaps panthers or bears looming at both bow and stern dhromons of the imperial fleet gleb spoke as if he were describing a huge wave rolling towards them a natural phenomenon that a man could only curse helplessly in his last instant of life fireships in what formation gleb cleared his throat with an angry growl battle formation if we are to die haraldr told himself we will not make it easy for them he shouted down to halldor we must give no provocation reef sails but dont furl them oars and weapons ready but out of sight keep men in place to furl sails quickly at my command well wait for them but if they come closer than two thousand ells well furl sails and row for the shore those big ships may have trouble manoeuvring up against the headlands so will these rus washtubs answered halldor then he shouted the orders down the line within minutes the entire rus trade flotilla had stopped and sat bobbing like a great flock of waterfowl resting on the water the imperial ships continued to advance their formation perfect oars slitting the water in precise rhythm haraldr could see metal scintillating on the decks and distinct figures clambering about the range was down to three thousand ells a fearsome oxlike bellowing echoed across the water two thousand five hundred ells haraldr looked at gleb gleb just shook his head and worked his jaws perun be praised that he had exacted enough gold from yaroslav to ensure that his grandchildren would never have to look down the angry snout of an imperial dhromon if his death could buy that then death take him two thousand two hundred the dhromons bellowed again louder as if the leering golden spouts had been transformed into the creatures they resembled two thousand one hundred at two thousand ells haraldr hesitated and decided to wait a moment longer he was no exact judge of distance a few hundred more ells would still give them time to break for shore eighteen hundred haraldr could see that the men on the decks of the giant byzantine ships wore armour kristr my fate is in your hands odins gift is of no use here seventeen hundred the command could no longer be delayed halno wait signal flags wriggled up the barren first mast of the lead dhromon the double rows of oars lifted glistening from the water bristled in the air like the spines of strange sea monsters and vanished almost simultaneously into the hulls of the dhromons the byzantine ships slowed and then stopped they were about fifteen hundred ells away gleb looked at haraldr dont assume anything when you deal with the greeks they love a ruse the motion at the periphery of haraldrs vision sent his pulse hammering what fool had broken rank then he saw the crimson sail puffed out like a fat silk cushion the trade ambassadors ship furiously rejoining its own the ambassador stood in the prow like a victorious admiral a few paces behind him a little bald figure turned looked up to the mast of haraldrs ship and waved gregory he looked lonely and wistful as if he were bidding his norse friends a permanent farewell a single small warship slipped out from between the monstrous dhromons and came very rapidly towards the ambassadors vessel the two ships drew even halted and bobbed in unison haraldr could see the flash of armour as several men leapt from the warship onto the deck of the ambassadors stubby vessel an animated discussion seemed to commence on and on it went arms raised on one side and then the other in a distant mimed debate the wind flapped the reefed sail of haraldrs ship and he imagined that it was the sound of the griks quarrelling among themselves good he told himself clearly there is a lack of resolution here but remember what gleb said about grik ruses the armoured figures leapt back to the warship oars dipped into the water and the ambassadors ship went on towards the line of dhromons while the small warship moved forward the question thundered into haraldrs head will the dhromons follow if the seagoing monsters now moved even an ell he could not hesitate to give the last order of his shortlived command but the dhromons remained motionless except for the slightest swaying it was as if the colossal warships were great buildings anchored in the earth rather than vessels floating on water the small byzantine warship came on with startling speed it seemed no larger than the rus ships with just a single row of oars the pitchslathered hull was solid black but the railing prow and swooping stern were brilliant arabesques of gold and red enamel the planked deck painted a gleaming white supported enormous crossbows on wheeled carriages most of the men on deck wore steel jerkins or bright blue steel byrnnies and conical helmets the byzantine ship closed oars almost brushing the hull of haraldrs ship an armoured figure apparently an officer and a single civilian came to the railing amidships the officers head was uncovered and his short curly hair was raked by the breeze his beard was neatly trimmed he wore a mail jerkin and a short scarlet tunic the man beside him was swathed from head to toe in a solid black robe only a stubble covered his head and squinched distorted face the wind slackened haraldr could hear snatches of the two men conversing he scampered down the mast gleb followed haraldr norbnordbriv shouted the man in black his norse accent was not nearly as good as gregorys you are now under the authority of michael lord of the entire world the emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans his imperial majesty has sent as his representative the droungarios of his imperial fleet nicephorus taronites who has sent as his representative the homes bardas lascaris the officer narrowed his dark eyes menacingly and barely nodded i john stethatus continued the man in black temporary secretary in the office of the barbaroi under the logothete of the dromus speak for the komes i am haraldr nordbrikt this fleet is under my authority and i speak for myself and those under my command the two byzantines spoke rapidly in greek the question was settled quickly the man in black shouted in norse again then the command you will give your fleet is this wait for our signal he pointed to the single mast of the warship one red flag and one white then follow us under sail in single file we will escort you to the queen of cities the warship moved quickly to a post fifty ells ahead of the rus vessel a single yellow flag went up its mast an answering yellow flag went up one of the masts of the nearest dhromon and the beasts bellowed again the spiny oars of the dhromons emerged and slapped the blueslate surface of the bosporus the great ships began to fan off their formation and head south along either bank of the strait it was as if the byzantine warships were forming a huge funnel to draw the rus flotilla down the bosporus or to surround and annihilate it haraldr turned to gleb but the old slav just chewed and ground his boot against the rough planking ive never seen an escort in such force but remember that the greeks rarely do the obvious haraldr had already made his decision were sailing rus washtubs not norse dragons he said forcing a jaunty smile at halldor if we run if we fight a dozen ships might survive to reach the dnieper and how many of those would survive the pechenegs no that way death is certain we dont know how the griks think but we know that this trade must be of value to them or it would not have continued for so many years this way we have one gaming piece on the table ulfr swallowed thickly and nodded gleb chewed and spat halldor shouted the order back the red flag went up on the mast of the small warship just ahead the white flag followed oars dipped and the byzantine warship began to move forward gleb ordered the sail set the gust caught and the ship lurched forward the rest of the rus fleet followed soon the giant dhromons flanked the rus river ships on both sides at distances of only a hundred or so ells they were floating islands three perhaps four times as long as olafs dragonship a vessel that had been the marvel of the north the massive black hulls were as high as the walls of yaroslavs palace and a giltandred building as big as the average norse farmers dwelling sat on each foredeck the spoutsnouted beasts at the bow and stern of each ship were more than twice as tall as a man and there was a third such spout on the deck between the two masts some of the spouts had been turned at angles to face the rus ships apparently these manmade dragons could swivel their necks just like living creatures the dhromons oars methodically plodding at the sluggish pace of the merchant ships continued to flank the entire rus fleet as it moved south the buildings on either shore but particularly to the starboard became more closely spaced and yet more complex in structure we have already passed the dwellings of a dozen yaroslavs thought haraldr but if this is miklagardr where are the great citys fabled walls an apparition appeared on the horizon a wavering ivory line flecked with bits of coral and silver haraldr shouted at ulfr and halldor and pointed gleb watched the three huge norsemen standing there jabbering like excited boys and smiled knowingly haraldr scrambled for the mast followed by ulfr and halldor kristr the pure haraldr gasped from the top spar he could see the immense sprawl of miniature palaces on the starboard shoreline though still diminished by distance the buildings would have to be as large as those they were passing now but the sparkling little domes and cubes now densely blanketed an area that stretched as far as the eye could see haraldrs knees weakened men could not build this gods perhaps but not men ulfr shouted and pointed to larboard no it was simply not possible even for the gods another great city on the opposite shore of the bosporus had the griks built a twin of miklagardr impossible kristrs mother this miklagardr was no less sprawling and lavish and brightly twinkling than the other we have left the middle realm thought haraldr we sail on the clouds towards the city the twin cities that kristr built in paradise he is truly the conqueror the ship pitched on a wave and metal glinted on the water directly between the twin cities of miklagardr haraldrs bowels knotted with alarm another fleet even greater than that which already surrounded them and the purpose of this second armada was obvious there was already sufficient escort haraldr whipped his head around to observe the dhromons expecting them to initiate the slaughter ulfr continued to elaborate on his discovery of the second miklagardr struggling to come up with some clumsy verses look halldor spoke with his insistent reserve he pointed towards the deadly scintillae of the second great fleet a heavy cresting swell tossed the bow high again haraldrs feet slipped and his fingers clawed the mast he looked at the frothing wake below and his heart raced when he looked up again halldor was still pointing only his eyes spoke haraldr sighted down halldors trembling finger all the gods all of them conspired to create this vision haraldr told himself this dream that mocks mortal existence until it seems nothing the twin cities that we thought were miklagardr are merely court men skalds who announce the entrance of the glorious sovereign of the entire world all the gods i have seen what i will see when i close my eyes for the last time gold and silver bubbled up from the sea shimmered and froze a froth of enormous bubbles that rose and fell over hills of solid ivory it was an enormous island of gold and silver and ivory no it was perhaps a huge finger of land jutting into the sea one could not see where it ended wind rattled the rigging and the ship sped towards the vision the shimmering bubbles were domes like the ones they had seen earlier but hundreds and hundreds and hundreds climbing up and down gleaming hills domes built upon domes to rise like globular mountains forests of enormous pillars stood in polychrome rows and window glass almost unknown in the north sparkled like diamond dewdrops constantinople the queen of cities rose from the sea like a huge gemencrusted reliquary on they sped the vision steadily rising from the water becoming more intricate in its fantastic multicoloured details awnings winked into view and tiny figures appeared on scrolled balconies the vast seawall a towering elaborately crenellated structure of brilliant ochre brick girdled the entire visible stretch of waterfront like a huge golden belt asgard said ulfr numbly the city of the gods on the deck below the rus traders and oarsmen crowded the railing exclaiming in wonder a miracle wrought by the angelic host father almighty christ the pure has brought us to his heavenly mansions the byzantine warships slowed and veered hard starboard towards an arm of the sea that embraced the city on the north the entrance to this prodigious harbour was marked by a soaring turret of mournful ashen stone set at the edge of the water the grim tower was a sinister contrast to the vivid colour of the buildings behind it for some reason haraldr shuddered as if he had seen a vision of his own grave gleb had already shouted the order to stop when haraldr saw what the old slav pilot was pointing at the mouth of the harbour was blocked by a colossal boom of skiffsize metal chain links alternating with wooden floats the size of tree trunks the daunting waterborne barrier extended from the brooding grey tower to the teeming docks on the opposite shore a span of about fifteen hundred ells a tender towed the boom towards the tower and the two fleets resumed their procession in the distance perhaps half a rowingspell off chequered dunandgreen hills sprinkled with chalkwhite dwellings rose above what haraldr assumed to be the western terminus of the harbour the harbour was crowded with perhaps a thousand ships dhromons smaller galleys exotic merchant vessels many types haraldr had never seen before along the shoreline as far as one could see enormous warehouses supported on pilings extended from the towering seawall out over the water from the landward side of the citys girding wall palatial stone edifices some of them extravagant concoctions of clustered cupolas and meandering arcades ascended the hills to the shallow summit of the citys long languorous spine broad white avenues teeming with laden porters mules carts and fourwheeled wagons as big as norse cottages disappeared into the architectural maze of the city as the rus fleet sailed on into the harbour haraldr turned and again studied the harbour chain no hull could challenge the cyclopean links and floats when the boom was drawn back behind them they would leave only with the permission of the griks emmanuel counted them he says there are only one hundred and fifty or so the prefect had anticipated four or five hundred ships now he will start gouging the butchers and the silk merchants to make up the shortfall i wouldnt be surprised if we find he has set the prices higher tomorrow the augusta theodora stood on the thirdstorey balcony of her ancient country palace her home was sufficiently far from the city to be considered a place of exile she had a view across the olivegreen hills occasionally speckled with whitemarble porticoes and redtile roofs that sloped to the distant slablike surface of the golden horn the enormous natural harbour flanking constantinople on the north the sails of the usual merchant traffic surrounded the wharves like swarms of whiteandbeige butterflies in the middle of the harbour the rus ships lashed together in a long single file looked like a wooden causeway set between two rows of giant metalbeaked dhromons constantinople seemed cool silent almost misty in the early evening light the last rays of the sun caught the ornate palaces high on the citys spine from this distance the long expanse of enormous buildings appeared to be a single intricate carving in gleaming ivory i am told they have brought some very fine sable skins said maria i intend to get enough to line three coats even if i have to auction a vineyard to pay for them of course the price will go down next year when the rus return in greater numbers but whatever i might save on next years sables wont keep me warm this winter the rus may never return at least to trade emmanuel says emmanuel was theodoras chamberlain although he had accompanied her into exile he still maintained a priceless network of informants among the eunuchs of the imperial palace that both the grand domestic and the droungarios of the imperial fleet favoured attacking the rus fleet in the bosporus this morning apparently the manglavite was murdered by one of the varangians he had recruited and now the murderer commands the entire rus fleet it is claimed that this varangian is a dangerous privateer and an enemy of christendom maria snorted with disgust i would consider the murderer of a manglavite a friend of rome perhaps so but the military clique and their dhynatoi sponsors are still looking for an incident to spark a confrontation what does joannes say he is holding them back for the time being as usual his real interest is obscure i think he might use the rus to bargain with the dhynatoi then give them up if joannes and the dhynatoi ever came to an accommodation i would fear for my sisters life theodora pursed her thin spinsterish lips she was tall with an angular frame and a disproportionately small face her immature pinched features gave her the aspect of a small child grown into middle age without ever ripening into womanhood though she was younger than her sister the empress zoe theodora often seemed old enough to be zoes mother how is my sister she asked unhappy her husband has not spent the night with her for almost a month i had hoped she would find peace with him after romanus theodora paused and scraped at the coarse stone with her silk slipper are you happy darling i think i am in love there was a curious melancholy to this pronouncement theodora smiled though her face seemed capable only of irony never genuine mirth is it one of them or both she peered down into the unkempt yard directly beneath the balcony alexandras and giorgios looked like little boys foraging they were peeling the thick layer of ivy from the weatherworn statue of an ancient roman deity i could tell immediately that the browneyed boy is in love with you he is the one maria said numbly darling you know i have always tried to refrain from judging you but will you be careful i think of my sister and how different everything might have been maria knew that theordora was referring to her older sister eudocia who had conceived a child out of wedlock given birth in a convent and had died shortly thereafter the baby was always said to have been stillborn though maria sometimes wondered if it had been adopted by a simple family and now oblivious of its imperial destiny lived a far happier life than its mother ever could have enjoyed i know all the precautions maria said there is even a physician from alexandria who specializes in the field i dont mean those precautions darling or even the measures one must take to guard the heart i mean the precautions of the soul maria nodded vaguely and studied the line of rus ships in the harbour it shames heaven kristr forgive me but it shames heaven ulfr shook his head and stared the great city blazed away in the night how many lights enough to make it like day down by the wharves where the porters still struggled with sacks and barrels and bales enough to turn the enchanted crown of the city into a dazzling universe drapes and garlands of winking lights spread over the hills as far as one could see the stars in the glassy black night were barely visible in comparison haraldr let the boy stand for him before this vision the man the commander of a fleet had given his orders and slipped off to await the day the boy stood in the inky night and saw a dream every norse boys dream of distant magic miklagardr become real haraldr gleb hobbled frantically across the hold his face lobstered his breathing was virtually apoplectic and he had to clear his throat several times before he could speak its lyashko hes a merchant from novgorod and a fool haraldr quickly remembered who lyashko was he was as big round as he was tall with a blunt nose and a greasy bald head hed made trouble ever since st gregorys island lagging behind and then sailing out of sight ahead of the file until haraldr had threatened to chain both him and his equally foolish pilot after that he had simply sailed up every day to grumble about incorrect headings yes the very one gleb said seeing the recognition in haraldrs eyes hes got himself and his men drunk says hes going into the city to find greek whores perun strike me if he didnt threaten my life when i tried to stop him haraldr left gleb far behind as he sprinted along the bridge of lashedtogether rus ships hurdling railing after railing damn fool lyashko after they had entered the harbour that afternoon haraldr had been called upon by an official announced as the legatharios to the prefect of the city a pale emaciated man dressed in the most intricately embroidered silk robe haraldr had ever seen though the legatharios had merely gazed into some metaphysical distance throughout the interview his interpreter the first norsespeaking byzantine they had met who was not a eunuch had issued a long set of directives haraldr and his men were expected to observe under the byzantinerus treaty the byzantine officials had expressly instructed them to lash their ships together and remain anchored in the middle of the harbour until a complete inventory of their cargoes and crews could be taken any vessel leaving the rank was to be considered in the interpreters words a brigand and will be dealt with as such by elements of the imperial fleet haraldr had spent the rest of the day making certain that every shipowner and pilot understood the byzantine orders a single ship out of formation and the lurking dhromons might be provoked into attacking the entire rus fleet haraldr must have leapt over a hundred railings before he saw the crews that had crowded the ships next to lyashkos he moved through the jabbering excited throng and the exclamations of its him its him and hakonslayer and mightyarm began to circulate he reached the gap in the line of lashedtogether ships and looked across the murky water nothing he left like that jarl said a gnarled old pilot with an eye patch slapping his hands briskly nobody could stop them elovit there he pointed to a boy with linen wrapped around his arm took a good cut theyda killed us kristr damn lyashko haraldr continued to search the black water between the line of rus ships and the harbour but he could discern nothing the lights from the harbour didnt illuminate the entire stretch of water and even lyashko wasnt enough of a fool to go in with a lantern shining from his mast close this gap shouted haraldr get a torch or a lantern up on every cross spar and keep them burning weve got to convince the griks theres only one renegade halldor and ulfr arrived both out of breath halldor made sure that haraldrs order started down the line find a healer for this boy haraldr told ulfr he looked out over the water again and thought he saw the silhouette of a rus river ship against the fringe of light spilling from the docks but the fleeing shape slipped back into the night lights began to appear from the mastheads of the rus ships as if in response rows of lanterns appeared before and behind the rus ships at a distance of several hundred ells haraldr watched the flaring lamps with utter horror the lights were paired one from each mast of the mighty dhromons the beasts were stirring in the night the dhromons bellowed as they had during the day but their lights remained motionless a still precise constellation against the dark water haraldr searched the brilliant formation for movement the beasts bellowed again again haraldr saw the darting grey silhouette of lyashkos ship two lights began to move passing the motionless row of similar pairs they were tracking in the direction of the evanescent silhouette the twin lights moved swiftly heading east almost a thousand ells away in an instant the night became day with a whooshing roaring sound a liquid comet a searing exploding rainbow of fire arced over the water the huge flamespitting snout of the dhromon glared like molten gold at the other end of the terrible arc lyashkos ship exploded in a volcanic pillar of flame the storm of fire almost immediately wilted the rigging of the rus ship and the human forms that for an appalling instant could be seen staggering within the inferno daylight burst again and the water itself began to burn around the redveiled shape of the boat before the brilliance of the second fiery rainbow had faded a third spout of flame arced from the dhromon in a monstrous exhalation lyashkos ship laden with wax simply exploded a ball of fire thundered back into the sky and rolled towards the vault of heaven only splintered timbers were left to be consumed by the flaming waters the rows of twin lights their work done winked out leaving the blazing slick to light the pall like a solitary eerie eruption from the darkest depths of the sea haraldr spent the rest of the awful night staring out at the incandescent city from the prow of his ship the dragon i have slain he told himself was merely a toy of the mind a creature of my thoughts tonight i have seen real dragons the creatures wrought by men and they are infinitely more terrifying and how if i must will i ever slay them the backs of the porters glistened doused with the heat of the high afternoon sun haraldr stood uneasily on the dock trying to regain his sense of the earth beneath him he imagined he would never become used to the din of this city it was a human cataract that roared shrieked and buzzed unceasingly five more barrels and were done sang out gleb in his happiest growl then well drink greek wine and all have aching skulls in the morning haraldr was about to turn to halldor and ask him to check on the progress of the offloading of the other varangian ships they all needed to gather and discuss haraldr norbriv haraldr stared in astonishment the dark little man tugging at his sleeve looked like a marmot dark and hairyfaced and no larger than a fiveyearold norse boy he wore a dirty pale yellow cap tied round his head with a ribbon and a faded yellow silk robe with several tears and holes in it he might have just crawled out from a burrow but he spoke norse quickly quickly haraldr norbriv you have five hundred varangians conscripted with you nicephorus argyrus knows indeed he does the marmotman pointed to the crest of the city where the great palaces ran on endlessly nicephorus argyrus yes indeed he does know the marmotman chuckled conspiratorially well he wants all five hundred yes yes you heard me correctly all five hundred marmotman tugged frantically at haraldrs sleeve and tried to pull him closer his breath smelled like fish his voice dropped to a harsh whisper nicephorus argyrus offers you five bezants to enrol each man and wages to consist marmotman broke off and his dark pupils dilated with fright he manoeuvred himself behind haraldr haraldr turned at the sound of hooves clamouring on the paved street that ran by the wharf mounted on dazzling white horses a contingent of perhaps two dozen men in short red tunics bronze breastplates and kilts made of leather strips swept aside the dockside traffic they were armed with short thrusting swords and longshafted spears from which flew scarletandgold banners the horsemen stopped in formation a few paces from haraldr a single rider moved forward reined his immaculately groomed horse and looked down at haraldr the rider had clippedshort dark hair and beard and taut leathertough tanned skin his hard unflinching eyes were coloured like the rus sea at dawn the horseman peered around haraldr and saw the cringing little marmotman he exploded in a fury of apparent obscenities lowered his spear and teasingly prodded marmotman and sent him scurrying off then he turned to a handsome barrelchested blond man in the first rank behind him and spoke rapidly haraldr heard the words nicephorus argyrus varangian and basileus mentioned the darkhaired horseman didnt seem faintly amused but the blondhaired man smiled showing perfect white teeth and shook his head araltes orkvit soree no talktauroscyth the darkhaired man held up his hand wait haraldr understood the crude stab at his name and the message but tauroscyth was that the greek name for norse as haraldr considered this two more figures emerged from the dockside traffic and walked towards him the two men daintily pulled up the hems of their streetlength blue silk tunics and gingerly picked their way over the paving stones as if they were walking on cow dung haraldr immediately recognized the arrogantly contemplative legatharios who had so studiously ignored him the previous day and the short blondhaired interpreter who had instructed him in the treaty provisions as he had the day before the interpreter carried a stack of documents written on a curious very thin and supple membrane unlike any parchment haraldr had ever seen the neatly inked characters seemed to dart across the page like busy insects the interpreter spoke for a moment with the darkhaired horseman haraldr sensed a controlled but still quite evident antagonism between the two he also noticed with great interest that the legatharios was ignoring the byzantine horsemen as magisterially as he had the rus barbaroi the darkhaired horseman reached into a leather pouch attached to his saddle and produced a folded curiously purpletinted document tied with a cord secured by two coinshaped seals one of red wax and the other seemingly pressed in lead or perhaps even pewter he handed it to the interpreter the interpreter placed the sealed document beneath a single sheet on top of his stack then he turned to haraldr and read from the sheet first haraldr nordbrikt i wish to convey the concern of the imperial administration over the impudent and unprovoked violation of harbourprotocol on the previous evening any further contradictions of imperial authority can result in the abridgement of privileges extended under the terms of our mutual agreement he paused and removed the message from the top of the sheaf we are almost finished checking off your cargoes when the process is completed the prefect will require your entire contingent to reembark for your final berthing place near st mamas quarter as principal authority over the rus fleet haraldr nordbrikt bears overall responsibility for the orderly execution of this procedure st mamas quarter asked haraldr the traditional lodging place for you rus outside the walls the interpreter pointed to the western terminus of the harbour then we are not to be permitted into the city the interpreter sniffed with contempt once approved by the prefect the rus will be admitted to the city with escort and in groups not to exceed fifty men the interpreter cut off the discussion with a curt nod he handed the sealed document to the legatharios who pressed it to his forehead and then kissed it then the legatharios broke the seals made no attempt even to unfold the sheet much less read it and handed it back kristr these griks are curious thought haraldr does anyone here do anything for himself the interpreter unfolded the document and read it carefully when he had finished he spoke to the legatharios who snapped back at him irritably then the interpreter spoke to the darkhaired horseman who responded in a steely tone the only words that haraldr recognized in the exchange were varangian and basileus but there was also another name which was repeated joannes always preceded by some sort of lengthy tonguetangling title and the name joannes seemed to settle the matter the interpreter glanced at the document and then looked at haraldr and gestured with his hand as he spoke as if paraphrasing this topoteretes of the imperial scholae requests that in your capacity as commandant of five hundred varangians you assemble your men when you reach st mamas quarter you are to be lodged separately from the rest of the rus when you arrive present this order to the imperial official in charge of final disembarkation then you will be escorted to your quarters the interpreter handed the document to haraldr the writing was in greek and in a reddish ink the broken seals seemed to be impressed with the likeness of a bearded man with long hair he held a staff with a large ornamental knob the back of haraldrs neck tingled was this the emperor by the time haraldr looked up again the legatharios and his interpreter were gone and the horsemen had wheeled their mounts and cantered off in stately procession this is certainly no prison haraldr told ulfr and halldor as he paced his footfall resounded off the green marble floor and echoed through the vast hall could it be one of their barracks he bent over and examined one of the cots that ran in long rows separated by an aisle the hundredell length of the room the simple wood frame of the cot though dented and nicked in places had been smoothed and finished the linencovered mattresses were yellowed and covered with the rings of old stains but they seemed to have been washed and they were stuffed with cotton not straw halldor sat down on one of the mattresses theres no inn in iceland this good perhaps they aim to soften us up with comfort then halldor drew his hand across his neck and grinned haraldr couldnt share halldors amusement he strode to the row of elegantly arched windows that lined the inner wall of the hall through the clear panes of glass some were cracked and a few were missing he could see the varangians milling and arguing in groups on the broad lawn that covered the large interior court of the building beyond this court was a parallel wing of the huge villa also filled with beds at the left end of the court was a complex of empty stables and locked rooms and at the right end were more rooms and a gate flanked by two large marble pillars the wooden gate was open and a wagon loaded with numerous sacks of grain and barrels of ale or wine had just rolled through haraldr had no doubt that the gate would again be locked behind them once the stores had been unloaded but other than his suspicion that they were under a polite form of arrest haraldr had no signal of what the griks intended to do with him or his pledgemen and he was wondering of the griks themselves knew and what about marmotman he was no official but he knew about the varangians and was trying to hire them apparently for someone named nicephorus argyrus one thing was certain however haraldr couldnt let the griks confusion or subterfuge infect his relationship with his new followers he had already heard one of the malcontents grumble to the effect that hakon would already have had them feasting in the imperial palace it wasnt a moment too soon to organize the men into companies and begin to fashion them into a disciplined fighting unit there at least he was on secure ground as a boy he had seen olaf turn ragged raiding parties into wellschooled armies a dozen times and the thought occurred to him that if he was to one day be a king then he would have to begin his own training now halldor ulfr barked haraldr they looked up surprised at the unexpected sternness of his tone get the men in here and assigned to beds in one half hour have them dressed in full armour for drills in the courtyard where would you like to be asked maria she stood before her bedchambers arcade and the colour of her eyes was so closely keyed to the hot flat cerulean sky and sea behind her that it appeared they had been painted with the same precious pigment i am at your discretion mistress said the eunuch his name was isaac despite his beardless skin his jaw was tense and muscular in his elegant perfectly fitted silk robe his frame seemed lithe and supple but with broad masculine proportions his blond hair was long and lightly curled maria laughed delightfully no i intend to leave this entirely up to you surprise me isaac did not have to deliberate he was a vestiopratai an imperially licensed dealer in the finest finished silk goods and while he numbered many of the dhynatoi and highranking ladies of the court among his customers this was his first summons to the gynaeceum the imperial womens apartments he had prepared thoroughly he could describe the plan and furnishings of the mistress of the robess apartments as accurately as if he had been there a dozen times previously you are not troubled by the heat he asked no i hate to be cold isaac led maria to an observation cupola on the roof he sent her eunuchs for cushions and cold wine the breeze that whispered through the delicate columns was like silk tissue teased over the skin he had long ago learned to be expedient and as soon as the cushions and goblets had been properly placed he unlaced marias scaramangium she stepped out of the robe and stood on the marble bench so that her body was exposed to the breeze isaac hardened her nipples with buttersmooth fingers then took the chilled wine in his mouth when he touched his cold tongue to her nipple she convulsed and whimpered his tongue slid towards her navel but she pushed him away she unlaced him and stripped off his robe he was as solid and as smooth as a statue she fell to her knees and ran her tongue along the tawny mass of scar tissue at the base of his erection then towards the engorged tip it is so beautiful she said when you are almost ready come inside me isaac was in fact both a eunuch and a silk dealer but his principal vocation was making this sort of call on wealthy highly placed women a vocation for which he was uniquely suited while the operation to create a eunuch was usually performed in childhood some boys like isaac had their testicles surgically removed in midadolescence although their bodies might never develop fully masculine characteristics their ability to function sexually and their desire to do so could sometimes remain intact such a eunuch offered a highly placed woman two invaluable attributes he usually would not arouse suspicion and he could not impregnate them when they had finished isaac reclined on the tasselled cushions he always provided his customers an opportunity to talk maria sat and shaded her eyes against the sun as she looked out towards chrysopolis the huge city across the bosporus you are better than i had hoped she said isaac smiled most eunuchs can function physically i have found unless of course they have had the entire male apparatus removed but this catastrophic surgery was rare because the operation was so dangerous and the wound caused recurring problems even when healed it was usually only performed on pechenegs or other barbaroi races that they do not is usually a matter of inadequate desire or technique maria laughed what technique was required for me that was desire is there any man who hasnt desired you i want something beyond desire still i enjoyed this you are like a boy and yet also a man i will want you again i have a lover and another boy with whom i am in love but my specialist advises me that on certain days i must abstain if i do not want unintended consequences still the more regularly one enjoys passion the more one becomes addicted if i did not have a lover now i would not need you so badly i am at your discretion mistress do you work with men only if a lady asks for another man to join us have you ever had a tauroscythian no i would try to find one if you are interested no maria looked down and stroked her fiat velvetsoft belly do you know what they are going to do with those tauroscythians they are calling pirates maria understood the efficiency with which information passed among the citys highly placed eunuchs it was as if they had all joined in some secret pact to punish the society that had deprived them of their manhood by exposing its secrets they are still arguing the military are quite set on simply massacring the entire lot now that their ships are unloaded they say there is still a threat of invasion maria snorted the military are the stooges of the dhynatoi the dhynatoi have never forgotten how basil the bulgarslayer used the varangians against them almost half a century earlier basil the bulgarslayer had recruited a large force of norse mercenaries to put down a revolt of the dhynatoi the varangians had been so effective in crushing internal opposition that basil had created the varangian guard to institutionalize permanently their role as the sentinels of imperial power over the succeeding decades the varangians had come to be seen as the champions of the middle and lower classes who relied on the protection of a strong emperor and the sworn enemies of the selfishly ambitious landed aristocracy somehow the rumour has been started that there is a tauroscythian prince among the traders isaac said the grand domestic the grand domestic was the empires highestranking military commander has elaborated this gossip into a theory that this prince intends to enter the city with his varangians then summon a huge invasion force lurking somewhere in the rus sea and open the gates for them when they arrive the grand domestic is determined to find this man even if it means resorting to the kind of crude measures with which herod hoped to indemnify himself against the christ child he has already had the rus traders interrogated how fascinating marias eyes sparkled like a childs i wonder if the fairhairs will eat our flesh and drink our blood as the prophets have foretold for centuries the fairhaired nations had been cast as the agents of doom in so many byzantine tales of the apocalypse that their role was as well known as that of the antichrist i think it is all nonsense said isaac of course there is no such prince and all the talk of action on the part of the grand domestic is bluster it always is what everyone will probably end up agreeing to do is to execute this bandit who killed the manglavite though they should rightly give him a palace near the forum bovis send the rest of the tauroscythians off to garrison ancyra and be done with it yes said maria distractedly she put her hand on isaacs thigh i suppose that compromise would make everyone except the tauroscythian bandit happy the bronze breastplates and the brilliant white horses flickered in the sun the same mounted contingent that had greeted haraldr three days ago at the docks rode stiffly into the courtyard the toughlooking topoteretes dismounted and looked around haraldr discerned that the byzantine officer was more than a bit impressed by the sight of almost five hundred armoured norse giants slashing shoving and grunting in martial cacophony a blackfrocked civilian mounted on a mule rode in among the horses john the interpreter with the squinched hairless face interesting haraldr thought that the same interpreter was assigned to the navy and now this group of horsemen perhaps there were fewer norse interpreters than it seemed at first that meant they might run into gregory again and then they might be able to get some information about the bewilderingly formal circuitous griks john the interpreter looked about spotted haraldr and nudged his mule towards the barbaroi chieftain haraldr nordbrikt come with us he said as if he were a gaoler addressing a prisoner where shot back haraldr his blood was spiced from three days of hard martial drills and he decided to get some answers from these griks for a change the interpreter stared sullenly haraldr noticed that his head and face were freshly shaven with his smooth skin john looked like a pink frog where haraldr repeated city said john as if answering an insistent squealing child inside the walls haraldrs breast drummed he snapped for one of the byzantine servants or were they spies who were always loitering around with hand motions he indicated he wanted a washbasin and clean tunic that wont be necessary snapped john haraldrs stomach plunged like cold lead in his sweaty torn tunic the only place he would be fit to be received would be in a slavegang or a dungeon well he would not let this blackfrocked frog march him off he continued to motion to the servants and sent them twittering on their errands john stared angrily but said nothing the topoteretes walked over and spoke to the interpreter who rattled on irritably and pointed at haraldr many barbarois peppered the recitation the topoteretes shrugged and went back to studying the drilling norsemen halldor walked up im going into the city haraldr told him youve got command until i return ulfr is your marshal and counsellor you know the drill schedule so keep to it ill be back the servants brought up the washbasin and one of hakons silk tunics and haraldr splashed water on his face and towelled dry when he looked up halldor was still observing him earnestly yes if i dont come back haraldr concluded you have the command permanently the mounted escort wound through the narrow streets of st mamas quarter looping around the back of a domed church huge by norse standards but relatively small in relation to the surrounding buildings as the stonepaved avenue straightened out haraldr could see an expanse of mowed grass ahead he looked up and gasped the great land wall which traversed the width of the peninsula on which constantinople had been built had been only partially visible as they had sailed into st mamas quarter now from an unobstructed headon view it seemed like a vast tiered manytowered city unto itself the first line of defence a moat as broad as a small river it was partitioned by a series of dikes that enabled it to climb up and down the gently rolling hills would alone have been the engineering miracle of the north just beyond the moat was a brick parapet about as high as the walls of a rus city then a broad graded path and finally a second wall of unimaginable dimensions the alternating courses of stone and brick rose a good twenty ells and were studded with massive stone turrets at regular intervals beyond this colossal defence was the main wall this third wall was at least as tall as a norse dragonship stood on end and yet the towering rectangular fortresses set against the sheer brickandstone surface at intervals of sixty ells they looked like the teeth of some worlddevouring beast as they ran off into the distance as far as one could see were twice as tall again each of these titanmade towers was a soaring castle capable of defending an entire city the size of kiev perhaps the gods had built these defences but not even the gods would dare come against them a small open gate framed by carved stone beams punctured the great wall several officials in long silk tunics one of the silkclads seemed to be a eunuch examined the documents presented by the topoteretes then began to question him insistently the eunuch looked at haraldr and shook his head the topoteretes pointed to something in the document and began a heated discourse haraldr observed that basileus and joannes and manglavite figured in this argument the eunuch protested again but the documents were returned to the topoteretes and he signalled his men to ride on the escort tunnelled through the wall and emerged on a brilliant white landscape a stonepaved avenue more than a hundred ells wide extended beyond the wall towards the distant heart of the city on either side of the street the three and fourstorey buildings rose like sheer cliffs though these palaces often had marblecolumned arcades at street level and elaborate balconies and rows of arched windows on the upper floors pack mules wagons slaveborne canopied litters and ordinary pedestrians jammed the street they passed one fourwheeled carriage with an elaborately gilded curtained boxlike enclosure for its invisible occupants haraldr struggled to capture details as his escort led him down the avenue at a brisk canter an arcade rollicking with roughly dressed men who hoisted wineskins as they disputed over board games and tossed dice a statue of an unclothed man set into a niche above a brassfitted oak door so astonishingly lifelike that one could see the veins beneath his pale marble skin a shorn blackfrock like john the interpreter offering bread to three ragged beggars who sat on a scrolled stone bench there were far fewer women than men about and most of them had wrapped bright cloth veils about their faces and moved in protective clusters but one young woman with a brightly painted face strutted alluringly alone the escort paused at a major intersection less than a dozen blocks into the city looking south down the paved street perpendicular to the main avenue haraldr saw enormous featureless russetbrick edifices looming some six even seven storeys high people milled about on the street and stuck their heads out of the innumerable windows for the first time haraldr noticed that the sky over the great city was strangely dingy he quickly established the source of the pollution maybe another dozen blocks due east from these buildings was a huge gritty pillar of smoke fouling the entire horizon not far away another shaft of soot rose above visible tongues of flame glowing cinders shot up into the roiling black column was the great city on fire neither the topoteretes nor his men took notice of this catastrophe they had been distracted by the approach of another contingent of a dozen mounted men quite similar in arms and attire to their own the leader of these horsemen had a sweatbeaded squarish face and red irritated eyes as if he had just ridden right through the smoke the topoteretes tipped his head deferentially and the redeyed man spoke with animated gestures then the redrimmed eyes turned to haraldr widened in surprise and he immediately gave the topoteretes what seemed to be a brusque order the topoteretes produced the magical documents again and the redeyed horseman looked at them handed them back and thought for a moment he snapped to one of his men there was some probing of saddle packs and a length of dark cloth was finally handed to the topoteretes the topoteretes then spoke to john the interpreter you have to be blindfolded haraldr iced with terror there was no reason unless they intended to put a blade to his neck two horsemen were already at his side he reflexively pushed them away his horse reared and more horsemen closed around him he threw one right out of the saddle but a blow cracked his head sparks showered as he sent another byzantine flying off his horse hands clutched all over him he heard a sound like glacier fracturing and smashing into his head and a brilliant light exploded into darkness ice he was in a huge ice cave his head throbbed and his neck ached how had he got back to norway had he ever left yes the pounding in his head had a pattern he could think between the metallic throbs yes he had left river city haraldr jerked erect his eyes focused ice somehow the griks had carved a room from ice the pure white light more diffuse than day but almost as bright momentarily defeated haraldrs quest for reason then he shaded his eyes and concentrated on bringing his mind back the ice was stone incredible stone a dazzling white marble with sinuous blue veins his head lolled and he strained to study the complex pattern on the floor knowing that if he understood it his mind would come back the floor was paved with polished marble a woven pattern of bands and circles of emerald and rubycoloured marble the light that glazed the marble seemed to come from high above he looked up light flooded in from a ring of windows set at an impossible height you shouldnt have fought the frog face of john the interpreter leered at him but he was speaking the words of the topoteretes who crouched over haraldr with apparent concern the blindfold was just a precaution against what thought haraldr painfully reorienting to keep me from seeing what so i wont know my way to what where exactly am i haraldr rubbed his head and looked around the vast hall dozens of finely dressed eunuchs circulated buzzing in discussion with one another as well as some soldiers four or five darkskinned saracens and several big shavenheaded men in poor brown wool tunics little better than those worn by norse slaves just a few paces from haraldr an excruciatingly thin eunuch with a curiously flabby pale face abruptly terminated his conversation and minced delicately on slippered feet towards haraldrs group with one sweep of his narrowly spaced hazel eyes the eunuch managed to look right through the topoteretes give the merest hint of contempt at the sight of the blackfrocked interpreter and completely ignore haraldr one hand propped on his bony hip the eunuch extended the spidery fingers of the other the topoteretes placed the documents in the eunuchs outstretched hand the eunuch unfolded the packet with the very tips of his fingers as if the pages had been dipped in fresh dung he was clearly less impressed than the previous inspectors he brusquely flipped through even the purpletinted document but the eunuch did pause over a plaincoloured sheet and something he read caused one of his thin seemingly paintedon eyebrows to quiver slightly that was the only reaction he betrayed without a word he folded the packet turned and walked off you follow him commanded john the interpreter in his sourest tone and dont try any more stupid barbaroi tricks the eunuch never once looked back to see if haraldr was following he left the great hall and after a long winding transit over marblepaved corridors stopped in front of heavy wooden double doors laced with gilt trim he pulled a yellow silken cord that dangled near the door frame to haraldrs astonishment the doors slid silently open as if they ran on greased tracks without even looking at haraldr the eunuch rolled his eyes towards the aperture the room was bright and strangely warm and humid marble benches and compartments lined the walls two young boys dressed in short white tunics waited by the doors clothes said one of the boys in a heavily accented attempt at norse with motions he indicated that haraldr should take his clothes off they dont bathe a man before they toss him in a dungeon thought haraldr with constrained relief still he could not escape the sensation that death however perfumed and silkfrocked stalked this place he remembered what gleb had said the griks were never straightforward about anything haraldr stripped and was shown through a door at the end of the room he was greeted by a blast of hot steamy air his eyes watered and for an instant he thought he would be attacked then the wonder of the place hit him the large domed chamber was almost completely filled with a brilliantly blue pool at the bottom of the pool was a shimmering illusion a twining green garden depicted with multicoloured bits of tile haraldr luxuriated in the cleansing heat and the cold water how long had it been since he had enjoyed a steam bath the pain at the back of his head subsided to a dull ache and he began to reassemble his scattered wits put aside your fear he told himself presume that you come as the leader of five hundred varangians not a condemned criminal they had you at their mercy on the street and yet look where you are now you have the instrument to serve the griks and they clearly have the wealth to serve your ends but why with every question that is answered are there two new ones who is nicephorus argyrus and what was it the griks didnt want you to see when he had finished bathing haraldr was towelled and combed and rubbed with scented oil then dressed in a long tunic of very fine white silk the high collar was crusted with heavy embroidery back in the marble hall two eunuchs both of them surprisingly stout waited for him along with the birchthin eunuch who had led him here originally his head cocked in annoyance the spindly eunuch cast his eyes over haraldr as if he had been forced to look at a mutilated corpse he turned to the other two and compressed his thin lips in an attitude of bored barest approval then his wretchedly bony shoulders shuddered slightly and he minced off the two big eunuchs flanked haraldr and each firmly but decorously took an elbow the hallway eventually turned into a large sunflooded arcade haraldr squinted out over a blazing expanse of white marble he could see patches of peacockblue sea framing a massive templelike structure several hundred ells away then he turned to his left he gasped and knew for certain where he was spread out over a gentle slope was a glittering jewel box that was an entire city fantastic multicoloured buildings stood on verdant terraces laced with neat rows of flowering trees shimmering azure ponds and pools and beds of vermilion blossoms scores of domes held aloft by columns of brilliant jadegreen marble or deep plumcoloured porphyry forming swirling patterns so deft and intricate that they seemed to have been painted against the backdrop of the sea and sky here in a magical city within the great city was the home of the emperor the eunuchs tightened their grip and led haraldr towards the prodigious building straight ahead six white columns so huge in girth that were they hollow a man could build a comfortable cottage within them thrust up to a marble roof at a dizzying height beneath the portico twostorey silver double doors embossed with fiercevisaged armoured eagles were surrounded by a perfect motionless semicircle of powerful darkeyed men in burnished steel breastplates and steel helms haraldr observed the guards dusky foreign features with a sharpness in his breast these men were khazars from serahs homeland the armoured arc split momentarily to allow haraldr and his escort to pass the enormous doors slid open as silently as those in the bath paradise it was not simply the vastness of the hall a bowman could not have shot the length of the jewelled cavern and the ceiling coffered with elaborate gold beams flecked with silver medallions soaring like a fantastic sky it was the supernatural sumptuousness pearlwhite marble columns topped with plumcoloured capitals wreathed with carved vines and flower buds candelabra that looked like lacy silver clouds dotted with glinting ice crystals curtains of braided ivy garlands of pink roses hanging tapestries stitched with lustrous flowers the entire back of the hall was cloaked with a vast purple curtain damasked with hundreds of huge eagles embroidered in gold forming a sort of funnel beneath the hangings were two ranks of soldiers in golden armour bearing standards topped with golden eagles and dragons a single figure stood at the very end of the funnel in front of a nowvisible seam where the two halves of the curtain met haraldrs heart leapt to his throat this man was as tall and broad as hakon he wore a golden breastplate and a plumed golden helmet with metal cheek pieces folded over his entire face concealing all save glints of blue behind the eye slits a varangian guard certainly and very likely mar hunrodarson himself i would not have expected this paradise to end at the executioners block thought haraldr with a groinstabbing renewal of his fear but i am told that the griks rarely do the expected the varangian stood perfectly motionless an immense silverbladed broadaxe inlaid with elaborate gold niello pressed to his chest like a rodent mesmerized by a snake haraldr was drawn to the eerie glimmer of life visible within the eye slits expecting some evidence of malice or recognition but the guarded irises were so still they might have been bits of glass the curtain drew aside slightly and the eunuchs led haraldr past the rigid varangian the rest came like a fantastic dream he was in a vast rosescented manydomed hall echoing with an unsettling powerfully sonorous music that pulsed within his very bones the hail was filled with a living rainbow hundreds of utterly motionless silksheathed bejewelled figures arrayed in perfectly concentric semicircles each ring a different dazzling hue the rainbow was broken in the middle by a great massing of incandescent gold a throne the size of a small building flanked by two large trees with leaves of delicate gold gembright birds perched in the gilt branches as haraldr approached the birds tittered and called in a supernatural melody cocking their brilliant heads and flapping their wings haraldr came to the terrifying realization that the birds were in fact jewels creatures of enamelled gold to which somehow the griks had given the power of both movement and voice then the beasts came to life from behind the trees and the blood drained from haraldrs face and his knees buckled lions creatures of the gods the great beasts rushed forward to devour him tails pounding the ground and huge jaws gaping they roared like the trumpets of doom and haraldr reflexively felt for the pommel of the sword that he had been forced to leave back in the barracks the lions halted as if the gods themselves had turned them to stone reason tried to command haraldrs whirling senses not stone but metal the lions were incredible metal creatures just like the birds but this deduction did nothing to assuage fear what wizardry or more frighteningly what knowledge did this emperor possess the huge throne was covered with a purple satin canopy and encrusted with gemstones and iridescent white pearls the giant god who might have occupied this grandiose furnishing was not present instead a mechanical man sat to one side of the vast cushion his body was metal no he was swathed in a fulllength tunic of stiff purple brocade covered with mazelike courses of gems and precious spangles and flocking eagles of flickering gold thread he wore a jewelled helmetlike cap and no winter sky was as thick with stars as this cap was with gemstones they spilled from the crown in sparkling runnels that streamed down the mechanical mans eerily human cheeks the devices eyes were agates polished to a watery sheen kristr not agates these eyes moved they were wet with life this was a living man no not a man a god perhaps allconquering kristr himself the two eunuchs threw haraldr to the floor and prostrated themselves alongside him this ritual of obeisance was repeated three times then the eunuchs raised haraldr to his feet he looked for the throne and moaned with awe the entire gold edifice floated high overhead the purple canopy seemingly grazing the goldflecked dome kristr he could be no other looked down on him from his rightful position above all mortals his head craned back dully gaping haraldr tried to focus his entire will on reasons moribund whispers and for a moment he found a certain mental equilibrium metal dragons and lions and birds and fire that burns on water and now this the rest are the creations of men and so this must be as well he clung to that thought even as his terrified awe rushed him off as savagely as the currents of the dnieper on the dark river of ignorance and superstition no no reason struggled all the works of men but if this is the emperor does it matter that he is not immortal kristr he is a man made a god with the power of the gods an elderly eunuch in a goldhemmed robe approached slowly and deliberately age spots covered his bald head he looked directly at haraldr his steady gaze a startling contrast to the condescending evasion practised by the lesser officials the eunuchs pale grey eyes were sad weary and ancient as if he had seen the cares of a dozen lives he motioned haraldr to bring his head down your father the lord of the entire world emperor basileus and autocrator of the romans greets you his son the eunuch whispered next to haraldrs ear his norse was fluent his imperial majesty has taken a personal interest in the matter of the death of the manglavite haraldrs entire body quaked as if he were bewitched after ordering officers of the court to take depositions in the matter and advised of their findings he has instructed the logothete of the praetorium to release his files concerning the incident of the third of june fifth year of the indication year of the creation six thousand five hundred and thirtythree your father the emperor offers you probationary conditions subject to summary revocation you may remain past the winter but you are not to be readmitted to the palace nor will you or your men be offered service under the imperial standards until your files have been readmitted to the logothete of the praetorium the eunuch paused and furrowed the thin veined skin of his brow that will be in approximately eight months before the spring campaigns you may reenter the city during this period only under conditions of private employ approved by the logothete of the symponus reason quickly revived under the comforting aegis of relief i have been partially exonerated thought haraldr his newly unburdened mind more supple than it had been all day but for obvious reasons the emperor still questions the loyalty of myself and my men private employ could that be what this mysterious nicepkorus argyrus is about the aged eunuch tugged at haraldrs sleeve and brought him even closer that is his imperial majestys position of record the eunuchs pale eyes roamed for a moment and then his voice dropped to the barest audible level privately his imperial majesty asks that you be advised to leave the queen of cities and the roman empire for that matter altogether the old eunuch paused and looked up at haraldr immediately the eunuch released haraldrs silken sleeve and the two stout eunuchs spun him about and led him from the throne of the emperor basileus and autocrator of the romans out into the lesser light of day throw him out asked halldor no you dont have to worry that i did that ive been trying to get information from him for an hour he chatters like a rodent but not much gets said these griks just arent very forthcoming with foreigners he claims that his master this nicephorus argyrus knows quite a bit however he even says that youve seen the emperor and been granted what he calls a conditional amnesty he says that we are free to accept private employment and thats why hes here he says that nicephorus argyrus invites you to dine with him tonight and discuss his proposal haraldr looked at ulfr his relief at haraldrs return was as obvious as halldors was deceptively concealed then at halldor and nodded nicephorus argyrus did indeed know haraldr had left the presence of the emperor only several hours ago he had been detained for a while in several parchmentpiled offices full of fluttering eunuchs and pale clerks and scribes apparently nicephorus argyrus had somehow received word of the ruling and had dispatched his emissary almost immediately well lets hope the rest of his information is as good said halldor he grabbed haraldrs arm and led him and ulfr into what must once have been a supply room the wooden shelves were now barren and shut the door halldor lowered his voice cautiously when we were recruited by hakon he led us to believe that after a short training period those of us who qualified would be initiated into the emperors varangian guard according to marmotman that would have been impossible not only do members of the guard have to complete a period of service outside the great city but also to enter the guard they have to pay an entrance fee well i asked how much that might be and since i dont know how grik money works i opened up hakons chest and took out one of his gold coins and held it up marmotman just laughed then he reached in the chest and pulled hakons belt the one entirely covered with hundreds of gold coins and said about this much i said you mean for all five hundred he just laughed again and said no that all the gold in hakons belt was probably enough to pay the entrance fee for one man haraldr blinked incredulously there was enough money in hakons belt to purchase several counties in norway and this was what one man paid to serve the emperor according to marmotman continued halldor hakon never intended us to enter the guard his plan was to contract our services for the emperors campaigns pay us a few pieces of silver and keep the rest for himself and this on top of a substantial bonus for recruiting us in the first place if we had started to grumble about our wages he would have seen to it that we were sent on an expedition far into serkland or some such place from which few if any of us would return marmotman says that hes already done this with two smaller groups of recruits in previous years the emperor permits this asked haraldr id hardly pay a cheat to guard my back perhaps the emperor does not know offered ulfr perhaps thought haraldr and what else might be beyond the emperors knowledge and perhaps also beyond his control i could not tell whether the advice the emperor presented me with today was a threat or a warning and if it is a warning is it possible that the emperor and i share the same enemy could you discover what role mar hunrodarson plays in all this asked haraldr halldor shook his head i just mentioned the name mar hunrodarson to marmotman and i thought he was going to scurry out of the room you might have thought i had offered to conjure a demon my feeling said ulfr is that by grik standards hakon was just a sandkicker mar hunrodarson on the other hand is playing a game with the gods you may be right about that ulfr haraldr went on to describe the message he had received in the presence of the emperor if the griks love a ruse what ruse could be more fitting than for this mangod that i saw today to have a personal guard he cannot trust consider that the emperor had the power to swat me like a bug today and who would have protested or for that matter even have known instead he pardoned me for the slaying of a high imperial official yet in the next breath he made it quite clear that my life was in jeopardy here and who more than mar would want me dead but what you are saying is that the norseman is playing the ruse on the griks said ulfr no said haraldr what i mean is that there may be a hidden power that mar and his varangians really serve and that the imperial throne itself is a ruse or at least a sort of illusion the thought even as speculative as it was made haraldr shudder what power could be greater than the mangod emperor except the power of the gods themselves haraldr looked at ulfr and halldor its time i greeted our visitor and get one of hakons best robes ready for me tonight im meeting nicephorus argyrus maria placed her palms flat on alexandross powerful chest and waited until he had stilled she did not look at his face she raised herself slightly and his slick now flaccid penis fell out of her she swung her leg over his body and padded to the floor she walked naked into her antechamber her breast was still rouged with passion her hair tousled giorgios sat at the small ivorytopped table staring morosely at his long artistic fingers maria sat beside him and took his hand it was lifeless unable to respond to her caress i love you she whispered alexandros came in also naked his ample manhood flapping like a banner of his virility maria stood and flexed her back alexandros came round behind her and kissed her neck and raised her nipples with his fingers after a moment maria pulled loose we are going to have the most extraordinary evening she said we are going to nicephorus argyruss everyone in constantinople knew the name argyrus was a former provincial army commander who had become the most successful merchant in all byzantium some said he was even wealthier than the emperor although that was also said of several of the dhynatoi but argyrus was the only merchant who could persuade the august dhynatoi to dine at his town palace at least those dhynatoi who had been forced because of overenthusiastic land speculation or simple mismanagement of their estates to borrow money from argyrus the very integration of the classes and sexes at argyruss dinners was considered a scandal in itself the tales told of his entertainments were a catalogue of vices though most of the gossip was patently false or at best wildly exaggerated argyrus has brought us a famous eremite from cappadocia i am told they say he last left his cave when the bulgarslayer was a boy i dont believe that for a moment but he will bring us luck also argyrus is going to display for us the tauroscythian who murdered the manglavite i have been told that this is the last opportunity we will have to see him alexandros seemed very keen at the mention of this attraction even giorgios cocked his head with interest i am taking all my little ladiesinwaiting so that they can see him and the hetairarch has agreed to come and translate for me though i think argyrus also has a man alexandros did not seem pleased that the hetairarch would be along he had heard that maria had once kept company with him then when we leave argyruss i can send my ladies home with hetairarch alexandross scowl fled and we three can visit that inn in the venetian quarter alexandros and giorgios looked at each other with naked alarm the venetian quarter home to the considerable contingent of traders from venice was almost as notoriously lawless as the vast studion slum though it was a much smaller enclave the venetian sailors were considered virtual savages and the only women who ever entered their environs were the most usedup and diseaseravaged whores who could find employment nowhere else maria had several times expressed an almost morbid interest in a venetian quarter inn where these women were said to service their customers on the tabletops i dont think you would be safe there said giorgios his eyes mournful and frightened maria opened her knees slightly and stroked her fingers once along the tops of her inner thighs just beneath her vulva the gesture was as mechanical and distracted as an animal cleaning itself yet almost breathtakingly erotic she looked up at giorgios if you dont think you can protect me then dont go the black waters wrapped around the brilliant galaxy of constantinople at night haraldr knew the source of the many lights now behind him the flares along the great wall to each side sloping away from the spine of the city the stillbustling wharves and factories and just ahead viewed as if from the mast of a ship the lights of the imperial palace it was as if he stood at the very centre of this wondrous constellation and all around him the empress city glowed and winked with the splendour of her nocturnal life and tonight robed in silk and perfumed with myrrh haraldr felt part of her his fears only seemed to inflame his ardour for this new woman in his breast to encourage the strange feeling that no matter how perilous this seduction he did not want to stop it nicephorus argyrus has a palace larger than this on the asian shore of the bosporus indeed he does marmotman interjected into haraldrs reverie larger still is his palace near ancyra yes yes nicephorus argyrus owns a third of the bucellarion theme but he got out of his macedonian estates when basil the bulgarslayer died didnt think this new lot could hold the bulgars back no indeed he did not still he likes his town palace best he hates provincial life and this terrace is his favourite place this new lot apparently is not as powerful or competent as the old bulgarslayer thought haraldr despite the narcotic luxury of the evening he was endeavouring to note any snippet of information that might be useful haraldr looked around the terrace atop the fourth floor of nicephorus argyruss palace he could well imagine that a man with this treasure would long for no other place the rooftop eden had been planted with small flowering trees neatly clipped shrubs and beds of flowers shallow pools with spouting fountains were surrounded by mossy lawns delicate marble pavilions lit with softly glowing glasssheathed oil lamps were sprinkled among the gardens and marble pathways meandered from pavilion to pavilion well let us return to the main hall haraldr nordbrikt nicephorus argyrus prefers to conclude his business before he dines indeed he does they descended a spiralling marble staircase and emerged into a miniature palace hall much smaller than the emperors but even more splendid it was paved with pale green marble inlaid with whorls of pure gold and silver and lit by candelabra that looked like silver pine trees bearing scores of lightfilled glass cones the gathering crowd was equally ornamental men and women alike wore elaborate goldembroidered silk tunics with high collars and long goldlaced hems and sleeves on many of the younger women the fabric seemed little more than a coating of iridescent paint while virtually every guest was dressed as lavishly as a rus prince or princess none of them was accorded the respect shown a miserable beggar literally dressed in rags his white hair and beard were crudely cropped his wizened ghostly pale skin pocked with crusty sores and his stench was detectable from a dozen ells away yet the most corpulent jewelladen princes and their ladies crowded around the foulsmelling wretch kissing his gnarled hands or filthy chest and pressing gold coins to him even though the old beggar simply let the offerings clatter to the floor haraldr was clearly the secondary attraction nicephorus argyrus a short wellweathered man with a deeply recessed grey widows peak and a stout belly that swelled against his carnationandgold silk tunic periodically flicked his hand discreetly in haraldrs direction apparently briefly explaining to various guests the identity of the giant curiosity argyrus started towards haraldr good haraldr thought let me do what i came to do before my wits are seduced by this luxury but a eunuch whispered in argyruss ear and he stalked off to the entrance vestibule at the far end of the room the doors opened and a flock of shimmering eunuchs bustled into the hall followed by a group of very young very pretty women almost all of them had their hair coiled on both sides of their heads and the tightly wrapped tresses were traced with sprials of sparkling pearls and gems the resplendent young women tried to appear grave and dignified as they entered but they began to talk animatedly and even to giggle as they were greeted by the other guests and absorbed into the crowd then everyone turned expectantly towards the doors she is not real was haraldrs first thought of the woman who now entered the hall she is the product of the grik artist who can surpass nature her hair was ravenblack and the pearls set into the twin coils glittered like the lights of the city even viewed from across the room her cobaltblue eyes were luminous she wore a tunic of the sheerest alabaster silk veiled with gold floral patterns yet both her front and back were more modestly concealed by a long rectangular scarflike garment of gemstudded crimson brocade maria said marmotman worshipfully as if the name itself were a confession of love for some reason haraldr repeated the name softly to himself he remembered that maria had been the name of kristrs mother the queen of paradise she is her imperial majestys cousin volunteered marmotman the mistress of the robes marmotman wandered towards the vision drawing haraldr with him two young arrogantlooking men attired like officers of the scholae followed maria into the hall the longing in the soft brown eyes of the thinner of the two was obvious and it made haraldr wonder what his own face now betrayed another man entered after the two officers haraldr felt as if a sword had whirred through his legs at the knees leaving the severed halves stacked like segments of a column if he so much as leaned forward a thumbs width he would collapse the norseman who walked into the hall was a giant as tall as and even broader than haraldr and yet he bore his enormous strength casually and gracefully he had a sensitive slightly feminine mouth and a high intelligent forehead the silkfine hair that swept straight back to his jewelled collar seemed dusted with gold haraldr had expected mar hunrodarson merely to be a more detestable thug than hakon this man had the noble stature of a king how could he be mar and yet if he was not mar who was he who is that man asked haraldr urgently his blood icing at the frozen look on marmotmans dark little face the hetairarch he answered with a tremulous voice his name demanded haraldr irritated by his own rising panic the hetairarch repeated marmotman weakly he waved his arm like a drowning man apparently trying to draw the attention of his master nicephorus argyrus had already moved to greet the norseman with an effusion that he had shown towards none of the other guests he chattered nervously and flicked his hands about the hetairarch glanced over at haraldr but the look was idle uninterested maria turned to the hetairarch and in a familiar faintly erotic fashion touched the norsemans sleeve with her beautiful white hand haraldr could see the statuefirm contour of her arm through the gauzy sleeve of her tunic the two officers who had accompanied maria made no attempt to mask their glaring disapproval of this contact haraldr understood their ire for a moment he too was a jealous boy raging as he watched his secret love make love to another nicephorus argyrus flicked his hand towards marmotman and without a word the marmotman scurried away from haraldr and joined his master and the hetairarch the three men and maria studied him more than casually their discussion was fairly animated unarmed tongueless without his interpreter haraldr felt naked and chained had nicephorus argyrus been the ruse all along would mar if this was mar kill him here a mere entertainment for the empress citys decadent elite the three men and the woman walked towards haraldr bringing along the other guests the beauty of maria numbed his fear if this was his valkyrja then odin favoured him even in death maria moved like a dancer her hips swaying gently exposing a heartstopping curve as her flank swished against the sheer tunic her laughter was like music her delicate white fingers languorously stroking the air as she talked she was close enough that he could smell her an indescribable fragrance like a raindrenched exotic flower but with the merest hint of musk her bowshaped lips relaxed whimsically almost teasingly her eyebrows were thick almost goldtipped near her nose then thinned and darkened as they rose and fell in gullswing curves maria spoke to marmotman then looked up at haraldr her eyes seemed to have lights behind them she wonders translated marmotman if you know that we romans have a legend that a fairhaired race will destroy us haraldr was taken aback her delivery had been trifling yet the question was taunting ominous and melancholy all at once let odin reply he told himself an ancient voice whispered back yet among us haraldr said with an evenness that surprised him it is the darkplumed raven who heralds doom marmotman translated the gullwing eyebrows rose slightly and maria looked at haraldr with mixed surprise and amusement maria spoke again and marmotman turned to haraldr she wonders if you know this tauroscythian prince everyone is looking for again the sword went through haraldrs knees could they have tortured gleb how many knew his forehead seared even odin could not offer him a response the hetairarch saved haraldr with half a dozen sentences in mellifluous perfectly accented greek he ended his discourse with a wry smile but did not seem amused it was as if he were scolding the rest of the guests haraldr was certain that his heart could be heard thudding in the chastened silence that followed the hetairarchs discourse the byzantines began to whisper selfconsciously among themselves the hetairarch turned to haraldr i told them to stop badgering you with that fable he said in norse the accent was icelandic i told them that a single norseman could come sailing down the bosporus in a hollowedout log and half the people in the great city would proclaim him this mythical norse prince leading the force that will finally sack constantinople it is incredible they are surrounded on every side by very real enemies but they have decided that we fairhairs who have loyally served them for three score years are going to pull their walls down all because of one incident lost in the mists of time and a few prophecies when you get to know these people as i do you will realize that for all their knowledge they are sometimes like credulous children i suspect you might be worried about false accusations being directed against you or one of your men but dont be concerned no one has come up with even a single hair of this supposed norse prince and the authorities have closed the matter it was all rumours to begin with and now it is nothing but dinnerparty gossip haraldrs lingering guilt was overwhelmed by relief this man was hardly his enemy perhaps he was even a rival to mar hunrodarson thank you he said stiffly offering the hetairarch a polite nod i can see there is much i need to learn well speak again comrade said the hetairarch genially he raised his eyebrows conspiratorially haraldr could scarcely wait to tell ulfr and halldor that he had discovered an ally a norseman with considerable knowledge of the griks and their curious ways already he had been given priceless intelligence maria apparently had become bored by the exchange in the guttural barbaroi tongue and her lips grazed the ear of the stouter of the two officers of the scholae who attended her the fashion in which she smiled as she whispered was almost like a hand on haraldrs genitals it was as if his previous conversation with all its terror and relief had been blown from his mind by a gale of lust he was certain that maria and this blueeyed officer were lovers and with a curious sensation both sickening and thrilling he imagined her naked and writhing with passion nicephorus argyrus stepped forward and placed his hand on haraldrs arm he spoke to everyone and they laughed politely as he swept haraldr out of the circle of guests my master told them translated marmotman that they can examine the fairhaired agent of our destruction during supper but for now we must discuss the demise of the enemies of nicephorus argyrus marmotman and haraldr sat behind a large ivory table nicephorus argyrus stood in front of a wall covered with truly extraordinary mosaic it was a map of the world that haraldr had previously only vaguely assembled in his mind though the names were in greek he thought he could make some sense of the places the gilt eagle certainly marked the empress city there was the thin blue slit of the bosporus the oval of the rus sea rus estland sweden norway anglia even iceland but where were greenland and far to the west markland and vinland clearly these griks are not allknowing he surmised still it was daunting to see the vast expanses of blaland and serkland that they had mapped the extent of serkland which extended so far to the east that it seemed to wrap up half of the world orb was particularly astonishing nicephorus argyruss gold signet ring rapped against the mosaic at a point just below the boot shape of what appeared to be langobardland he barked a single word marmotman quickly translated pirates nicephorus argyrus ejaculated a few more words almost as if he were angry at haraldr saracens yes uh afrikka that is blaland uh maumets men heretics marmotman said fumbling haraldr nodded saracen pirates who sailed the waters off blaland he had heard tales of them since he was a boy they were said to be vicious tricky and their ships were as quick as narwhals but surely the griks with their firespitting dhromons feared no pirates nicephorus argyrus went into a long discourse that sounded like a recitation of dates names numbers none of it made much sense hes recounting the cargoes that have been lost to the saracens in just the last year he says that he alone had to sell three good estates in the bucellarion theme as well as his monastery near chrysopolis simply to cover his losses monastery asked haraldr marmotman looked at him incredulously a community of monks he rolled his eyes at haraldrs continued lack of comprehension blackfrocks he said as if to a slow child men who devote their lives to christ is there no end to the strangeness of these griks wondered haraldr so these blackfrocks are kristrs wizards and wealthy men can buy and sell them like trains of pecheneg slaves nicephorus argyrus rapped the mosaic map impatiently he offers you ten fast ships with tackle and provisions one solidus per man guaranteed and thirty per cent of any booty above twenty solidi of gold per man how much is a solidus asked haraldr coolly he was determined to deal hard as he had seen his brother olaf do so many times nicephorus argyrus unlocked a small cabinet set in to the wall next to the map he removed a bulging chamois sack thudded it onto the table removed a small embossed gold coin held up one finger and said solidus haraldr pondered twenty solidi was considerable gold though only a fraction of the entrance fee for the imperial guard but catch the pirates when they were laden with plunder that would be essential to vanquishing them anyway and yes they could well exceed such sums your ships asked haraldr describe their construction number of benches armaments and condition nicephorus argyrus rattled off specifications the ships were light galleys of the type that had initially greeted the rus fleet in the bosporus thirty benches about the size of a norse dragon they had heavy arrow launchers but of course haraldr must understand that only imperial vessels were permitted to carry liquid fire ten solidi per man guaranteed shot back haraldr fifty per cent of all booty period nicephorus argyrus frowned at marmotman and barked something in greek that was not translated but the general thrust was clear i thought you told me this boy was a bumpkin who would trade a dozen gold arm rings for an iron kettle then he turned his comments to haraldr he doesnt think you understand your position here translated marmotman with a slithering menace in his voice you have entered the city under his escort with the assurance to the authorities that you were in his employ and you have enemies here perhaps even in this house against whom only nicephorus argyrus can protect you his terms are fair still his generosity is legend he will offer you three solidi per man and forty per cent above fifteen solidi hes taking enough of a risk as it is what if these pirates add you to their plunder hes lost ten good ships haraldrs stomach churned at the bald reference to his enemies and in this house was the hetairarch in fact mar no norsemen did not smile at their mortal foes then it occurred to him that it was in the nature of the griks to hide the problem at hand behind an imaginary concern yes he told himself youve struck this nicephorus argyrus a good blow follow it up and my men are risking their lives said haraldr with a hard edge on his voice what good are your ten ships sitting in the harbour does nicephorus argyrus think that five hundred more varangians will come down the dnieper tomorrow if he doesnt like my terms let him find some camel drivers to sail his ships we norsemen know what our skills are worth nicephorus argyrus clapped his hands sharply the doors to the little room slid open immediately and in popped two stocky darkfaced men in steel jerkins they aimed the steel points of their spears at haraldr he leapt forward and grabbed a shaft with each hand and jerked the spears back so violently that the guards crashed against the wall he kneed one guard in the gut and left him doubled up on the floor then dropped the other with a mighty hand slap to his ear he picked up one of the spears and turned on nicephorus argyrus you have just raised our fee by ten solidi a man and twenty per cent growled haraldr the terrified marmotman meekly repeated the figures nicephorus argyruss eyes revealed more surprise than terror he had clearly seen death before after a moment the coalcoloured irises brightened and he grinned slyly before beginning his response he asks you to put away your weapon he says a man with your special skills is certainly worth the extra pay though it will probably cost him his profit and then some hes doing this as a service to the empire of course thought haraldr hes probably already extorted the entire cost of the expedition as well as a good profit from the other merchants who ship in those waters he says that now that our business is concluded he wants you to eat well youll need your strength out there nicephorus argyrus reached up and put his arm around haraldr and began walking him out of the room marmotman followed with a running translation yes the risks are great but i have every expectation of a successful venture after all you varangians grow up fighting on the sea why i might even gain some profit in the end why not of course youll be a rich man and when you return well talk about making you wealthier still and by that i dont mean chasing more saracens around italia there are still some superlative properties for the taking out there particularly thrace and thessalonica where the bulgars will never touch them theyre undervalued simply because the dhynatoi have this prejudice about setting foot west of the land wall of course if you really want to ruin the value of even an eastern estate send the son of a magister out there to manage it yes my friend im the one to talk to if land is your business its not enough to know what to buy its the when that makes the difference between profit and penury i always buy after a raid and sell when everyone says the frontier has never been quieter nicephorus argyruss guests dined on silver plates embossed with scenes of legendary heroes and sipped wine from carved agate goblets rimmed with silver and pearls it was an excruciating experience for haraldr he did not know which foods should be eaten with the hands such as the tiny berries and fish roe and other curious morsels that were served before the meal or which should be picked to bits with the curious little silver ladles and prongs each guest had been provided and even when haraldr cued himself by watching the other guests the effort in managing the delicate implements was maddening when not struggling with the dining protocol haraldr was surreptitiously studying maria her nose alone was a fascinating work of art it was narrow with an erotic slight flare of the nostrils and somewhat long very subtly curving inward along the bridge and then rising to a sharp chiselled tip she was a goddess to whom elisevett and serah were only handmaidens and yet she sat between her scholae companions as if she were their whore touching their hands and nuzzling their shoulders eventually maria caught haraldr staring at her impelled by a force that seemed to gather him up like a huge surf he did not turn from her blazing cobaltblue eyes she made no expression or gesture whatever and yet her unwavering gaze drew him within the icetinted fires haraldr felt the same sort of convulsive shudder that he had when hed touched serah yet this sensation penetrated to his soul the voice in his head spoke so clearly that he wondered if the others had heard thoroughly spooked he closed his eyes for an instant and a fantastic vision composed of images so fleeting that he could not discern them flashed before him he felt something strike his neck quite perceptibly and he could not breathe his eyes shot open and his hand jerked up to his neck and he was surprised to find nothing there maria was still looking at him her lips softened into the barest hint of satisfaction as if she acknowledged the vision to which her powers had drawn him the voice spoke again this time as softly as a womans silken touch the shouts broke the frighteningly irresistible connection disappointed and relieved haraldr turned towards the commotion at the entrance to the dining hall a giant figure in a black frock and high black hat a monk haraldr reminded himself lurched forward as if he would topple yet slapped his gangly curiously shaped arms at the distraught silkclad eunuchs who were trying to prop him up the blackfrock took several unsteady steps towards the table and then his shoulders wavering in an almost constant rotation leered over the guests like the other monks haraldr had seen this man had cropped his beard and hair apparently just recently his skin was as smooth as a womans but his features were huge distorted almost monstrous a nose like a great swollen eagles beak an upper lip as thin as an engraved line a thick almost purple lower lip and a grotesquely heavy bestial jaw his tangled dark eyebrows seemed to merge with his small dark irises and his eyes rolled about with a manic piercing fury after a moment haraldr realized that this baleful monstermonk was not freshly shaven he was a eunuch the monks strident voice rumbled over the table the slurring of the words only adding to the inherent menace in his discourse a swarthy sumptuously dressed man seated across the table from haraldr inclined his head towards the painted cheek of his lady and mumbled some commentary on the monks discourse haraldr strained for some recognizable words or names and was startled to hear joannes the same joannes whose name he had heard invoked so often the monk heard his name as well and his already angry features shadowed with rage his explosive response was entirely verbal but the resounding sentences seemed to assault the swarthy man physically the mans head snapped back and his dusky complexion ashened he rose his entire body trembling bowed to nicephorous argyrus and hurriedly led his obviously terrified wife from the room the monk went back to his wavering vigil someone tipped over a goblet of wine and a few guests tittered nervously maria tilted up her exquisite nose and dabbed her lips with a linen napkin she spoke very slowly to the monk using the name joannes quite clearly and there was no mistaking the timbre of annoyed sarcasm in her musical tones joannes replied precisely and gravely almost as if he had suddenly been released by the herons of the alebenches his tongue was a thick reptilian pad that slid over his lower teeth as he talked maria followed his words with a quick glaring retort when it seemed that the goddess and the monk would remain locked in this exchange of hard looks and words nicephorus argyrus rose said something to the guests and clapped his hands in a flash of brilliant hues and dazzling flesh several acrobats in colourful jackets and brief loincloths flipped over the table the guests laughed and clapped his audience lost joannes stalked from the room haraldr noticed with considerable curiosity that the monk moved much more steadily than he had when he entered had he only been feigning drunkenness and why and who was he kristrs chief wizard the acrobats bounded into the main hall and the guests rose and followed dancers and more acrobats on stilts gambolled about to the whirling rhythms of cymbals pipes and stringed instruments eunuchs brought fresh goblets of wine but many of the guests were already making their farewells to nicephorus argyrus marias entourage of pretty young women had returned to her side and the two officers of the scholae and the hetairarch were strapping on their swords maria turned and the stunning blue eyes glanced in haraldrs direction his heart hammered at the thought that she might be thinking of him as he was of her she reached out to the hetairarch again placing that infuriating familiar hand on his arm and spoke to him for a moment then she turned amid her train of lovely young ladies and vanished like an achingly beautiful dream the hetairarch walked straight for haraldr his step graceful the heavy jewelled sword and scabbard riding his brocaded hip the lady has a message for you the hetairarch said pleasantly with a touch of genial mantoman ribaldry haraldr thought his heart would thunder out of his chest the hetairarch slapped haraldrs shoulder and said follow me ill give it to you away from prying ears he led haraldr to a small clerks room with cases for files and a few parchments piled on a plain wooden table it was lit by a single ramshaped iron oil lamp the hetairarch turned and faced haraldr his features flickering in the light she says she hopes your fair hair will not bring about your own doom before she has a chance to see it again haraldr was confused was she warning him as well or just teasing and was this the extent of her message why this secrecy his skin began to crawl the hetairarch seemed to sense haraldrs unease well he said affably i wanted to give you advice as well he smiled and stepped closer his eyes were rimmed with a touch of black paint haraldrs instincts warred he desperately needed this alliance yet he was becoming acutely uncomfortable the hetairarch came half a step closer still smiling you dont know what the hetairarch does do you his inflection was curiously lilting he reached out and lightly touched the ends of haraldrs silky blond hair haraldr cringed rocked by revulsion kristr damn all a crooked pervert boy lover you still dont know who i am the hetairarch said still smiling but there was a strange metaledge to his lilting voice that made the hair at haraldrs neck rise no no it all happened at once the handsome slightly feminine features darkened as if a great storm cloud had passed over them and in an instant the hetairarch had the face of the beast nostrils flared murderously mouth blackened and snarling eyes veined and bulging with rage odins rage haraldr already felt cold steel at his throat the hetairarch slammed him against the table as if he were a puny child the voice roared and howled like the last dragon the hetairarch the demon spat in terrifying barking convulsions commands the imperial guard the syllables each a separate explosion of rage followed by a thundering gasp jolted haraldr like the blows of a broadaxe i am mar hun ro dar son the sword slid against haraldrs neck and he could immediately feel the tickling flow of blood he could do nothing it was as if a crate loaded with anvils had rolled upon his chest odin the beast fled from the face of mar hunrodarson haraldr now merely faced the most terrible intimidating human visage he had ever imagined the great force relaxed slightly but the sword stayed at his neck just so you know that the rage is no weapon against me mar said his voice still metallic and his teeth clenched with a lightningquick movement he thrust the bloodied sword back in his scabbard most of the deep crimson hue of the rage receded from his face he pulled haraldr up by his bloody collar haraldrs head spun and he sat meekly on the edge of the table he was the new boy at court who had taken a profound thrashing from the reigning tough and that was all he was no son of the gods no king from kings not even leader of five hundred varangians i hope this proves to you that i am not the one who wants you dead said mar his voice even if not genial it was i who made certain that no one meddled with the investigation into hakons death a fair ruling was all i sought and i helped to see that you got it mar confidently turned his back on haraldr hakon was a buffoon i had reason for encouraging his rise at court but he had become a liability even an affront to the imperial dignity and i was appalled when i learned that he was going to sacrifice five hundred good men in another of his foolish cheats if you hadnt killed him i would have mar turned and placed both hands firmly on haraldrs shoulders there was nothing remotely suggestive in the gesture yes your life is in danger here but not by my hand it would hardly be in my interest to kill you mar grinned tightly i have use for you mar threw back his head the grin spread over his entire darkly flickering countenance before he lowered his gaze and fixed his glacial eyes on haraldr again yes haraldr sigurdarson prince of norway i have use for you the building had been an old roman inn and it stood between crumbling centuriesold brick tenements the street in front had stone kerbs but the ancient pavestones were invisible beneath a thick layer of silt and rubbish a sailor in a ragged fustian tunic sat against the buildings soiled marble facade his head ducked between his knees a prostitute paced before him her face painted as garishly as a wooden puppet she seemed at least fifty years old the music of some kind of stringed instrument came from inside alexandros and giorgios had consumed enough courage at argyruss to cast aside boldly the filthy sheet that served as the inns front door maria followed there was but a single large table and no one was having sex on it half a dozen venetians howled as they gathered around a furiously attentive young man rapidly and deftly pounding a huge knife blade between his spread fingers less interested in the game were four or five prostitutes and another dozen sailors who milled beside the row of marble basins that had in better days dispensed food to the establishments patrons the current habitues scarcely acknowledged the new arrivals they discreetly gestured to one another while taking furtive glances one man plucked tentatively at a lute maria watched a sailor slip his hand inside the coarse linen tunic of one of the whores and knead a sagging breast i am so disappointed maria said perhaps we have come on one of their saints days we have seen enough said giorgios slurring slightly at that moment the sheet over the door swept aside and at least two dozen people and assorted creatures burst through the arched doorway so convulsively it seemed that the little inn had somehow ingested them in a single gulp sailors in coarse tunics more affluent traders in relatively cheap exportgrade silks some young not unattractive prostitutes several musicians with lutes and pipes yapping dogs screaming monkeys and a small spotted panther on a leash the music shrilled in frantic circular rhythms and almost immediately a woman whirled on the table after a very short performance one of the silkclad venetians wrestled her to the floor and began removing her robe marias eyes ignited several of the newly arrived traders noticed her shouted curiously among themselves for a moment then gestured for her to dance alexandros took her arm and urged her towards the door but she pulled away she unwrapped the long scarflike jewelled pallium that covered her sheer tunic at both front and back and threw it at giorgios she leapt onto the table the venetians backed away slightly thunderstruck by this vision faintly cloaked in almost transparent white silk maria began to dance slowly with the sinuous control of a professional the tunic restricted the movement of her legs so she pulled it high on her hips and knotted it as she spun more rapidly the truncated garment hiked up farther and her black pubic triangle teased her audience two traders began to close in on the table alexandros swept his cloak aside and slowly drew his short sword a hand reached out and maria kicked at it a dozen hands grasped for her alexandros and giorgios savagely hacked the venetians with their swords somehow maria kicked herself free and leapt from the table onto giorgios back they were able to retreat behind alexandross whirring blade but only because marias gemstudded pallium had been dropped in the melee and most of the venetians considered it an equally valuable and far less fiercely contested prize three of them lay bleeding on the floor while the rest ripped the garment to shreds and scrambled after the loose baubles alexandros and giorgios with maria still on his back raced uphill in the direction of the stillglimmering spine of the city after half a dozen blocks they stopped and ascertained that no one was following giorgios wrapped maria in his cloak her tunic was in tatters her face betrayed nothing but her eyes were startling their hue visible even in the dark there is a lovely park just a little farther up the hill she said it was as if nothing at all had happened back at the inn the park was a small nicely maintained refuge in the midst of a cluster of uppermiddleclass town houses a ring of cypresses shielded a little pool and an adjacent marble pavilion maria spread giorgios cloak on the neatly mowed lawn alex she said go to the corner and watch for the cursores the cursores were the citys nocturnally vigilant police force alex looked quizzically between his friend and his lover then shrugged and walked away maria feverishly removed giorgios clothing for a moment she reverently caressed his painfully erect shaft when he penetrated her she gasped as if stabbed and her fingernails brought blood from his back they rolled ferociously in the grass and her moment came quickly she screamed a short sharp note then clung desperately to giorgios holy mother how i love you she gasped she fell silent and licked his neck and wondered to herself i do love giorgios but why did i just feel the tauroscythian deep inside me like a knife in my womb ii they are the offal of the empire the horseman observed to himself the effluence of the stinking sewers in which they spend their days hiding from the sun and the police armenian peasants selucid mongrels mutilated criminals all of the outcasts who have come to the empress city to exist as human cockroaches twolegged insects who scurry from the dark alleys at night to cut purses and throats the horseman counted five of these nocturnal predators they had set a barrier of refuse across the narrow unlit side street a trap for any citizen foolish enough to stray near the putrescent arteries of one of constantinoples largest slums but the horseman who was in his own way a denizen of the night and the less decorous recesses of the city had seen them even before they discerned his giant silhouette against the distant backlighting of the magnana arsenal he made no attempt to alter his course hooves clamoured on ancient paving stones then quieted as they slowed on the silt and trash that had begun to bury this forgotten reeking little lane the five waited listening for the hoofbeats of an escort and satisfied themselves that their victim was alone but when they distinguished the blackfrocked figure and the huge head they postponed their assault wondering if this was the man who rode in the night they whispered their confusion and the horseman who had learned to make out murmured confidences across a room full of tittering dignitaries smiled and listened its the demonmonk ill swear to it on the hair of a saints ballpouch no well see demons nough when were called to hell wont be christ the king nor devils disciples youll have to fear if he catches you first hes an unholy black whirlwind set down by a conjurer then hes somewhere across this cursed city a wink later listen to that while you still got ears brother lets beat out of here and lay ourselves upon some sotted whore so to thank the demons who saved our balls from joannes before the five could vanish into the shadows the horseman had charged into their midst the cutthroats looked up in terrified rapture then shrank from the monstrous leering head as if it were a lighted torch thrust into their faces mark me well the horseman thought as the five stumbled into the dark crevices between the towering hovels spread the word like poison into your fetid warrens let every miserable damned soul in these pestilent warehouses of human refuse know who i am i am more than power that alltoorecognizable face of uniformed authority that clubs you into your stinking lairs by day and gives you short leash by night i am something more formidable that ultimate alloy of power welded to the implacable resolution to wield it without hesitation or pity i am fear the horseman whose name was indeed joannes now returned to his intended route he spurred his horse up the good stone road to a hill crowned with a large plainfronted town house he circled round the back of the building then turned off the street into a colonnaded arcade screened with vines a boy in a short silk tunic recognized him and slid open a gate that led into a large interior court as he gave up the reins to another stable boy joannes looked at the outlines of the elaborate topiaries in the court a boar an incredible crouching lion he traversed the long interior arcade to the large brass double doors where he was greeted by two armoured stubblefaced alemmanians taller even than the blackfrock himself and quickly ushered inside orphanotrophus said his host using joanness official title in the imperial administration of the roman empire the candelabra were not lit and the single row of candles in sconces on the walls cast a wavering hallucinatory light over the mosaics above them here and there golden tesserae glimmered like little stars logothete of the dromus answered joannes this was the official title of the man responsible for all intelligence gathering both foreign and domestic in the roman empire joannes pointedly ignored the logothetes honorary rank of magister the highest for any administrative officer in the roman government though such an address would not be neglected by any other courtier who hoped to keep his manhood the holloweyed glowering monk had no use for the complex apparatus of court ceremony just as he gave little thought to his own meaningless title orphanotrophus or guardian of orphans head of the empires vast network of charity hospitals and orphanages and now incidentally sole authority over hundreds of thousands of solidi in charitable donations usually extorted by various threats for which he was accountable to no one and which rarely redressed any of the empires social ills titles might have currency to the posturing milksops at court but tonight a simple monk had the real business of the empire to conduct joannes knew his way and silently followed the muteeyed servant to the corner of the room the servant a pale blondhaired thracian in an oversize silk tunic pressed against the wall with a slight exhalation the smooth marble panel swung aside joannes and the logothete entered a small cool chamber the servant followed with a single brass lantern in the shape of a ram the servant bent over and pulled a thin stone slab from the floor a chill gust swept into the chamber and the logothete shielded the lantern the servant descended into the dark hole after feeling his way down the familiar wooden steps joannes let the servant guide his legs into the small boat he swung to the side and sat the lantern to his acute eyesight lit the entire cistern as the servant paddled the boat through the inky subterranean lake joannes counted the rows of algaestriped columns and studied the patterns of the bricks in the rounded vaults overhead numbers and order were the two fundamentals for which his mind instinctively quested when they had passed beneath twenty vaults they reached the far end and climbed to a small wooden dock they ascended a short flight of stone stairs that led to a stained oaken door the servant unlocked the door the room they entered smelled of incense good wine and a womans perfume i have something special tonight said the logothete as he and his guest lowered themselves to tasselled brocade couches the logothete had dark piercing asiatic eyes that sparked ferally as the servant began lighting the sconced oillamps like joannes he had been born to a lowlevel bureaucrat and had suffered a family disgrace his father had been paymaster to a provincial regiment and had been cashiered for skimming funds while joanness father had been a minor legal clerk in the black sea port of amastris and had been caught forging deeds of sale this was the bond between joannes and the logothete worth more than any momentary political allegiances or utterly fictional declarations of loyalty youll find this quite remarkable said the logothete his servant poured wine from a glazed clay jug into silver goblets a sicilian vintage it will be past its time in two or three weeks so drink copiously the logothete smiled joannes would drink liberally whether or not the wine was good and certainly regardless of any invitation the logothete waited until joannes had downed a full goblet and half of a second he knew from long experience that joannes never exceeded his considerable capacity but often drank enough to convince others that he had gone beyond his limits the information comes from my usual correspondents at the court of yaroslav as well as interviews with rus traders who have journeyed from what are commonly referred to as the islands of thule though we are certain that thule is actually a collection of separate nations some of them islands some of them large peninsulas linked by a common language my offices have also had conversations with frankish traders and diplomats who know and deal with these northern barbaroi whom they call with their characteristic simplicity of expression northmen the logothete paused to sip then placed his goblet on a small ivorysurfaced cabinet the facts are thus the level of military organization among the northern barbaroi is much higher than the strategus of kherson our putative expert in these matters has led us to believe land battles involving tens of thousands of men have been reported and fleets of hundreds of fast craft manned by heavily armed marines regularly launch lightning attacks on their neighbours because these northern nations are not dominated by a single great power there is considerable political flux among them and the northern barbaroi kings regularly depose one another bands of warriors often considerable in number disenfranchised by these conflicts are almost always available for hire or simply for the promise of booty to the next usurper joannes thought for a moment before speaking in his sepulchral baritone so the military resources for an invasion by the northern barbaroi certainly exist this is one of those rare instances in which popular hysteria has a basis in fact it is quite coincidental of course if a blind man spends enough time grovelling in the street eventually he might chance across a gold coin someone has dropped joannes signalled the servant to fill his cup settled back and looked steadily upwards as if he had just located some hovering phantom he wished to address of course the military capability of these northern barbaroi is in itself hardly alarming merely another name added to the litany of antagonists who ceaselessly harass our borders but alone among our multitudinous adversaries the northern barbaroi have the seafaring abilities to threaten the queen of cities herself if they did mount such a naval belligerency and had the good fortune to find their assault coincident with let us say an incursion by the bulgars across the danube estuaries then we would find the northern barbaroi a serious menace joannes snapped his gaze back to the logothete however you mention this political flux in the northern nations as long as thieves quarrel among themselves the gatekeeper has little to worry about without strong leadership any northern barbaroi incursions would be little more than illfated acts of piracy even with half the imperial navy dispatched elsewhere you discount the notion that a barbaroi prince arrived incognito with the last rus trade flotilla you found nothing it smacked of the usual dhynatoi rumourmongering i am not entirely satisfied with what i found the rumour may have started among the rus continue to work on it then as much as i would like to build the rus trade if this prince is produced i would have no choice but to make cause with the dhynatoi in urging the extermination of all the northern barbaroi who arrived with that fleet would that be enough suppose one of these barbaroi thieves to follow your metaphor was already the gatekeeper joanness dark oily eyebrows descended towards his stormy irises and for an awful moment the logothete wondered how he could have so miscalculated his allys loyalties but joannes then nodded appreciatively at the extrapolation of his metaphor the hetairarch the northern barbaros mar hunrodarson opened the gates to the imperial palace each morning and the hetairarch was perhaps a servant who had begun to imagine himself a master develop your theory rumbled joannes the hetairarch mar hunrodarson has long openly petitioned for greatly increased recruiting of varangian mercenaries lately he has focused on my office almost daily providing me with intelligence some legitimate some highly exaggerated regarding suspected civil uprisings in the city and suggesting that a new lesser varangian guard be created and posted in the city though outside the palace for riot control interesting isnt it the champions of the common folk petitioning to become their oppressors joannes nodded and gulped another draught of wine mar hunrodarson is clearly an exceptional barbaros he has learned to thrust and cut with roman paper almost as well as he can with frankish steel joannes drank again and reflected silently if things were going well in the imperial palace this would be the time to eliminate the barbaros upstart hunrodarson but things were not going well at all and the wily hetairarch would have his role in the drama that surely would be enacted over the next few years yes said the logothete his eyes keen and fiery as he responded to his guests twitching brow the hetairarch mar hunrodarson is extraordinarily patient for a man capable of such illtempered eruptions i believe he will wait strengthen his hand with the increasing insinuation of his fellow barbaroi in the military affairs of the roman empire and when the time comes here the logothete trod warily knowing the relationship between the emperor and joannes position himself to broker the succession with a sufficient force of varangians in or even near the city it would be possible then we must either make mar hunrodarson our broker or find someone who will break his sword when that time comes said joannes as much to himself as to his host he covered his deeply set eyes with his long misshapen fingers pressed in then moved the spatulate fingertips to cradle his chin perhaps we can do both the logothete showed decayrimmed ragged teeth most officials of the imperial administration exerted their power like porters hefting heavy crates joannes was a juggler capable of keeping several contradictory goals in the air at once i suppose you have this janus already in mind the information you wanted from italia now joannes raised his thin upper lip in what appeared to be a snarl though the logothete knew it as a rare expression of genuine if sinister mirth yes i believe this man haraldr nordbrikt i presume that is the correct pronunciation of yet another ludicrous barbaroi name that this haraldr nordbrikt and mar hunrodarson have a relationship that is rather one would say pregnant as you know when the grand domestic wanted this haraldr nordbrikt and his men butchered in neorion hunrodarson interceded and provided information that justified the murder of the manglavite yet consider their only meeting said the logothete contributing the presumed antithesis my man in the house told me that they closeted argued and perhaps struggled and hunrodarson made no attempt to get haraldr nordbrikt a posting anywhere near the city it was he who insisted that the imperial pardon banish nordbrikt and his men for a period of months a deception perhaps hunrodarson wishes to allay any suspicion of his barbaros accomplice or he thinks that haraldr nordbrikt will fail in his mission for the merchant argyrus leaving a powerful force of varangians looking for a more effective leader better than martyring their hero is it not a possibility that certainly would have occurred to me were i standing in hunrodarsons boots well right now all we have are possibilities but possibilities that we can quite likely turn to our advantage what word do you have of haraldr nordbrikt the last landfall was brindisi almost two months ago they had been at sea for several months without sighting the saracen fleet they provisioned very quickly and there was a detail you might find interesting unlike most barbaroi wine bags who prefer to drink barrels of that piss they call ale nordbrikt loaded his ships almost until the rails were awash with barrels of plain spring water i would suspect he was heading south towards libya and intended to remain at sea for some time he may be a resourceful man joannes grunted monkeys in the hippodrome could also perform tricks still something about this haraldr nordbrikt interested him he had possibilities but better still he was entirely expendable there was absolutely nothing to lose in using him and possibly the roman empire to be gained joannes gulped a full cup belched deeply rose and motioned the servant to let him out without even gesturing to the logothete at the door however he turned if this haraldr nordbrikt makes a return landfall see that i know at once giorgios her voice was visible in fine silver bubbles and she knew that it was not giorgios who was there the sea around her was a vast azure platter with a pure gilded rim she was cold and he was like the sun his hair a golden halo high above her mar again the silver bubbles he was not mar the other one the silk the wicked scar he was like a sun but the sun was gone and the sea fiery as opal lit them from below the ships flew over the dimming horizon and the blue glow from the sea candled the faces hundreds of them hollow and ghostly their dead teeth chattering obscenities but the fairhaired sun made them shrivel and they floated away like dry leaves in the soft breeze the fairhair climbed aboard and he was gone and her heart tore with a pain so real then he stood before her again and in the wooden chest he held the sun with his hands he scattered light and she could feel the hot incandescence when his arms took her up he tells you to behold the pillars of heracles haraldr nordbrikt the ends of the earth marmotman haraldr and the byzantine pilot stood in the prow of nicephorus argyruss galley the deck pitched in a south wind with the same harsh steamy rasp as a harlots love cries marmotman had been forced to join this mortifying piratehunting expedition as interpreter for the pilot who otherwise could not have warned these reckless barbaroi that they were rapidly approaching uncharted waters there is a sea beyond these pillars said haraldr he pointed to the west a molten sun hovered above a watery horizon the colour of steel haraldr shielded his eyes to discern the slight shift of hue that marked a spit of headland jutting into the sea a sea indeed but it would not be wise to venture into it for any great distance haraldr nordbrikt it is the moat that separates the world of men from the walls that thrust up the vault of the firmament with his hands marmotman drew the shape of a box so that living men cannot attain these walls and climb into paradise lord god has furnished this sea with every imaginable ferocious creature of enormous size and some so frightening to behold that their gaze alone will shatter a ship to timbers haraldr continued to study the sunhammered horizon as a boy i spoke with a man who sailed this great western sea with bjarni herjolfsson they ventured as far as vinland and saw no walls another man sailed with leif the lucky and went ashore on vinland there was no paradise only miserable skraelings savages haraldr rotated his palms to sculpt a sphere in the air the worldorb has no walls marmotman sighed well haraldr nordbrikt that is also the opinion of certain overly learned heretics at court who read the words of ancient greek pagans marmotman rose on his toes to approach haraldrs ear more closely haraldr nordbrikt believe me you do not want these heretics as your friend or their enemies as yours hissed marmotman haraldr nordbrikt say no more of this earth shaped like a persian melon haraldr looked away weary of marmotmans pointless often conflicting confidences almost four months at sea and marmotman had furnished nothing more than incidental glimpses of the vast structure of grik no roman he reminded himself power it was as if even at the limits of the roman world marmotman were reminded of a sword over his neck the ravens took wing in haraldrs gut as he remembered the blade that threatened his own head each day for the last four months he had ached with the shame that he could not reveal to halldor ulfr and the rest of his pledgemen all that had transpired in his meeting with mar hunrodarson yet how could he admit to his physical fear of mar and far worse tell them that mar held knowledge that could prevent all of them from ever seeing their homes again what fate was mar even at this moment divining haraldr had heard nothing from the terrifying hetairarch during the week they had remained in st mamas quarter preparing to sail but now alone at night on this distant sea it was as if mars mighty grip was an evertightening noose about his neck lately he would awaken hardly able to breathe and what of these other enemies mar had alluded to perhaps even more deadly than the ragefilled hetairarch yet when haraldr thought of sailing right through the pillars of heracles to the sanctuary of the cold green sea that norsemen alone commanded he was pulled irresistibly back the empress city he wanted her embrace her scent her heat her maria with some strange clarity undiminished by time and distance he could still see the brilliance of her lips and eyes hear her speak watch her hips sway in his endless rocking fantasies each night upon these fevered southern seas maria and the city had become the same imaginary lover and when he finally held maria against his breast loving her so deeply and limitlessly that he would melt within her he would know then that the empress city had trothed herself in return they had already loved a hundred nights in as many different places within the empress city the night before on a marbled terrace lying upon silk naked to the whispering breeze her swanwhite skin iridescent like the lights of halogoland writhing against an arctic horizon he had been away from her both of her so long haraldr struggled against the torpid seduction it was this unearthly heat the heat attacked reason the heat was death and death waited out on this flaming sapphire brine he could consider what awaited him in the empress city when or if he returned to her count no day until the sun has set he reminded himself as he squinted into the boiling copper disc looming over the western horizon this day was far from ended he called for ulfr and halldor to join him forward we come in with the sun at our backs ulfr nodded ja my friend if the men dont fight these saracens soon i think theyll begin to set their sword upon the wind theyve given you a name now hardraada hardruler if they are still fullstrong enough to praise me with such curses then i have served them well at least about this haraldr could be pleased at their last landfall now almost two months ago along the coast of langobardland haraldr had provisioned his ships with water rather than the local wine to which the men had greatly taken the men had complained bitterly then and the hardmouthing had continued for the next month while they had searched for the saracen pirate fleet at open sea then they had sighted the saracen masts rising against the bleached horizon like a seagoing forest and for another month had dogged the huge saracen fleet along the endless coast of blaland the vast landmass sometimes called afrikka haraldr had enforced strict water rationing among his own men while staying at sea to block the saracens from turning into the afrikkan ports yes his men were as testy as penned stallions scenting a mare in heat but consider what entreaties the crews aboard the saracen ships now would be issuing to their devilgod maumet if indeed they had the spit to speak haraldr studied the saracen mastforest sails unfurled on the eastern horizon like enormous white leaves he squinted to discern the formation of the bobbing dark hulls wondering if he had found his answer he could not be sure odin he prayed as much to himself as to the god i lay it all in your hands then he turned to ulfr and halldor and sucked in a parching breath there will be no battle cry he said were going in by ourselves just this ship i alone will board halldors blackened sunsplit lips slackened in shock ulfrs jaw dropped yes i have invited the ravens to join me haraldr looked hard at ulfr and halldor but the men are nearly mutinous in this hot blue sea they have long ago forgotten that day beside the white waters of the dnieper yet if my strategy has been successful i will have both saved a good half of my force and given them as their leader a true favourite of odin when we return to constantinople they will cleave to me as if i were their emperor and when we return to the city surely i will need nothing less than fanatics to guard my back ulfr conveyed the order down the line of ten fully rigged galleys soon haraldr could see arms swords and spears gesturing with confusion atop the decks he ordered his own crew to furl sails and take their places at the oars as his ship moved swiftly out of line the crews left behind stilled and hushed soon the only sounds on all nine ships were creaking tackle and flapping canvas the splash of waves on hulls and the invisible abrasion of the wind a man was about to show them that he was a god haraldr caught the spray at the foredeck as the fast galley charged the droplets stung his suntormented face like flung sand here the sun rises so high that it does not offer a shadow for much of the day he thought vaguely considering what mechanism of kristrs doing had created this phenomenon so different from the long shadows of the northern lands he focused on the mast forest trying to discern if he would win this wager or lose everything it was confusing so many masts three to a ship so many sails all crowded together then the formation began to make sense and he whispered his thanks to odin it was as he had expected the saracen vessels were clustered in groups of from three to a dozen and they bobbed and yawed curiously the hulls often bumped together you are indeed as clever as odin said ulfr as he and halldor came forward and observed the curious progress of the saracen fleet i hope you are as lucky halldor waved his arm as if anointing the careening lines of saracen ships his byrnnie glistened with sweat and his teeth were as white as bleached bone against his cooked face a ghost fleet he said intended to function like an army of false campfires as their men perished of thirst they abandoned ship after ship towing the dead vessels along in files to deceive us that their strength was intact that must be their flagship said ulfr pointing to a deephulled vessel with a kind of house on the stern three separate masts and perhaps a dozen empty oar ports to a side it leads the line despite the growing chaos within the ranks of the ghost fleet most of the ships had been rigged to run with the wind and the flagship cruised smartly ahead of the long swelltossed files haraldr observed the lead ship carefully odin enjoyed tricks he squinted for resolution and as they approached the flagship his hopes plunged in sickening concert with the pitching deck he had indeed offered the oneeyed god a premature thanksgiving a full crew manned the top frame of the saracen flagship as well as the half dozen ships to her stern steel jerkins glinted over white robes and flashing spearheads and curved silvery steel swords pointed to attention in immaculate rows we change the orders asked halldor no said haraldr raptly as if he suffered from some narcosis of fear odin has led me here if odin intends to offer me to the ravens this day not ten thousand men could save me is it the heat he wondered as he distantly contemplated his deadly folly or was fate so thick around him that it had charged the air with the heat of its vast cauldron boarding ropes shouted ulfr the galley swung parallel to the hull of the flagship and prepared to drift into position for a fast boarding ulfr and halldor worked frantically with the boarding ropes too mesmerized with haraldrs goddriven fury to try to stop him but why was he laughing the heat the heat and the fear had driven him mad the line between madness that saved a man and that which doomed him was finer than the finest silk filament odin had finally forsaken their hero and they would joyfully share his fate look shouted haraldr he was still laughing my foes will have to dismiss their unbidden supper guests before they can fight halldor and ulfr raised their heads at first bewildered by haraldrs babble then incredulous at what they saw at the railing of the saracen ship ulfr coughed revulsion gagging his throat dozens of seagulls had descended upon the saracen warriors they perched on unmoving shoulders and pecked the eyes from unprotesting heads the ghost fleet had also been provided a ghost crew haraldr leapt to the deck of the saracen ship the stench was appalling he had never imagined such decay but then he had never known such a sun the saracens had their backs strapped straight against their spears and were lashed to the railing as he walked the deck slimy with the foul droppings of the carrion birds haraldr felt the spirits of the dead hovering about their unburied corpses their sighing plaints were a hot miasma in his nostrils he looked straight ahead as he went aft but he could not ignore the awful cooing and clucking of the birds an obscene satiation worse even than the cawing of hungry ravens he saw the door to the cabin at the stern of the ship he now only wished to escape the sun and the spirits that were sucking away the air around him he wondered at the strange partially peeling blue script that bordered the roseenamelled wood the door rattled as the ship pitched then suddenly swung open the scimitar raked emma with a dry screech the sound was far more alarming than the impact haraldr lashed out with his shield and felt as if he had crushed a birds chest he stepped back and with his sword probed the blueblack pall inside a spear jutted past him and he snapped it like a twig he placed his shield beneath his chin and tried to adjust his eyes to the darkness then he saw the nimbus of light around the curtains and ripped the fabric away with his sword the saracen sat at a large table of carved wood inlaid with rosettes of pearl and ivory he was coalbearded still almost as juicily plump as a fat partridge a clean white cloth covered his head beside him stood a single wraithlike guard in a filthy stained smock a curving dagger swaying in his withered grip the saracen pushed the guard back and immediately opened a black lacquered box set before him on the table the light from the portals glossed a small flat gold ingot then another then another until the saracen had placed twenty ingots on the table haraldr extended his sword and pricked the mans windpipe he held up his other hand and flashed his fingers to signal five four times then he shook his head no and began to flash five again and again and again until it seemed he had done it a hundred times when he was finished he cut a small nick on the saracens wellfleshed throat the saracen shrugged turned up sausagethick fingers almost immobilized with gemencrusted rings and waved haraldr to a latticed hatch at middeck he opened it and climbed into the hold at the point of haraldrs sword light from the oarports sliced the hold with hot white blades that flickered as the ship gently rocked the saracen very slowly pulled aside a dingy canvas revealing seven large wooden chests bound with bright brass fittings the saracen hiked up his billowing cotton robe shrugged at haraldr and assumed a ridiculous posture as he probed his bowels he winced as he withdrew the key the saracen unlocked all the chests before opening any of them when he began to lift the lids he went about it so quickly and dramatically that haraldr expected a ruse saracen warriors springing from their last hiding place but it was not iceofbattle that glimmered in the thrusting light it was roman gold enough shimmering solidi and golden ingots to buy all of europe for a moment haraldr saw olafs last moments at stiklestad heard the dying words from jarl rognvalds skyblue lips and saw the icewhite swords of retribution bloody the northern horizon and then in a blinding epiphany all he could see was the empress city luminous in her aureate mantle receiving him into her scented arms maria asked her guard to have the carriage stopped brakes whined and the enclosed compartment pitched and canted slightly back she slid across the cushioned satin upholstery and nudged aside the shellpink brocade shade she could see over the queuedup crowd at the news bulletins posted by the great bronze gate to the imperial palace complex what is it maria asked anna dalassena daughter of the grand domestic in her chiming voice look remember the tauroscythian we saw last summer where was it the nervous one with the clumsy hands and the agile tongue no demurred anna with a leisurely folding of her thick dark lashes she indeed remembered the towering barbaros hadnt she in fact lain in her silk sheets later that night her head whirling from wine and for a dreadfully fascinating instant imagined those huge arms enfolding her but as the flower of annas maindenhood had yet to be pruned she was obliged to coyness maria on the other hand in the months that anna had waited on her had alluded to the most delectable most extraordinary intimacies between men and women anna suppressed a giggle maria had no chastity to protect how exquisite that would be oh said maria the elegant line of her lips scrolling with amusement i had rather a fantasy of the tauroscythian that night as i recall i saw to it that he was rough with his hands anna blushed profoundly please lady tell me what this man has done for his name to be posted by the chalke gate they havent cut off his hands i beseech the holy mother maria smiled thinking that it was time that bright spirited little anna learn a womans pleasures she needed to think of someone suitable someone gentle yet vigorous perhaps isaac would know annas face pressed next to marias and the braided loops at the sides of their heads touched holy mother the bulletin was framed and set in the usual marble niche maria read the florid script with mock gravity varangian champions defend christendom at edge of the world restore roman riches to furtherance of glory of christ the king varangian nordbrikt his arm strengthened by the mother of god singlehandedly vanquished the infidel they say hes now rich enough to buy nicephorus argyruss palace blurted anna anna said maria musically you suddenly recall the man anna smirked yes then her face dropped my father isnt happy about this tauroscythians success i heard him she sighed trying to imitate the mysterious note of melancholy that so often crept into marias discourse i dont suppose well ever have him to a banquet in our chambers no answered maria she pulled the shade back and motioned the carriage on i fear the tauroscythians enemies have multiplied as rapidly as his riches maria settled back against the cushions and closed her eyes as the carriage rumbled up the mese the citys main artery extraordinary the dream had been months ago and how vivid it had been perhaps more than a dream perhaps a vision like those of the prophet daniel the fairhair the fleet of ships manned by spectres a chest of gold as brilliant as the sun but there were other dreams no she could not recall them would not fairhair haloed by horrible black flocking creatures frozen waters dark as onyx awakening with fear on her tongue had she some gift of prophecy there were many in the city who claimed it but as with virtue that gift was much more often claimed than possessed maria opened her eyes and clutched her hands tightly together yes the fairhaired barbaros was a harbinger of death but she had not seen if the death that haloed his golden head was his own or that of another maria started it was as if an icy finger had suddenly brushed her cheek she whipped her head expecting annas cheerful confession of the prank but anna had slid across the seat to peer intently through her own window maria touched her faintly rouged cheek as if daubing a wound and shuddered that she found nothing but her own silken warmth tonight in the hagia sophia she would pray to the mother of god that the fairhair not visit her dreams again and pray for his soul because in her silent heart she would pray that it was his own death she had foreseen who is he asked thorvald ostenson centurion of the grand hetairia fourth in command of the emperors varangian guard the leather fittings of ostensons new gold breastplate creaked as he came round the chair on which the man sat hunched over his back trembling in soft heaves like the belly of a small wounded animal this pitiful head upon whom the ravens have chosen to defecate belongs to john choniates a petty tax officer from the anatolian theme mar hunrodarson folded his arms atop his writing table and studied the wretch who sat before him the mans eyes were pools of vitreous red surrounded by enormous purple bruises and his chin was as raw as fresh meat where his beard had been plucked his short stiff fingers were swollen and caked with blood so why are they feeding these little mice to varangian lions asked ostenson dont the ballless paperstuffers know that we are already overburdened with felons above the rank of patrician and our strength is short as it is besides a varangian takes little pride in playing a broken reed like this the men are malingering when theyre asked to perform these inconsequential interrogations mar looked up at ostenson he had just promoted the lanky strawheaded farm boy from iceland to centurion mar had learned his lesson with hakon when he had seen to it that hakon was elevated to the honour of manglavite he had thought that it was more important to find a man who was suitably vicious something mar knew couldnt be taught than to look for intelligence in his key subordinates mar had reasoned that he had enough wits for all five hundred members of the grand hetairia and then some well mar also had the wits to know when he had been wrong ostenson was part of mars new strategy to surround himself with men who did not run out of words after axe ale and cunt this new centurion had the keenness to understand the intricacies of roman power if he were taught well and it was clearly time for the education of thorvald ostenson to begin ordinarily i would have flatly refused the use of my offices to execute sentence on such a menial bureaucrat explained mar to his coarsefeatured but sharpeyed subordinate but here my own objectives are served mar paused like a runementor you understand the significance of anatolia and the rest of the eastern themes do you not ostenson nodded he knew that the anatolian theme was the richest of the eighteen asian themes or provinces that comprised the breadbasket of the empire the wealth of the eastern themes continued mar in a pedagogical rhythm he had learned from listening to the endless discourses in the emperors chambers is not simply the endless sacks of grain they provide the imperial granaries or the yet more extraordinary harvest of taxes they provide the imperial treasury it is military manpower by this i mean the thematic armies again ostenson signalled his understanding each theme was able to mobilize a highly competent citizen army both to protect its own borders against minor incursions as well as to supplement the imperial taghmata the constantinoplebased standing professional army in times of major conflict fully mobilized all of the thematic armies could quintuple the size of the imperial taghmata and you understand the system of inalienable military freeholds then asked mar certain that his new centurion had not troubled himself with such arcane details ostensons bewildered eyes quickly confirmed his doubts well mar continued understand that these citizen soldiers cannot magically transform their hoes into spears and their burlap tunics into armour if you travel through asia minor as i have you are struck by the prosperity of the small farms strip after endless strip of shimmering grain and dewy pasture for centuries roman law has required each of these prosperous small farms which are the freeholds of the peasants who work them to provide and equip one soldier to remain in readiness for service in the thematic army the emperors have long understood that roman power is dependent on the survival of these military freeholds so for centuries they have enforced laws strictly banning purchase of the freeholds by the dhynatoi ostensons eyes narrowed the dhynatoi not only wallowed in the centuriesold fortunes provided by their vast landholdings but also dominated the roman senate and had placed their stooges in many of the most important imperial military commands the dhynatoi were vain ostentatious and insufferably arrogant when one of them occasionally ran foul of his own kind and ended up in numera prison the varangian centurions would cast lots for the privilege of attending to him unfortunately mar went on in the wry tone he used when he criticized official policy recently these laws have proved difficult to enforce the peasant freeholders who are called upon all too frequently by the imperial tax collectors as well as by their local military commanders wish to elude these obligations by illegally selling their farms to the dhynatoi the dhynatoi for their part are only too willing to purchase these properties illegally which they acquire by the hundreds even thousands and consolidate into vast estates so a peasant feels his lot is bettered by becoming a serf on the estate of a dhynatoi rather than owning his own farm ostenson shook his head then this tax gatherer is one of the bloodsuckers who are turning these soldierfarmers into slaves no wonder the emperor wishes to make an example of him mar grinned in the matter of thinking like a roman ostenson was a newborn the obvious deduction which you must never make if you wish to fathom the roman mind it is not the emperor but the dhynatoi who have sent this wretch to us bundled up with a dozen more tax officers from other districts and themes the dhynatoi wish to make an example of them why ostenson looked like a boy playing his first game of draughts with a man mars lips contorted with sarcasm this pathetic fool officially protested that the two largest estates in his district were harbouring former peasant freeholders now serfs on these estates who had illegally surrendered their farms to the dhynatoi the local judge quickly convicted this troublemaker of fraud and extortion and then the dhynatoi sent him along to the great city for punishment so that the message might be spread to overzealous tax officers throughout the empire ostenson was astute enough not to have to ask why the emperor permitted the dhynatoi to cheat him of taxes and soldiers instead he raised the less obvious question im not certain what our interest is in serving the dhynatoi mar nodded soberly as the thematic armies are inevitably weakened by the disappearance of the military freeholds the imperial taghmata will increasingly require the support of foreign mercenaries in times of great need and with my devotion to our father the emperor and indeed to the ideals of rome itself i would like to see that the roman army is served by nothing less than the finest warriors on the worldorb mar paused and flashed his perfect teeth norsemen ostenson looked down on the quaking back of john choniates then there is great worth in the punishment of this doubly cursed villain what is the disposition of his sentence hetairarch mar forked two fingers and pointed them to his eyes take him to the basement of numera prison and blind him with irons then transport him to the augusteion chain him upside down between the pillars and let the simple folk of the great city show him their charity ostenson jerked the whimpering tax collector to his feet and dragged him off this departure was immediately followed by the appearance of a decurion of the grand hetairia who handed mar a rolled and sealed document mar looked carefully at the lead seal dangling from the cord when he identified the author of the missive he flipped the seal contemptuously mar considered the grand domestic bardas dalassena commander of the imperial taghmata to be as mar had once said a puffedup strutting cock who holds his position only because of the position he holds bent over with his hands on his ankles whenever the dhynatoi request protection for their estates the grand domestic had vehemently resisted mars initiatives to recruit more norsemen into the roman army his opposition not only reflected the traditional interests of his dhynatoi sponsors but also his own conservative defensively orientated approach to battle tactics as mar had put it dalassenas idea of an aggressive campaign is to bribe the opposing commander not to transgress roman borders for a period of six months mar ripped the seal off with irritation expecting another protest about his petitions to expand the varangian guard but his face settled into intense concentration as he unrolled the document and began to read what was this the grand domestic was proposing that he and mar put aside their animosities and join forces to counter the precipitous ascent of mars fellow tauroscythian haraldr nordbrikt what mar had been nothing less than delighted by haraldr sigurdarsons success now the fugitive princeling could not only contribute his title to mars ambitions but also his fortune and why deprive the lad of any incentive to fatten his already considerable purse whatever the slave earns the master keeps mar shook his head dalassena he told himself is a bigger fool than i had thought no no man rises to the rank of magister without a modicum of cunning even if he has only acquired his guile by aping the patrons whom he serves no dalassena was not a complete buffoon was he privileged to information mar was not or was the intent here simply to burden mar with suspicion no dalassena was not that clever the grand domestics concern probably could be taken on the face of it but then who would be sponsoring mars pet princeling behind his back not nicephorus argyrus he was merely a grotesquely inflated merchant masquerading as a dhynatoi well such speculation was at this moment pointless mar did not want to be like one of these socalled hellenists at court who read the ancient greek philosophers and postulated endlessly on ultimate causes a hellenist would stay rooted in the path of a runaway horse debating over the great forces that set the event in motion rather than just simply getting out of the way or better still taking a horse staff and goading the beast back into its stable indeed if the fugitive princeling was perhaps soaring too high this would be the time to remind him of the chains that held him to earth mar remained fixed in thought for some time then took up his quill pen and dipped into the gold ink pot given to him by romanus on the occasion of the late and emphatically unlamented emperors last easter among them he wrote at length checking the details carefully then he removed his ring lit the red candle he had taken from his writing cabinet and applied his personal seal to the paper he clapped his hands with pleasure in the imperial palace a bowshot was not well aimed unless it brought down two birds at once and this single arrow might just skewer three fat unwary fowl these are instructions for our friend on the street of st polyeuktos mars handed the sealed document to the waiting decurion double his usual fee make certain that he understands everything and tell him that his brother who unfortunately has come to lodge in numera prison is well cared for we have petitioned for his release and he may be free before he has to spend the winter there the decurion bowed turned briskly and headed towards the palace gate mar hunrodarson looked through the large vaguely greentinted arched windows that illuminated his thirdstorey office he had set his writing table so that he faced north there was a uniform greyness to the view even the great silver dome of the church of hagia sophia was dulled by leaden skies that here and there dipped to earth in wispy ashen shafts of rain the waters of the bosporus sprinkled with white resembled gouged pewter how gentle those waves lulled next to the memories of the vast furious northern ocean that had tested mar as a boy and had brought him to manhood mar opened the doors to his colonnaded balcony and walked outside a north wind carrying the first intimations of winter funnelled through the marble portico mar savoured the refreshing gust the air seemed cleansed of the appalling fetor of the long sweltering southern summer what these romans have built is magnificent mar told himself as he surveyed the great city but think how much more magnificent all this will be when it has been scoured by the tempest that rages out of the north he assures this price is below the cost to him haraldr nordbrikt he only begs you accept because of the prestige your patronage will bring to him marmotman paused and reflected that this handwringing rug merchant with his oiled brow and desperate eyes had neglected to add a tip to the minimum fee that nicephorus argyrus via his representative marmotman was collecting for arranging audiences with the fabulously wealthy barbaros pirateslayer besides the perplexingly tightfisted barbaros had already refused a number of tempting propositions from agents representing nicephorus argyruss own business concerns and some of the proposals even offered legitimate profits there wasnt time to waste with this greasy carpet peddlar marmotman waved aside the scrofulous boy and crookedbacked old man who had carried in the merchants wares no haraldr nordbrikt slayer of saracens this merchandise is inferior indeed to such a degree that this purveyor might well be reported to the prefect no more merchants growled haraldr in the passable greek marmotman had taught him during their long voyage yes ive asked him to go haraldr nordbrikt not him only all all merchants this time haraldr drew his finger across his neck marmotman nervously stroked his new robe of syrian silk as he surveyed the mob of dealers in precious gems icons glass vases carved ivories egyptian carpets chased silver and gold serving vessels furniture polo mounts and even concreteandsteel strongboxes the merchants waited impatiently in the courtyard of the norse compound bobbing up and down to practise their shrillest solicitations or jostling as they fought for position there had already been several bloody noses and one attempted stabbing and these were supposedly proprietors of the most respectable shops on the mese men who wore embroidered hellas silk to work marmotman shook his head and calculated that there were thirtyfive forty tips still to be collected and four no five that would have to be refunded and here was haraldr nordbrikt making like christ the king expurgating the moneylenders from the temple still had not haraldr nordbrikt given marmotman a full varangians share of his booty which was ten times what nicephorus argyrus had paid him marmotman quickly decided where his true allegiance lay he raised his hands and flew at the merchants like a peasant woman shooing a herd of lumbering oxen out of her herb garden out out be gone quickly quickly the slayer of saracens casts you out he casts you out you have angered him with tawdry wares and meretricious claims be gone quickly before you bring his magical sword from his scabbard out save yourselves haraldr put his hands over his ears to block the unearthly wails of protest and withdrew into the barracks marmotman described these for me halldor was sitting on his cot leafing through a sheaf of parchments a shipyard in langobardland or as the romans say italia an estate in a place called melitene which is somewhere off in serkland this estate encompasses ten entire villages there are at least three score opportunities right here in constantinople a candle factory a palace not one street from nicephorus argyruss a home for blackfrocks or monastery that includes a newly constructed mortuary which is a building where corpses can be prepared for burial halldor looked up i think we could make some money on this haraldr simply groaned and sat on his cot how many agents for such properties had already assailed them in the two days since they had docked and returned to their st mamas quarter barracks one hundred perhaps another hundred right now howling outside the compound gate like a starving wolf pack with an elk in sight and then there were the merely curious conducting some sort of strange vigil outside thorir from uppsala had gone through the gate to fetch a ball he had kicked over the wall and so many of the men women and children of a half dozen nationalities had crowded forward to touch his cloak that he had nearly died of fright apparently they had thought that the towering moonfaced swede was the famous haraldr slayer of saracens we are invited to purchase other properties as well said ulfr who had just descended the stairs that led to the secondstorey gallery the romans call them ladies of the roof though i hardly know why since they are always on the streets at least they are all on our street right now there are three painted whores outside for every man inside you would not believe it the traffic is entirely blocked ulfr did not need to add that the noise from the street made the din of battle seem like the music of a mountain rivulet well let the whores in said halldor matteroffactly halldor may be right haraldr ulfr looked out into the courtyard where the varangians were squabbling over the trinkets they had purchased playing dice wrestling and throwing knives and axes besides breaking up all the fights over the belly plunder would give us something to do haraldr looked down at the cracked marble paving stones if odin and kristr had not favoured him with his successful stunt in the oceans of blaland he already would have lost the confidence of his pledgemen he shook his head at his two friends i dont understand nothing no word from the imperial authorities other than that eunuch tax gatherer who came to count our gold nicephorus argyrus sends only this plague of merchants most of them probably representing his own businesses as if it is now our duty to serve ourselves up to these gold devourers like trussed pigs not even any word from rivals of nicephorus argyrus hoping to hire our services away from him believe me said ulfr you still have the absolute allegiance of your pledgemen haraldr smiled grateful for his friends but unable to share their belief in him he had thought that his newly won wealth would open the gates to the imperial palace immediately and it was his secret desperate hope that even mar would be so impressed by his coup that he would accept him as a valued and respected ally mar no word from him either the knifing guilt that he had not could not tell everything to his pledgemen and each passing hour tightened the fetters of anxiety haraldr could almost sense his destiny being determined by forces beyond his reach perhaps even beyond his knowing was mar himself devising his use for haraldr or were others now taking up the threads of his fate and those of the five hundred he had pledged to lead two days ago he had been a triumphant god now waiting outside the walls of the empress city like the mendicants outside his own gate he was but an infant desperate for his mothers breast haraldr nordbrikt haraldr nordbrikt marmotman tugged on haraldrs sleeve you must talk to euthymius haraldr took his sword from his scabbard and checked its polish and edge against the light from the freshly lit oillight night was falling quickly and the sky smelled almost like damp earth is a euthymius a merchant he snapped an agent for some property owner a tax collector a whore if it is any of those id like to test my blade on this euthymius no no haraldr nordbrikt indeed he is not indeed he is euthymius the euthymius you cant imagine what his coming here means quickly haraldr nordbrikt quickly the man who strode jauntily through the doorway was tall perceptibly bony even in his stiff robe of damson silk and he moved so strangely that haraldr wondered for a moment if a euthymius was another of the emperors magical metal beings this note of artificiality was heightened by the mans face which lay beneath more paint than haraldr had ever seen on man or woman it was as if euthymius had been lacquered and dipped in wax his long sweeping golden hair scarcely seemed more real had it been hammered from brass and his equally golden pointed beard might have been bevelled with a chisel he spoke in greek without prompting and sounded as if he were projecting his words through a large tin funnel haraldr nordbrikt slayer of saracens to whom brilliant achilleus and resourceful odysseus and indeed the entire host of stronggreaved achaians are but phantom mists seared to oblivion in the withering sunburst of your fame rise up o former denizens of olympus a man lives among us who would be our successor to your heracles rise up o christendom embrace your new champion rise up o ye firmament that doth illuminate our flickering lives a new beacon is set among you euthymius advanced fell to the floor and threw his arms around haraldrs new leather boots haraldr nordbrikt i greet you with as much felicity as can surmount the towering edifice of reverence already constructed to your immortal memory haraldr understood only a fragment of this he had been told of odysseus and achilleus and heracles heroes of the ancient greeks and he knew the terms for ghosts and sun but he hardly needed a complete translation to understand what a euthymius was he had finally met a roman skald tell him i thank him for his verses haraldr told marmotman unfortunately i have both ulfr and thorfinn the otter to serve me in the role of skald and possibly grettir before too long besides from the look of him even now i could not afford his upkeep but tell him his verses would surely please odin our patron of poets no no haraldr nordbrikt this is the euthymius as he urges me to tell you impresario of entertainments husbander of amusements commander of an army of mirth he offers you one of his amusements celebrated in the hippodrome and throughout the empire theatre dance song comedy drama all specially created for the entertainment of you and your men believe me haraldr nordbrikt this is an honour you will enjoy beyond all others i will be all right nicetas maria whisked her hands gracefully at the concernedlooking eunuch he bowed and retreated into the villa maria turned to giorgios how did you find me giorgioss face was flushed from his run up the flight of marble steps and contorted with pain i followed the imperial galley i thought you might be on it he did not need to remind her that he had been trying to see her for weeks and that her servants and guards had rebuffed every attempt this is my villa maria said she stood on the portico with her arms folded beneath her breasts as if defending it behind her the great cities on either shore of the bosporus were framed by scudding rain clouds and metalhued water her villa was on the asian side to the north of chrysopolis i dont want you here giorgioss brown eyes were wet with confusion and sincerity i cant play this game any longer i am useless without you you must please maria stepped towards him her jaw tensed i know more amusing games this is not love play little boy i have refused to see you because i do not want to see you giorgios swallowed as if preparing to attempt some athletic feat you said you loved me the things we have done do you think you are the only man i have done those things with you saw me do some of them with alex i despised him it would make you sick if you knew some of the men i have been a whore to and what i have asked them to do to me and what i have done to them giorgios sprang forward seized her arms and shook her like a doll for a moment when he stopped his lower lip quivered why did you ever say you loved me you must despise me too i did love you then why why do i no longer love you she asked rhetorically you were only beautiful when i hurt you you only had life when i caused you pain i could no longer go on creating you anew each time marias eyes were cast down and her tone was inexpressibly melancholy i realized i can only love a man whose pain i do not have to provide a man bereaved in a way i cannot understand so that i must enter him when he enters me and find the thorn that has impaled his soul in you i could only find myself her pearllike teeth nibbled at her winedark lower lip and i am empty i am as cold and dark as the deepest abyss there is another man giorgios sounded curiously hopeful as if he could deal with that eventuality it was the utter frigidity of her demeanour that baffled and frightened him there is no one you were the last man in my bed if i could both love you and be kind to you i would love you still giorgioss mouth trembled with anguish he squeezed her shoulders gently and when he closed his eyes tears spilled to his cheeks clutching his forearms she removed his hands from her shoulders farewell giorgios an awful muffled keening came from giorgioss throat and he fell to his knees the tip of his bronze scabbard clattered on the marble paving stones he wrenched his sword free and with trembling arms held it to his own throat i want you to see the wound in my heart he sobbed i want you to see the proof of my pain his neck corded against the sheer polished steel marias eyes were uninterested seemingly dulled by the baleful pigmentation of the bosporus i am cold giorgios i am going inside please go before i call for my guards she walked swiftly past giorgios and disappeared into the pillared entrance after a moment giorgios lowered his sword and sobbed quietly still on his knees he finally left an hour after dark euthymiuss little army of mirth put the finishing touches on their courtyard theatre the stage they had erected with its gilded proscenium and brocaded curtains was as splendid as the palace of a norse king neither haraldr nor any of his men could divine the use of the rest of the apparatus this impresario had assembled but the varangians who had already littered the courtyard with empty kegs jars and wineskins were loudly speculating on the possibilities offered by the dozens of variously costumed lithe young women all painted nearly as brightly as euthymius himself who scurried about trilled brief notes or performed agile exercises haraldr had nearly choked when marmotman had first proposed euthymiuss expenses and honorarium the rest of his costs are an offering a veritable human sacrifice to the herculean demigod the slayer of saracens and his dauntless band of incorruptible christian heroes but now even before this amusement had begun haraldr knew that the gold spent would be more than recaptured in the heightened spirit of his men the performance opened with an explosion of two dozen male and female athletes clad only in loincloths spangled with shiny rainbowcoloured metal bits who could spin like tops roll like hoops and whirl through the air like throwing axes eventually they built a human tower crowned with the barebreasted women then came dogs that dressed and walked as men monkeys that raced into the audience and plucked coins from mens purses then danced in celebration a lion whose roar seemed to shake the walls then a lion with stripes a striped horse with a neck so long it seemed certain he would topple over and finally an incredible beast with a back that reached to the secondstorey balcony legs shaped exactly like tree trunks and most wondrous of all a snout as long as a man was tall that could also pluck coins from the audience leading halldor to ask if there was any living creature in constantinople that could not find a mans purse then came the truly extraordinary portion of the amusement if indeed this was an amusement at all it was well past midnight the varangians roaring with wine and lust when a chorus trilled and the stage was momentarily screened the brocade curtains parted and the music provided by a portable pipe organ droned dramatically ill draw the curtain you find euthymius haraldr shouted to halldor wearing purple brocade a dark full beard and an elaborate sparkling diadem the first actor was clearly a representation of the emperor haraldrs heart screamed with alarm as he rushed to the stage was this a plot to involve them in a treason clever indeed haraldr nordbrikt haraldr nordbrikt shrieked marmotman as he clung desperately to haraldrs thigh haraldr nordbrikt you must stop please if only for a moment haraldr finally gave up he was not making much progress through the crowd the varangians kept clasping him gratefully and the enactment was rapidly proceeding the mock emperor had already been followed onto the stage by a second thinner actor also dressed in mock imperial raiment and then three younger purplerobed women one beautiful one less attractive and one wearing a mask representing some sort of pox or skin disfigurement these five characters burst into simultaneous action the first emperor mimed the defeat of numerous men in rough brown tunics who streamed endlessly onto the stage the thinner purpleclad man drank from a wineskin and rolled dice the beautiful woman primped and dabbed paint on her face the plainer woman looked on enviously and the ugly one retired to a corner and knelt in prayer haraldr nordbrikt gasped the shaken marmotman you must know that this is customary among the romans it is permitted to lampoon the emperor even should he himself be seated among us in fact there has never been an autocrator who did not himself witness at least one such performance at his expense believe me haraldr nordbrikt euthymius says he has prepared this mime particularly for you haraldr understood a norse king would also permit a skald to jest with him of course the skald who dared such jibes was like the man who hunted walrus alone in a small boat if he was not extremely skilled he was dead haraldr waved halldor back and they stood together to watch the show basil the bulgarslayer asked halldor as the first stage emperor continued to bash various mock enemies i think so said haraldr bulgars wear those brown tunics suddenly the bulgarslayer slumped motionless to the floor and the other actors indulged in great floor pounding and wailing the bulgarslayers crown was handed to the thinner man who after placing the diadem on his head paused and appraised the beautiful woman and the notsobeautiful woman the disfigured woman apparently had disappeared though haraldr had not noticed her departure from the stage another actor a rather elderly man in a green robe entered and with elaborate comic motions the emperor urged the notsobeautiful woman to embrace this new character but she merely turned her head and turned up her nose then the emperor cajoled the beautiful woman and after considerable reluctance she finally took the greenrobed old man in her arms the notsobeautiful woman erupted into hysterical mocking laughter the emperor threw up his arms in glee promptly fell in a heap and the beautiful woman picked up his crown and purple robe and gave them to her aged companion once crowned this new emperor piled bricks into little walls and sprinkled them with coins to the accompaniment of longhaired men who threw pages torn from books in the air and shouted in a nonsense language then something quite remarkable happened the pace of the actors movements slowed the music became funereal and a towering blackfrocked monk entered mounted on a real horse and pranced about the stage not the blackfrock you saw at nicephorus argyruss asked halldor i dont know perhaps we have reached the present emperor this one is certainly portrayed as a buffoon the blackfrock paused for a moment to study the new emperor and the beautiful woman who had turned their backs to each other the monk cantered offstage for a moment and when he returned another man much younger than the emperor and clad in a very plain yellow wool robe rode behind him on the horse both men dismounted and the monk took the yellowrobed man by the hand pointed out to him the apparently feuding imperial couple gave him a pat and a kiss as one might to a young child and shooed him over to the woman the beautiful woman took the yellowrobed mans hand held it shyly for a moment then devoured him with kisses knocking him to the floor fuck her fuck her the first few varangians to shout were quickly joined by a rhythmic chant the couple kissed prone for a moment the notsobeautiful woman just observed all this with elegant amusement then rose turned to the emperor and stood and watched while he grabbed his throat like a man choking or poisoned neither they nor the monk attempted to help and the emperor collapsed in a heap theyre saying someone murdered an emperor hissed halldor his wife and her lover the monk plucked the imperial diadem from the fallen emperors head and removed the purple robe the monk then placed the crown on the yellowrobed mans head and wrapped him in the purple robe the beautiful woman turned to the notsobeautiful woman erupted with armflailing anger and drove her off the stage then the beautiful woman went to one side of the stage to paint her face while the newest emperor sat contemplatively on his gilded throne the monk hovering over him in a somewhat sinister tableau kristr haraldr released the strangled oath as a tall blond man wearing huge padding and the uniform of the varangian guard entered the stage the makebelieve varangian stood on the side of the throne opposite the monk his great axe extended over the emperor it was unclear as to whether he was protecting the emperor or preparing to behead him mar hunrodarson asked halldor haraldr nodded his veins iced he had suspected that the imperial throne might be an illusion masking a greater and more sinister power but to finally see his speculation confirmed by a roman source and to know that mar himself was that power but it wasnt that clear what of the blackfrock was he the mysterious joannes and if so did he and mar share power before haraldr could begin to sort through these alarming new questions the organ raced to a triumphant flourish and a second tall blond padded and armoured actor entered the stage followed by a band of makeshift varangians this second mock norseman was quickly swarmed by a band of actors wearing white robes he held his varangians back then stepped forward and one by one knocked the whiterobed actors to the floor haraldr haraldr hardraada hardraada chanted the audience haraldr uncomfortably watched his stage persona finish bashing the mock saracens then reach into the stage floor and pull out a chest filled with brilliant gold coins the mock haraldr proudly displayed the chest to the emperor and as he presented the offering both mar and the blackfrock bent simultaneously and mimed speaking garrulously to the emperor each taking an imperial ear with that the curtain was drawn haraldr leapt for the stage intent on asking euthymius just what message this cryptic unfinished drama had been intended to convey even if it meant posing his question with the blade of his sword but he was quickly intercepted by his pledgemen haraldr haraldr yelled the varangians as they swarmed around him find euthymius haraldr frantically shouted to halldor the varangians boosted haraldr to their shoulders then ebulliently tossed him high into the night sky they caught him and continued to throw him into the air again and again after several minutes halldor returned and shouted to his still soaring leader i cant find euthymius someone opened the gates and the whores came in silence the grand domestic bardas dalassena turned the brass cock at the base of his water clock and emptied the fluid into a washbasin he kept beside the machines ponderous brasspillared base for precisely that purpose even though the hourly whistle did not sound at night he hated the insidious ratcheting of the mechanism that caused a small statue of a beast a different one for each hour to appear in a miniature arcade visible now was a bear indicating the ninth hour of the night dalassena looked at the erect gold creature its finely modelled little paws clawed the air with his usual vague dread a psychic burden he carried so habitually that it seemed to press on his shoulders physically bowing him forward like an aged porter three hours until the first hour of the morning five hours until he would once again be at his office in the palace he hated this reminder of the routine that had chained him but the clock had been a gift from the senator and magister nicon attalietes so he was obliged to display it prominently in the office he kept in his home the hilltop palace that he had acquired through the generosity of senator attalietes and his circle but for a moment at least dalassena was free from time and its irksome herald sound his wife eudocia had long since succumbed to the oppressive gaiety of their evening at the palace of the zonaras the price of being among the dhynatoi but not of them was that one had to pretend to enjoy the social rituals that the dhynatoi themselves disdained with weary sarcasm his daughter anna also had come home though only an hour ago he ached to think of the corruption of her doeeyed innocence but since anna now often dined only a chair removed from the empress he endured the pain of her despoliation like a soldier in a field hospital stiffening against the amputation of his leg the only sound from this quiet precinct of the sleeping city was the occasional rattle as armed guards checked locked gates and the ghostly sough of the wind through columned arcades dalassena went to his lacquered wooden writing table and removed the sheaf of dispatches that he regularly brought home and studied as if in taking these profound drafts of his predicament he could somehow find expiation the dispatches reported raids near hadath and raban some large estates had been torched and a distant nephew of a senator had been slain bulgars had come across the danube near nicopolis and had penetrated almost to trnovo in paristron theme the continuing fester of sicily where abdallahibnmuizz was taking christians captive by the thousands libyan pirates had sacked three coastal villages in southern crete the successes were almost as nettling the siege of berki would soon be concluded now that a force of varangians had arrived and most appalling of all the victory by this new tauroscythian menace over almost two hundred pirate vessels at the very ends of the earth just the kind of thing that would kindle the dangerous imagination of the mob dalassena clenched his still powerful fists madness his generous appeal to the selfinterest of the swollenheaded hetairarch mar hunrodarson had not brought a breath of reply apparently hunrodarson was unaware of the directive from the emperors own offices to explore expansion of the middle hetairia the less prestigious imperial guard that had been virtually defunct for decades and was now manned by only a few wellborn fugitives from saracen courts ceremonially invested to reward them for converting to christianity and swearing allegiance to the emperor this directive proposed to revive the middle hetairia to accommodate a second force of varangians a force that would be equal in numbers to mar hunrodarsons grand hetairia and this initiative had not been sponsored by mar hunrodarson dalassena was certain of that no he reflected hunrodarson has taken to making his appeals to the logothete of the dromus with all these not entirely unfounded claims of massive civil discontent in the city and his continued lobbying for another varangian unit to be posted outside the palace even hunrodarson is reluctant to invite any more of his barbaroi band of cutthroats within the chalke gate so it is clear that the extravagantly lucky thug haraldr nordbrikt is the beneficiary of some other highly placed patron perhaps someone promoting a rival to mar hunrodarson why cant hunrodarson who is as clever as he is mendacious see that he is being asked to share his bone with another equally vicious dog dalassena shuffled through his writing cabinet took out his pen and ink and a sheet of alexandrian paper and laboriously scripted a note to the domestic of the hyknatoi one of his key subordinates in the imperial taghmata instructing him in the course of action they should now take he decided he had better use his personal seal on the document rather than the official stamp of his office as he fingered the small coneshaped stone implement he noticed that traces of wax had been left on the face and he picked the engraved surface meticulously clean had his wife eudocia been using his seal again perhaps to place orders with the vestiopratai the imperially licensed dealers in silk garments wasnt it enough that she had one eunuch silk merchant who called weekly that was simply not acceptable the woman was determined to make a travesty of his marital dominion bardas dalessena pressed the stone seal into the glimmering hot wax then put his writing instruments away and savoured silence within seconds he had completely forgotten the diatribe he had intended for his wife the sound of steel striking brass echoed through a cavern haraldr felt the pain and wondered how he had come to sleep with seals slippery seals soft downcovered seals their bodies underneath and atop and beside him but seals did not have furless arms or legs or great hanks of wet hair still seals could smell like this again the noise in the cavern but this time it was someone screaming haraldr struggled to raise his torso and bodies slithered away from him he saw the whore her face paint smeared into a blurry mask and then the dancer around they went pulling hair grunting and squealing haraldr dragged his legs from under a bedding of flesh punctuated with bulging breasts jutting buttocks and staring wheatthatched belly furrows he shook the whore she had to stop screaming but she wasnt screaming haraldr struggled to his feet the brass was shattering inside his head the courtyard looked like the aftermath of a terrible battle the wreckage of euthymiuss stage was scattered amid a vast carpet of naked men and women their clothes and empty containers of various intoxicating beverages odin the herons of forgetfulness must have plucked every mind last night thought haraldr his stomach retching and his head bursting with hot metal and the horrible shrieking then he saw the actual source of the screaming an oliveskinned dancer rising above the prone but obviously not totally incapacitated form of a wildhaired varangian at first haraldr assumed that only an excess of pleasure filled the dancers throat but then he saw it too it had been a varangian when it had forearms and calves and bowels and genitals and a head it now hung naked six feet off the ground from its own small intestine which had been wrapped around its waist and then tied to the balcony above so that the truncated body spun slowly within one of the broad soiled white plaster arches of the courtyard arcade haraldr bent over and let the bitter alcoholic bile surge over his tongue and onto the pavement the vomit filled his nostrils and he retched some more choking and sputtering like a child another woman screamed and a varangian began to shout haraldr held his hands to his screeching head the screaming and shouting became a chorus ulfr came running he had remained sober to guard the gold along with a few of the most devoted disciples of kristr among the varangians who would neither drink for pleasure nor fornicate they had been at their posts in the strongroom all night a message has been left said ulfr as he stood over a disembodied arm lying on the stone pavement a few ells from the corpse the stiff purple forefinger had been carefully arranged to point directly at a large algaetinted terracotta jar resting a few ells away against the inner wall of the arcade haraldr looked inside the jar and gagged steeling himself he reached in his trembling fingers found a single grotesquely slippery lock of hair the bowelknifing touch told him that the rest of the scalp had been flayed to the bare skull he forced back the bile and commanded himself to bring the head up he stood and looked with uncomprehending terror into the face no lips or ears a shrivelled bruisecoloured penis in place of the nose and a rosy testicle in each eye socket a piece of parchment was clenched between bloody grimacing teeth shaking from head to toe nauseated beyond anything he had ever imagined haraldr prised the teeth open removed the parchment and clawed with bloody fingers at the crimson wax seal he read the message crushed it in his hand fell back against the wall and slumped to the ground holding the bloody skull against his chest like a boy cradling the dead body of a beloved pet one by one they entered their robes of glossy white silk stiff with gold thread to stand at their places around the polished ivory table but the blackfrocked orphanotrophus joannes did not acknowledge or even see them he had gone home to amastris he smelled the dust of asia minor in the hot summer wind and heard the buzz of the locusts but i did the sums you cant have finished all of them his mother had said she held the lump of cheese in her hands squeezed and the thin milky liquid oozed between her thick mannish fingers he remembered that distinctly but i did if stephan and constantine are going i must be able to go too the sea was where he had wanted to go the coarse wet sand of the beach near the docks and the big cool pebbles around which he could curl his toes i need you to look after michael hes everywhere at once and into everything now look his mother swept up the naked infant who had almost disappeared into a halfempty grain sack joannes could tell that his mother was concealing something from him he knew then that his day would not be good he said goodbye to constantine and stephan and waited quietly doing sums in his head after what seemed a very long time he heard his fathers voice that beaten whining voice that alone of all sounds terrified him for he knew the defeat in it his father tall yet paunchy with his reek of fish sauce and cheap wine was in the company of a second man and joannes shrank from this man immediately he had the ugly hairless chin of a eunuch jaundiced squinty eyes that made him look like a snake and a tunic stained like a butchers smock this is the one joanness father told the snakeeyed eunuch he reads better than boys twice his age and there is no function of arithmetic he cannot already perform the eunuch slipped joanness tunic over his head and looked at him through his reptilian slits then felt his arms and poked at his chest and belly he turned to joanness father and said hes strong enough for the operation i can proceed right away hell have some pain but little bleeding the rest had been an unimaginable nightmare no blade only a silk ligature wrapped tightly about the top of his tiny pink scrotum the searing pain that had come within minutes then the numbness and the horror of the next two weeks as he had watched a part of him die every day the eunuch came to smear the purpling yellowing blackening flesh with ointment and every day joannes smelled the rot of the life he might have had the games with other boys and that vague future of manhood that he could sense only well enough to know he was now denied it joanness father had not explained it until the shrivelled vestige of joanness scrotum and testicles had sloughed away this is so you can stand next to the emperor as i will never do the next day joannes had been sent to a school in constantinople and so he had come to stand next to the emperor the orphanotrophus joannes looked down upon the living heir of christ the king seated on his golden throne as he attended to this meeting of the sacrum consistorum the group of fifteen men who constituted the emperors cabinet the emperor turned and looked up at joannes his dark tired eyes questing for assurance and joannes nodded and replied with a look that communicated the almost suffocating love he felt for this sacred person he had never loved a woman but was not such feeling even at its purest a hollow profanity next to the love he held for the lords anointed representative on earth for in loving this emperor joannes could restore the life no not simply the life but the immortality that had been shorn from him so long ago joannes looked again at the emperor michael and for a searing instant filled his heart with the dream that burned in his soul joannes studied the assembled cabinet they were pieces on the board at which joannes daily played the agesold endless game of roman power a game where a man might wager his life and win eternal life his name inscribed for ever in the halls of memory there isnt a real player in this lot thought joannes the grand domestic bardas dalassena clutching the golden wand of a magister as if he were showing off his erect manhood his arrogant chin and barrel chest thrust forward dalassena was a career military officer his family just wealthy enough that he had been able to start out in the imperial scholae but not wealthy enough to make him a member of the dhynatoi to which he so desperately aspired will you be so proud dalassena when you ride through the city backwards on an ass and the logothete of the dromus a thorough potentially formidable man who had become so timorous of his own spies that he could hardly speak without locking himself in that absurd secret chamber of his joanness eyes flickered what would the logothete say if he knew that his trusted servant was in the pay of the orphanotrophus the prefect of the city whitehaired and frail was a harmless criminal a competent administrator content ploddingly to enforce his exacting regulations and enrich himself with a steady flow of petty graft the quaestor his fat round head bobbing with palsy was the highest judicial officer in the empire and reputed to hear his cases in such a state of inebriation that he had once sentenced his own secretary to hanging fortunately the lawyers had been able to turn him to the accused before he had had the horrified functionary dragged off in irons the sacellarius a stooped almost vacantlooking eunuch was joanness personal property as supervisor of all imperial finances from the emperors estates to the empires staggering tax revenues he was a relentless cipher who provided joannes with the real key to his power a knowledge of the origins and ultimate disposition of virtually every solidus that entered the imperial treasury then several august senators of magister rank the obligatory representatives of the mindless dhynatoi and their reclusive swineherd the senator and magister nicon attalietes the dhynatoi joannes thought scoffingly were wilful children who produced nothing and were intent on consuming everything and in eastern themes they were shaping the noose with which they would hang themselves then the imperial government would come in and restore the timeless order of the roman system the meeting droned on the principal concern was the quiveringjowled quaestors continuing dispute with alexius the patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith the patriarch alexius was attempting to appropriate into the patriarchal courts some types of cases previously relegated to the civil courts in this joannes would oppose the quaestor though he personally despised the unctuous excrementtongued patriarch perhaps more than any other man because when joannes had deposed the patriarch he would wish to expand the authority of the ecclesiastical courts beyond even patriarch alexiuss insanely grasping ambitions the grand domestic reported on the siege of the saracen fortress at berki in eastern asia minor which was finally showing signs of a successful conclusion yes dalassena joannes observed silently because you were finally able to blockade the fortress when a force of several hundred varangians was brought in by your subordinate nicholas pegonites over your objections hadnt you dalassena at first threatened to make a eunuch of pegonites the sacellarius gave the usual summary of the declining tax revenues from the eastern themes though as usual his figures at joanness behest did not reflect the true immensity of the problem wait until the patient is gravely ill joannes reasoned and he will accept even the most drastic treatment then came the matter joannes had prompted the logothete to raise the new caliph of egypt moustanir billah the logothete humbly intoned his stubby fingers clasped almost penitently to his chest is proving himself the very manifestation of peaceful coexistence between rome and the arab world he has released tens of thousands of christian captives from the caliphates dungeons he has entered into a thirtyyear treaty of peace with the roman empire he has kept passage to jerusalem open to christians who wish to journey to the holy shrines and to crown his achievements he has authorized rebuilding of the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem is it not time to honour this saracen avatar of christian virtues with a gesture of regard for his estimable conduct the emperor nodded what is your suggestion logothete asked joannes what better way to express our respect and trust for the caliph and indeed convey to the ordinary roman taxpayer the peace that roman hegemony has brought to the entire civilized world than for eminent and honoured roman dignitaries to lead a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre of christ pantocrator in jerusalem and what dignitaries would the logothete suggest as appropriate to the significance of this new accord in the lands where our lord was sinlessly made incarnate in flesh asked joannes we must not offend the caliph by sending him any less than his equal in rank and diplomacy it would of course be inconceivable to ask our emperor father to make such a timeconsuming journey at a time when his children are in desperate need of his holy presence but perhaps the empress mother who has spared no effort on previous occasions to vouchsafe her exemplary piety would lead the roman standards on a pilgrimage of such profound implication that it may well be thought to augur the millennium of the pantocrators holy kingdom i pray that our emperor father will bless us with the loan of his living treasure though it is certain that for him and indeed for those of us who will remain in the empress city each moment without our blessed mother will be a torment to echo the diabolical distresses christ pantocrator himself endured in the wilderness joannes looked around the room the dhynatoi would concur in this initiative since such a profound expression of saracenchristian accord would almost immediately escalate the value of their estates in the eastern themes which had long suffered from arab raids and their dung hauler the grand domestic dalassena would certainly have to join their accord even though he knew that he could not even guarantee the empress safe passage from cesare mazacha to adana in the heart of roman asia minor joannes turned his lowered palm forward signalling the emperor that he should reply of course the lord of the entire world would accede to this request the idea of a pilgrimage would appeal to his ardent piety but less so than the opportunity to remove himself from the scheming harlot who plagued him to distraction with her unyielding demands for the most lascivious affections the woman was a menace and joannes longed for the day when she would prove unnecessary when the emperor had given his approval joannes thought of the small matter that had troubled him earlier he was fatigued from the meeting but reminded himself that the enormity of his responsibility required unremitting attention to detail your imperial majesty said joannes let me presume to acknowledge the angelic quality of your affections for our mother the empress a model of devotion such that even those of us who love the holy theotokos as we do cannot hope to exceed the adoration you have vested in our earthly mothers precious vessel and so to protect this wondrously adorned yet fragile vessel i would suggest her guard be augmented with a special gift to her holy presence a force of tauroscythians of proven ferocity and dauntless ability in dealing with foes of christendom the tauroscythians who vanquished the despicable saracen miscreants off the coast of africa are languishing in disuse and i fear that their services will soon be lost to the roman empire if they are not given employment suitable to their evident worth as champions of christ name these men as the empresss special guard and the mother of god herself will take our mothers hand as she ventures forth to pray for us at the shrines of christ the king the emperor quickly agreed and joannes watched the grand domestic dalassenas eyes looking for a sign as he had suspected he saw nothing purple even halldors voice was edged with fatigue shock and rage asbjorn ingvarsons funeral pyre which had burned in the courtyard all afternoon still sent a ravensooted plume into the indigo sky the authorities had barred the gates and prevented the varangians from burying the young swede at sea and it had taken all of haraldrs force as a leader to keep his men from breaking out and assaulting the city walls purple asked ulfr numbly he jerked his head up his chair scraped against the stone paving of the little storeroom halldor spoke like a man in a trance determined to make his point to listeners he could scarcely see when the first two emperors died the woman passed the crown to their successors neither of whom wore purple when they first appeared purple implies royal lineage haraldr tried to focus on halldors words through his own scarcely controllable fury although he had not known asbjorn ingvarson well the agreeable young pagan had been one of his most devoted pledgemen and his death screamed for odins vengeance asbjorns soul could not begin the long journey through the spirit world while his murderer remained in the middle realm but haraldr realized that his sword was sheathed by his own ignorance as yet he could only guess at the identity of the murderer of asbjorn ingvarson he was convinced however that euthymiuss curious mime provided them important clues he struggled to make sense of halldors reasoning so you see halldor droned on the man the monk brought in on his horse who was surely intended to represent the emperor who received you haraldr is not of royal blood haraldr nodded his intellect finally stirring so this bitchwhore is the last of the bulgarslayers lineage and the kiss of her loins can legitimize any wouldbe emperor skilled in aiming the lance he carries between his legs the monk gave the last emperor his crown rebutted ulfr but the emperor still had to embrace the bitchwhore in order to receive the crown and purple robe countered halldor why would the monk pick this particular man mused haraldr almost to himself youre certain this monk is the same one you saw that night at nicephorus argyruss asked ulfr no there are so many blackfrocks among these romans i could never be certain but this joannes i am certain that was his name inspired fear as if he could indeed topple an emperor and raise up another in his stead and his name is whispered here and there again and again i believe that this joannes was the monk portrayed here last night ventured halldor and clearly the emperor a usurper with no blood claim to the throne is but a puppet of both joannes and mar the question left is what were they telling their puppet to do with you haraldr massaged his aching temples im not certain any of it is that simple yes mar and joannes are very powerful but the very fact that they might need a puppet to represent them indicates the limits of their power after all one is a eunuch the other a barbaros i have also seen the array of courtmen who surround this emperor and among those hundreds there must be other factions as well haraldr placed his hands together and looked searchingly at ulfr and halldor his scarred eyebrow twitching slightly consider this what if in the play mar and joannes were actually disputing for the emperors ear if mar is my enemy then joannes might be my friend or the other way around said halldor again haraldr felt the awful stirring deep in his entrails even now especially now he could not tell everything to halldor or ulfr or any of his men it was not only the oaths he had sworn to olaf and jarl rognvald but he now realized that the jarl had been agonizingly prescient when he had warned him that his deadly secret could also condemn the men pledged to his keeping haraldr would have to deal with mar as he had dealt with hakon in the arena from which the only exit was victory or death haraldr pressed out the piece of parchment prised from asbjorns frozen teeth the message had been written in runic symbols obviously drafted by an interpreter who had made several mistakes still the message was clear enough haraldr read it aloud again as if the words were some sort of chant that would induce a state in which a greater truth would be revealed haraldr nordbrikt the next head is yours think well with it while you yet own it leave miklagardr mar would not have needed an interpreter to write the runes offered halldor perhaps the interpreters hand is a clever ruse suggested ulfr haraldr followed his own silent line of reasoning why would mar want haraldr to leave if he had as he had said use for him but perhaps mar had butchered asbjorn ingvarson simply to unnerve haraldr to remind him of the blade he held at haraldrs back if haraldr could prove that he would not wait he would ask odin to choose between his two ragegifted champions but what proof a mistaken judgement now would almost certainly doom five hundred men haraldr examined the remains of the red wax seal again cursing himself for destroying most of it that morning by the time he realized what he had done the remaining bits had been flattened on the stone walkway by dozens of feet still the fragment that remained had a recognizable detail an arm holding a sword that could easily be mar but then many men carried swords though it was unlikely that monks did haraldr fixed every detail of that fragment in his memory if he saw it again his sword would be swift could it be mars seal asked ulfr why would mar use his own seal but try to disguise his hand countered halldor or perhaps joannes is trying to make us think that mar opposes us haraldr just shook his head each thought was like a box within a box within a box were mar and joannes themselves merely ruses was the whole intent of the play and its grisly aftermath to confuse yes a man could be beaten by ruses alone to march on the city that day would have been suicidal but soon haraldr would have to take some action they could not fester here indefinitely eventually to turn on themselves he considered the bitter irony by defeating an army of phantoms he had won enough gold to buy a kingdom but now all the gold in the east could not help him against the phantoms the romans had set upon him and the names of these phantoms were fear confusion and indecision how could a garden so beautiful be so empty she had wondered but she knew that only the iridescent peacocks watched the huge leaves so green that they seemed flaked from giant emeralds bowed deeply with the moist heat her robe was hot so she had slipped it up to her hips as she sat on the cool marble bench and dangled her legs in the little pool the peacocks rustled and spread their silky fans she touched herself and she was already wet then his hand came over hers and held it there he stroked her gently with her own finger her spine became fluid and she rocked her head back and saw the sun distant and filtered through the emerald canopy his other hand pulled her robe up and the silk seemed to dissolve over her arms and she shivered when he touched her hard nipple she floated on the pool the water warm he tossed her like a doll and she faced him he standing she poised weightless legs wrapped around him sensing the searing gristle just beneath her she lowered herself and he was like a shaft of rock covered with hot unguent sliding deep she pressed her milky breasts to his chest pulled his silky hair and kissed his soft golden eyebrows her tongue darting over the hard ridge of the pale pink scar she rocked and rose and the birds made a single noise like the note of a golden hymn her scream shattered the glassy leaves and brought the night like a black hammer the obsidian head of her lover leered his horrible beak tittering and the nacreous beads of his eyes reaching for her soul she screamed and screamed again and her lovers wings rose up like storm clouds she awakened mistress lilted the eunuch nicetas he stood at marias bedside a silver tray and golden goblet balanced on his slender fingertips mistress would you care for your draught the mistress of the robes usually requested this narcotic when she awakened in the night if she did not have a companion to ease her nocturnal anxieties maria looked around the bedchamber no nicetas light a lamp nicetas found the brass lantern on the dresser and lit it with his own oil lamp is our mother awake yes mistress the blessed mother was often awake since she was so rarely rendered pacific by the attentions of her husband maria put on her berylgreen robe and padded down the marble hallways in her silk slippers she paused before the eunuchs who guarded the empresss antechamber and was nodded past the antechamber was brightly lit by the silver candelabra the floor of opus sectile resembled a meadow of crocus and hyacinth two more eunuchs in lacquerstiff silk greeted her and went softly to the huge ivory doors incised with the imperial eagles and slid them slightly apart after a moment one eunuch turned and nodded and maria crossed the room columns of whiteveined carian marble supported the soaring golden dome of the empresss vast bedchamber the walls were revetted with alternating panels of deep red porphyry and mossgreen thesallian marble maria observed that the empress had expanded her cosmetics factory three servants attended tables covered with vials jars mortars and pestles and rows of braziers simmering dozens of pungentsmelling potions little daughter cried the empress zoe as she swept across the room to greet maria her flawless white arms extended her sheer gauze gown clinging to her full yet youthful form like a windblown cloud she drew the small clay jar in her hand beneath marias nose it smelled vaguely of whale oil and then dabbed with her fingers gently massaging a cool cream into marias forehead this is new it will erase a frown as if an angel had passed over your face maria acquiesced was not zoes own unsurpassed pulchritude proof that her endless cosmetic inventions had merit still the empresss obsession was desperate as if she believed her beauty might flee in the night if she did not remain awake concocting ways to preserve it of course maria acknowledged that she too would be as vigilant when she reached the empresss age she hated to think of herself as prunefaced and desiccated no longer able to contort her lithe spine against the supple body of a young athlete but perhaps she would not live that long zoe stood back and admired maria already the care has been absorbed from your skin she handed the jar of ointment to a servant i guess you have heard that the senator and patrician andronicus cametus has been murdered by one of his conquests its not entirely true the boys father was the assailant he hid in the senators bath zoe waved her hand as if the entire scandal were a wisp of stagnant air to be fanned away no i can see that you dont know she parted her bowshaped bloodred lips in a curiously triumphant pout inhaled as if to speak and then paused savouring her coup were going to jerusalem she finally said she fluttered her hand frivolously my devoted husband commands it so i must obey should i have occasion also to submit myself to the sinful pleasures of antioch and the appalling decadence of the levant on this holiest of ventures it would simply be as the dutiful wife of our holy emperor father then i am bid to suffer these scourges at your side my blessed mother said maria her eyes cast down in mock humility then she looked up earnestly but isnt it in truth dangerous i think not at least once we leave roman soil the caliph is reputed to be most gracious and zoe drew the word out with a delicately salacious flourish we are to have a special guard attached to our regular military escort those tauroscythians who have made themselves so rich and the monstrously acquisitive nicephorus argyrus so much richer maria felt as if the blood in her face had been sucked away by a shrieking dry winter wind she could only stammer i i mother her teeth began to chatter slightly little daughter the tauroscythians are such luxuries they amuse us zoe placed her arms around maria you have never been afraid of northern barbaroi before and you have even met the commander of these men why you said he was partially civilized in a grim sort of way i do remember i fear he is too grim for me i have had dreams ohhh zoe let the exclamation breeze through her lips i am so stimulated by your dreams maria had i had your imagination when i was your age perhaps i would have been more deliberate in my choice of companions mother these dreams bring me no pleasure but maria realized that there was even now a residue of the ecstasy she had known in the dream garden and that her memory of that passion was all the more vivid because of the horror that had followed no that is not entirely so there is pleasure and there is terror my dreams offer love and death twined so tightly that you could not get a knife between them perhaps death is the ultimate desire zoes icy amethyst eyes seemed to darken like crystal pools shadowed by a cloud as she thought of her own troubles yes little daughter love and death are but the different sides of one coin how well your empress mother knows the truth of that you may not john the frogfaced interpreter held the document against his chest as if he were a woman shielding her bare breasts i have translated each word exactly as written he fixed his eyes defiantly on the ceiling let me read snapped haraldr in greek so that the topoteretes would hear the tougheyed leatherskinned topoteretes who had been absorbed in studying halldors sword looked up in surprise after a moment he barked at the surly blackfrocked interpreter who sulkingly handed the paper to haraldr haraldr studied the claret script he made out the term for the emperor and also another greek word that troubled him it says something about my going by ship he told halldor and ulfr my previous journey to the emperors palace did not require a sea voyage i smell the ravenslime said ulfr they could plan to take you to a place of imprisonment ive heard they frequently exile their own to islands from which there is no escape or just feed you to the lobsters offered halldor haraldr decided he would balk on this issue he tapped john on the arm the interpreter jerked it away indignantly the dam haraldr had built against his rage and frustration could hold no longer he leapt to his feet grabbed johns gown at the chest and with one hand jerked the astonished interpreter over his head his other hand quivered over the pommel of his sword waiting if necessary for the topoteretes ask the topoteretes why they are transporting me by sea ask him to haraldrs surprise the topoteretes laughed his head back showing big white horsy teeth he even poked halldor and gestured showing how much he appreciated this treatment of the interpreter ask him shouted haraldr to his redfaced flailing captive the interpreter translated frantically and haraldr recovering his control dropped him hard on his feet the topoteretes shrugged and explained the interpreter stepped back and made the sign of the cross he spoke in unsteady norse he says they want to receive you in the palace harbour its more appropriate haraldr looked at halldor and ulfr he raised his eyebrows quizzically i think we can trust our friend the topoteretes said ulfr yes thought haraldr i can assume i am going to the palace but has mar sent for me or is it joannes do mar and joannes work in concert then all of the pieces shifted and he felt a sudden tranquillity almost as it had been when he was a boy struggling to learn the runes and suddenly he had made sense of it all fate alone would greet him at the end of this days voyage and the masks destiny wore were not important if he died it would be a better end than remaining the wealthiest prisoner in st mamas quarter if he returned it would be with the answers to these devilling questions a small warship waited at one of the commercial wharfs in st mamas quarter haraldr was actually greeted by the kentarchos the captain of the ship a wiry man of about thirty who wore a bright brass breastplate embossed with a lion the kentarchos told haraldr he could roam the deck freely haraldr studied the great throwing engines with the bewildering complexes of gears ropes pulleys and windlasses then went to the bow and examined the ornate bronze spout shaped like a bellowing lion that could belch forth the terrifying flames he would not have believed in had he not already seen their devastating effect the warship passed the enormous harbour boom and the foreboding grey tower and skirted the tip of the finger of land that thrust the great city into the sea in ancient times haraldr had learned this entire peninsula had been called byzantium the sun parted the slatecoloured base of the roiling cotton clouds projecting a broad shaft over the eastern prow of the city and haraldr once again gaped at the thrilling panoply of glistening domes the ship docked at a wharf next to a large blocky gatehouse projecting from the towering seawall soldiers armoured like the topoteretes and clearly under his command joined haraldrs escort and led him up wide marble steps to a series of grassandivycovered terraces lined with stone statues some of them as startlingly lifelike as the ones haraldr had seen in the city but others standing stiffly at attention arms at their sides as he walked among the stone figures haraldr noticed that their eyes had a strange life force as if they were filled with visions of distant realms and other times times before there were men and only gods inhabited the earth for how many aeons had men preceded him up these steps beneath this stony scrutiny the terraces climbed to the imperial city within the empress city haraldr had seen the palaces from a distance and yet then they had seemed a miniature world too fantastic to be real like looking into a knothole and finding a splendid city inhabited by elves now this world surrounded him in its dazzling actuality the rows of carnation and sulphurcoloured marble pillars towering above him like gleaming stone forests the spray from the fountains turning into crystal fragments that melted against his face he wondered at an enormous golden building made of domes fanning out like the petals of a flower cyanblue ponds teeming with darting orange fish marble cypresses carved into foliate traceries so delicate that it seemed they would crumble in the breeze in the distance shimmered a vast silver dome huge enough to swallow a dhromon chalkwhite avenues fanned out in the sun swarming with eunuchs in silk soldiers in armour and occasional groups of ladies who seemed to float along in the coraltinted shade of endless porticoes the escort steered haraldr sharply right in front of a massive shellcoloured building khazar bowmen stood at attention within a towering portico haraldr and the topoteretes were admitted through the massive silver doors they crossed a marble hall busy with scurrying sumptuously dressed eunuchs then wound through a jadecolumned portico a courtyard with gurgling fountains and halls decorated with endless ochre and gold mosaics depicting scenes of battle half a dozen times they had their passes inspected by guards posted at each entrance to a new room or passageway finally they halted in front of a cottagesized vaultlike structure made of porphyry marble as deeply purple as a ripe plum two varangians in their golden armour stepped from a door at the side of the vault and looked at the passes the topoteretes nodded and stepped aside while the varangians came round haraldrs back haraldr hated the fear that crawled up his spine had he not resolved to remove all speculation from his mind and leave his questions to odin and kristr and yet how else could he feel at this moment sir please accompany us said one of the varangians in swedishaccented norse the menace thawed slightly and haraldr stepped into a lurid purple chamber half a dozen armoured varangians stood rigidly at attention a single varangian faced them his huge back to haraldr the golden broadaxe crossed over his chest glimmered as he turned haraldr resisted the swoon yes he had been prepared for this encounter but now face to face with mar hunrodarson he wanted to fall to his knees and toss the fear from his surging stomach mar stepped forward the axe moving in his hands and haraldr heard the rustle of the ravens wings but mar merely passed the axe to the varangian flanking haraldr on his left he extended his hands in greeting haraldr nordbrikt he said without even the ominous emphasis on the last name that haraldr would have expected then mar grabbed haraldrs arm and drew him close haraldr could not mask the terror in his eyes before you go in listen mar whispered i have heard of a plot against you if you have been threatened i must know of it mar paused and drew haraldr into his insane glacial eyes the rest of the hetairarchs face was utterly void of meaning or inflection as if he were a walking corpse that had lost its spirit but not the heat that still flushed its cheeks haraldr remembered that he had been fooled once by that face you wear doubt like a battle standard mar continued but you have nothing to fear unless you challenge me i would use your secret as a shield for myself not a sword against you look my plan will benefit us both we are both norsemen mar stepped away as two eunuchs entered the chamber through a rear door the taller and elder of the two was a palebrowed but firmfleshed man who wore creamhued silk so heavy yet so finely woven that it seemed like a metal foil the other man similarly splendid held an ivory baton with a golden dragon atop it this eunuch was short with a receding jaw marked with a large dimpled scar just below the corner of his mouth the whitehaired eunuch reached out and fingered the heavy blue fabric of haraldrs new tunic of the finest hellas silk he nodded and the eunuch with the scarred jaw spoke in norse haraldr nordbrikt i am the grand interpreter of the varangians the honoured dignitary assisting me in preparing you for your audience is the imperial high chamberlain listen carefully to your instructions you will enter and prostrate yourself three times at the command keleusate you will be invited to stand your father may wish to examine you should you be questioned the high chamberlain will nod if you are permitted to answer you may look upon the face of the autocrator but be certain that your expression is one of reverence humility and gratefulness when the interview is concluded your father will bless you with the sign of the cross you will immediately withdraw arms crossed over your breast from the presence of the pantocrators hand on earth haraldrs blood drained by fear almost audibly roared back into his veins he had expected he might be displayed to the emperor again and perhaps receive yet another warning from this curiously godlike puppet of a norseman and a monk yet to speak with him haraldr could look this man in the eyes weigh the timbre of his voice and in every way discern if he was a man to command all men or a mere illusion perhaps haraldr had seen nothing in the inscrutable face of mar hunrodarson but now the veils of roman power would be stripped aside he would see into the heart of the roman dragon the two eunuchs preceded haraldr through an antechamber with a goldcoffered roof mar his axe upon his chest followed at haraldrs back four varangians stepped aside while two whiterobed eunuchs parted the silver doors after the ritual prostrations were completed haraldr stood and steadied himself above him soared a vast celestial blue dome speckled with golden stars but the area in which he stood was a small one cordoned off with heavy scarlet brocade curtains the emperor seated in a jewelled gold throne was flanked by several standing whiterobed eunuchs he was aflame in scarlet silk medallioned with gold eagles but he wore no crown upon his head haraldr noticed out of the corner of his eye a man in monks garb for some reason this figure was the only person of the eight or so in the room who was seated in the presence of the emperor haraldr reminded himself that he was of royal lineage and that this emperor was not he breathed deeply and forced his eyes to search the face of the man who sat no more than three ells from him his hands trembled but he locked his gaze upon the sablehued irises within seconds he knew that everything he had assumed about this emperor was wrong he was no god certainly but a handsome man of perhaps two score years with a bold sharp nose noble high forehead and long greyflecked dark curls but he was also just as clearly a man above all men his entire carriage as he sat bespoke stature and confidence his redbooted feet flat upon the floor his shoulders square and chest erect his hands set in his lap with the fingertips lightly touching haraldr had grown up in royal courts and he knew the importance of a kings sheer physical presence in maintaining the respect and fealty of his subjects but he knew just as well that this mysterious aura of command was not as simple as donning silk robes or projecting a fine masculine swagger it was something in the eyes an intangible yet undeniable quality that left no question of a mans mastery of both himself and those around him haraldr had seen this look before and he had learned to discern men who pretended to have it and did not and what he saw in this emperors black chasmdeep eyes was all he needed to know they were somehow infinitely sorrowful yet terrifyingly obdurate the shafts to some unshakeable resolve this emperor was no puppet even a man like mar would be but a toy to him the emperor spoke several sentences in an even deep yet natural voice that did not turgidly solicit respect as did the exhortations of so many weak leaders but simply projected keenness and innate authority the grand interpreter translated maintaining much of the emperors original inflection your father greets you haraldr nordbrikt and applauds your resourcefulness in dealing with the plague of saracen pirates who have disrupted our maritime commerce there were some who did not welcome you when you first came to our environs but his imperial majesty has seen to it that your enemies now respect you as a true soldier of christ your father asks if you are now willing to perform a task that will more directly serve his holy person haraldr was almost euphoric in his desire to serve this magnificent man and yet another region of his mind screamed with confusion he had burned the body of asbjorn ingvarson only yesterday had these enemies been chained in hours and even so the young swedes soul pleaded for revenge he again saw the monk at the corner of his vision and thought of mar at his back it was likely that asbjorns murderer was no more than two steps away haraldr noticed that the high chamberlain was nodding at him he broomed his mind by drawing in his breath then gave his tongue to odin your imperial majesty and chosen hand of kristr though it is my most passionate desire to serve you in any way i can your invitation assumes more honour than i am now worthy of two nights ago one of the men pledged to my keeping and guidance was slain in a cowardly and villainous manner until i avenge this murder i am soiled by a disgrace that renders me unfit to serve a sovereign so glorious as the emperor of the romans after the translation the emperor stared intently at haraldr it was everything haraldr could do to keep from flinching before that lancing gaze then the emperor looked up at the eunuch nearest to him haraldr recognized this man as the aged sadeyed eunuch who had spoken to him at his first audience who bent to the emperors ear and began a whispered discussion that lasted perhaps a minute the elderly eunuch disappeared through the red curtains behind him while the emperor studied haraldr in almost total silence the seated monk seemed to have difficulty breathing and wheezed slightly haraldr also noticed that the seated monks robe was rough brown burlap hadnt joannes worn fine black wool the eunuch reemerged and whispered to the emperor who nodded and immediately addressed haraldr his imperial majesty is pleased to tell you that even now the assassin is being interrogated he has confessed to everything you will be able to see the perpetrator when you leave his majestys presence will this satisfy the admirable requisites of your honour haraldr could scarcely believe his ears he cast his eyes quickly in the direction of the monk kristr he was almost certain that the seated monk was not the joannes he had seen this monk was much smaller with a crown of short hair could joannes possibly be this perpetrator now in custody that was too unlikely given the monks evident power not even this emperors justice would be so implacable but clearly haraldrs enemy had been identified and dealt with and he would soon know him the imperial chamberlain nodded again and haraldr gushed praise your imperial majestys pursuit of justice as swift as the flight of an arrow makes me all the more eager in my desire to dedicate to you my arm my allegiance and my life and the lives and allegiances of the five hundred men i have pledged to lead to glory in the service of the emperor of the romans haraldrs skin tingled with conviction he meant these words with all his suddenly unburdened heart haraldr raptly watched the emperor reply he thrilled at the eloquence of his majestys speech and imagined himself walking beside him in stately procession and yet some tiny parcel of haraldrs intellect saw something else even as the rest of his consciousness floated on this dream what was it something about the emperor the shape of his cheeks his lips where had he seen these features before but the memory was too fleeting his majesty delights to command an arm so strong and yet so obedient his faith in you is boundless so he offers you a task that might have exhausted heracles and yet he is assured you can perform it the grand interpreter went on to describe the pilgrimage to jerusalem an entire regiment of the imperial army would accompany the empress and her ladies but haraldr and his men would comprise the empresss personal bodyguard it was an honour second only to guarding the person of the emperor himself haraldr quickly and ardently accepted and the emperor rewarded him with an intoxicating perfect smile the emperor began another address and haraldr was again transported with devotion but the emperor blinked in midsentence stopped and tipped his head slightly towards the seated monk the commotion was immediate the high chamberlain glared at haraldr and made an entirely indecorous whisking motion haraldr sensed mar still at his back spring forward the crushing grip stung his arm and then haraldr spun his heart now cold lead slammed against his ribs no the ultimate ruse mars grip vanished and haraldr stood outside drawn curtains that seemed to shrink around the emperor and his party like a crimson silk cocoon the grand interpreter was beside him he yanked haraldrs arm and frantically urged him into the guardhouse behind him haraldr heard a rustle of brocade calm whispers and painful gagging as if someone had got a bone lodged in his throat haraldrs mind raced had someone become ill had someone perhaps even joannes sent an assassin to avenge himself on the emperor just when he had thought he knew the heart of the roman dragon this what was happening mar still inside the curtains watched with disgust the twitching figure on the floor before him he reflected that this spectacle was becoming enticingly common but the emperors disclosure had caught mar by surprise had they really caught the norsemans assassin he wondered or was this perpetrator merely the usual scapegoat to be sacrificed to the absurd notion of roman justice haraldr scarcely noticed the clicking feet around him the topoteretes one of the eunuchs who had attended the emperor and the blackfrock interpreter had taken him completely across the palace grounds past even the huge silverdomed cathedral now he looked up at the sheer round tower that brooded over the entrance to the harbour a doleful stone shadow against the shimmering harbour beyond his mind was a tempest of suspicions and fears the entrance to the sinister turret was a steel door set into grim cinereous granite the topoteretes spoke to haraldr for once john the frogfaced interpreter seemed eager to translate do you know this place haraldr shook his head the tower was a giant crypt it even smelled of death it is called neorion tower pray to your god that you are never invited to stay the night here unseen machinery seemed to crank the steel door open gloom wet and decay seeped into the sunlight as the shadows engulfed him haraldr felt that he was entering the dark world of spirits two dozen khazar guards armed with swords stood watch in a perfectly barren room that seemed even darker because of the flickering lamps that could only establish dirty brown penumbrae in the foul pall a roman officer approached and inspected passes machinery clanked again stairs fell from the ceiling the topoteretes led haraldr and john up the wooden steps and into a narrow sooty shaft encasing stone stairs that spiralled endlessly up oillamps in the form of wolves sputtered greasily at intervals dark steel doors waited next to narrow stone landings haraldr could only observe all of this with nightmare acuity like a man in a dream his fate was no longer subject to reason or even speculation it was as if the ascent were actually a journey deep into the underworld what demons awaited the topoteretes rapped on steel and an almost obscured grate slid aside the entire door wrenched open at once haraldr smelled the carrion the ravens would take from this place and his weary stomach heaved he coughed to disguise his retching they followed a guard down a long corridor the dingy walls seemed to radiate cold as if they were not blocks of stone but dirty ice the darkness and the smell of death and spoil and new blood were suffocating the walls closed like black jaws a grimy steel door groaned like the dead and took them in lights flickered enormous steel double doors faced haraldr across what seemed to be the antechamber to a fairsized hall a man was seated at a small table to haraldrs right his massive dark shoulders hunched over as he studied papers by the light of a table lamp haraldr knew the man and his own fate as soon as the monks huge head lifted to confront him joannes joanness eyes were hot charcoal bits with a faint nimbus of red what seemed a flat statement rumbled from the tomb of his breast you know him said the interpreter haraldr looked directly at joannes and nodded the monks voice pounded again do you know this seal haraldr was startled the monks curiously flattened fingertip pushed a small folded document addressed with a few lines of greek across the tabletop the attached lead seal was intact haraldr leaned forward feeling as if he were coming too close to a dangerous wild beast he recognized the tiny sword arm at once it was identical to the wax fragment he had studied a thousand times the complete figure was a man armoured like the typical roman military officer yes haraldr answered grimly i think it belongs to the murderer and then he asked joannes silently are you the murderer if you are before i die and take you with me to the spirit world i must barter for the lives of my pledgemen joannes glanced once at a paper before him the document was covered with dozens of lengthy roman numbers and haphazard lines of greek writing he settled back in his chair and looked at haraldr carefully haraldr was aware of a faint sound almost like a spirit moaning from the depths his nerves were shards the monk spoke you were the victim of a plot the late manglavite had a criminal associate a middleranking roman military officer in the palace this associate deprived of his nefarious income by the death of the manglavite sought revenge against you and carried out his plot with professional stealth haraldr nodded and relief began to fill him like a warm draught this was more than plausible he and halldor and ulfr had perhaps been overly impressed with their importance among these romans they had not considered that hakon would have had friends coconspirators at court lesser men who might have acted entirely without the knowledge of mar or joannes but the monk now telling him this had a face no man could trust the murderer has already reaped the whirlwind of your fathers implacable justice do you wish to see the vengeance god grants the emperor of the romans the huge steel doors at the back of the antechamber slid open and two men brought out a canvasshrouded parcel on a pallet the intestinal stench engulfed haraldr like the breath of a howling carnivore the pallet was set down and the shroud pulled away the lump of gristle bowels glistening organs and stacked appendages was surmounted by a helmet of flayed featureless viscera incredibly the teeth still chattered yes this lives for a moment still you may finish him or leave him to contemplate further the immutable virtue and implacable will of roman justice haraldr turned away from the horrifying bundle if this was the murderer then the soul of asbjorn ingvarson had been avenged in kind joannes spoke at length then watched haraldr keenly during the translation i understand that you saw our father this very hour let me explain to you what occurred to put your mind at ease his imperial majesty enjoys the company of holy men like myself some of whom are given unlike myself to convulsive visions that yield extraordinary prophecies it was discerned by his imperial majesty that the monk you saw during your interview was about to experience one of these transports and he did not want to trouble you with the monks outburst for many things are said that would summon demons if they were heard by ears innocent of the knowledge to resist them the interpreter paused and conversed with joannes apparently to straighten out something the monk had said and then continued the translation nordbrikt i am aware that you have recently been exposed to the fantasies of naked chorusgirls and sotted actors and perhaps you have mistaken these shameless libels as some accurate representation of my humble role in the vast scheme of roman power you must understand now that you and i merely serve the same master i am friend of all who truly love the emperor unrelenting foe of those who would try to deceive or harm him after this translation joannes began again and haraldr focused on the face of the giant monk true the monk seemed to be the living face of evil and yet when joannes spoke of the emperor the passion in his countenance had transformed it the love that had radiated from that monstrous visage was too fierce as fierce in its way as the rage to have been feigned haraldr could trust nothing about this monk except that joannes truly loved the emperor whom he served and perhaps that was a common turf on which they could meet the translation began again you have been successful here nordbrikt and yet you have held your arms out to death more times than is prudent even for a man who apparently sits in fortunes lap you are of no use to anyone if you continue to use your life as the vane to detect the direction of the winds of roman power you are a seafaring man of some renown now and you would not go into strange waters without a pilot just so you need a guide to plot your course through the shoals of our roman system you need a patron who can see that opportunities not deadly obstacles are placed in your path again the interpreter paused for clarification then quickly resumed the translation i would like to sponsor you not formally certainly neither of us will have occasion to recall this conversation to others but when your course needs proper steering i will be there haraldr soberly considered the monks words olaf had once told him that the best tutor in games of power was the man other men feared and avoided not the man who nightly drew the skalds to flatter him and heap him with praise but a powerful instinct warned him that this monks lessons might well be fatal still the faith they shared in one man was enough to tip the scales and what would he gain by refusing i share your devotion to our father said haraldr searching for the correct tone with the romans it was obvious one always had to speak as artificially and obsequiously as a skald i believe your offer to be the most generous gift i have received here even more generous than the gift given me by the saracen pirates i recently met i am grateful and in need of any assistance your offices might provide as his response was translated and joannes replied in greek haraldr studied the monks distorted features and remembered his fleeting perceptions in the presence of the emperor strange he thought and unlikely but it would explain much he abandoned the notion when the norse translation began good i have a letter for you bearing my seal it contains no threats or warnings it is rather an introduction to my brother the strategus that means the military governor of antioch a city you will pass through on your holy mission to jerusalem i want you to be known to my brother and he to you i also have a nephew there about your age though he sadly lacks your ambition perhaps he could learn from you joannes reviewed his own concerns during the translation the assassin had died before he had revealed the truth joannes was certain of that he looked again at the seal he had shown the hapless nordbrikt the grand domestic bardas dalassena was just arrogant and stupid enough to have put his personal seal on such a crude enterprise yes this would have been his fashion but the indisputable fact was that the by now demonracing assassin had named the grand domestic far too early in the interrogation and had lingered far too painfully while insisting that he was telling the truth someone else was using the grand domestic to screen his own intentions but who surely the hetairarch mar hunrodarson did not know that joannes had already moved to preempt the hetairarchs proposed expansion of the varangian guard joannes refused to consider further the myriad possibilities he tried to look composed as the obviously befuddled varangian nordbrikt was led away he chided himself for the time wasted on this inconsequential project varangians even the hetairarch were hardly worth the effort not now not when so much else was at stake joannes lowered his head to the paperstrewn table and went home to amastris to the time when his being had split into the two persons who now so desperately struggled to achieve a single voice he felt the hot dust on his lips and lay again on his back the pain still in his testicles his arms strapped to his sagging cot so that he would not loosen the ligature michael dear little michael crawled stumbled shakily stood and gurgled beside him the infant grabbed for his brothers finger caught hold and held cooing with delight and the love entered joannes and the pain vanished back in the neorion tower watched only by a corpse without eyes the huge blackcloaked shoulders of the monk trembled with sobs michael michael dear little michael he murmured choking with grief now you are afflicted and is there nothing i can do to succour you so you are not keeping company with either of those boys as she waited for marias answer the augusta theodora sipped from a goblet fashioned of embossed gold leaf pressed between clear glass she was fond of elaborate table settings but otherwise the apartments in her country palace were almost barren the only decoration on the dull terreverte marble walls of her dining chamber was a small enamelled icon of the virgin framed in gold no maria paused for a silver forkful of fish it was a mistake they say that love is a flower that can only bloom once if it withers without bearing fruit there will never be another blossom my first man was a mistake and so all of the rest have been i wish you could forget about that darling no one blames you maria took several silent bites while theodora watched her expectantly i think you might be happier if you tried to remain chaste theodora finally said and as much as i am concerned about your journey darling i feel that this pilgrimage will be a salve to your soul allow the christ to fill your heart the patriarch has helped me to see that when we love the christ we are never without love alexius patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith had become theodoras spiritual adviser and personal friend during her exile maria ran her tongue over her teeth alexius is as determined as joannes to keep you and your sister apart my sister is determined to keep us apart she will always blame me for romanus that i refused him and she was forced to marry him i thought that it would all be buried in the same crypt as romanus but it will always be there joannes is responsible for this breach he never could stand up to the two of you together he told the emperor lies about you and the emperor repeated them to zoe you believe anything from the mouth that drinks your soul emmanuel says that the emperor has not taken that draught for some time perhaps on this pilgrimage she will have an opportunity to consider who truly loves her and who is merely using her theodora frowned like a troubled child i know how much she loves you that is really the reason it was so easy to turn her against you maria tapped her goblet with her fingernail a staccato pecking that went on for almost half a minute it is strange how thin the membrane of love is she finally said and how precariously it withstands the pollutants of the soul sometimes when i am with a man i love i feel that i can reach inside him and find only decay darling some day you will find the proper kind of love with a man give yourself time to find the christs love and then you will find a mans true love maria chattered her front teeth in minute nervous little clicks i feel that on this journey i will find a resolution i will either fill my soul or my being will completely evaporate like a dead lake but i will not be this empty cold thing any more a shell with no light inside my palmist ata told me that soon love fate and death would collide in my life i am not afraid to die because i am already dead but once before i die i would like to love a man and not feel the rot in his soul maria looked at theodora almost belligerently for a moment and then her face slowly began to contort she burst into tears iii the world was a reflection in a copper sheet the dust stirred by the horses hooves swirled up into the dust already suspended in the air like a dry chalkfine fog the approaching horses of the scouts merely added to the choking ochre cloud the scouts dark wildeyed men called akrites wore jerkins of quilted cotton over short linen tunics there were four of them silver helmets dulled to brass in the dusty pall they rode directly to the domestic of the imperial excubitores bowed in their saddles and began talking with animated gestures haraldr had difficulty with the dialect the akrites were from armenikoi a theme halfway to khoresm but he understood a saracen raiding party fairsized was just ahead it appears that the saracens have positioned themselves to block the cilician gates came the quick effortless translation haraldr pushed his helmet back wiped the grit from his forehead and smiled at gregory zigabenus the interpreter who had accompanied the rus trade fleet i understood some of that already gregory then he said in greek because you teach well he added his own silent thanks to odin and kristr for this gift of the little eunuch the assignment apparently had been by chance but the adventuresome unfailingly cheerful gregory was as welcome as a third hand in a single combat like every roman gregory was mute on the subject of the emperor and his immediate circle but otherwise he had been a continuing education in what joannes had called the shoals of the roman system and strange waters not to mention dangerous they were indeed haraldr looked down the road up which he had just ridden along with two dozen horsemen of the imperial excubitores the graded path here only wide enough to draw a wagon through wound down through the russet haze towards a dull brownishgrey plateau ringed by the slightly darker convolutions of the taurus mountains as they rose to their snowcrested heights he had never imagined so much land or so little beauty and yet the mute austerity of the terrain bespoke the power of the romans for almost six weeks at a clip that surely measured at least two and sometimes three rowingspells a day the imperial entourage had traversed territory not unlike this not as dusty certainly farther to the north the peaks were less precipitous and the pastures still held some of summers verdure but the distances the isolation on many stretches surpassed anything imaginable even on norways barren central plateau yet most remarkably just when one thought that the romans had finally run out of folk with which to populate this prodigious domain of theirs the endless road paved as neatly and much more sturdily than the floor of a jarls hall would enter the treerimmed perimeter of yet another pasture pass through the rich dark relentlessly cultivated communal fields and orchards speckled with ripe fruit and lead them to the clustered mudbrick thatchroofed huts of yet another roman village the industry of these provincial romans lost in this frightening vastness was something to behold hoeing their autumn harvest of vegetables chopping wood for winter sacking grain bundling fodder driving their massive oxen to and fro they had coaxed a bounty from a wasteland that a norse farmer wouldnt give a piece of silver the size of his fingernail for and yet as gregory had explained many of these proud busy people preferred to become rich mens slaves because of the burden of imperial taxes on free peasants the domestic wonders if you wish to go forward with them he says if you do you will see a roman ambush haraldr turned to nicon blymmedes domestic of the imperial excubitores thickchested wirylimbed about two score years old blymmedes was accompanied by two dozen mounted soldiers wearing waistlength mail shirts and conical helms with their bows and tooledleather arrow quivers slung over their backs the rest of their vanda a company of about two hundred strong were footmen who had disappeared up ahead seemingly swallowed by tortured rock and swirling dust clouds yes thank you i will said haraldr directly to the domestic he had come to like the hawknosed constantly frowning blymmedes the domestic unlike so many of these endlessly scheming romans seemed solely concerned with doing his own job properly no perfectly and seeing that his subordinates performed with similar punctiliousness yet he was eager to teach and he had accepted haraldr as a fellow warrior with perhaps a different philosophy of warfare but of considerable aptitude in martial affairs the small contingent started up the steeply climbing roadway blymmedes fell back between haraldr and gregory and began another of his tactical discourses vigorously illustrated with his leathertough hands you see i have sent my infantry up ahead blymmedes thrust both his hands forward as gregory translated and positioned them in the heights on either side of the road he pushed his hands apart to show the dispersal now we will come forward past the position of our hidden infantry we will appear to be a mere scouting party but one that offers the prize of a foolish officer of the roman imperial taghmata the saracens will see us and advance quickly to profit from my impudence prudently we will retreat the way we have come they will follow us lusty with the promise of my ransom when our pellmell retreat has lured the saracens beneath the positions held by my infantry blymmedes brought his hands together with a loud clap deal with the enemy on your terms said haraldr directly repeating one of blymmedess axioms yes said the domestic hazel eyes flashing eagerly then he shook his finger but meet the enemy the ambush does not work if you simply run away retreat alone cannot win victory gregory pretended to translate you understood i thought so the domestic i think feels that roman strategy has become too cautious under the man who commands him this is as far as he can go in criticizing the grand domestic bardas dalassena however blymmedes was now occupied ahead having taken the point of the column he signalled to his unseen forces in the hills the road continued to climb and narrow the crumbling shardstrewn rock walls rising ever more steeply they rounded a blind turn and looked up to a narrow defile backed by nothing but thin coppery sky blymmedes fell back for a moment and whispered to gregory then went boldly up ahead these are the cilician gates whispered gregory the domestic wanted you to know that alexander brought his army through this pass haraldr nodded alexander of macedon or the great alexander had been a greek king who had conquered the world to the gates of dionysus in the days before the roman empire even existed alexander sounded more like a god than a man but the domestic often referred to his tactics and courage and seemed very proud to speak the same language as this great demigod the horsemen wandered slowly into the massive jaws of the cilician gates haraldr caught a breathtaking glimpse of rugged terrain falling away to a dull green plain the saracens seemed to come out of the rocks they led their horses by the reins then saddled up deliberately as if they had enough time to pause and straighten the quills of their arrows a few bright curved blades began to flash and bows rose in disjointed arabesques against the metalled sky the domestic conspicuously displaying himself four ells in front of the rest of his horsemen held his reins deftly almost as if he were preparing to touch a womans face horses snorted but no one on either side made a sound then the nearest saracen a beetlebrown face with a coalblack beard and eyes rimmed with glaring whites raised his arms and legs like a fourwinged bird preparing to fly arrows hissed from quivers it was as if the mountains behind them had found huge metal voices even the domestic whipped his head around with astonishment then his face almost instantly purpled in that same instant the saracen leader let his limbs relax and fall he neatly wheeled his horse about and the rest of his band just as suddenly turned their rearing mounts and began to vanish into dust and rock haraldr had no idea of the specific meanings of the raging oaths the domestic began to bellow with bulgingeyed fury but a translation was hardly necessary blymmedes spurred his horse and charged back down the road the komes in charge of the vanda ordered the rest to follow the domestics curses were quickly swallowed up by the unearthly blaring pounding whistling din of the lifeless crags a short way down haraldr reined his horse around a switchback and saw the source of the sound the road was jammed with armoured horsemen and footmen as far as anyone could see the files of soldiers in mail coats and breastplates glinted through the dust like strands of silver thread as the road zigged and zagged thousands of ells down the mountain jammed in among the vanguard of this army were two dozen musicians equipped with every manner of drum horn bell and whistle one could imagine haraldr knew immediately what he beheld ever since they had crossed the bosporus into asia the citizenarmy of each provincial theme had as soon as the imperial caravan had entered their territory joined the imperial taghmata to guard their empress and her holy pilgrims but the meeting places had always been carefully appointed this was a curious breach of protocol and military discipline the domestics livid face was inches from the rather puffy even somewhat indolent features of a man mounted on a huge white horse the horses trotted in quartercircles as blymmedes bellowed furiously the other man simply sat higher in the saddle like a traveller trying to ignore a troublesome dog finally blymmedes abruptly ended his diatribe shook his head like a tutor puzzled by a witless student and motioned with his hands as if he were attempting to push the entire thematic army down the mountain the other man ignored this signal and rode past the domestic stopping just in front of the excubitores haraldr was close enough to detect the perfumed fragrance that surrounded both rider and horse the man was groomed like a courtier his brown beard immaculately trimmed the beautifully chased dragons on his gold breastplate still bright beneath a thin layer of dust even his horses bridle was brightly enamelled his indigo eyes which despite the slackness of his face had a command to them swept over the excubitores gregory and haraldr with no acknowledgement whatsoever that they were separate individuals but as if collectively they represented a single large deposit of donkey excrement to be avoided on his upward journey then he turned spurred back to his waiting army and shouted a command in a brisk imperious voice with the same musical cacophony that had heralded its arrival the thematic army turned and began to lumber back down the mountain blymmedes rode back to his men shaking his head next lesson he shouted to haraldr i teach you how to keep the thematic army from scaring off your quarry when youve already got their heads in your game bag who was that man asked haraldr the domestics eyes flared again that eminent tactician was meletius attalietes strategus of the cilician theme and the first son of the senator and magister nicon attalietes you see mistress interruption of the effluent phlegms that produce these desires is the reverse of the procedures that stimulate the sexual inclination one must simply manipulate the organs with careful consideration of vortices that regulate the discharge of the vital humours mother of god willing we have every reason to assume that you will be relieved of your grievous and insolent inflammation before the hour of compline the empress of the romans zoe the purpleborn ordered her face towelled by whiterobed leo her eunuch vestitore and considered for a moment the advice of this new specialist in the treatment of sexual disorders the deathly pale longfaced eunuch physician who always seemed to perspire above his upper lip was in countenance alone dour enough to dissipate the carnal appetite but as for his procedures zoe seriously had to consider that perhaps she had exhausted the knowledge of these learned charlatans what good had the specialists done to facilitate marital relations with her late husband romanus the endless applications of aphrodisiac ointments prescribed by these experts had done nothing to restore virility to the senescent manhood of a whitehaired windbag and now that she herself required the reverse procedure due to her present husbands persistent neglect of his marital obligations their success seemed equally unlikely michael no she would not think of him any longer the disappointment was too acid maria asked zoe what do you think of this physicians ambitious promulgations in your experience is desire physical something that can be manipulated by pressure on the offending internal organs or is it rather spiritual and therefore beyond the probing fingers of our learned specialists maria puckered her brow cracking the dried cosmetic paste the empress had applied all over her face she sat on a gilt camp stool set in front of the empresss portable magyar steam bath only zoes flushed face was visible at the top of the round leather cabinet that enclosed the imperial body i am certain that it is both of the two components of desire the physical is easier to assuage the spiritual element of desire however can lead one to overcome even a physical repulsion and enjoy the love of a man who is fair neither in limb nor in countenance she idly dipped her finger in the silver bowl of rose water set on the cabinet beside her chair i have never loved both the spiritual and physical aspects of the same man at least not at the same time who knows perhaps that is an explosive combination of elements like the ingredients of liquid fire it would incinerate the soul but i have never met a man who having aroused my body was sad enough to arouse my spirit how interesting little daughter zoe reclined her head towards the crimson silk canopy of the bathing pavilion the lamps had already been lit the sun had just vanished behind the peaks of the taurus do you realize that you have lately come to speak of your amorous pastimes with the most curious melancholy i advised no implored you to bring some sort of diversion with you to prevent just this sort of malaise and this ceaseless wandering in the wilderness would have taxed the virtuous patience of moses the chosen of god it is the vastness of asia that afflicts the mind with such lassitude and apprehension i felt this emptiness before we even departed the empress city oh well little daughter you certainly must know that the brighter the flame of passion the more rapidly the fuel of desire is consumed your problem is that you stoke the flames too quickly and awaken in the middle of the night to find that your bed is cold zoe relaxed as the steam dissipated the road weariness in her back michael she could not elude him he was the heat that still fevered her nights if only joannes had not quenched michael with lies about romanus not lies you watched as they held his head under he came up once gasping eyes bright zoe felt an internal cold the jeopardy of her immortal soul as the memory flew by her like a dark comet but they were lies in the context of her love for michael and her people even joannes had known that joannes to have had the man who seared her soul wrenched from her scorching grasp by the malignancy she found repellent beyond all else joannes he is the one who has banished me to this life of saintly contemplation so contemplate i will though of matters saintly it will not be mistress asked maria is my own melancholy infectious i was thinking said zoe with a frown that indicated she was still thinking the tauroscythian the homes of my own personal varangian guard haraldr something i think they all have the same family name all probably having had the same father anyway he of pirateslaying fame zoes voice was almost chilling in its deliberation we have so rudely neglected him shut up in here with our tittering little birds like anna and that dreadful hellenist bent on ransacking the library at antioch maria looked down at the thick blue carpet she had not dreamt of the tauroscythian harbinger of death since they had left the empress city and peering out at him several times a day through the curtains of the imperial carriage she had come to see him as simply another oversize barbaroi curiosity but to look in his deathfilled eyes again she realised that she had seen the doom in his icy irises even that night at nicephorus argyruss for a fleeting moment she wanted that tragedy deep inside her and her womb stirred but this man would not be a harmless pet like giorgios he was a murdering savage from thule she had lied to her aunt theodora out here in this barren postapocalyptic vastness she realised she was afraid of death and always had been her entire life had been driven by her fear of deaths ineluctable darkness is it wise she asked are we not convinced that he is an informer for joannes symeon assures me that he is said zoe with bland indifference she needed no further proof her chamberlain symeon a vestitore to her uncle basil the bulgarslayer for decades had so many ears in the palace precincts that he would know if a mouse squeaked in the triclinium a largely unused ceremonial pavilion late at night he says that joannes himself sponsored the tauroscythians under this haraldr in the sacrum consistorum and later this haraldr met joannes alone at neorion maria crossed herself quickly at the mention of the gruesome tower then we have been laudably prudent in excluding him from your presence so far why would we now wish to invite this snake into our gilt cage zoe arched her perspirationslickened eyebrows except for symeon and theodore and leo and you darling i am surrounded by joanness spies as a fishmonger in his booth is by his stinking fish besides i am not suggesting that we uncover our metaphoric bosoms to this cyclopean menace haraldr whatever or even our physical breasts its simply that there is a primitivism a vigour to his race that i find enchanting we will converse with him beckon him to share drink with us perhaps and encourage him to speak to us of his perpetually frozen homeland here zoe smiled maliciously and any other matters we may find to our interest maria offered her own bewitching smile for the first time since the morning sun had glared over the snowcaps of the taurus zoe she reminded herself had been basil the bulgarslayers favourite niece and while zoes father had been a blathering sophist with the sole ambition of totally depleting within the providentially brief three years of his reign the bulging treasuries his older brother had won in a glorious half century of relentless conquest zoe had been the heiress to the bulgarslayers strength and wiles yes this evening would be amusing after all she and her beloved empress would give joanness tauroscythian busybody all the information he could stuff within his thick skull youre certain it is the empress herself you are to see and not symeon that halldor was about to make some satirical reference to the empresss prize geld he caught himself out of deference to gregory who had just entered haraldrs tent symeon brought me the message himself signed in purple ink just like the emperors missives haraldr looked over at gregory who had put on a white silk robe that swallowed him up as if he were a boy in a mans tunic you appear more nervous now than when we faced four times our number in saracen brigands this afternoon my friend dont tell me your fearless breast is quavering gregory was indeed nervous he hardly smiled at haraldrs attempt to lighten his burden blessed though the holy mother and father of the romans indisputably were it simply was not safe to come too close to them as he began his career in the imperial administration gregory had never imagined he would have reason for that concern and was more than happy to think that his viewings of their imperial majesties would be from no greater proximity than those permitted the rabble of the empress city now to think of entering an imperial pavilion and may christ grant him absolution for thinking so especially that of her imperial majesty who could quite clearly eliminate anyone who gave her offence even an emperor and autocrator no he cautioned himself it was too irreverent as well as profoundly unsettling even to think such things there is an ancient greek story i have not told you of haraldr nordbrikt gregory said weakly about a man named daedalus who built wings of wax for himself and his son the boy flew too close to the sun and perished well said haraldr i dont think my problem on this journey has been one of overexposure to the imperial sun haraldr shook his head in bewilderment he had quickly learned that an assignment to guard the person of the empress actually meant guarding the swarm of eunuchs who in fact guarded the person of the empress these pale drones who on this journey had probably not trodden with their silk slippers more than two ells of their empires vast expanse of naked earth became angry hornets defending their nest when even the homes of her majestys special imperial guard approached the imperial carriage and pavilions gregory had insisted to haraldr that these imperious functionaries were versed in a combat at which he was illequipped to best them so haraldr had observed the curious protocols and had been rewarded with an occasional sighting of blurred crimson silk as her imperial majesty was escorted from her brightly gilt carriage into the scarlet pavilion that the advance party had waiting for her every evening and maria he was certain she was among the ladies who occupied the four curtained carriages perhaps she even rode in her imperial majestys carriage a eunuch had whispered her name in one of the endless flustered handwringing deliberations over protocol maria haraldr could not describe the agitation that had seized him just to hear the name was she waiting with her mistress now how could he keep his face from colouring like a maidens when he finally saw her no he must not think of her he was here to serve the emperor i am certain this will be a brief interview said haraldr as he gave his hair a final combing a servant held a mirror above his silver washbasin just as one is not permitted in the presence of the emperor and autocrator for any length of time the eunuchs met haraldr and gregory just inside the encirclement of one hundred and fifty varangians that secured the complex of her imperial majestys domed brocade pavilions anyone who came within an axe shaft of this human barricade without plainly declaring a password that was changed each evening would have his skull instantly split the ritual the eunuchs explained to haraldr was identical to that for his audience with the emperor but with a surprising exception her imperial majesty the wizened symeon had unctuously droned expects you to reply without prompting from her chamberlain the entrance to the main imperial pavilion was curtained with brocade so thick that it seemed to be made of lead the sound of some sort of stringed instrument much more elegant and melodious than anything haraldr had heard at the court of yaroslav sweetened an atmosphere already rich with the scent of fresh roses walls of heavy brocade divided the pavilion into separate spacious rooms with gauzy canopies overhead haraldr and gregory were led through two fabric antechambers before they were finally thrust to their faces in the thick nap of a carpet that smelled of myrrh a eunuch guided haraldr to a couch covered in glasssmooth silk cushions thick with down seemed to swallow him up producing a disorienting weightless feeling the lamps flickered he dared not look directly at either woman but he already knew his heart pounded his ribs with huge hollow thumps and he was certain his voice would quaver this was worse than any battle helpless sinking he gave himself up to the god who had suffered unspeakable torment to give men the beauty of verse let this torture make him as eloquent in the face of her beauty maria the voice was throaty almost mesmerizing flowing forth like a thick fragrant syrup haraldr could only distantly observe that it was not maria who spoke your mother the empress greets you and thanks you for the assurance your offices have given her on this most arduous yet joyous pilgrimage gregory seated to haraldrs left translated with considerable fortitude haraldr forced himself to concentrate when the translation was finished haraldr knew he should look upon the empress kristr which of the two was lovelier the empress was like a living statue a beauty so ideal that it could exist only in the imagination or upon the face next to her in fact they looked almost as alike as sisters the same pearllaced coils framing the same exquisitely contoured slightly rouged cheeks the glistening deftly sculpted lips but the eyes of the empress were ashtinted with a sorrow that showed even in the surrounding flesh in minute creases that shadowed the corners of her eyes marias eyes almost amethyst in this light challenged him they were as hard as the gem they resembled it was as if she knew of the liberties he had taken with her in his fantasies he was shamed a boy confronted by his secret love the empress said something to maria about gold or golden and hair and haraldrs wealth it was an aside that gregory was not invited to translate marias gemstone eyes remained obdurate fixed on a point somewhere to haraldrs left and considerably behind him the empress laughed showing perfect small teeth for the first time haraldr registered that her coiled tresses were as stunningly golden as marias were ravenblack an uneasy silence followed the empress looked at haraldr steadily forcing him to lower his eyes his head buzzed with tension was this acute coyness his fantasy lovers fashion hadnt maria haunted him with her eyes on their previous meeting hadnt she hoped to see his fair hair again oh no what a fool he suddenly realized in the pit of his stomach that declaration had only been manufactured by mar to his purpose maria spoke an aside to the empress her tone like a knifes blade tongue and oxen something to the effect that one should not expect a beast set to the plough to regale one with wit haraldr felt as if hot irons had been placed to the backs of his ears he knew his forehead visibly flamed why would not odin release his tongue the weight on his chest was crushing the empress spoke again and gregory translated the lady maria says she has dined with you on a previous occasion and that your tongue was shall we say charmingly audacious it would distress your mother so to think that the honours and wealth you have won since then have made you reticent among us marias lips flickered with the barest discernible taunt haraldr wondered if his chest would explode with excitement she remembered him her demeanour now was the ruse haraldr closed his eyes as an ancient wind swept his mind odin was ready to speak forgive my insolent silence my blessed mother i can only say that since coming among the romans i have seen many wonders that have brought comment spontaneously to my tongue your imperial majesty is the first such wonder to deprive me entirely of the faculty for speech the empresss winered lips parted and her pearl teeth sparkled in a display of glee she sat up and pulled her arms about her knees her long elegant white fingers stroked the raised goldeneagle medallions on her silk robe maria shifted to place her elbow on a thick maroon cushion she cast her eyes down zoe signalled with the merest nod and a whiterobed eunuch passed among the couches with silver goblets on a silver tray the wine was strong and aromatic and seemed to change flavours in haraldrs mouth ending its passage with a faint sweetness that dissolved on his tongue a drink for the gods he thought he was seduced by the heady vapours and the down and silk that wrapped him up what place in thule do you come from haraldr zoe successfully feigned interest in her own question norway zoe nodded norway and before you earned honour among the romans what were you haraldr was instantly cold but almost as quickly he realised that the empress was asking one question only to get to another i was a land man at the court of the great prince yaroslav marias laugh was as harsh as breaking glass she spoke several sentences to zoe haraldr made out the word servant three times he was thought a servants servant apparently the romans were not impressed with the great prince and certainly not with his former toll collector the blood pounded in haraldrs ears more wine was served zoe spoke between sips i have heard such tales of you tauroscythians is it true that one man may have many wives haraldr flushed with wine and embarrassment he tried to shift his body but the downy cushioning gave way trapping him as if he were struggling in a spiders web not for those who believe in krischrist pagans perhaps zoes eyes bored away with insistent insincerity yes i have seen some of you who wear amulets dedicated to a heathen god he is a bull haraldr was confused for a moment then he understood many norse pagans wore the hammer of thor while the greek word for bull was the similarsounding tauros he explained to the empress zoe tired of these preliminaries she lowered her voice to a gentle growl so i have heard that followers of this thorgod will take a woman and have intercourse with her before an entire multitude a man will spread his harlots haunches atop him even as he sits playing dice with his friends haraldrs face was singed with embarrassment was the empress testing his modesty then he remembered the scene in the play how she had rolled on the floor with her lover and hakon had called her a bitchwhore maria again directed an aside to zoe haraldr could tell she made an obscene jibe he did not know many of the words except donkey he looked sharply at maria who was she but a presumptuous ladyinwaiting while he was rightful king of norway odin filled his throat with a fatetempting voice hadnt the empress asked for audacity i am certain your imperial majesty that were a roman to observe our lovemaking he would not find it different from the habits he is accustomed to unless of course his own practices were as curious as those you have described zoe looked slyly at maria whose cheeks became slightly tinted the barbaros had a certain deftness zoe observed to herself by making his hypothetical roman a man he had avoided a direct aspersion to the imperial dignity in the manner one should treat a lover found more skilled than one had expected it was time to lead this haraldr on to more intriguing postures maria says you are a harbinger of our destruction i have often wondered why so many of my children have an inordinate fear of you fairhairs of course your role in casting us into the abyss has long been chronicled in the life of st andrew the fool and in our time this sagacious oracle seems to be present at every meeting of the sacrum consistorum though god accepted the saints worthy soul half a millennium ago however since you are of the fairhaired race and st andrew was not might we know if you are an agent of such sabotage haraldrs heart seemed to constrict involuntarily at this line of questioning but he was certain that his identity was not what the empress wanted to know what was she getting at he cautioned himself that this imperial beauty was a thorngirt rose her question had ridiculed both him and maria and apparently also disparaged the policies of imperial officials all to an end that was no more discernible than a headland lost in a fog answer soberly haraldr instructed himself you have permitted yourself enough recklessness for the evening it is true if the empire of the romans turned against my father the emperor and my empress mother i would be the agent of the romans destruction maria spoke to zoe waving her hand dismissively haraldr recognized the words serpent and flatterer haraldr felt as if she had physically slapped him his bed and his heart would be empty tonight it saddened him to think that his fantasy love had been inspired by such an astringent reality zoe sipped with both hands on her goblet as if she were a priest consuming the blood of christ i understand that you have made yourself most favourably known to my husbands brother zoes voice was devoid of inflection neither innocent nor accusing haraldr made no attempt to conceal the shock of realization of course the mouth the eyes one face a grotesque inflation of the other and yet brothers that was why the emperor had appeared to be a mere puppet of joannes more likely his imperial majesty who lacked none of the aptitudes for leadership simply valued the advice of his older brother it explained so much the orphanotrophus joannes prompted zoe dismayed by the barbaross crude disingenuousness in attempting to conceal the liaison surely he was more skilled than this yes joannes said haraldr recovering he had suggested i not boast of the honour he has paid me yes he indeed offers me the inestimable gift of his guidance but of course our orphanotrophus guides all of our earthly fortunes much as christ the pantocrator guides our immortal souls he has the hands to mould whatever he will with the clay of our beings maria spoke sharply something about hands too big and statues lacking in grace haraldr would remember to ask gregory later then he was chilled to the core despite the swaddling warmth of the down cushions kristr maria hated joannes there had been no doubt of her enmity that night at nicephorus argyruss could the empress share this animosity had there not been a strange timbre to her voice when she had spoken of him cold stormy mortally dangerous these roman waters were indeed zoe looked keenly at haraldr she was certain that this interpreter was good and that the barbaros was really almost a semibarbaros with a fair command of greek already and yet he had betrayed nothing when she had mentioned sabotage and had stumbled with witless guile over her mention of the grotesque monk he was either an innocent or a dissimulator worthy of odysseus an actor to make the entire hippodrome weep either way he would be useful but before she took this seduction further she would need to know which she signalled symeon to escort her guests out and spoke in parting your mother has enjoyed this interview translated a gratefully exhausted gregory as zoe finished when we arrive in antioch and begin our official entertainments there i will ask that you be seated at my dining couch brother muttered constantine mocking the imperious tone of the letters perfunctory salutation he continued to read my instructions will arrive in two separate missives this is the first as is your duty as strategus of antioch you will send the escort you are obligated to provide her imperial majesty to the scheduled rendezvous at mopsuestia at mopsuestia your turmarch i of course presume that you will not accompany your army into the field given the everpresent threat to antioch itself will not accept the transfer of command from the strategus of cilicia instead due to the temporary depletion of your own ranks and the necessity of defending your own city the strategus of cilicia will be humbly beseeched to continue his escort of the imperial party as far south as tripoli you are to pay for the accommodation of the cilician troops within your theme with the surcharge to the land tax i ordered earlier this year i trust you will show the strategus meletius attalietes every hospitality your splendid city has to offer your second set of instructions will be delivered to you in the form of a letter introducing the homes of her majestys special varangian guard this tauroscythian named haraldr nordbrikt is a tool i plan to use for one surgical procedure after which he will be blunted to uselessness until then see that he is particularly well cared for with affection and in the service of our holy brother joannes orphanotrophus constantine took a small key from an unlocked drawer beneath his writing table then opened the lock of another drawer he removed a box with an ivory lid unlocked the padlock that secured the sliding top and deposited the letter in the box then locked everything back up again he sat for a moment with his hands clasped across his chest his beardless slightly sagging chin slumped forward brother never consulting never asking always the command brother yes his brother joannes had pulled him along as he rose in the imperial administration and yes joannes had engineered the stunning deification of their precious little michael over whom joannes doted as if his youngest brother had sprung from his own mutilated loins but had anyone ever wondered how constantine might have performed on his own had he been the firstborn or had he been the lastborn permitted to go through life with the undamaged reproductive equipment that had placed michael on the imperial throne yes joannes had given up his manhood but so had constantine and yet everyone revered joannes as if he alone had made this ultimate sacrifice for the family and michael now unbelievably the emperor and autocrator of the romans had given up nothing for the family yet now from beneath the imperial diadem he looked down upon his second brother constantine as if the strategus of antioch were merely a court fool dressed for the part incapable of performing the simplest easter distribution without the personal intervention of the allknowing orphanotrophus joannes the fountains gently tinkled in the courtyard balming constantines anger a man does not say when or who will bring him into the world only the pantocrator determines that fate joanness schemes had worked in the past and this current exercise however nebulous it might seem at the moment would no doubt bring them all further success and some day constantine would be brought back to the empress city and there he would prove to both his eldest and youngest brothers the true measure of his abilities until then antioch was the fairest exile a man could know he rang for his chamberlain basil he told the bowing eunuch order the turmarch to my office right away you would prefer we discuss this flatulent plato our hellenist is always ranting about the man is an aeolus so prodigious is the hot wind he makes zoe was irritable after the jolting pitching descent from the cilician gates i simply do not think that this single tauroscythian offers anything other than his own considerable wind while we toy with this savage the repulsive orphanotrophus joannes continues to strengthen his stranglehold on your people i would not be surprised to hear that in your absence he has snatched up the imperial diadem and placed it on his own head joannes could not keep the brother i have crowned on the throne for a day without my purpleborn connivance the people would put the palaces of the dhynatoi to the torch and then smash down the palace gates to evict the usurper zoes voice was as fierce as her pride in the devotion the common folk the merchants and labourers and fishers and butchers and porters reserved solely for the authority derived from birth in the porphyry purple chamber of the imperial palace she and her sister theodora were the last purpleborn survivors of the macedonian dynasty established by their uncle basil the bulgarslayer and woe betide the upstart who would attempt to take from the folk of constantinople the living legacy of the emperor who for half a century had lifted them up and protected them against the dhynatoi no zoe said joannes is as presumptuous and arrogant as babel rising from the plain of shinar but we must not forget that he is also thorough and patient which returns me to our tauroscythian why would joannes sponsor a barbaros upstart if the barbaros did not figure in some important equation if this haraldr is innocent of joanness wiles and despite your protests i believe that this is possible if he is innocent we can turn him to our purpose and if he is a willing accomplice of the grotesque joannes then we can send him back laden with poisoned treats to offer his patron and what could we possibly betray of our own objectives between the sexless brute joannes and myself is that absolutely transparent intimacy that can exist only between the most implacable foes i do not assail your logic mother zoe pushed the curtain slightly aside to see why her carriage and presumably the rest of the imperial caravan had stopped well you know i value your intuition little daughter what is it for a moment i got the sense that this haraldr fancies himself i dont know he looked at me as if he considered himself a king well he certainly cannot think he will conquer the roman empire with his five hundred varangian malfeasants but do you think he has ambitions for himself ambitions i am not sure that is the correct term fate rules all and yet fate has no ambition this man he chills me it is not as if he is an agent of some worldly power but an emissary of destiny itself there is this current of raw fate that seems to surround him almost as if you could touch him and maria clasped her hands as if to stop them from quivering i do not make sense i know but i have told you what ata said about the three lines crossing he never said that the man might be a barbaros fairhair i dont know zoe placed her hands over marias i think this tauroscythian is a chorus player in this drama of ours but perhaps dont take offence daughter but you said once he brought you pleasure if only in the evanescence of sleep zoe smiled wryly perhaps he is an instrument of a simple fate i know you find the tauroscythians pleasurable to countenance and you never did conclude your investigation of the hetairarchs abilities perhaps you make too much of a basic desire the one as you so astutely pointed out the other day that is easiest to assuage zoe laughed delicately you would hardly be the first lady of my court to take a tauroscythian barbaros to your bed perhaps i confess that he was in my bed last night after your conversation with him marias eyes widened as she recalled the vision may i tell you oh yes little daughter said zoe all weariness forgotten he came to me quite naked his chest covered with hair like golden threads his arms as hard and smooth as sculpted stone he ripped my gown away i submitted totally willing it mother it embarrasses even our confidence to mention my shamelessness i begged him to enter every orifice with the most savage thrusts i screamed at him to break my flesh with his teeth to bite my lips and nipples and blood and sweat mixed to a hot oil spread between our merciless breasts and then i rose above him now pulling his hair then clawing his eyes and he knew my pleasure we rose conjoined in ecstasy towards a golden dome and in my hand i discovered a knife a cold icy blade and at the moment of supreme passion i plunged it with all my force into his neck and he faded he died as i was transported raised by the last warmth of his burning member as his body froze and the arms of the sun held me when i awakened from the dream i was drenched in my own effluxions maria you exceed yourself your nocturnal musings would make our esteemed specialist in sexual disorders faint away like a maiden at the sight of her first unsheathed column so you see you can have your pleasure of him but i think we can ultimately dispose of our overweening tauroscythian in a fashion that might be less provocative but more useful to our cause maria nodded her jaw still tense yes she could finally admit that the desire existed after all it was of the type easiest to assuage what she could not confess even to her beloved empress mother was that her dream had demonstrated to her a frightening but essential truth her desire could only be quenched in the moment that its object was destroyed if constantinople was the queen of cities stately and elegant then antioch was a ravishing courtesan the walls golden in the lateafternoon sun were almost as vast and proud as those of the empress city studded at intervals of a bowshot with huge round towers they rose from a glowing emeraldandochre valley to the pinedotted heights of a mountain ridge thousands of ells above the city tumbled down the slopes beneath rocky heights were terraced fields rowed vineyards and gardens dotted with lemon and orange and ivy interspersed with the white domes of vast palaces the buildings thickened as the incline graduated to the flat plain before the river crowding together in fantastic arrays of domes and spires and colonnades that faded into the southern horizon for almost a rowingspell the people of the surrounding villages had come out to stand by the road they were simple farmers in brown tunics brightened by vivid shawls and sashes they threw flowers and aromatic herbs beneath the wheels of the imperial carriages and chanted in greek mixed with a tongue haraldr did not know the women held their children and pointed saying theotokos apparently many of the peasants could not distinguish between the mother of the romans and the mother of god the city became more distinct as the imperial party advanced parallel to the looping sluggish yellow river that flowed towards the citys eastern flank the buildings seemed more open than those of constantinople with rows of wide arches and canopied balconies to draw the breeze that wandered idly through the valley banners fluttered and glazed domes sparkled it does not have the aspect of a virtuous city said halldor lightly she is a whore offered ulfr admiringly goddess of neckice goldenhaired shaker of the limb of freys orchard please repeat that asked gregory that was a very difficult kenning he means that this whore is both very beautiful and very skilled said halldor he gave his horse a little spur and came up beside haraldr you havent had a woman in some time i think abstinence has made you despondent your comrades have decided to plunder this wanton city until we find a woman who will put the fire back in your eyes haraldr struggled to smile i can always count on you to be blunt he thought for a moment halldor had bedded a woman in nicomedia one in nicaea one in ancyra one in adana none of them whores either but seemingly wellborn women prominent in provincial courts the one in nicaea with dark hair and dark eyes and a waist like a wasp had rivalled even maria in haraldrs fancy for several restless nights why had he not considered this before if a mans arrows consistently missed their target should he not ask the advice of an archer who inerrantly struck that at which he aimed haraldr asked halldor to join him in riding up ahead of the varangian ranks i knew you were lovesick said halldor when haraldr had finished his tale but i thought it was still that khazar girl halldor rubbed his fine nose with his forefinger as he thought for a moment haraldr do you know why i drink a full cup of love for every drop that dampens your lips he asked rhetorically because you approach love like a poet your breast bared for all to see while i approach love like a trader with his hacksilver hidden in the lining of his girdle but you have never had to pay for a womans favours exactly look the wise trader sees an object he must acquire he does not run pellmell to the merchants booth swoop the desired merchandise into his arms with heaving chest declare that his life will end if he cannot have this exquisite item and then offer to hack off a limb to place on top of the merchants price so that he may have it no the wise trader in fact strolls idly by this merchants booth then looks for hours perhaps days into the booths of the neighbouring merchants he examines their wares and sets his praisetongue wagging over the quality of their merchandise then his bag already full of items he has purchased at the other booths he walks by almost walks on thinks better of it and pauses to poke here and there among the wares that surround his treasure he asks the price of this and that and then well since he is here what about this and then of course he haggles as if this treasure is nothing more than dried dung to be burned and how could he possibly pay such a price and so on soon the merchant is so convinced he will never be relieved of this worthless item that he virtually gives it away so as i see it this maria is a wiser trader playing games with you now all you need to do is turn the tables on her that is remarkable halldor said haraldr with genuine respect it had never occurred to him that one needed to deal as hard with a woman he hoped to clutch gently to his breast as he did with a man with whom he was doing business the wise trader indeed the next time he saw maria he would not offer so much as a sideways glance at the wares in her booth haraldr nordbrikt of course haraldr nordbrikt constantine the strategus of antioch virtually leapt from behind his ivorysurfaced writing table haraldr observed that constantine was a beardless eunuch like his brother joannes though he had been spared the grotesque giantism of his brothers features in fact there was more of the emperor himself in constantines look as he came closer though haraldr noticed the glaze of nervous perspiration on the strateguss forehead and upper lip and he wondered if this man was so daunted by his brother that he grew anxious in the presence of someone merely bearing a letter from him welcome welcome welcome my brother joannes has not only told me to expect you but word of your fame has already begun to buzz about my city we are verily beneath the blade of the saracens here so your proficiency in exterminating heretics is particularly well valued in fair antioch constantine fluttered his hands and hated himself for it mother of god what a monstrous thug he thought albeit splendidly formed the scar over his eye gives him the sinister aspect certainly the type of delinquent my brother would enlist in his employ thank you strategus said haraldr in greek he had specially prepared this address i wish i hope i may serve you well as well as i am devoted to serve your brother orphanotrophus joannes and our father and may i present this haraldr handed the rolled and sealed letter to constantine constantine thanked haraldr and returned to his seat behind his writing table before unsealing the document i wonder if my omniscient brother knows that his pet brute is acquiring the power of speech he thought as he nervously peeled the embossed lead from the string is joanness ambition making him careless and if he plots an errant course to what end will the rest of us be led constantine unrolled the letter apprehension already lurking in his stomach haraldr watched carefully as constantine read kristr for a moment haraldr wondered if someone hiding beneath the table had just knifed constantine in the groin he was suddenly virtually chalkfaced haraldrs own skin crawled had his patron joannes been entirely sincere this could not be simply a friendly letter of introduction and wasnt it considerably longer than it would need to be for that purpose on the other hand perhaps joannes sensibly appended other news to the letter and perhaps not all of it was good but the reaction was most curious and constantine did not seem to be recovering well this was doing nothing to allay haraldrs doubts about joanness credibility constantine put the letter down with trembling hands he had not needed to finish it to be virtually numb with shock and he certainly could not read on in front of this brute he grinned forcibly sweat beading his brow well haraldr nordbrikt i am afraid official duties beckon me to return to them but i understand that i will see you this evening we are both seated at the imperial table when haraldr had left constantine picked up the letter again and studied it for almost an hour forcing himself to consider carefully all of the details the plan was astonishing in concept and would be exceedingly taxing to execute it was certainly more than just another of joanness elaborate schemes and yet joannes promised far more reward than he had ever offered before the complicity he now desired it was incredible but yes it could be done and of course now there was no question it would have to be done get your face away swinebreath shouted grettir though he knew these beetlefaces could not understand norse at every street they swarmed around him touching his tunic and the white skin of his arms with their filthblackened fingers then abandoning him to the rabble that assumed the chase at the next block this was a mistake grettir told himself in every way haraldr nordbrikt was no longer his enemy after months of a womans scullery work grettir now rode with the skalds again few other masters would have been as generous particularly not grettirs former patron hakon grettir cursed the impulse that had led him those long months ago to contact the hetamark or whatever they called that icelandic devil well the ogre had him by the belly purse now and he would have to ransom his own soul to shake him loose if these nutfaced demons did not take him first the beggars crawled from their rag nests set against the scumcoated walls empty eyes legless torsos lipless mouths jabbing stumps the sores the stench the pall of fat lazy flies grettir swatted the attacking human miasma around him and looked for the landmark as he had been instructed there odin be praised the blue tiles the tower rising how he had found the place through this rats warren in this vast strange city he did not know perhaps fortune was still with him it was the place indeed as he turned the corner grettir saw the goldentipped spires rising above the blue dome the street in front was blocked with every damned soul kristr had cast into hel they wailed and beseeched like screeching birds and chattering rodents rags hanging off their scabrous desiccated limbs men with cloudwhite eyes a woman with ragged black hair pulled out in angry red patches children with poxeaten faces they saw him and they came after him instinct took over and grettir struggled for his knife against the probing of skeletal slimy fingers he waved the blade and the man in front of him pressed his hands to his bleeding chest the rest hesitated a wolf pack deciding if hunger or fear would command their guts grettir wheeled crouched let them all see the blade they stood dulleyed and sightless moaning and jabbering grettir took one step no one moved he thrust ahead with the knife a man with a huge swollen oozing leg stepped back another step the pack responded slowly step by thrusting step grettir passed beneath the bluetiled dome suddenly they were gone vanished like malignant fylgya returning to the spirit world grettir looked down the dark narrow alley ahead with tears in his eyes the absence of traffic was as disconcerting as the mob the crumbling mud walls almost met overhead and a dank smell pervaded the chilly air a rat scurried across the narrow dirt path he listened to the faint cries of the mob the once hideous wails were seemingly sponged from the air by the ancient earthen walls he squinted into the darkness a man bent over a sort of crude stone table he worked at something edging closer grettir saw a boot a few scraps of hide he gasped the man was huge but the enormous figure did not turn from his table he was filing something slowly wearily as if for the rest of his life he would file away in this strange dungeon grettir fought the gorge in his throat and nostrils as the man looked up no nose only gaping wheezing slits yet the eyes were light blue and the filthencrusted hair had once been golden odin what caprice of yours condemned this norseman to this hel the giants tunic hung in greasy tatters the man spoke you have business here the language was norse the accent icelandic whwhat mumbled grettir the eyes burned in the darkness ice beneath a haunted moon you have business here the voice was strangely passive yet grettirs tuned ear detected the strong current of menace beneath the calm surface quickly reveal your errand he told himself i am told to give you this grettir dug the ring from the lining of his belt and cautiously placed it on the stone table the next thing he knew he was on his back the dankness suffocating the pale luminescence of the eyes above him the sharp point at his throat what does mar hunrodarson want the voice was the wolfs grettir whimpered but fought to find words his tongue had always been his livelihood but now it was his life he said you would not need to ask that the knife vanished and grettir was jerked to his feet you live then growled the beast as mar once let me live the noseless giant said nothing else only stared at grettir for a long horrifying minute as if he could pull from grettirs terrified gaze the memories of a homeland so far away finally he spoke again with calm finality the name of the man he is called haraldr nordbrikt grettir gulped the dry rock in his throat his real name is haraldr sigurdarson prince of norway i cannot bear to look said gregory he shut his eyes i and would have buried his head in his hands if he had not thought he would be immediately flogged or worse for such a violation of protocol you dont know how many of them fall ive seen it before in the hippodrome i cant take my eyes from her said haraldr as he raptly watched the acrobat the rope had been strung taut between the far ends of the two half domes that thrust up the gilded central dome of the strateguss palace the acrobat stood on one pointed toe just beneath the balustraded rim of the central dome her arms stretched wide like a birds and her breasts covered only by tiny golden leaves placed over the nipples were pulled firm against her sculpted rib cage her bare buttocks were tensed a third leaf between her legs was all that concealed what little modesty she had left she pirouetted and waved then leapt almost weightlessly to the safety of the stonerailed balcony the strateguss guests several hundred of them at more than a dozen large tables covered with white brocade cloths and silver settings roared in acclamation he wonders if you would like to speak to the acrobat gregory translated for constantine her name is citron a very private conversation he assures you haraldr looked at constantine who reclined across from him next to the head of the tshaped table yes he answered in greek then turned to gregory who stood in attendance directly behind him tell him i do not intend the shroud of night to conceal from me the beauties of antioch constantine smiled obsequiously haraldr noticed that the strategus of antioch was in an active sweat a bead dripped from his eyelash and darkened the carnelian silk upholstery of the dining couch on which he reclined haraldr settled comfortably on his left elbow constantine had called this dining in the roman fashion and gregory had reported that this was considered the height of elegance one of constantines eunuchs scurried over to arrange the silken pillows to support haraldrs back he studied the gleaming silver knives and forks set before him after practising for months with the absurd instruments he could use them as well as axe and sword and after all he reminded himself these are in a sense the weapons of rome the young man who came to stand beside constantine at first seemed to be the emperor another moments scrutiny revealed a less robust torso and more delicate features but he was a very handsome young man constantine gestured between the new arrival and haraldr this is my nephew michael kalaphates michael you are privileged to meet the renowned slayer of saracens haraldr nordbrikt haraldr stood and bowed michael seemed genuinely enthusiastic his dark eyes lively sir i am your servant he said in an elegant but slightly quavering voice the smallest thing you wish or if you wish the greatest thing of your admirers here in antioch i would find any request an honour to fulfil and even if there is nothing i can do for a man as resourceful as your feats prove you to be i hope i will have the good fortune to converse with you before you leave our city he bowed and took his seat haraldr remembered that joannes had remarked on his nephews lack of ambition but haraldr also observed that the same had been said of him not too long ago and he felt an instinctive affinity for this lesser michael meanwhile constantine had begun to dither with the eunuch he called basil something about his anxiety as to when the empress and her ladies would appear haraldr counted the empty places the empress would clearly take the purpleupholstered couch at the head of the table two guests would be seated between him and the empress another directly across from him haraldr worried that maria would take the seat one removed from him then he would not be able to pass her booth conspicuously without so much as a single glance at her wares constantine frowned involuntarily and then brightened into a clearly extorted greeting he stood grinning and perspiring strategus meletius attalietes you do us honour attalietes waved as if he were fanning a slow stupid fly he settled languidly onto the couch opposite constantines haraldr was astounded to observe that attalietess goldhemmed tunic was almost as berrypurple as an imperial blood relationship was it effrontery attalietes made the merest inclination of his head in haraldrs direction the small nostrils that pierced attalietess snub nose flared slightly and then compressed as if expunging a disagreeable odour he turned back to constantine and spoke in a scrolling tongue more imperious more florid than even symeons haraldr heard barbaroi clearly of course and something about vulgarity bad taste constantine seemed flustered his forehead was covered with huge beads and his bare cheeks flushed the dhynatoi wants to know why you are seated at his table whispered gregory he also says it is vulgar to entertain before dinner he says that out of deference to her imperial majesty he will suffer these affronts to propriety and remain at the table the music of the organ was the signal for all to rise like a huge flock of white birds the snowyrobed guests stood and waited the large bronze doors at the end of the room slid aside signalling the prescribed chants come forth empress of the romans the dome echoed with the reverent words and haraldr calmed himself with the reminder that he had dined at a kings table for most of his life come forth godprotected splendour of the crown come forth purpleborn glory shed light on your slaves the whiterobed chamberlains led by the frail symeon preceded the glittering ladiesinwaiting through the door haraldr saw maria sheathed in tight white silk just before the empress appeared in a burst of brilliant purple every head in the enormous hall bowed deeply eunuchs fluttered about the couches more whiterobed figures took up positions behind the head of the table silk rustled and haraldr head still bowed saw a goldthreaded white hem a few ells from his feet the erotically tiny white slippers were studded with little pearls he thought of halldors lesson and relaxed the wise trader the whiterobed figures at the head of the table began to chant one after the other in a tongue haraldr could not understand when the chants were done it was permissible to look up zoe reclined at the head of the table a young woman bearing a golden wand stood motionless directly behind her the empress turned to her right and said constantine strategus of antioch constantine removed the long white sash he wore over his shoulder then reclined on his couch zoe turned to her left meletius attalietes strategus of cilicia attalietes removed his sash as floridly as a dancer discarding her robe and reclined in a single effortless motion as if he dined in this position each night still facing left zoe addressed the woman next to haraldr maria mistress of the robes said zoe in her voluptuous slightly sibilant voice maria settled on her couch haraldr could not restrain a glance at her white slippers and a flash of bare ankle anna dalassena silentarias the girl who removed her sash and reclined just opposite haraldr was like a gorgeous bird her lips bright red her black hair coiled and set with pearls her cheeks blazing she was smaller than the empress and maria with a delicate silksheathed neck and probably not any older than elisevett haraldr nordbrikt slayer of saracens and komes of her imperial majestys varangian guard haraldr could not suppress his excitement and vanity as he removed his sash and settled back on his couch as the rest of the guests at the imperial table were announced and seated he noticed that the empress gave michael kalaphates a wry meaningful look the five whiterobed chanters or voukaloi began their sonorous rhythmic exchanges again the eunuchs fluttered forward and began to mix the wine with water haraldr looked across at anna he nodded and her brilliant cheeks grew darker her dark eyelashes dipped but her lips quivered with a faint smile haraldr decided he would praise these wares with a tongue that would make odin blush she wants to address you said gregory in a panic that almost tied his tongue haraldr put his goblet down and looked at the empress have you ever dined in the roman fashion before asked zoe haraldr could hear attalietes snort the position is familiar to me as we do not have seats on our longships the comfort of course is quite superior and this i attribute to the glory of the roman empire and the divine offices of your imperial majesty haraldr thanked odin for his words the voukaloi again droned their chants and the servants brought the first course miniature olives in silver bowls boiled artichokes eggs cooked and shelled and cradled in shells of blue enamel set on individual silver trays and served with a long silver spoon haraldr thought better of tackling the egg and instead scooped fish roe from a silver bowl onto a biscuit anna dalassena haraldr was surprised at the civility of attalietess address somewhat condescending but spoken as if the girl were human your father is well anna blushed oh yes very well thank you strategus yes said zoe pausing to press one of the miniature olives to her erotically puckered lips as if kissing the tiny morsel gregory quickly poised himself to translate as haraldr had asked him to do whenever she spoke the grand domestic has to be magnificently robust he has so many masters to serve that his errands are endless and it is a pity that those for whom he so diligently labours are never satisfied i pray for him often dont i anna dear attalietes dabbed his mouth with his lace linen napkin i am certain that is a comfort to the girl i know how devoutly you prayed for the health of your late husband may christ the king strategus your tongue is not so glib that i could not have it removed zoes voice was a dagger in each heart within hearing haraldr could scarcely believe her screaming eyes this was an empress who could daunt any king he had ever known he almost flinched as she gestured towards him you have met the homes of my guard have you not strategus he has hewn suffer stuff than your neck zoe fixed attalietes for a moment then turned and with absolutely deft fingers selected another tiny olive her eyes wandered again to attalietes strategus i suddenly realize that naughty symeon must have failed to communicate to you the proper attire for our dining symeon you must make amends take our strategus to the kitchen and find him a garment in a more harmonious hue symeon came up behind attalietes the strategus coloured like a maiden but his haughty eyes were unrepentant the wrinkles at the corners of zoes eyes twitched slightly haraldr quickly rose and stepped over his couch one of the eunuchs handed him his singlebladed axe haraldr slammed the blade flat against his chest with a resonant thud attalietess jaw quivered with astonishment and anger he rose reluctantly and haraldr stepped closer attalietes turned to the urging of symeons withered hand on his arm haraldr wheeled to follow no komes haraldr said the empress i assure you symeon has the strength to provide a suitable escort for our strategus besides you would leave my darlings bereft of company resume your place haraldr returned his axe to the eunuch and settled back onto his couch he knew he had made an enemy but he had realized an inescapable truth he was at the empresss beck and call and like her husband no matter what rumours one heard of her she was more than capable of that command whoever was her enemy was his a truth he reflected that brought him little comfort the second course was a large poached fish smothered in the oily tart sauce called garos and topped with more tiny fish eggs haraldr was pleased with how he had handled the thin twopronged silver fork particularly since he was still rattled by the incident with attalietes zoe spoke with anna for a while the girl seemed to have taken the outburst with aplomb haraldr found this attractive she seemed so young and blushing yet she had a womans grace when he had finished his fish he kept glancing at her until he caught her eye she looked at him and cocked her head slightly komes odin no homer gregory had set him upon the study of the famous ancient greek skald saying that it reflected well on one to recite his verse haraldr frantically reviewed some remembered passages laodike loveliest of all the daughters constantines fork clattered on his silver plate he stared as if he had heard a dog speak even zoes jaw sagged slightly anna blushed furiously and fluttered her lashes then her eyes widened and her teeth flashed as she spoke tall hektor of the shining helm haraldr understood immediately hektor was the hero of homers seemingly endless lay called the iliad but wasnt hektor killed at the end of this lay zoe leaned forward her eyes sweeping from haraldr to anna i have certainly heard many far more subtly allusive citations of the bard she said but none quite as extraordinary zoe looked at maria haraldr would not turn to see marias reaction and then back at him i had no notion that your inclinations extended to verse i hope that your imperial majesty and this estimable lady do not consider it an indignity in my own tongue which has not the grace of the greek but is not without its own beauties i have composed verses of my own and i have three men in my company who record in verse the valour of the varangians as we serve your majesty it is customary for a norse king never to be far from his poets we call them skalds but you are not a king haraldr concentrated on not lowering his eyes no he answered firmly but then no norse king has had the privilege to stand next to your throne perhaps i imagine myself above them though i am just the servant at your feet anna said zoe turning to the rapt girl i believe you have found a gallant if he can celebrate your beauty in our tongue think what glories he might ascribe to you in his own haraldr only wished halldor could hear this he turned and glanced quickly past maria as if he were checking on the eunuch who held his axe hah she was looking at him the second course was a whole goat stuffed with delicate miniature onions and other tiny vegetables haraldr was grateful for the distraction as he realized that halldors first lesson had not included all he needed to know if he lingered by annas booth too long pointing and jabbering then certainly anna would demand a price he could not meet or else shoo him away it was endless fortunately a dance with men and women in sheer gauzy costumes gyrating madly to wild ringing circular music followed the dinner haraldr watched the empress for a moment her eyes seemed to fill with the music and sinuous movements as if they gulped the pleasure of love she devoured with those eyes the dancers kalaphates the strategus meletius attalietes now wearing white was readmitted to the table maria began to converse animatedly with him when the dancers were finished haraldr drank deeply and met anna across the table he desired her now he felt she desired him and there seemed to be no caveats against a woman of the court freely enjoying a man even a barbaros she raised her goblet to him he to her they remained locked sipping their eyes like stroking fingers their tongues darting over silver haraldrs head dizzied they no longer mixed the wine with water he signalled the eunuch and told him that ulfr should assume command of the varangians for the rest of the night zoe rose and drank toasts and the voukaloi chanted first to constantine then to kalaphates shockingly kalaphates came beside her he sat on the couch next to her nephew she said and she pressed her winedark lips to his forehead and touched his hair haraldr felt the seduction around him like a great hot yet fragrant wind sweeping sucking it was their perfumed scent the vague outline of nipples beneath silk perhaps the air of this place he desired the voukaloi celebrated the pastries and fruits haraldr took a fig someone was on the rope high above again anna nodded eyes heavy with desire she bared her teeth she kristr annas head bobbed and then plunged to the table nearly crushing a silverwreathed pastry she raised her head again but the eunuchs were around her like white spume and whisked her away like a white cloud riding the wind the empress had not even noticed haraldr steadied himself halldor he lamented dizzily now there is only one booth open citron was at his side like an answered prayer her gauzy robe hid little more than her working costume had the nipples were dark citron sat bringing a mist of rose and pine with her her arm was smooth and cool around his neck her breath hot on his ear another white arm drew her back so haraldr turned and met marias eyes it was she who had taken citron away from him even with the herons fluttering in his head she was as detailed as one of the empresss jewellike icons the scroll of her lips seemingly painted with blood the slight flare of the delicate nostrils and the chiselled tip of her nose the gullwing brows she did not flinch from his rapture nor did her blue silk irises flare with jealousy she stared at him for a moment and then her glistening lips descended on citrons ear almost as if she too desired the lithe acrobat but maria only whispered something then drew away a eunuch bent to maria listened for a moment and nodded to citron citron almost imperceptibly tilted her head then she wrapped haraldr like a hot breeze like cool marble her fevered lips on his john chimachus turmarch of the first brigade of the imperial thematic army of antioch waited alone in the darkness he watched as the pearlfaced moon settled just above the eerily luminous crest of mount silpius he did not like it on this side of the mountain with antioch hidden to the west silpius was the citys great natural shield and on this eastern slope of the peak he felt about as safe as he would were he advancing into battle with his shield behind his back something rattled and chimachus gripped the pommel of his sword he looked back at the skewing arms of the thicktrunked old tree isolated in a rockstrewn pasture the peasants had tied talismans in the branches bits of cloth bells entire weathershredded garments hanging like moss to appease the djinn of the place thought chimachus he wished there was some djinn he could appeal to things had been so much easier when he was a mere koines in command of a vanda then he simply had to worry about fighting saracens not about making deliveries to them in the djinnhaunted night chimachus looked at the leather bags at his feet his strategus constantine ran an army in a queer sort of way all his letters and dispatches and sealed missives and for the past two days theotokos four of the dispatch units fastest horses were lame and a good messenger was even now being treated with st gregorys salt in the brigade hospital of course something was up why else would a turmarch be standing alone in a christforsaken pasture but the strategus who had ordered these strange things was very close to the imperial dignity what he bade was done and questions were a waste of time good he heard the hoofbeats if they had wanted to come with stealth he would have seen them first and by then it would have been too late to outrun the saracen horses then he saw the silhouettes as the horsemen rode over a slight ridge to east just four of them four black horses they do not like this night thought chimachus and perhaps this errand any more than i the horses wheezed sweat lustrous on their necks and flanks the black robes of their riders concealed all but black faces white teeth lit by the moon appeared with frightening brilliance yes asked the black face from atop the largest horse yes the turmarch grunted as he handed up the first bag the other horsemen came forward in turn after the fourth bag had been laboriously hoisted the horseman who had spoken nodded spurred his horse and led the others galloping into the night the turmarch returned to his own horse and gently soothed the beasts sweatcrusted neck a pack mule would have been better suited to this mission he thought fortunately the stallion hadnt been lamed by the load the turmarch looked over his shoulder he could no longer hear the riders but he again saw their silhouettes on the ridge in an instant they were gone as considerable as that weight had been it did not warrant the apprehension he still felt the turmarch decided he would walk his horse at first yes that had been a great deal of gold but the turmarch was certain that it had not been the final payment in the darkness he felt silk on one cheek something lighter almost as fine on the other areld she whispered her hair over him like a shroud she burrowed beneath him like a silken otter turning him on his side it wasnt dark he realized as the shroud fell away his freyspike was tempered as hard as hunland steel and her hand tightened around it citron he mumbled her dark tresses receded down his goldflecked huge torso her course as direct as it had been all last night kristr odin and that had been only the prelude citrons tongue had been insatiable as if she were a hummingbird who could only take sustenance through that medium odin kristr the things she had done with that tongue he had never imagined she was doing some of them again haraldr moaned and writhed as if she were sucking the life from him when she was done he slept again he awoke light filtered around the brocade curtains he vaguely recalled the room in the palace citron had taken him to she was standing by the window wrapped in a green silk robe she opened the curtains slightly and returned to him she bent over and the dark hair fell and she brought her lips to his again she reached within the sleeve of her robe and took out a white slip of alexandrian paper and laid it on his chest then springing as lightly as if she were once again cavorting high above the great hall she danced to the door slid it open and vanished citron haraldr lay back on the pillow and looked at the red wax seal who would be summoning him here he decided not to prolong his anxiety and broke the seal the message was written in runes in gregorys hand sir we game with one another such pastimes are for girls like anna i hope citron has reminded you that there are other games today we go to daphne you will be with me maria daphne nicon blymmedes could in no way believe what he was hearing you received none of my intelligence do you think i employ akrites and a kambidhouter and a mandator because they amuse me with their inventions blymmedess face was ripening rapidly the indications are unmistakable we have evidence of very large movements to the west of aleppo and one of the brothers at st symeon was blessed to elude a reconnaissance party constantine toyed with the large clamp used to stamp his seal in lead absently snapping the iron jaws shut several times delightful he thought the way the birds had added their earlymorning chorus to the melody of his fountains domestic he said insouciantly i am most impressed with the fashion in which your barbaric akrites can examine a pile of camel dung and from it deduce the size of the caliph of egypts army however constantine rattled a sheaf of documents i have here my own intelligence and it is considerably more eloquent than the carefully studied excrement your akrites offer us he threw the papers down assurances of safe passage from the caliph of egypt as well as his vassal the emir of tripoli it is never safe to be careless thundered blymmedes all i am requesting is another day or two to send two light cavalry vanda west as far as harim our mother does not wish to wait a day or two she wishes to leave for daphne immediately she does not wish to await the winter inclemencies while your cavalry collect more droppings to display to you fine said blymmedes calming and searching for compromise we will leave today but we will move quickly and set a proper camp for the night daphne is not defensible the empress wishes to stay the night there i am certain that with two thematic armies in her cordon she will not need the warriors of the domestic of the imperial excubitores to safeguard her blessed person blymmedes saw that there was no hope even one strategus outranked him and apparently the two he now had to contend with agreed on this foolish course the only other recourse was dangerous insubordination and these two strategi whatever their woeful shortcomings at military command had the abilities to see that he would be punished promptly and mercilessly for any usurpation of their commands well defending daphne would at least be a challenging exercise in tactical deployment blymmedes bowed crisply we will be ready to leave antioch within the hour these mistress symeons scarcely living parchmentlike fingers decorously placed the documents broken seals dangling next to zoe the empress was stretched out under iridescent purple covers her ponderous gilt and whitelacquer imperial sleeping couch required an entire wagon for transport these are the original documents asked zoe as she read her varnished fingernails picked at the dried emollient that masked her face oh yes mistress after we have opened them we always feel it is better to make an exact copy with a fresh seal and send on the duplicate a keen eye can detect a seal that has been restored zoe continued to read and pick for several minutes she leaned back against her pillows and closed her eyes symeon stood patiently a single bluish vein throbbing just beneath the membranelike skin of his ancient temple how interesting said zoe finally do you really think it is attalietes no mistress said symeon without hesitation these came to us too providentially for even providence to account for reasonably how interesting then it is someone else who wishes to make a fool of a fool and only our mother in heaven knows what they plan for us how very interesting zoes eyes were still closed and she seemed to drift off for a moment mistress asked symeon is there something you wish done about this zoe seemed not to hear at first oh symeon no if you please nothing we will do nothing blymmedes seemed quite convinced said ulfr of course we have not surveyed the terrain at this daphne but what he told me made sense i have no doubt we will find the situation as blymmedes described it mused haraldr he looked at the lifelike almost crocusgolden statue of a woman that stood beside the broad paved gently rising avenue set well back from the road a large villa glimmered like ivory behind a screen of cypress trees haraldr turned to ulfr and halldor i smell something rank and foul here i smell a plot he went on to describe the vitriolic exchange between attalietes and the empress the previous night perhaps considered ulfr but blymmedes said the empress herself had commanded this and that both the strategus of antioch and the strategus of cilicia were in agreement haraldr thought for a moment he knew that attalietes was the empresss enemy if joannes was also the empresss enemy then constantine could well be allied with attalietes despite the disdain of the dhynatoi for the eunuch i think i will find out what the empress commands with my own ears haraldr said motioning to gregory to join him he spurred his horse and turned back towards the imperial carriages the imperial chamberlain symeon rode in his own carriage with his own eunuchs riding in attendance he pulled back the crimson curtain and peered out his slightly jaundiced watery blue eyes looked as if they would slide off his face deceptive eyes thought haraldr he had seen the authority in them the night before chamberlain i hope you will not think it impertinent if i discuss with you my anxiety about the safety of our mother symeon nodded haraldr recited brymmedess concerns while symeon fixed him with a curious look not indifferent but perhaps regarding haraldr as only one of an entire multitude of things he witnessed at once then haraldr added you will see that we are dependent on the thematic armies to guarantee the security of such a diffuse perimeter tonight will we sleep with the assurance that these bricks have been set with the proper mortar komes symeon intoned with ancient resonance the empress herself is the architect of her fate she has set these bricks you speak of in the pattern she finds most pleasing symeon closed the curtain and his carriage rumbled on daphne zoe pulled aside the curtain and inhaled deeply you can smell the roses she watched as her carriage passed a long marble pergola smothered with ivy she inhaled again the air is as fragrant and pure as the water you know how they say antioch near daphne dont you dear you have to be here to realize how true that is zoe again imbibed the fresh floralscented air cypress pine roses paradise fair daphne your virtue is our reward she turned to maria you are not troubled are you little daughter symeon simply thought we should know i can hardly see that it changes anything marias nostrils flared it means that this haraldr is almost certainly a principal in this conspiracy if it is to happen near st symeon and this haraldr says it is to happen here is he not saying watch out for the dog at our feet when he knows that the lion approaches from behind but komes haraldr implies that constantine and attalietes are allied in this enterprise there is no sense to that accusation unless yes yes the best actor is both a liar and a madman euthymius would pay a thousand solidi for this haraldrs talents marias cheeks glowed stoked with outrage zoe settled marias hands i believe he is innocent simply because there is no method no plan to his contrivances why would he have so visibly challenged attalietes last night if he was in league with whomever wishes attalietes to play the ass in doing that he has already made attalietes the fool thus relieving the scene that will follow of its necessary drama and why would he warn us of a conspiracy we have already been far more subtly and misleadingly alerted to so you believe it will happen here oh dear i have no concern where it happens zoe settled back and admired the sad elegance of a crumbling arcade you must enjoy your day here my darling simply remember that i now regard my tauroscythian komes haraldr as wedded to me by a loyalty that would embrace death with greedy arms you must only think to weld him to our cause with a yet more implacable bond maria looked out on the dead splendour of daphne and said nothing who are these men white wisps of hair clung to the parchment scalp behind symeons ears and several errant strands floated in the breeze like gossamer the varangians stood at rigid attention breastplates gleaming i have detailed these men to follow the empress at a discreet distance wherever it is her pleasure to go haraldr stood with his singlebladed axe pressed against emmas polished links these men are not necessary symeon studied the varangians with his watery stare they are relieved from their martial duties so that they may imbue themselves with the culture of the ancients it will heighten their appreciation for the glories of the roman empire certainly that will make them better servants of her majesty symeon returned to haraldr the empress believes you alone are sufficient escort for her sacred person and her ladies symeons bony fingers moved through the air like the passage of an apparition and komes do not go to her in your war costume she does not want to be reminded of military matters in any fashion the empress was accompanied by the eunuchs leo and theodore two serving ladies and maria and anna she waited for haraldr and gregory beneath a single large laurel tree her own fragrance and that of her ladies blended with the scent of the leaves komes she offered enthusiastically haraldr mastered his urge to look at marias face he knelt before zoe and she gave him her hand to kiss when haraldr and gregory stood again zoe regally scrutinized gregory then she spoke sharply to him she asks if you can trust me i understood gregory haraldr looked at zoe with my life he said in greek zoe nodded slowly and graciously then lifted her crimson hem and whirled daphne she plucked a leaf from the tree and pressed it to her cheek dear little daphne do you know her story komes haraldr haraldr shook his head daphne was the fairest nymph who lived in this the fairest place on earth apollo son of zeus devotee of beauty looked down upon her as he rode in the chariot of the sun struck by mad longing he leapt to earth and pursued her she fled in terror to save the lovely flower of her chastity the ladies seemed highly amused by this passage but apollo was swift and relentless he was upon her his golden shaft poised to pierce her with the wound from which there is no recovery was there no pity among the gods daphne pleaded and sobbed and good gaea mother of the earth was stirred to mercy poof gaea decreed even as apollo held her in his arms daphne bloomed into the very tree we see here zoe pressed the leaf to haraldrs lips you see she still has the freshness of a virgin zoe turned to her ladies and she will be fresh and pure for ever for that is the reward for woman who has never known man haraldr was startled the empress had been so gay a moment before zoe whirled again ah she said the lust returned to her voice but to have loved apollo even once to have felt the heat of his golden arms despite the frivolity of the tone in which the empress had told her tale haraldr sensed that the romans still had a reverence for their old gods he looked about at the wonders of daphne behind the laurel tree stood a row of columns half toppled with fragments of architraves forming zigzag patterns the crocusveined marble was chipped and weathered and spotted with lichen beyond these ruins was a perfect grove of ancient cypresses set as formally as the row of columns and above these cool dark spires unfolded a tumbleddown city of enormous crumbled columns and jagged walls and ruptured towers and curious rows of small stone terraces all of it set as if by giant hands into the garlandscattered limestone cliffs the old gods the gods of the ancient greeks and romans had lived here once nephew michael kalaphates strode among the imperial party his sparkling robe of white hellas silk far superior to the tunic of syrian silk he had worn the previous night kalaphates knelt and kissed the empresss hand she clasped his shoulders and raised him up then turned and whispered to the youthful fulljowled eunuch leo although the empress gave no signal that haraldr could discern the ladies stepped away from her haraldr was confused he wondered if he should stay and guard his mother or offer her his own discretion the hand on his arm was as light as if a butterfly had settled there maria smiled up at him without guile her coiled hair almost touching his upper arm the crimson lips the pearl teeth he shuddered perceptibly at the thrill of her presence you will be with me may i use your name she asked did the multihued ethereal lights of halogoland have a sound if so her voice was it haraldr nodded may i call you by your name certainly haraldr the weight of her hand increased minutely and perhaps you will think of another name for me before we leave daphne her tone was an invitation yes thought haraldr your name is already snowbreasted goddess may i show you daphne white silk dazzled as she waved her ivory fingers towards the ruins on the heights with gregory the unseen voice following behind them they crossed to a paved path that rose in a series of worn stone stairs flanked by small disarrayed columns birds sang and a green lizard scampered from atop a chunk of white stone carved with a floral pattern soon the rows of cypresses draped them in cool misting shadows did you enjoy our mothers tale of how daphne gave her name to this place i found it quite beautiful a skald will often use a tree kenning to describe a lovely woman kenning im afraid that word does not translate into the language of homer gregory elaborated in greek oh yes when a poet likens one thing to another he went on his way like a snowy mountain so the bard spoke of fairhelmed hektor because his size and ferocity and some would say his arrogance put him above other men there was no dominant tone here that could guide haraldr was she teasing him or was there a threat in her bewitching melody had hektor been too arrogant too bold and if so was hektorharaldr considered to share the same faults yes a kenning is much like that though not entirely so take this example ravenflocked laurel tree of the golden sea cliffs maria stopped for a moment and looked up at him her silksheathed breast brushed momentarily against his sleeve whatever might that be you the lovely laurel tree with hair as dark as the ravens breast who comes from the great city where the mountainous walls that face the sea are golden in the sun maria simply looked at him for a very long moment it was as if her eyes were mysterious chasms with blue lights in their depths she turned and guided him up the steps and out of the cypress grove incredible thought haraldr how could such things be built and then discarded men would not abandon such a place only gods the huge marble structures clung to the cliffs dappled all over with flowering vines and lacy ivy haraldr and maria and gregory walked towards two broken towers surrounded by the glacierlike rubble of their former magnificence rome built this said maria the old rome that rose by the river tiber in italia but you are the romans we are the new romans the ruins of the towers lay in huge ashlar blocks among which berries and flowers had begun to grow here and there were fragments of carved human forms a muscular leg an arm and shoulder a partial head covered with short curly hair it was as if here the old gods had waged their last battle their bodies now frozen amid the titanic wreckage of that ultimate struggle the old romans asked haraldr what happened to them maria stooped to caress the ancient stone face of a beautiful young man a fragment so curiously lifelike that it seemed as if the delicately parted marble lips might take in air and restore a blush to the weathered cheeks travellers who have visited the old rome make the cross of christ the king when they talk of it so vast is that tomb as vast as the queen of cities yet peopled only by spirits and demons and slinking dogs all like this stade after endless stade all like this a vast sepulchre so sad to think of them maria touched the stone youths lips they were flesh as we are soft lips dust all to dust she drew back as if the lips had burned her fingers or perhaps as if they had stirred to life she took his arm now curling her elegant statuesmooth fingers just above his elbow and pulling him next to her so that her silk flank swished against his haraldr was stirred and yet the awe the holiness of the place overwhelmed him he looked up at a wall covered with carvings of young men naked athletes not armoured warriors maria led him beneath an arch that pierced the wall and descended a dozen steps into a brilliant field of light haraldr gasped what was this place it was a vast long field of unkempt grass and shrubs surrounded by row upon row of steps no seats as if for a thingmeeting but there was room enough here for every man in norway it seemed the stadium said maria for the games haraldr shielded his eyes from the glare off the bleached stone seats what sort of contests the ancients called them olympics after the mountain on which zeus dwelt the man who won here became a god as one every citizen of antioch stood to sing the victors name maria paused a flight of small black birds descended on a shrub at the end of the field nearest them and chorused noisily can you hear the name they are singing she asked wryly though her scrolled lips had a bitter set maria guided haraldr around the pathway at the top of the stadium to a row of almost intact neatly fluted columns the columns were the entrance to a large cottagesized niche carved into the very rock that seemed to embrace the long southern flank of the stadium haraldr peered into the gloom behind the sunwarmed columns in the shadows a huge figure loomed haraldr bent for the dagger he had hidden in his boot you think he lives maria laughed haraldrs eyes adjusted to the light he saw a stone man taller than himself even if the statue were to be taken off the stone pedestal upon which it stood the figures marble arms were coursed with living veins and every other detail was equally lifelike even the curl of hair that crowned his manhood haraldr was embarrassed heracles maria sighed as if she was a rapt maiden he was half man half god they say that apollo and hermes were fairer perhaps yet one does not reflect on their beauty in his presence she stepped around an empty basin that stood before the statue and wrapped her fingers about heracless veined marble ankle and softly ran her fingers up to his bulging stone calf she pressed her cheek to the leg and nuzzled it for a moment then leaned her head back and looked directly at the demigods flaccid strikingly human organs haraldr could not believe her immodesty but her boldness stirred him far more than downcast eyes and fluttering lashes maria slowly released the demigod and stepped towards haraldr her hips inclined slightly forward only a thumbs width from his thighs she held her hands just above his chest and spread her fingers for a moment she looked directly at him her eyes reflections of the brilliant azure sky outside her lips slightly parted her fingers touched his chest like the barest breeze that was all she closed her eyes for a moment and stepped away she looked once again at the towering heracles and then went into the sun by herself it is so dark in there she said taking haraldrs arm again sometimes in the dark i feel i cannot breathe they entered a shaded arcade roofed with thick ivy she was quiet for a while they left the stadium and wandered in a small poplar grove poking at statuary fragments with their feet between the rows of trees the limestone cliffs fell away to the greenandgold plain below the trees that ringed daphne shimmered in the lateafternoon breeze marias fingers moved softly against haraldrs sleeve she spoke as if mesmerized do you fairhairs believe in the apocalypse haraldr asked gregory to clarify but maria interrupted the end of creation she looked out over daphne now a mosaic of golden spires and long misty smokepurple shadows we shall subdue the sons of hagar the emperor shall regain illyricum and egypt shall bring her tribute once more and he shall set his hand upon the sea and subdue the fairhair nations her recitation was dreamlike then a base woman will rise up and rule the romans and there will be conspiracies and slaughter in every house and this impure queen will anger god and he will stretch out his hand and seize his strong scythe and cut the earth from under the city and order the waters to swallow it up and the waters will crash forth and raise the city spinning to great height and then cast it down into the abyss haraldr knew that maria had sensed his tremor of anxiety was she testing him with this reference to an impure queen i see i have frightened you maria said her voice light it is such a wicked tale do you have one like it haraldr assumed she had only been playing yes ragnarok the doom of the gods haraldr watched daphne glitter in the lowering sun and felt odin stir to life the sun turns black earth sinks in the waves the blazing stars are quenched from the sky flames leap fierce to scorch the clouds until heaven itself is seared to ashes haraldr lost the skaldic rhythm with the words that followed and then the wolf fenrir will devour all even oneeyed odin the allfather odin is he your fairhair demon he is the god of war verse and vision he hung from the tree of infinite roots to seize the mead of verse from the underworld and in his palace called the valhol slain warriors raise their swords again to wait for ragnarok so you do not believe in christ the king i was baptized with the water of allconquering christ now maria seemed perplexed so you believe that christ will rule in the end after odin perishes yes do you believe that you will be spared to enter the new jerusalem she gathered that he did not understand you see when the empress city has been cast into the abyss god will allow the fairhairs to rage forth upon the earth and they will consume blood and flesh and the sun will turn to blood and the moon darken and then the antichrist a serpent in the guise of a man will arise to battle christ after terrible tribulations christ will cast the devil and all of the unjust into a lake of fire and the just shall be brought into a great city of crystal and gold the new jerusalem that will descend from heaven maria seemed to recite from some text and there shall they dwell in the sight of god and there shall no longer be night nor need of lamp or sun for the lord god will give them light and the just shall reign for eternity haraldr pondered this tale in which the norsemen played such a menacing role was this why the romans feared the northern nations even with their godgranted gift of liquid fire he looked down and saw marias flickering blue challenge so you believe that we fairhairs will hasten the rise of christs great foe the devil antichrist those are the visions of the prophets maria paused and reflected as if she gave partial credence to these visions what do you think haraldr remembered the words of the christian skalds at olafs court we believe that that after ragnarok christ will raise up a hall more fair than the sun thatched with gold at a place called gimle perhaps that is this new jerusalem you speak of it is said that the gods shall dwell there in innocence and bliss how extraordinary that you fairhairs would also know of the holy city of god that is not the end of the tale haraldr felt as if he could see beyond sunflecked daphne to the dark border of creation maria clutched his arm tightly odin spoke death dark on his own tongue now comes the last black dragon flying the glittering serpent from nidafell he is a blackness that will consume all flesh all life all light even his own being when he soars in the darkness all creation will cease to be then no one will judge you in the end and bring the just to everlasting life no one man or god will be left to judge a man will judge himself by the courage with which he stands before the last dragon maria looked down for a long while finally she blinked and a tiny tear hung on a painted lash your tale is better than mine she whispered it is so brave and so sad the wind fluttered the leaves in the grove behind gregory spoke in greek someone was approaching maria turned and waved she let go of haraldrs arm and advanced a few paces to wait for leo who attacked a flight of stone steps with redfaced vigour leo whispered breathlessly into marias ear then held out his arm to her she placed her white fingers on leos silk sleeve and turned to haraldr thank you for your lovely tale anna is coming for you then with dancing white slippers maria descended the golden steps of daphne that ass has more sense than the man who beats him muttered the keeper of the imperial beacon at toulon he plucked at his short black beard with consternation you be careful with those the keeper quickly steadied the stumbling pack mule and made certain that the load two large terracotta canisters was secure fool he shouted to the batman a small cilician whose weathered dark skin was the same colour as his sweatstained brown burlap tunic you break one of these and your own piss could set it off so quickly that you would wish for hellfires to save you from the flames the batman grabbed the mules harness to steady himself and looked back at the narrow rocky path he had just ascended it led from the main road which threaded through the cilician gates well your sirship accustomed as i am to the loads of faggots we bring up here and that is no worry to me for my children would not go fatherless but you want the devils spittle and for good reason i do not know and you pay only what the load of faggots is to boot the batman pulled the longsuffering mule over the last steep stepup a small stonewalled fort stood at the flat top of the crest the batman slapped the mules rump the beast trudged towards the forts heavy wooden gate its me that should protest sirship its you that should protest mumbled the exasperated keeper as he followed the delivery through the gate they stepped into a deserted court a rectangular threestorey stone tower rose at the northwest corner of the walls atop the tower was a flat bronze ellipse twice as tall as a man surrounded by four workers who busily polished the shimmering surface i should protest thought the keeper i am asked to maintain toulon with one assistant and five liceeaten guards when the sainted bulgarslayer was alive the frontiers were important and we would sometimes have an entire vanda posted up here now the corvee that would provide us with even temporary reserves from the thematic army has been eliminated by the offices of the strategus attalietes fine he will one day learn his lesson when the sons of hagar pour through the cilician gates and darken his own fields and there is no thematic army to resist them and the imperial taghmata cannot be summoned because the imperial beacon at toulon has been destroyed by the heretics the keeper hitched up his belt and strode to the tower he ascended the grey stone steps and stopped in the clock room his young assistant the superintendent of the imperial dial maintained the room spotlessly the afternoon sun through the grilled glass windows lit scoured stone the brass tank of the water clock gleamed the gears and pulleys beneath it clicked like busy beetles with a habitual reflex the keeper checked the time on the large engraved bronze disc he looked for the coinsize gold pin that signified the sun and then plotted it against the overlying grid of arcing wires that indicated the hours tenth hour of the day four hours past the redenamelled vertical wire that marked the meridian two hours above the red arc that indicated sunset it was the hours after sunset that mattered to the keeper lets check the beacon he said to the superintendent a studious young graduate of the quadrivium in dorylaeum whose oncesallow cheeks had taken on a healthier brightness from his mountain posting the pair climbed through the small circular stone stairwell to the roof of the tower a charred stone tub three arm spans wide took up most of the roof space towering above the tub was the elliptical copper mirror the guards had just finished their meticulous polishing and the slight concavity captured a compressed distorted image of the mountain landscape the keeper looked north imagining that he could see the summit of mount arghaios a dozen leagues across the dull olivegrey expanse of the taurus plateau may the clouds stay away and your watchmen stay awake he thought silently invoking the beacon keepers prayer for his counterpart atop the distant mountain and for you also at mount samos and kastron aiylon and mount mamas and kyrizos and mokilos and st afxendios and of course the grand superintendent of the imperial dial in the great magnara in the empress city the keeper sighed thinking of the distance that separated him and his ambitions from the queen of cities he attempted to assuage his melancholy with the thought that he was the most important of the keepers for he started it all and he would at least not have to worry about his watchmen sneaking wine to their posts and drifting off his message would come by swift courier from antioch by way of adana the keeper inspected the improvised crane that would lift the terracotta canisters to the roof of the tower yes he shouted down signalling the guard to attach the clay jars to the hoist im not comfortable with the idea of using liquid fire said the superintendent i really think it might melt the mirror and burn through the roof i guess when you studied the quadrivium they didnt teach you that a wood fire can actually burn hotter than that stuff said the keeper goodnaturedly the advantage to liquid fire is that it ignites instantly and the flames leap more vigorously when basil the bulgarslayer may christ the king preserve and keep his immortal soul was alive we used it all the time look you can figure it before i can say it even when the flame is up to maximum visibility in four minutes true four minutes for each beacon times eight beacons in all totals more than half an hour and given the usual delays it is quite possible that a message sent from here in one hour could be received at the imperial palace in the next hasnt it happened before indeed it did the year before you came here we were told of the capture of edessa by the saracens at that time the schedule called for the beacon to be lit at the fifth hour of the night to signal that particular event but the light finally arrived at the magnara in the sixth hour of the night signalling that edessa had resisted the siege by the time it was all straightened out the relief force was two weeks late the problem was traced to mokilos where the keeper had allowed two women of a nearby village to inspect his facilities that night needless to say that particular keeper no longer has that particular equipment to display nor does he have eyes with which to miss beacons shining brightly in the night so why do they give us liquid fire but cut a watchman from our roster every month it seems well something big is afoot down there in antioch he pointed south they want to make sure this message is not delayed and you and i are going to have to share in the watch duty the superintendent groaned lets look at the new schedule said the keeper he genially slapped the bony shoulders of his assistant they descended to the clock room and the keeper went to the polished wooden cabinet in the corner opposite the water tank he unlocked a shiny brass padlock removed the sealed document and displayed it to the superintendent the superintendent examined the seal the orphanotrophus joannes he said with youthful awe usually it is the grand domestic who sends us the schedule yes said the keeper i wouldnt be entirely surprised if someday the orphanotrophus joannes appeared at our gate to set your clock they say his seal is on everything these days perhaps i should petition him to find me a posting in the empress city well let us see what the new schedule is the keeper peeled apart the seal the superintendent crowded in so that he could read the paper as soon as it had been unfolded after a moment the keeper and the superintendent looked at each other in shock the most important messages were always scheduled for the second and third hours of the night while the evening winds still whipped clouds and fogs from the peaks for years now the message reserved for the second hour had been antioch besieged and for the third hour it had been antioch has fallen now there was a change the message for the second hour was the empress has been attacked and for the third hour the empress is dead so this plutarch was a greek ruled by the old romans and he wrote of both the greeks and the romans but before plutarch in the time of alexander the greeks ruled the world yes haraldr said anna happily haraldr leaned against the stone seat and watched a shaft of sun project a vivid aquamarine stripe over the darkening waters of the semicircular stonelined pool a column toppled from the row behind him lay across the seats nearby like a huge recumbent figure the temple to jupiter the old god the greeks called zeus stood ravaged at the far end of the pool only four delicately fluted columns remained to glow in the dying day behind the temple a much larger reservoir sat deep and still water from the limestone springs beneath daphne was collected here and sent to antioch via the soaringarched aqueducts that sloped away from the far end of the reservoir and disappeared into the distance all this had been built by the old romans yet much of it according to anna in imitation of the style of the ancient greeks haraldr marvelled at these dense intricate layers of time the world he had grown up in was so new in norway wooden shrines to thor that could not have been more than two hundred years old were all that could inspire memories of the ancients here amid these giant stone relics he could reach across time and touch the world of the old gods it is said that hadrian the emperor of rome who built this place also built a wall somewhere near your home in thule is that possible perhaps so i remember once when my brother returned from angleland someone talked of a wall haraldr shook his head in wonder in norse the terms for fool and stayathome were the same yet as far as he had now come from home he felt like the fool next to this bright beautiful girl he studied annas vivid almost unreal colour her face was like a painted statue her skin so white and her lips so intensely red and yet haraldr reflected her enchantment was not simply beauty if the empress was beauty enhanced by power and maria was beauty enhanced by carnal invitation then anna was beauty enhanced by knowledge she had said it was her mother who had insisted she learn of ancient texts that revealed the thoughts and breasts of men who had lived long ago when the old gods walked the earth and daphne was new incredible the more he observed them the more bewildering and beguiling these roman women became we must go anna sighed the shadows had dissolved into a lustrous twilight and the pillars of daphne were transforming into towering ghosts maria says that every sunset is a tragedy she does not like the night and yet anna trailed off with an enigmatic smile maria a witch who shunned the darkness that haraldr had seen deep in her own eyes in spite of anna he could not rid her from his mind he would have to talk to halldor what did the wise trader do when the merchant gave him gifts from his competitors booths if he and maria no longer gamed what was this there is one thing i must show you said anna as they descended from the reservoir a moment later she turned off the path and entered a small grove thick with vines here night had already settled she took his hand and he marvelled at the impossible smoothness and delicacy of her flesh the vines arched over them haraldr peered into the miasma ahead wait for your eyes to become more adept said anna confidently there the stone architrave supported by two columns materialised from deep shadow soon haraldr could even distinguish the greek letters chiselled onto the crumbling architrave hecate the temple of hecate whispered anna the greeks worshipped her as the goddess of diabolic magic she could raise the dead and make them appear to the living fylgya said haraldr with genuine respect spirits that wander among men you know them whispered anna come i want to tell maria we went down there she will be terrified that we even speak of it down haraldrs neck and shoulders tingled yes annas whisper had become a mysteriously urgent hiss hecate lives in the underworld look you can see the steps barely the narrow stone steps faded into the murk after a few ells gregory crossed himself haraldr nordbrikt i do not see well in the dark stay here said haraldr mercifully in case we become lost anna clutched haraldrs hand tightly and led him down step by step behind him haraldr could hear gregory reciting one of the poems called psalms that the warrior david had long ago composed for christs father soon there was an utter stillness broken only in the instants that foot touched stone the dampness made haraldr think of neorion the hell that rose in the sky ever down the smell of ancient stone more and more suffocating haraldr counted over a hundred steps and still they descended anna bumped against him and gave a little cry haraldr fought the reflex to grip his dagger he had been the fool once already today o sky whined anna haraldr heard her hand slap stone she said something to the effect that they could go no farther haraldr reached out and felt the cold grainy stone no farther he said hopefully in greek no farther whispered anna can you see me not well no anna lifted haraldrs hand and slowly took it to her warm marblesmooth face then she took his fingers away from her cheek and brought them down until he felt the lightest touch of silk she pressed his hand towards her and he could feel her hard nipple and small soft breast she exhaled once took his hand away and pulled him behind her as she scampered back up the steps anna smiled impishly in the relative light at the surface and said to gregory with a sigh we did not get to see the shrine we did not go all the way asked haraldr in greek anna smirked no the shrine has a step for every day of the year we only took one hundred and seventytwo steps the stairs have been blocked but we will still tell maria we saw the shrine anna wrapped both hands around haraldrs arm and led him away from the temple of hecate certainly you may have your leave brother zoe sat in her gilded portable throne the rounded back piled high with cushions of scarlet and skyblue silk she curled her goldflecked slippers beneath her you have provided us with all splendid daphne has to offer zoe raised her hand to indicate the marblerevetted hall her throne had been set in beyond the meloncoloured columns that ringed the courtyard lanterns played off the waters of a chiming fountain and our nephew has graciously consented to attend to myself and my ladies until we are safe in tripoli so go brother defend the trust my husband and your brother has given you and be assured that the convivial and benign reception accorded by your antioch will remain a cherished memento in my grateful heart your words are my solace answered constantine his brow gushing for tomorrow i will awake in a city that has lost its sun farewell sister mother light of the roman world chosen of god constantine crossed his arms over his chest and backed out of the room like a dog sneaking a stolen morsel haraldr stood rigid beside his mother wondering if he was able to conceal his shock and dismay now it was as plain as the nose on a face joannes through his surrogate constantine was behind a plot against the empress one that would surely take place before sun dappled daphne again and one that played haraldr as a dullwitted accomplice in the usurpation of his empress but why did his mother do nothing she had just permitted constantine to withdraw his thematic army to antioch citing some clearly contrived saracen threat to the city and blymmedess taghmatic forces and haraldrs varangians could not as the domestic had warned defend the entire perimeter of daphne they had had to rely on attalietess utterly incompetent and most likely disloyal thematic army to complete the cordon on the road from antioch that morning haraldr had had the opportunity to inspect attalietess troops and he had been astonished to find that most of them were baggage handlers and batmen for the pack mules and that many of those who were armed did not have proper weapons or healthy mounts it was a disgrace how could they all be so blind haraldr looked at maria and anna rolling dice at a table in the corner of the room opposite their mothers throne their laughter fused with the music of the fountains he was suddenly in the cold embrace of a theory he had never considered this was all a ruse there was a plot indeed but one of romans devilishly conspiring to rid their empire of the fairhair menace but then why had all these romans constructed such an elaborate ruse simply to eliminate him they had already had him in neorion had they since then discovered his identity there had been so many cryptic allusions and considered such extravagant measures justified by their morbid prophecies of a fairhair apocalypse did they intend to slaughter his pledgemen as well once they had eliminated him such reasoning was selfinflicted torture only one thing was certain he would not sleep tonight a dog barked in the ruins and a cock crowed prematurely it was still four hours until dawn the fountain in the courtyard of the empresss villa masked the norsemens words we wager on both stallions said ulfr if it is the empress who is to be a victim of this plot i will embrace the valkyrja at her side and if it is you haraldr said halldor together we will summon every carrion bird in serkland no said haraldr that honour is too great for me if i have led you into this if it is me who is to be attacked you must live to lead my pledgemen to safety i know that the romans have enemies nearby if you can fight your way out of here you could parlay with them my pledgemen may yet see their homes again with little thanks to their foolish leader besides i have learned an interesting tactic from the romans how to bait a snare and perhaps tonight by offering myself as the bait i may win something more valuable than all the roman gold we have acquired he paused and looked at his two stemfaced comrades i may win some answers the whiterobed figure emerged like a ghost from the dark hall symeon was indeed as indefatigable as a spirit it seemed as if he could not take the next step and yet day and night he was there attending to the smallest detail the wraithlike eunuch swished to haraldrs side mother wish to know guard relieved he croaked in a condescending bastardization of good greek you may tell my mother yes replied haraldr as fluently as he could he nodded to ulfr and the grimfaced norseman followed symeon into the hall halldor fixed haraldr with his implacable stare well he said with a faint smile i have no lady i guess i will have to spend this night with my sword in my arms he turned to walk away oh in the morning i think i need to tell you some more things the wise trader must know as casually as ever halldor vanished through the gate haraldr shook his head in amazement when the valkyrja came for him halldor would ask them to spread their legs his bravado bolstered by his friends insouciance haraldr began to reason where he could best place his snare he listened to the gurgling fountains a twoweekold moon silvered the dancing droplets here of course symeon already knew where he was no doubt others did as well wait here and they would come to him he sat on the damp tile enclosure of the fount to come behind him they would have to splash through the water a variation in the nights music that he could easily detect the dog barked again more distantly lost in this ancient world haraldr wondered if the gods had a purpose had they spared him at stiklestad along the dnieper among the saracen corpses only that he should die here tonight that could not be he was part of their plan haraldr felt a strange power surround him in the night wrapping him like the layers of fur that had armoured the terrible hound he was destinys instrument and when fate called him to the last battle he would come with his sword in hand he did not wait for long heels clicked on marble and the white robe came into the light leo he reached down and handed haraldr a tiny slip of paper the eunuch turned quickly and vanished with his bounding step heedless to haraldrs plaintive leo the message was in greek apparently the conspirators could not risk asking gregory to write the runes he might have warned haraldr that was obviously why the empress had wished to know of the bond between the interpreter and haraldr haraldr studied the brief message the translation was quite simple especially since he had seen the name written before come to hecate now haraldr had to compliment the romans on the elaborate construction of their trap the girl as the lure the perfect place for an assassination he removed his sword and set it by the fountain then raised his robe and snugged his dagger into his boot what could be more disarming than a man walking unarmed to his own execution daphnes shattered face was pearl like in the moonlight it was bright enough for haraldr to find the path that turned into the grove easily then the ivy bowers closed overhead and the light faded he walked slowly ahead and almost collided with one of the columns the inscription was unreadable now but the impenetrable void just beneath haraldrs feet was proof that this was hecate haraldr descended into the earth carefully counting each step his fingers darting against the damp increasingly slimy wall to maintain his orientation it seemed to him that if he lost contact with the wall he would not know up from down much less right from left in this inky oblivion after an eternity he reached the hundredth step at one hundred and sixty he would pause and listen for his murderer one hundred and fortyeight a noise something brushed past his leg and scurried up it was not relief that caused haraldr to shudder the fylgya would often take the form of small beasts one hundred and fiftyeight fiftynine sixty haraldr waited for his heart to cease echoing off the coffinlike walls he listened nothing even to ears strengthened by blindness nothing hecate was as still as death another five steps and haraldr listened again four more haraldrs skin crawled and yet he could sense nothing even this close to fates answer then the light of realization dawned the empress it is her they have plotted against after all as i voluntarily bury myself in this dungeon my mother and my pledgemen are probably struggling for their lives haraldr pivoted frantically lost his balance and stumbled haraldr pulled himself up his veins ice he had fallen three four steps he reached ahead nothing no stone the barrier he had felt that very afternoon was gone very slowly he descended another step gone haraldr paused on a threshold of fate up or down then something told him that the beast he could not run from waited below at two hundred and fifty steps the walls closed in haraldr had to turn sideways to squeeze through then there were no walls no steps he walked forward and smacked into a wall he ran his hand over the slimy surface he looked down at his feet and he could see them vague shadows against other shadows and the stairs were to his right down he went the light coming up to meet him like a winter dawn he was almost able to see each step before he set his foot on it at three hundred and twentyfive steps he squeezed through an even narrower passage than the one before and turned again in a grim vestibule lit by a flickering from below the last forty steps were straight down carved pilasters marked the entrance to the shrine the single lamp within the darkwalled chamber was set just above the doorway the sputtering flame flicked light over a tile basin filled with water the water was covered with a pale mist no steam the air was warm almost as sultry as a steam bath the statue of hecate stood on a low platform behind the basin it seemed as if she had been draped with a real robe of fine black fabric for only her delicate alabaster ankles and feet showed her head was bowed her hair painted so lifelike that it might have been as real as her cloak the statue moved haraldr stooped to pull his dagger from his boot never taking his eyes from the startling motion he backed away seeking the corner to protect his back and flanks if there were others the robe slid from the shoulders and the statue stood revealed in flawless alabaster except for the dark nipples and sable pelt between the legs the face turned up the lips were red and the eyes blue even in this light haraldr reeled from the blow he had never expected maria was his valkyrja her white skin drawing him on into the last black night of his mortality she stood still hair shimmering piercing azure eyes unblinking almost armoured in her nakedness haraldr took a tentative step forward and then his boots were wet and he was stumbling through the warm water she still beckoned her bloodred lips faintly parted he stood dumb disbelieving the perfection of her body the full womans breasts the erect areolae the unflawed curve of her hip the glistening pelt he stepped closer rapt at the flaring of her chiselled nose he did not see the knife until she had already raised it from her thigh he was powerless now refusing to believe that such beauty could be wedded to death he watched the heaving of her breast as her arm shot out there was a faint blue vein beneath the mercurous ivory surface of her skin the blade flickered against his throat she held him with her eyes he remembered the last time he had seen olafs eyes the sense that all time had fallen into that void it was as if his fate were within that abyss waiting for him to find it the knife moved swiftly when she cut his collar open she nicked his neck and the warm blood trickled never blinking she ripped downward slicing the front of his robe open her arm fell wearily as if she had freed herself of a great burden and the knife clattered on stone her breasts rose with a violent inhalation and she attacked the incisions in his garments ripping at silk and linen when she had exposed his almost immediate erection she knelt and pulled off his boots then her face was above his her hands searing velvet claws on his shoulders as she lifted herself like an adder she brought the point of her nose towards his he could no longer look at the blue fire in her eyes her smell seemed to drown him and his steel member reached for her she settled and he felt the fiery point of wetness she held there tantalizing pulling his hair hard pulling his head forward she came down slowly a consummate torturer if he arched upwards she drew back now raking his neck with her nails he placed his hands beneath her tensing thighs and could feel her wetness spilling onto the soft down beneath the sable patch she let her body slump against his and they both convulsed haraldr knew that the stars in the heavens reeled and pitched from their orbits there had never been a rage like the fury of this pleasure her spine was willowsupple and he pressed her to him her breasts kneading his chest then she would stiffen and tease him with the merest touch of her hard nipples she would writhe until he thought his brittle member would snap and then rise tightening rippling soothing him with her lips those delicate crimson lips gentle on his forehead and then she was mad sucking at his eyes his nose his lips sucking the blood at his neck biting and ripping until he felt fresh blood flow and in all this there was pleasure rising like the molten spume of a huge burning mountain maria rocked wrapped in coruscating clouds of sensation the scent of his blood the giant arms pressing her breathless the power that she could so wilfully control he was like the sun inside her his golden hair glowing with that sun the hardness of him all over yet the softness of his brilliant skin like gold leaf hammered to the suppleness of velvet and the death in his eyes what gods does he dance with now she wondered swaying and pumping listening for the music she knew he heard she pressed his chest clawing the curled gold threads her wide eyes reaching his and forcing him down to the cool marble slab she was close now close to the knife she felt the sun exploding inside her and knew she would be gone and it was now she strained for the knife and felt its silver handle hard and in an insane instant wondered if he would stay hard afterwards and could she keep him in until he cooled letting the night enter her again she had the knife now but she did not have his eyes there and then she went beyond the eyes before her floated with their whiteice blueness and she was beyond beyond him his one death to the thousand thousand souls he held in his eyes and she knew it would not end here there was more she dropped her knife the sun in her novaed and she fell away from her body her soul drifting with the glassy stars haraldr strained with every fibre to contain her violent spasms and then he burst inside her his whole being drained in an instant for a moment it was black before him and he wondered if he had been taken into her eyes into the whirling black vortex of fate haraldr saw the dagger before he saw his attackers huge shadowed form looming above him the knife fell like a comet towards marias still spasming back and he rolled flinging maria away like a doll he was on his feet before he could think the hound his mind screamed for a moment but the metalswathed giant in front of him was not the same the hound still had a piece of his nose but this man had only two inhuman gills the giants dagger swayed in front of him its movement hypnotic haraldr looked at the awful face ringed with helm and byrnnie like some demon warrior and knew that the rage was on it without armour or even a weapon haraldrs fate was indeed here in hecate haraldr waited for the monster to commit himself the knife continued its lulling serpent dance maria thrashed in the water near him momentarily distracting him from his attackers menace was maria the assassins helper as well as his bait maria lurched towards him the pommel of a knife touched his outstretched hand he could not look and for a moment would not believe a dagger and not his he could tell from the feel of silver rather than bone she pressed it into his grip haraldr did not wait for odin and his arm was as swift as thor the monsters dagger swiped against haraldrs shoulder but by then the point of haraldrs blade had crunched effortlessly through the gaping artificial orifice in the centre of the monsters face his eyes rolled back and when haraldr pulled the dagger from his brain he dropped like a dead walrus into the pool maria came to haraldr sobbing her hair plastered to her skull she nuzzled into his arms her heart pulsing like a birds and pressed her cheek against his chest her tears were warm haraldr turned her head with one hand and with his foot tilted up the lolling head of the floating corpse who was he he demanded i have seen him before maria said with a horror innocent beyond any conceivable guile and in that moment he was certain he could trust her in the grand hetairia she turned again to his chest her cheek smeared crimson from the wound on his shoulder she sniffled and stopped her sobs then she placed her lips against haraldrs chest and touched her velvet tongue to his trickling blood remember shoot the horses at close quarters spear the horses with your swords gut the horses keep your shields up and dont even concern yourselves with the riders until you have got them off their horses blymmedes looked at the incredulous faces of his norse colleagues believe me the saracen values his horse above the life of his closest comrade without his mount he is literally a legless man on an endless plain without food or water the value of his horse exceeds anything he could win in spoils or ransom kill enough horses and you dont need to kill saracens thats sensible enough haraldr nodded from what he had already seen the saracens huge swift horses were more formidable foes than the men who rode them but perhaps the ransom available to them here will incite them even to fighting on their own legs blymmedes turned in his saddle and checked again on the progress of the distended baggage train the imperial caravan had just left the crossroads where the road from antioch met the coast road an ancient highway that ran a few miles north to the seaport of st symeon and south past the port of laodecia all the way to tripoli beirut caesarea finally turning inland at arsuf to their destination of jerusalem i am certain they will consider the imperial baggage train a more convenient target than the sacred person of our mother an abduction of the empress would provoke massive punitive action as im certain you have seen the value of the baggage train is an empresss ransom without the attendant risk of retaliation so you think that is why the astute strategus nicon attalietes has ordered the imperial excubitores to guard the imperial baggage train asked haraldr with wry emphasis what if the saracens are to receive a ransom for not sparing the life of our mother blymmedes pushed back his golden helm and massaged his temples the varangian haraldr nordbrikt was a clever boy thought the domestic but perhaps his intellect was a bit too active he saw conspiracy in the rising of the sun each morning only one man in the entire roman empire was both devious and able enough to carry out such a plot and the orphanotrophus joannes knew that his brother lord god forgive me for thinking such a thought would not go shod in the imperial buskins for a single day without the divine sanction of the purpleborn niece of the great bulgarslayer but what about a plot engineered by the orphanotrophus joannes to embarrass the senator and magister nicon attalietes through the agency of the strategus meletius attalietes after all the orphanotrophus joannes was a dedicated enemy of the dhynatoi and blessedly so for if joannes and nicon attalietes ever joined forces the result would be too disagreeable to contemplate but if this conspiracy only aspired to slitting the throat of the scapegoat meletius attalietes let the orphanotrophus joannes conspire the purpleborn surely was safe the domestic looked at haraldr my friend im certain i would see demons scampering about by light of day if i had seen what you saw last night biymmedes thought of that obscene giant his brains oozing from the hole in his face and wished he could have seen haraldr dispatch him but i know the man who tried to kill you served in the hetairia and im almost certain that he was punished and expelled by the hetairarch for some illegal confiscation he had a grudge and you were the most convenient varangian im certain he is not an agent of some plot against our mother perhaps haraldr mind aching from sleeplessness and worry tried again to make sense of it what if the giant had not acted on his own who had sent him haraldr was too fatigued to think of the possibilities and his mind was too full of maria she appeared in a flash of alabaster he could feel her smooth wet skin the previous night he had taken her back to the villa before he had alerted his own men to the attempt on his life at the gate she had given him a kiss more erotic certainly more emotionally powerful than their embrace in the temple of hecate she had saved his life and he hers but that kiss had told him that they had yet to plumb the depths of their shared fate there biymmedes stood in his stirrups and pointed to the rugged crags that pushed the coast road against the azure band of the sea haraldr saw nothing but biymmedes assured him that a large saracen force was stirring dust in the heights were vulnerable now that we have turned south to laodecia theyre waiting im going to the empress said haraldr signalling gregory to follow he spurred ahead passing the huge baggage train of attalietess thematic army incredible he thought as he observed the rugs and pillows and wine jars these socalled soldiers had brought along before he had transited half of the thematic armys line of creaking wagons and groaning pack mules he was passed by two akrites heading in the opposite direction their dust and sweatstained mantles flying and their horses whipped to a furious foaming gallop only minutes later blymmedes came by heading towards the imperial carriages like a whirlwind this is it yelled the elbowsakimbo domestic haraldr whipped his horse in pursuit of blymmedes but by the time he reached the imperial carriages the domestic had already dismounted stopped the caravan and engaged himself in discussion with symeon and the resplendently armoured meletius attalietes halldor who had remained with the empresss carriage looked on helplessly haraldr was grateful when the dogged gregory arrived less than a minute later though even without his interpreter he had already discerned that the argument was over the disposition of forces to defend against an imminent attack i gather that domestic blymmedes wants to disengage half his force said gregory breathlessly in order to protect the empress if the saracens move for the imperial carriages or should the saracens capture part of the baggage train to pursue them while they are laden with spoils the strategus attalietes forbids this he commands the domestic blymmedes to use all his forces to guard the imperial baggage train as far as the strategus attalietes is concerned the matter is settled blymmedes continued his livid armthrusting presentation of his strategy but attalietes merely stood with his arms folded and his snub nose lifted blymmedes finally stopped stomped the dust layered over the paving stones and turned away then attalietes spoke to symeon you will not like this haraldr nordbrikt the strategus suggests that the empress in the person of her chamberlain symeon command the varangians to guard to guard the thematic army gregory cleared his throat anxiously excuse me i am embarrassed to have to clarify that to guard the baggage train of the thematic army haraldrs aching skull could not even momentarily contain his fury symeon he shouted i am ordered by the emperor himself to offer my life and that of all my men in defence of our mother i will not guard donkeys while she goes undefended haraldr stepped towards attalietes and narrowed his eyes at the arrogant strategus with satisfaction detecting the spark of fear symeon you tell this strutting peacock that we will die before we withdraw from the person of the empress and if the strategus attalietes wishes otherwise he will first have to convince my own sword haraldr did not add that there was now another life in the imperial carriage for which he would sacrifice his own a thousand times gregory translated with admirable emphasis attalietess pale forehead coloured blymmedes made no attempt to conceal his smile and symeon stared as if haraldr had worn red silk to an imperial banquet his lifeless fingers suddenly clasped in relative agitation symeon walked a few paces to her imperial majestys carriage and tapped the window the door opened slightly and symeon stuck his head in after a moment he walked back to the still speechless group of military men his corpselike composure restored he said nothing the door to the imperial carriage opened wide gilded wooden steps were placed in the dust leo dropped out in sparkling white silk theodore following with a goldtasselled silk parasol he quickly opened michael kalaphates leapt out cinching the leather straps of a bright new bronze breastplate embossed with a rearing lion leo extended a hand into the carriage and the pearl and goldstudded red silk slipper of zoe the purpleborn reached for the great roman road upon which she had travelled for perhaps a hundred rowingspells without ever setting down her foot supported by leo her face discreetly veiled in crimson gauze zoe watched as her commanders fell to their faces before her when they stood again she spoke to gregory in a husky fearless tone the strategus attalietes is the ranking military commander and as such he represents the will of my husband our father in the matter of my defence komes haraldr if you do not carry out his order i will command your centurion here to administer summarily the punishment for treason she turned and fixed halldor with a stare that blanched even his face if your centurion will not perform this duty i will order the domestic blymmedes to carry out the execution of both traitors haraldr looked at blymmedes and saw no indication that his friend would not do as his empress had commanded he mastered his rage at his own impotence but his breast was leaden with the thought that maria would share her empresss fate but perhaps blymmedes was right the baggage train would be the objective what could he achieve anyway now forced to place halldors head on the block and challenge his friend blymmedes and it seemed the empress was determined to perform her own execution almost unable to breathe haraldr bowed deeply gave the order for the varangians to redeploy and backed up to his horse with his arms crossed over his breast at least he had another answer it was the strategus meletius attalietes who wanted his empress dead shielded by her parasol from the glancing lateafternoon sun zoe kissed michael kalaphates on the forehead and wished him the beneficence of the theotokos then assisted by her eunuchs she returned to her carriage and settled beside maria we will wait here zoe said calmly her lips mused sensuously when we are finally put away and at our privacy you must tell me about your interview last night with the komes you have put such a fire in his eyes and my darling well i have never seen your countenance quite so avid we will talk of it during the long days ahead you know your mother is fascinated by details maria said nothing lost in her labyrinth of fear and desire could this be the death his eyes had promised her the night before was this where the three lines crossed little daughter the empress said soothingly surely you are not worried about this zoe waved her hand languidly symeon assures us that the emir of aleppo is most hospitable blymmedes pointed to the dust cyclones that had appeared at the head and tail of the long motionless imperial columns his infantry were raising their own reddish clouds as they returned to formation after spreading thousands of spiked iron balls called caltrops on the plain between the road and the sea there komes haraldr you see how they are flanking the column at both ends now they will circle back to come in with the sun behind them thats why i spread my caltrops to the seaward side if i were giving the orders i would send my light cavalry there he pointed north to a distant point along the coast and there now blymmedes pointed south and crush them in my pincers when they fell on the baggage train blymmedes slapped his hands together and looked with admiration at the line of varangians in gleaming byrnnies fortunately your men are adept at static defence well good luck komes haraldr blymmedes waved dashingly as he galloped back to the imperial baggage train haraldr turned to his men dismounted and lined up facing the sea as blymmedes had suggested haraldr had placed archers behind the first spearwielding shieldraised rank the overloaded mules behind the archers wheezed and brayed and the batmen chattered with nervous excitement haraldr rode out in front of the varangians stood in his stirrups and tried to strike a balance between his own utter despair and the kind of valiant exhortation that would merely humiliate his men further they knew they guarded mules and rugs this time the maumets men will not be ghosts he shouted evenly as if giving routine instructions remember we must first shoot horses then spear horses then if the men still come against us we will let them feel the bite of hunland steel haraldr had expected the halfhearted acknowledgement he received but the muttering only fuelled his anxiety the men had every right to be dispirited he thought stallions asked to pull the plough alongside the ox and the mule after perhaps a quarter of an hour the sound came from the sea at first the noise was almost like wind whistling through a narrow opening but it quickly rose and fragmented into the trillings of an enormous and angry flock a rusty pall soon shrouded the sea and then the glittering cloud of dust boiled out of the sun the noise seemed to advance and retreat in a horrible shrill wailing the saracen host rode forward at a pace that seemed unreal as if nature had somehow compressed time they were dressed much like the romans own akrites spectacularly in silver and white helms and curved blades glimmering before the dust cloud that they seemed to outrace their unearthly shrieking rising and falling in violent rhythm scraped the nerves haraldr stood at the centre of his varangian wall his shield set and gave his bowmen the order to fire almost instantly the huge white and black and grey dappled horses in the vanguard toppled legs buckling and skewing but the rest leapt over the writhing beasts and their hapless riders making little attempt to avoid crushing their own men haraldr took a step forward and set his spear arrows clattered against the varangian shields haraldr wondered how men on horses were attaining such prodigious bowshots but the return salvo brought down another rank of horsemen still the rest came on now only a hundred ells away the horsemen abruptly veered whipping light throwingspears against the varangian shields as they turned off towards the north another salvo from the varangian archers and the horses and riders began to pile up the following ranks were refusing to advance beyond the flailing parapet of fallen mounts saracen arrows still rained with surprising force against the norse wall of shields but haraldr could not see a single varangian down haraldr yelled for halldor and ulfr to come to the centre have we slain enough of their horses asked halldor dryly haraldr shook his head they seemed bold enough even within our bowshot perhaps they are tempting us to begin our own offensive kristr haraldrs sudden epiphany clutched at his belly this is only the feint the empress haraldr brought his head back and bellowed so that he was heard over even the cataclysmic shrilling of the saracens boar the line of varangians almost instantly reformed into the impenetrable wedge of the swinearray haraldr took the snout flanked by halldor and ulfr the saracens quieted for a moment as varangian axes pounded on shields as the boar moved to the south the mounted fury of the saracens raced to blunt its snout haraldr did not know how long the rage seized him so immense was the relief of feeling odins favour again he thought he could slash and hack until his blade wore to a nub the saracens were indeed brave they came forward in endless files with their howling black faces and agate eyes their silver arcs swishing and they fell relentlessly to the norse blades haraldrs boots were soaked with blood when the saracen horde finally disappeared almost vaporously like a sea mist rolling back from a morning sun the road ahead was littered with corpses like terrible blossoms white robes and quilted cotton jerkins were spotted with brilliant crimson roman and saracen corpses at first then a growing preponderance of romans quilted armour soaked sleeveless byrnnies glazed red conical helms cast everywhere horses bleated in agony joined by the screams of men the vultures made obscene circles above the thematic army of cilicia had been virtually annihilated the imperial carriages were surrounded by a low ridge of corpses several whiterobed eunuchs sat wailing beating their chests and tearing at their silken hems symeon stood like a corpse that had neglected to fall a darkhaired silkclad woman wandered dazed and haraldr breast exploding began to run to maria but no it was anna then haraldr saw the empresss purplepanelled carriage the lumbering fourwheeled wagon had been tipped over the goldscrolled whitelacquered door on the upturned side was open numb with horror haraldr peered inside the scent that lingered her scent choked him with anguish the carriage was empty blymmedes charged up and leapt off his horse his face pale and scowling beneath his golden helm clearly shocked he stumbled over the corpses and looked inside the carriage he turned to haraldr with pain in his eyes and whispered you are the better tactician my friend then he turned over one of the saracen corpses the man had a neat black beard and decayed teeth that showed between slightly parted claret lips one of his eyes had become a livid bruise but the other was open and the staring iris was as black as a ravens plume not saracens said the domestic hoarsely tears welling in his eyes seljuks haraldr looked across the plain to the sea the sun skimmed rays over distant golden ripples he turned and the snowy crests to the east flared with the glow of the plunging orange globe where was his mother and where was his love distractedly the pain too great for thought he began to check the fallen for signs of life he nudged a shoulder and turned a limp body on its back he knew the nowbattered bronze breastplate before he saw the face michael kalaphates haraldr ripped away the breastplate and hollered for water for the bloodied lips kalaphates was alive komes haraldr left kalaphates with the waterbearer and ran to blymmedes who knelt beside a corpse he had uncovered from beneath several slain seljuks his arrogant features almost serene the strategus meletius attalietess body reposed in eternal sleep his golden breastplate punctured by a broken spear and his golden helm crushed into his skull just above his ear blymmedes sealed attalietess partially open eyes with respect closed his own and whispered an epitaph for the strategus he fought bravely the magnara palace was dark and empty the tapestries shrouds on the wall the golden throne a looming silhouette the carpets had been rolled up and the blackfrocked figure paced the bare marble despite the size of his enormous spadeshaped boots the orphanotrophus joannes made no sound to mask the whisper of his fine wool frock as he walked he calculated the time as he calculated everything in his head with unerring precision he did not need to rely on the endlessly clicking water clocks that coerced lesser men because he could rely on the sound no not the sound but something more subtle more intuitive of the city his city he could sense its rhythms the rising in the morning and the settling at night with ineffable primal instinct in the way a bee might locate its hive it was a vibration only he could feel and it told him the time with far more precision that the grandiose machines the dhynatoi amused themselves with and from the movements of his city he could also discern much that those clocks would never tell their owners high on their hilltop palaces but at this moment only time concerned him it goes well this much he permitted himself the message received in the second hour exactly according to plan the third hour had passed with no signal that was an enormous relief particularly given the unpredictability of the agents they were dealing with but the excruciating effort would be for naught if the fourth hour passed without a message and his city told the orphanotrophus that the fourth hour of the night was three quarters gone the message was already a few minutes overdue hating his own lack of control the orphanotrophus walked behind the throne left the audience chamber through the silent hidden entrance used by the emperor climbed the large spiral staircase to the cabinet chamber and took the smaller staircase up into the clock room and observation deck the attendants went about their duties accustomed to if not comfortable with the lurking presence of the giant monk joannes stepped out onto his own private balcony adjacent to the observation deck lamps flared along the towering seawall beneath him and the bright points of ship lanterns drifted on the bosporus here and there the asian palaces of the dhynatoi formed little constellations off into the east he knew the exact position of mount afxendios and stared without blinking only ten minutes left in the hour eight the beacon glimmered for a tantalizing instant then more brilliant than the evening star the light that had begun in faraway toulon exploded and flared across the last expanse of asia minor a pity thought joannes as he quickly turned and headed back into the palace the senator and magister nicon attalietes has lost his favourite son joannes opened the door to the small groundfloor antechamber a disused room once employed for storage of the censers and icons that cluttered the magnara on ceremonial occasions joannes had had many of these superfluous treasures melted into more utilitarian assets his guest waited in darkness and joannes lit a single oil lamp he had learned years ago that men found flickering light on his face far more frightening than simply his voice emerging from the shadows thank you for waiting joannes told his guest the man shifted his clumsy sandalled feet and bowed deeply his rough burlap tunic exposed thick burly calves his face was round but had long seamlike scars from which his jowls seemed to hang as if wired to his face his richly veined nose was studded with two warts he smelled of cheap resiny wine i wanted you and your friends to know the truth before the dhynatoi begin to shovel their lies about the city said joannes a terrible tragedy has occurred due to the negligence of the powerful who have so much while you have so little the powerful who impede every effort your imperial administration makes to ease your suffering no one has done more for us than yourself who we worship as the blessed hand of christ the king orphanotrophus said the man in a brutishly obsequious voice the growl of a bear paying sincere homage to a lion he clutched his broad scabbed fists to his tunic as he spoke in a gesture of humility and anxiety you know how much we folk are beholden to what you have done joannes studied the clutching hamhock fists with satisfaction the butcher he did not know the mans real name nor did he care to know had in fact been a real pork butcher once he had run afoul of the prefect for buying his swine outside the city at prices below the officially mandated wholesale rates then charging an exorbitant markup at his shop in the city of course it was not that crime that had condemned him his fate had been sealed by his refusal to share the requisite portion of the illicit profit with the prefect joannes had found the butcher in the neorion tower where he often browsed for suitable instruments of his myriad policies and now the butcher was still a butcher of sorts joannes stepped forward and enveloped the butchers powerful shoulders in his grotesque fingers i prayed all afternoon to the holy veil begging the holy mother for the strength to convey my sorrow to my friends in the city who should know first of this calamitous event joannes stroked the butchers shoulder paternally and lowered his voice to an awkward rasping whisper our purpleborn mother has been raped by the saracens the butchers bleary eyes froze with shock and then thawed with flowing tears theotokos theotokos theotokos he wailed frantically oh beseech we holy mother spare our mother spare our mother oh theotokos theotokos my mother my mother the butcher thundered his chest with his rockhard fists slumped to his knees and began to rip the front of his tunic to shreds joannes watched incredulous as always at the devotion of the rabble to the painted harlot they called their mother in zoes case it was not simply the centuriesold association of the empress of the romans and the mother of her people with the empress of heaven and the mother of god zoe also had the legacy of the bulgarslayer dyed into the weft of her purpleborn being the bulgarslayer who had diligently and when necessary ruthlessly protected the people of his city and his empire from the merciless depredations of the dhynatoi seeing the wailing butcher before him joannes again reminded himself that the macedonian dynasty would have to be excised from the hearts of the clamouring mob with the greatest of surgical precision joannes knelt beside the slobbering butcher and cradled the greasy roughfleshed head brother brother he said in a low rumble like a distant shaking of the earth fear not for our mother i have already dispatched the grand domestic and our imperial taghmata to effect the rescue of her sacred person the brutish eyes turned to joannes gratefully yes brother let us now think to transform our tears into a righteous vengeance there has been fault here the butcher stiffened yes it was the dhynatoi meletius attalietes who cravenly abandoned our blessed mother to the unclean heretics that vile recreant is beyond our reach now but the father the demonsire who engineered this plot against our mother is well within your grasp the butcher bolted to his feet his fingers strangling the air his chest heaved with rage there boomed joannes do you see him joannes extended his vast arm span to a dark corner of the antechamber the archangel michael he appears to lead you in vengeance against those who having deprived you of everything save the love of your mother now wish to deprive you of your empress go to your friends in the city and tell them what the archangel has commanded you to do archangel michael messenger of god roared the butcher his rapt eyes fixed on the empty corner the augusta theodora wrapped her long arms around her slender torso her limbs tense and her expression pained as if she were trying to crush her own ribs her eyes welled with tears for some reason grief made her look much younger almost boyish thank you for telling me yourself father you know your guidance is the balm for all my disquietudes alexius patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith smiled gently he had come to theodoras country palace as soon as his informants in the magnara had brought him the news of her sisters abduction the patriarch showed no sign of fatigue from his long night on the road he had a powerful yet elegant face his nose was long and jutting with a craglike tip poised above thin almost feminine lips his heavy somewhat brutish eyebrows were streaked with black and they ended at his temples in wiry tufts his beard was like an extrusion of fine pure silver wires his small black eyes were fierce but controlled like leashed hunting cats i was frightened for her said theodora may the pantocrator forgive me for not setting my pride aside and going to her with my fears i will never forgive myself there was no reason to be apprehensive about this pilgrimage at least within the saracen territories i myself made inquiries alexiuss voice was a heavy tenor like his eyes seemingly capable of vastly more powerful effects than the patriarch cared to display at this moment i will probably be unable to confirm my suspicions but i believe this abduction to be the work of heretics who call themselves christians and not the sons of hagar theodora immediately understood to whom alexius was referring father i cannot believe that even joannes could consider this father he could not keep his brother on the throne without my sister why if it is he he would not be acting against your sister and indeed i believe she will not be harmed i suspect some fashion of manoeuvre against the dhynatoi your sister is merely in a jeopardy we all share in his demonic pursuit of his personal ambitions in his persistent and diabolical attacks upon my person and the one true faith under my stewardship joannes threatens every soul born into the world from now until the trumpet of judgement sounds it is not joannes the murderer of men i fear it is joannes the murderer of souls do you understand the true seriousness of his crimes my child theodora stared thoughtfully at the floor i know that he is trying to redraft the typica of hundreds of monastic establishments to withdraw them from your jurisdiction alexius ruled a virtual empire within the empire consisting of thousands of churches vast landholdings an entire system of patriarchal courts and a huge bureaucracy to manage it one of the principal sources of revenues was the income from monasteries granted their typica or charters by the patriarch by issuing typica under imperial sanction joannes could divert those revenues from alexiuss empire to his own alexius placed his long elegant fingers together just beneath his chin his golden rings caught the light from the single brass candelabrum he wore a thickly embroidered white robe and a white shawl emblazoned with gold crosses his eyes were unleashed now stalking a prey joannes weakens the one true faith at the moment that it requires every resource to combat a far more malignant infection the bishop of old rome is a wily servant of the fallen archangel and what satan himself could not accomplish these socalled roman pontiffs may succeed in achieving with this filioque they are demonbent on inserting into the holy creed their insistence that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son rather than from the father through the son denies the operation of that spirit in our souls indeed it denies the pantocrator himself his divine patrimony from god the father if the latin creed is allowed to become standardized throughout the christian sees then every soul receiving the sacraments under that doctrine is in jeopardy with that single unholy word the infidel will have defeated us and the gates of hell will receive all the descendants of adam but i cannot combat this infection until i have extirpated joannes theodora crossed herself i have always despised joannes but before tonight i had not fully understood the urgency of opposing him i will help you in any way i can father alexius looked away and his eyes finally pounced on some invisible quarry yes my child i am certain you will i order a halt said the strategus constantine the domestic nicon blymmedes turned to him blymmedes seemed to have aged a decade in a single night this pursuit is useless selfexcoriation continued constantine we will be too exhausted to fight when we get there and that presumes that we are even taking the proper route after all your socalled intelligence is responsible for this catastrophe that and the foolishness of attalietes may the pantocrator have mercy on his soul had i known we were dealing with seljuks i certainly would have stayed with the empress and taken command myself this never would have happened haraldr listened already hating that name seljuks they were believers in maumet or muhammad as he was known to the romans who was either the son of or wizard to a god named allah the seljuks had many of the characteristics of the pechenegs they migrated in great hordes on veritable herds of fast horses which they rode expertly they were heedless of their lives in combat and they even had the same beetle faces but the seljuks were wealthier and more organized than the pechenegs because they already had begun to conquer less warlike saracens in a rich place far to the northeast called persia blymmedes said that the seljuks had never been this far west before and that this was probably a renegade tribe hired out to the emir of aleppo however the domestic had also told haraldr that he considered the seljuks a plague that would someday spread west and make the romans forget all other foes but right now these seljuks were retreating east at an astonishing pace and despite the gutjarring evening and night in the saddle the swift light cavalry units of the imperial excubitores and the thematic army of antioch there were virtually no surviving horses or men from the thematic army of cilicia could not bring them in sight the pursuit through the plains of the orontes river valley had been especially brutal for the varangians who simply couldnt ride with the romans but had maintained the pace through sheer endurance and tenacity and now they were going up again back into the rocky foothills that would soon rise to even more torturous heights blymmedes heard approaching hoofbeats and hailed the rider one of an endless relay of akrites who had ridden ahead of and behind the column all night long he turned to constantine if we do not intercept them before they make aleppo i am certain we will not see our empress for some time and the ransom could be insuperable i assure you our father will bear any demands to obtain the safety of his wife said constantine indignantly he did not add that the price had already been fixed and in any event would come from a contingency fund that joannes had amassed with a triple surcharge to the window tax levied a year ago in all eighteen asian themes the emir of aleppo has made an alliance he will soon regret said blymmedes he may not be able to control his seljuk servants and i assure you they are nowhere near as cognizant of imperial protocol as the good emir is constantine straightened in his saddle the alarms clanging in his roadassaulted skull that would be the end of them all why hadnt joannes thought of this then the alarms were replaced by sweeter music well perhaps the august orphanotrophus joannes simply could not dictate everything to brother out here in farflung antioch perhaps brother would have to rescue this perhaps notsothoroughly planned enterprise with his own astute initiative ah but brother must be careful he was reaching high and he should provide a bed of straw to cushion his fall if he did not attain his objective what is your plan domestic growled constantine with feigned uninterest i believe they will stop water and fodder their horses and rest for a few hours then they will send half their force in one direction to mislead or even harass us while the rest will proceed directly to aleppo i believe they will make this stop at a fortified place between here and aleppo asked constantine irritably blymmedes was falling to pieces he was a typical career military man constantine reflected crowing lustily atop his own dung heap but at an utter loss in true adversity the closest fortification is only eight leagues from aleppo why would they pause there have you ever sent a reconnaissance as far as harim blymmedes was astonished the saracens exerted control of the countryside only several leagues east of antioch wasnt constantine concerned as to what the infidels might be up to right on his own threshold our tax collectors dont go out that way any more answered constantine we dont need those revenues and not many peasants are willing to farm out there what with nothing to protect them save the ruins of the kastron near harim a kastron was a fortified town i suppose you would suggest i rebuild the kastron the cost would hardly be offset by the increase in tax revenues you should focus on military matters domestic with which you seem to have ample difficulty as it is leave civil administration to those with the requisite expertise you would not need to rebuild the kastron strategus my akrites have seen it recently the saracens have rebuilt it for you for a moment constantine refused to believe blymmedes very well he then conceded to himself perhaps one did become contemptuous of saracen threats within the walls of antioch so you think they will pause at the kastron if it is such a threatening fortification how do you expect to besiege it with several exhausted droungos of light cavalry i think if we appear we will bottle them up then we can bring up siege machinery and go to work on the walls constantine frowned trying to make sense of this new music it was becoming increasingly titillating to his ear yes most pleasant with the siege engines in place the leader of the seljuks might be compelled to negotiate independently of his agreement with the emir of aleppo he might be convinced to surrender his prize at a significant discount and the emir could hardly grumble because he had already received partial payment and would be relieved of having to compensate his seljuk hirelings and the enormous sum left in difference well of course that would be returned to joanness special treasury minus a suitably ample reward for the extraordinarily illustrious engineer of this successful conclusion ah very sweet music indeed but what if the seljuk beasts are not so reasonable well that was the risk one had to take or else remain in antioch for ever besides there was an easy way to indemnify himself constantine pulled himself erect i concur with your judgement domestic but since your intent for the moment is merely to frighten the infidels into remaining at the kastron i reason that it would make sense for me to withdraw my forces to antioch and begin requisitioning the appropriate siege equipment constantine tugged his horses reins and rode off without waiting for a reply what a filthy man zoe pulled her veil more tightly around her face her blue eyes shone like gems in the dismal room the eunuch who spoke only the local arabic dialect set the silver tray down then bowed and retreated as if he had been addressed with appropriate decorum maria sat crossedlegged on a stained linen cushion balefully studying the four saracen women who sat against the wall opposite her the plaster was new but the tapestry that covered much of it was motheaten and faded can you imagine said zoe airily i had heard that their women were veritable chattels but the emirs and ambassadors we have dealt with were always so civilized apparently here they are rather less gracious im certain that their stables are cleaner than their womens quarters of course given the choice the brutes who have absconded with us might prefer the enchantments of their steeds to these greased piglets they call their wives the saracen women three chubby barely pubescent children and one darkly pretty young woman tittered shyly at the empresss dismissive gesture and then resumed their entranced study of the silkdraped woman they understood to be the mother of the prophet christ maria caressed the back of her hand with the fingers of the other and avoided zoes inquiring look little daughter admonished zoe you are making far too much of this tomorrow we shall be in aleppo we shall have our leo back and no doubt the emir will immediately regale us with tales of his exotic land you know that their literature is so much more forthright than ours dont you dear i suppose that explains why all the sons of hagar are so frightened of women that they must keep them locked away after all they have heard so many epics of these temptations pity that the reality is so artless have you noticed the coarseness of their complexions we will never see aleppo marias voice was so deep and soughing that it scarcely seemed to be her own little daughter dont tell me the prophet who haunts the orient has taken you as his deputy you are as gloomy as a bogomil from wherever have you received this intimation he told me suddenly maria whipped her head her eyes fired and she spat the words out he told me while he loved me zoe pursed her lips in deliberation my darling she said with paired concern and anticipation would you like to elaborate on that marias eyes were almost phosphorescent i had intended to kill him as i had in my dream i even had the knife zoe shut her eyes and leaned against the wall oh darling i had hoped that was all done with that was so long ago you mustnt go on reliving that accident with every other man everyone knows you are not at fault there has never been a man like this man this haraldr maria clutched her arms and cocked her head her voice was hypnotic all the rest have simply drawn the poison out of me sucking away the putrescence of my soul with the proboscis between their legs feeding on that obscene gruel because it is the only sustenance their own corruption can digest they leave me empty yet cleansed of my own toxins this man filled me with the brilliance of the stars the sun a thousand suns a light pure and searing an incandescence in which every fate is revealed a light in which i saw love and death as lovers joined in the mad ecstasy i shared with them at the moment that light flared to infinite brilliance he offered me an exchange he offered me that light in exchange for my life he offers that trade to everyone he touches i saw it in his eyes there are souls trapped in his eyes a thousand thousand souls for a thousand years i know i am with them now he lives and i will die zoe slid next to maria and took her limp almost lifeless hand little daughter she said with a sigh now you have entered a realm i perhaps know better than you she wrapped her arms around marias visionstiffened shoulders our komes haraldr has beguiled you fear is the most powerful aphrodisiac it not only arouses passion but also bonds souls you were there when he killed that man werent you maria nodded numbly blood excites me i wanted him to make love to me again zoe raised her eyebrows for a moment well she said conclusively we are each plagued with our passions i am a slave to simple caresses and the merest devotions while you being rather more cosmopolitan have developed more complex desires we can never fully exhaust these passions and yet we can acquire the wisdom to endure them you are wise my child you will endure long after this komes haraldr has gone back to the frostbreasted maidens of distant thule zoe kissed marias forehead i rather think your unwarranted inquietude at our predicament has inflamed your memory of the golden giant when we see him again you will find him just another tauroscythian curiosity you are not afraid mother marias eyes were wide and incandescent of course not i am the most valuable being beneath our lords sight the ransom i can bring is worth far more than any goal that might be obtained by placing my soul before the judgement of god no one clever enough to steal me would be fool enough to kill me zoe stroked marias downy temple with her fingers no little daughter i do not fear the hands i have fallen into however rough and unwashed they may be i do not fear a confinement that will probably be long longer than i can permit your precious heart to suffer before it must but now i know what must be done when we finally return to my city and my people and when i think of that i know fear the mandator chief intelligencegathering officer of the imperial excubitores spoke in arabic to the squat scruffybearded man a petty merchant from the look of his uncalloused hands and his dirty linen robe the merchant showed several blackened teeth as he jabbered in a singsong voice as he spoke he seemed to clutch frantically at the vague groundclinging earlymorning mist the mandator gestured to the mans cup and ordered a batman to fill it with more wine he bowed to the merchant and stepped back to talk with blymmedes and haraldr hes an arab from this place not a seljuk said the mandator a wiry spookyeyed man who usually dressed just like the akrites he supervised he says they rebuilt the kastron for defence and they have no wish to invite quarrel with the romans according to him the seljuks have murdered the governor of the kastron and have sent out couriers to the east the mandator lowered his bristling sunbleached brows for a moment fixing his usually wandering eyes he is telling the truth i have no need to intensify his interrogation blymmedes nodded agreement see that the paymaster attends to him he turned to haraldr it appears the hireling has initiated his own scheme are you prepared to interrogate the seljuk haraldr pulled his knife from his belt and nodded blymmedess akrites had chased down a contingent of the seljuk rear guard and had succeeded in capturing a seljuk warrior good said blymmedes it is important that you do it they think you fairhairs are demons christs avengers the seljuk waited on his knees his arms bound behind him haraldr forced his hands to steady this was not his type of business and it required a kind of courage that he had not considered before but blymmedes had convinced him how important this was and he needed no convincing of the importance of the lives this wretch might save when his tongue was persuaded to glibness the seljuks bright feral eyes widened when he saw the golden giant approach then he remembered his own fierce father and his big brothers who had swatted him and he spat at the demons boots allah would soon embrace him haraldr held the seljuks eyes he reached around and slit the rope that held the seljuks hands then raised him up he signalled the batman to give him a bowl of steamed grain with bits of sliced lamb the seljuk looked at the bowl sniffed and barked something in his staccato tongue an akrites who knew the seljuk dialect many of them did spoke in greek to gregory who then translated for haraldr he says why should he poison himself he excuse me haraldr nordbrikt calls you a huge pig haraldr looked into the furious curiously smug face the man was not much older than haraldr with a dense black beard and a sharp handsome nose he clearly prided himself as an indomitable warrior and was probably one of their officers haraldr took the bowl from the seljuks hands shovelled several handfuls of the food into his own mouth chewed at length and swallowed before handing the bowl back the seljuk snatched the bowl from haraldr and devoured the rest of the dish like a ravenous dog does he wish more asked haraldr the seljuk nodded and another bowl was brought tested by haraldr and served and then another did their guest wish to drink watered wine was brought tested and poured for him was their guest at last satiated the seljuk nodded eyes gleaming certain that allah had bewitched his foes haraldr gestured that he would relieve the seljuk of the burden of his empty goblet when he had given the cup to the batman he turned suddenly clamped his hand to the seljuks forehead like a vice and neatly sliced his right ear off the seljuk was rigid with shock blood streamed down his neck and dripped off his shoulder haraldr seized the seljuks jaw popped it open and stuffed the ear in tell him to eat his ear the seljuk fell to his knees retching and coughing haraldr knelt with him his hands over the seljuks mouth and nose eat the seljuks eyes seemed to grasp for the air denied his lungs haraldr held his knife to the desperate face again tell him to eat his ear or i will feed him his other ear and then his nose haraldr waited for the translation and sliced skin from the tip of the nose and then i will make him eat the nose that droops between his legs he lowered the knife to the mans belly slit the coarse linen robe and made a shallow cut across the abdomen and if he does not eat i will find another way of filling his belly haraldr then placed the bloody point of the dagger against the tear gland of the seljuks right eye when he has seen all this we will provide him a dessert he will have no trouble swallowing his eyes haraldr pushed against the seljuks face and toppled him backwards then our physicians will make certain that he lives haraldr stood over the seljuk like an ancient titan the first question saves his eyes after a few minutes of verbal interrogation the seljuk had gratefully saved everything except his previously forfeit right ear it was an ominous tale the seljuks had been in the pay of the emir of aleppo but now planned to keep the empress as their own property they intended to rendezvous with a larger seljuk force riding from the east then retreat with their prize to a series of mountain redoubts in northern persia beyond the reach of any power even the romans the ransom they extorted would finance their westward ambitions for this reason they saw no need to deliver the empress once their demands had been met for if their demands were met they would soon enough be at war with the romans blymmedes asked haraldr and gregory to accompany him they climbed a rocky path that snaked to the summit of a sheer outcropping the kastron now four or five bowshots away was a sinister apparition in the moonlight a dungeon rather than a town the dark walls were only about two bowshots on a side but they were a good twentyfive ells high and were rooted in a roughly faceted summit that scarcely allowed purchase to a few scrubby trees toothlike merloned battlements ran along the top of the wall in the crenellated openings the robes of the seljuk sentries were visible as a pale luminescence i dont like sieges said blymmedes it is work for engineers not soldiers towers tortoises fire blowers mangonels of course it would take weeks to bring the equipment up here dig the tunnels and entrenchments and erect the engines and there are too many seljuks inside such a small place so they would first slaughter the inhabitants to preserve food a disagreeable business altogether blymmedes paused and frowned even more deeply the lines were like slits in his leathery forehead of course that is the simple problem and now its solution offers us nothing my akrites have already encountered the reconnaissance elements of the seljuk force and have interrogated though not as eloquently as you komes haraldr one of their scouts the relief is quite a large force and only a day away even if my infantry arrives tomorrow evening to help us initiate the siege we would not be able to withstand both the relief force and the force inside and of course we do not know when constantine will return with his thematic forces though with such assistance as he will offer we might hope he is delayed indefinitely i do not see any way we can prevent the empresss abductors from escaping into the plain of aleppo and from there to wherever they may wish to go blymmedes folded his arms looked up at the brooding kastron and shook his head haraldr studied the walls at the back of the kastron the crenellations were almost crested by a twentyellwide lip of tortured rock that fell away to a sheer drop of almost two hundred ells how wide are those walls on top asked haraldr three men abreast answered blymmedes his brow slightly unfurrowing so despite the considerable number of these seljuks inside were i to gain access to those walls i would only have to worry about three men at a time that is true said blymmedes but how would you get on the walls and what objective could you accomplish on the walls alone for you could never survive a descent into the town my comrade said haraldr with renewed vigour the seljuk who leads this army impresses me as a bold ambitious leader who can count on the fanatical loyalty of his men why else would they have joined him in this daring escapade up on those walls my objective will be to meet face to face with this noble warrior but before i can achieve this intercourse i will need you to help me with a diversion the drums broke the dawn the kastron was a blocky silhouette against a radiant sunrise still hidden by the summit five light cavalry vanda of the imperial excubitores and four hundred varangians advanced in stately formation to within a bowshot of the walls the mandator of the imperial excubitores domestic nicon blymmedes at his side formally called upon the walled town to surrender to his majesty michael emperor basileus and autocrator of the romans for several minutes the only sounds were the snorting of horses in the roman ranks and the faint crowing of roosters from inside the citadel the scream began inside the walls for a very long minute the sound left the kastron and was amplified among the surrounding crags finally assaulting the roman forces like a dry biting nervescraping wind then the scream lifted into the sky and became pure and clear sheer human terror the body flew against the lightening sky arms and legs milling madly for a moment it seemed to succeed in gaining desperate flight then it plunged sickeningly the scream lowering in pitch and ending with the sound of a bag of wet sand smashing into a wooden wall naked arms akimbo like a huge pitiful plucked bird the body lay on the rocks in front of the roman formation the head was cocked perpendicular to the spine blymmedes walked forward and gently lifted it haraldr did not know the man at first because the facial skin had been slit at the forehead and peeled off like a rabbits pelt then he saw the eyes terror still intact leo the empresss eunuch blymmedes faced the citadel a figure stood framed in a crenellation just above the thick wooden main gate the seljuks white silk seemed to have a phosphorescent corona he called down in a powerful voice that bounded stridently off the rocks the mandator translated his name is kilij he is the leader of these seljuks he says withdraw or he will see if the woman can fly any better than the eunuch cold hands knotted haraldrs intestines he struggled with a maddening urge to run forward and settle with kilij but no the plan he must meet this kilij blymmedes and haraldr discussed kilijs ultimatum with animated gestures just the type of argument among commanders one might expect before a cowardly retreat after a few minutes haraldr stomped angrily to the rear blymmedes gave the order to withdraw within minutes the cavalry and the varangians were winding down the narrow dusty road to harim haraldr could hear the seljuks jeering from the walls and the cold hands made the knots ever tighter grettir squinted the sun was now a golden globe just resting on the kastrons east wall preparing to break loose and float into the sky the mist had contracted into purplish streaks in the shadowed ravines grettir stepped forward proudly and gratefully odin had favoured him by sparing his leader haraldr sino nordbrikt if he so wished and by giving his tongue grettir this chance to atone for his stupid treachery the eaglefeeding saracenslayer had asked for the most amusing man among them and grettir had been a virtually unanimous choice well it was true a skald who skinned onions for half a year had to become a prankster or he would drown in his own tears besides as odins din hastener had told him today his humour would be worth a thousand swords judging that he was just outside bowshot grettir cocked his big knifeedged hat and stepped onto his stage a patch of fairly even ground illuminated by a sun that had now been freed to the pondblue sky this morning ill teach even mischiefmaking loki a thing or two grettir told himself hoping to calm his quaking hands haraldr waited at the base of the sheer drop beneath the east walls of the kastron when he heard the dim but clearly perceptible sound of a human imitating with comic hyperbole the crow of a cock he turned to halldor good grettir has begun haraldr looked two hundred ells up the crusty face of the cliff wafting slightly in the breeze the rope ladders hung like glorious braids in the dazzling sun haraldr clapped joli stefnirson and his brother hord on the back and winked at ulfr i told you that any man from geiranger can climb like a goat but joli and hord can fly they are norways eagles and today they will bring us seljuk meat next haraldr checked an apparatus the domestic had called a fire blower this was a long brass tube attached to a leather bladder worn on the back the infantryman carried the hollow tube in his hands and had a woodandleather bellows strapped under his left arm tapers tipped with some incendiary substance used to ignite the liquid fire were stuck in his belt lets give grettir enough time to win his audience haraldr told the clustered eagereyed varangians grettir skipped drunkenly dozens of arrows bristled the ground a few steps in front of him doffing his hat with exaggerated gestures of deference grettir veered towards the arrows with freakish bounding steps stopped suddenly as he encountered the feathered shafts teetered forward while waving his arms as if he were about to pitch into an abyss then staggered backwards before tripping over his flapping legs tumbling into a heap and starting all over again the seljuks at first incredulous at the assault of this single addlebrained infidel had begun to join in the game sending down their arrows every time grettir lurched close grettir saluted the salvos with increasingly elaborate flourishes of his silly hat the jeering seljuks soon crowded the walls suddenly grettir dropped his hat and jerked his head up as if a rope were pulling against his neck swivelling his head on his distended neck he reached down and clutched at his crotch then began increasingly vigorous scratching motions the seljuks howled with laughter grettir turned his back to the walls pulled from beneath his tunic the specially shaped pig bladder he had contrived and pumped his hips and jerked his free hand up and down as he blew into the bladder when he had the device inflated and in place he turned with his arms wide the seljuks shrieked with delight and began an immediate chorus of trilling observations grettir surged wildly with his hips showing off a pigbladder phallus as long as a mans arm complete with a melonsize scrotum grettir continued to stalk with his absurd giant steps his hips pumping in enormous circular motions within minutes the seljuks had several of their concubines up on the walls stripped naked and gyrating their pelvises in reply to grettirs prodigious thrusts the walls swarmed with seljuks now they jammed the crenellated openings and balanced on top of the merlons one warrior fell from his perch and lay in a creamcoloured heap at the base of the wall no one even noticed loki grettir said aloud as happy as he had ever been i have shamed you at the base of the cliff haraldr could clearly hear the rising din of mirth he started up the rope ladder first followed by halldor ulfr the fire blower and then a gradual procession that ultimately would total a hundred picked men haraldr climbed quickly repeating the phrases the mandator had taught him and reflecting on the strange hilarity that accompanied their grim ascent he soon reached the jagged rock lip at the summit he gripped the stone and easily pulled himself over the natural obstacle the lance blurred by him and he heard halldor grunt haraldr swung his shield to his front and looked back halldor hung by one hand his face gushing blood haraldrs shield took a blow and he had to turn his sword lifted the seljuk into the air and sent him flailing into the gorge haraldr crouched atop the rock lip he could see right through the crenellation into the walled town as if the kastron were a box tipped to one side every man in the city seemed to have spilled onto the west wall or stood below it waiting for an opportunity to view grettirs performance apparently only a single guard had remained posted along the entire east wall haraldr surveyed the route he intended to take as the others began to gather beside him halldors face was severely gashed can you go on asked haraldr they didnt cut my legs off snapped halldor haraldr dropped to the greybrick pathway atop the wall they already had twentyfive men on top now enough the rest should be able to join them quickly flanked by halldor and ulfr haraldr took his axe with one hand set his shield and positioned the roman with the fire blower almost against his back the first seljuks to notice the varangian invaders were lost in the clamour near the centre of the west wall haraldr could see them distinctly pounding and tugging at their fellows like miniature actors in a raucous comedy then a few more seljuks began to turn but most were held rapt by grettir and the naked mime of their whores when the varangian phalanx reached the southwest corner of the kastron they met the unwary seljuk spectators like a whirring relentless steel engine the carnage was appalling hastily produced scimitars did almost nothing to deter the varangian advance the first seljuks to fall screamed their oaths to allah or simply ululated with surprise but their distress was blanketed by the blaring revelry of their fellows only after dozens had pitched off the battlements did the change in tenor begin to spread orchestrally north to the centre of the wall but the crowding made a concerted defence impossible only the sheer weight of frantic bodies began to stop the varangian push haraldr shouted to the infantryman armed with the fire blower the long brass tube a glowing taper now fastened to the tip jutted past haraldrs shield a phallus far more obscene than the pig bladder grettir still played with below haraldr grimaced against the intense heat as the fire streamed out the molten lance virtually seemed to blow a hole in the first seljuk then splattered haraldr quickly stomped his boots to shake off the singeing droplets the spout of flame swept in a slow arc across the breadth of the battlements quickly extending its reach as flaming seljuks plunged from the wall within seconds the seljuks began to leap well in advance of the fiery tongue when the liquid was exhausted haraldr looked ahead just past the blackened bricks that defined the fire blowers deadly range waiting for him was an armoured guard cordoning the whitesilkclad figure of kilij with ulfr and halldor at his side and now almost a hundred varangians on the walls behind him haraldr pushed forward across the scorched bricks the seljuk guard died quickly their elegant scimitars and oaths to allah no match for hunland steel and odins fury kilij said haraldr he handed his shield to ulfr and gripped his axe with both hands he had already calculated that the next arc of his blade would be perhaps more fateful than the blow that had killed hakon and yet he did not need odin to strengthen his arm only to assuage his fears before he had climbed to these walls he had been certain that when kilijs head rolled into the streets his seljuk followers would immediately give up their cause and their captives but now that wager seemed far less certain the seljuk leader was viciously handsome his dark sharp features framed with a dense beard and a beautiful engraved silver helm holding haraldrs blade with his eyes kilij slowly knelt removed his helm and began a recitation punctuated with many allahs haraldr ignored the appeal and stepped forward conscious that if he had erred in his judgement he would never escape these walls alive he caught the seljuks nightfilled eyes and in odins ancient voice he recited the phrase that the mandator had taught him the words were said to mean i am the avenging angel kilij lowered his forehead to bricks speckled with the blood of his guards atop the walls the silence was now complete from the city below came the wails of badly burned men haraldr told halldor to hold kilijs head up halldor yanked on the glossy black hair bringing the dark face to that of the golden angel kilijs pupils became antic flying insects seeking escape from a doomed head haraldr lifted his axe high his own fate as tentative as his victims to the left down in the town below kilijs desperate eyes found their sanctuary he lifted his head defiantly and his left arm shot out a goldringed finger pointing he smiled wickedly down below on the street just inside the gate another seljuk ululated insanely kneeling at his feet was a woman in a white silk robe her raven hair long and undone the seljuk who had cried out jerked the flowing tresses and forced the face of the kneeling figure to look up instantly numb his upraised axe suddenly weighted with the huge burden of this revelation haraldr could only murmur the name once somewhere in the last redoubt of his reason maria a second seljuk stepped forward touched a heavybladed scimitar to marias neck then raised the blade to the sky the swordsman looked up to the walls and kilij grinned like death the exchange was now stated in terms so graphic that no language would be needed the life of kilij for the life of the roman woman maria did not lower her head nor did haraldr lower his axe their eyes met her blue fires perhaps pleading perhaps challenging clearly questioning him a simple instinct bound his arms for a heartbeat and then he listened to some vastly more profound intuition he found the answer he would give her beyond love beyond death somewhere amid the black ice of eternity the only sensation haraldr felt as his axe descended in a whooshing arc was the slight vibration of kilijs skull splitting and the virtually simultaneous cracking of his coccyx the axe clanged on brick halldor held the two halves of kilij together at the shoulders but faeces and bowels still gushed onto the bricks and the neat seam along his chest spurted blood in the courtyard the seljuk executioner wearily lowered and then dropped his scimitar stunned by his leaders demise and utterly astonished at the huge golden demons ferocious disregard for the life of the woman second only to the prophet christs mother it was so quiet that the sound of the seljuks blade clattering to the street seemed like a small rock slide the seljuk who held marias hair let it slip from his fingers like a bewitched man watching the gold in his hands turn to sand her face radiant her cheeks and neck flushed as if with lovemaking maria stood and stared at the vision on the walls above her haraldr pulled his axe free with each hand he grabbed a lock of kilijs hair but saw that the scalp would simply pull away from the skull he found a grip on each side of kilijs neck he lifted oblivious to the horrifying scent of the spilling organs his arms swooping wide like the gianttaloned wings from nidafell haraldr raised the butchered halves of kilij turned to face the courtyard and stood with arms out and elbows locked like a hunter displaying a brace of rabbits i am the avenging angel he told the seljuks in their language i have come for my mother the seljuks billowing robes seemed to collapse like felled tents as every man among them threw himself to the ground and pressed his lips to the dust a frightening silence followed this huge rustling homage to the terrible golden avenger only one person remained standing within the citadel her brilliant face still lifted to haraldr her gemblue eyes telling him that she was the fate to whom he had just given his reply no one present could remember having seen the senator and magister nicon attalietes walk for at least ten years but the old man his spine grotesquely conformed to the shape of the chairs in which he spent his days and nights hobbled to the window he placed his thick gouty fingers against the marblerevetted recess and pushed his deformed nose towards the glass he hacked wetly as he always did before he spoke everyone quieted despite his massive chest and the leonine growl with which he habitually cleared his throat the senator and magister nicon attalietes had a voice like a whisper beside a grave dogs whores lepers look how they lick their adulterous mothers pustulant afterbirth attalietes shuffled around to face his retinue his thin white hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck and his grey beard fell in sagacious disorder to his chest a large purple blotch spread over his broad nutcoloured forehead his nose and cheek below his left eye were scarred by surgeries to remove similar skin malignancies several years ago attalietes had sent for a specialist in facial restorations from alexandria but had dismissed the man for reasons he would never discuss the senator and magister nicon attalietes was not accustomed to giving reasons you get over here he jerked his swollen hand at his son ignatius as if he were strangling a chicken ignatius attalietes had the same indolent features as his late brother meletius but as he preferred to avoid altogether the salutary effects of outdoor exercise having hit his head badly while taking instruction at polo as a very young boy he had a particularly spectral pallor boils spotted his forehead and nose as if some mysterious demonic force had directed his skin to emulate his fathers afflictions he lowered his head and minced towards his father get over here you spineless milksop attalietes batted his sons ear meles dead and you wring your wrists like the capons at court mele would have sent that holy turd a pile of their whoreson noses but you you tell me what you see ignatius inclined slightly towards the window with the vertiginous sense of a man looking into an abyss he could see all he needed to see three stories below the street was solid rabble and for that matter every street as far as he could see down to the distant pale square of the forum bovis was jammed with the clamouring beasts they were disgusting the terrible anonymity of their ragged browntunicked poverty it was as if the sewers beside their tenements had flooded and now the feculent sludge had filled the streets they had set fires at many of the intersections and the smudgy pillars were choking off the sun deepening the vile coloration of the scene ignatius didnt care any more he was frightened he began to sob softly beside his fathers wheezing face attalietes decided not to humiliate his son further what was the use as much as ignatius was a coward mele he still could not believe it meletius had been a fool what was he doing south of antioch in the vanguard of the sluts escort no doubt the holy turd joannes and his sexless brother constantine were laughing richly over meles corpse and now this oh the blackfrocked excrements slimy hands are all over this certainly damn fool attalietes thought admonishing himself i should have withdrawn to arcadiopolis or nicomedia when i heard of the whores abduction but there was so much to do here what with the plunging value of land in cilicia and teluch and lycandus my god even armenikoi has shown some downward trends too much to do too much possible still god is so cruel when nicon attalietes had been young and vigorous basil the bulgarslayer had limited the universe of the dhynatoi to polo and banquets and hunts those luxuries had cost the dhynatoi more of their vitality than if they had rebelled and had been cast into the numera or neorion but now when there was so much to be taken so much simply waiting to be plucked there were only feeble old men without the strength to grasp it and callow youths without the courage to reach for it perhaps mele would have been the one to extend the dhynatois grasp again attalietes silently lamented but mele is dead and the mob is at the door manganes isaac manganes a short asiaticfeatured man who glowed like an icon in his robe of hellas silk came to the window a former middlelevel military commander from armenikoi who had been denied promotion by less competent superiors manganes had begun working for attalietes as manager of several estates in armenikoi he had proved himself so much more able than the network of cousins nephews and yes sons who supervised most of attalietess properties that he had soon risen to overseer of all the asiatic estates when the position of strategus of cilicia had been purchased for meletius manganes had been summoned to the empress city to become the elder attalietess nextincommand with responsibility for the enormous body of daytoday details the old man didnt like to bother with that is the plight of the dhynatoi now thought attalietes as manganes came to his side to have to depend on the lowborn for our survival well at least manganes appreciated the luxuries to which he had become accustomed i have to tell you the situation is hopeless manganes knew his patron preferred blunt talk to the florid dissimulations one heard at court that less than health concerns was why the old warrior had not entered the chalke gate to the imperial palace for perhaps five years besides as attalietes always said why should i go to his palace and endure his strutting capons and branded felons when i have a dozen of my own palaces unfortunately considered manganes as he watched the mob surge against the gates of attalietess vast hilltop residence this palace is about to be sacked and burned by the unclean horde unless well the old man will have to suggest it first there are some things a hireling from armenikoi can never say youve considered everything attalietess blackstreaked white eyebrows quivered as he faced manganes senator it has been well conceived the duping of meletius the abduction of the empress the dispatch of the grand domestic and the rest of the imperial taghmata to recover the purpleborn youll recall that i cautioned against the reduction in your personal guard even though we were all convinced that under the grand domestic bardas dalassena the imperial taghmata had become our personal guard this is just the sort of eventuality i was concerned about as long as the taghmata is under the authority of the emperor our assurances of its protection cannot be absolute all right manganes youve made enough noise shutting the gate i left open attalietes wheezed irritably why cant we buy off the mobs leaders surely the walking dung heap has not paid this stinking herd so well senator the orphanotrophus joannes has a unique system of inducements in his one hand he offers the carrot his orphanages and charity hospitals entirely inadequate for the demands on them but sufficient to offer hope in the other hand joannes carries his whip neorion and of course in this matter an even more powerful force is at work attalietes nodded slightly the purpleborn harlot his legacy attalietes could still see the bulgarslayer strutting before the sacrum consistorum hands thrust against his hips pausing to twirl his black beard as he pondered the next advance of romes borders the arrogance of his simplicity throwing away his purple robes and rings and diadems to receive his supplicants bareheaded in a tunic the colour of ashes always surrounded by his barbaroi goons as if he could not trust his own courtiers it was he who had invited the fairhair menace to the very bedchamber of roman power his lifelong hatred for the dhynatoi was evident in every rough clipped utterance in every brutal larcenous action his vicious novel no forcibly returning estates of the dhynatoi to the dullwitted slovens who had not maintained them in the first place why hadnt the bulgarslayer seen the true glory the highborn would have afforded him if only he had included them in his vision of rome instead of the glowering ruthlessly simple despot had raised his throne on the offal of peasants and labourers no one can buy their devotion from the purpleborn emphasized manganes he coughed deliberately and dared to prompt the inevitable still even the purpleborn has her enemies we have ample proof of that in this conspiracy in which we have become pawns attalietes turned slowly from the window and with laborious motions and rasping breath returned to his giltandvelvet chair his brilliantly robed retinue faced him from a respectful distance two elderly senators his useless nephew manuel four glorified accountants with what seemed to the old man almost uniformly pinched narrow faces and squinting myopic eyes his eunuch chamberlain and the obligatory staff of three additional fluttering capons if any sight could compel the unprecedented step he was about to take they were such an epiphany yes their faces told him what he had long suspected but until now would not admit the dhynatoi could no longer stand alone they would have to make an alliance an alliance with the devil but which devil attalietes rattled the phlegm in his throat well he said exhaling you have read all the proposals from the two extortionists who have offered to save us from the mob what do you think if that is not asking the impossible manganes surveyed the numb faces and coughed again senator we know the hetairarch has the lesser ambition i know the hetairarch offered ignatius with a sudden brightening we have spoken about horses three or four times he is very civilized yes fools thought attalietes manganes is too young to have seen the varangian victories at scutari and abydos the victories that had saved the throne of the bulgarslayer what dung he had been no bulgarslayer just a varangian payer and now this barbaroi hetairarch who was far too civilized for anyones good fools the whitehaired immaculately groomed senator and magister romanus scylitzes spoke up owner of huge chunks of the themes thessalonica and dyrrachium his speech reeked with presumed hellenistic elegance my esteemed colleague virtuous mentor and indefatigable paramount might i offer a deduction of my own i declare the orphanotrophus the inferior source of jeopardy offering these substantiations the orphanotrophus and his egregiously purpleclad sibling suffer from the dilute blood of the plebeian classes because they are not conditioned to the obligations required by their station they will rapidly weary of their lofty occupations suffering from languishment and irresolutions due to these exhaustions the midnightcloaked will be forced to gesture forth with his own hand not in augur of our own despoliation but suppliantly in reciprocation of the gesture he would have us perform today though vastly exacerbated against restraint insufferable turdspewing windbag joannes hardly needs an hours sleep each night and his brother has the endurance of a pack mule as usual it was pointless to counsel with these parasites an old man would decide the way an old man best decides with his ancient ulcerous churning gut and that decision has already been made chamberlain send my secretary attalietes raised and shook his bloated fist the rest of you get out children hid behind their mothers rough wool tunics men stared with wooden fright and then lowered their gaze to the littered paving stones as the man on the black horse came close enough for his swollen immense face to reach out and mark them joannes was on the streets the clamouring died in inevitable sequence as the blackcloaked monk ascended the rise to the palace of the senator and magister nicon attalietes the great hollow stillness that preceded the orphanotrophus joannes like some force of nature was neither sullen nor reverent but profoundly respectful who did not have a friend or neighbour or relative who had received free treatment in one of the orphanotrophuss hospitals and who did not know of someone who had vanished in the night as was his custom joannes rode alone he dismounted in front of the brassornamented oak gate of the attalietes palace rough hands came tremulously forward to hold gently the halter of joanness horse and stroke the animals quivering obsidian flanks as if in assuaging this great beast they could somehow gain favour with the other orphanotrophus attalietess chamberlain bowed deeply the arcade led through a courtyard in the style of a moorish palace from iberia a glittering fantasy of gold and lapis lazuli and chequered ceramic tiles and azure pools flecked with crimson fish joannes enjoyed the irony of his monochrome intrusion in this brilliant setting he was a moving shroud his black breast a sepulchre for an old mans dreams he would enjoy crushing nicon attalietes there were only two people on earth whose destruction would give him more pleasure the silver doors emblazoned with virtually lifesize embossed lions slid open joannes almost gasped unbelievable attalietes did not style himself a mere emperor the chosen hand of god no his ambition exceeded even that blasphemy attalietes sat enthroned in the middle of a vast hall the golden tesserae that covered the dome high above him glittered like the sun flanking the gilded throne which resembled a small chapel in its ornate architecture were long goldtiled pools lined with a carved stone menagerie spouting dazzling sprays of water as he came forward joannes marvelled at the mathematical intricacy of the floor the way the scrolls of rose and white marble created fantastic threedimensional patterns against a background of goldserpentined green marble and black onyx orphanotrophus attalietess eyes were like stone the tombs of hope thought joannes brother joannes used the greeting that would most offend attalietes the salute he would offer any of the rabble outside at what price do we purchase our lives joannes slapped his leg with his riding crop with what would you pay brother attalietes you borrowed from nicephorus argyruss arguoprates to buy most of cilicia and armenikoi i understand that the merchant argyrus instructed his agents to charge you the usurious rate of twelve per cent attalietes thought he would choke on his welling phlegm it had been humiliating enough to have to shake hands with a man like argyrus a man whose hands were stained so deeply with the filth of commerce that they would never be clean no matter how many silk robes he donned or palaces he built i have instructed the merchant argyrus that i will remit the penalty for his usurious exaction if he will immediately bring his promissories due joannes gleefully watched as the old mans face coloured to the extent that his skin lesions were hardly noticeable attalietes didnt know the exact figures and he didnt need to know he had rushed to acquire the vast holdings in teluch and cilicia when he had learned of the imminent accord with caliph moustanir billah and then on top of that the office of strategus of cilicia had opened and had brought a damnable price at first in solidi then in the incalculable loss of his son and then the untimely demise of the senator andronicus cametus leaving the old pederasts estates in armenikoi available at an enticing discount yes each acquisition had made good sense at the time but now with the plunging value of land all along the saracen frontier the arithmetic of disaster led to an inevitable solution he could not meet the damnable merchants notes even if he sold everything attalietes lifted his thick fingers from the skulls of the golden lions that snarled at the arms of his throne since i cannot pay this debt in solidi what currency do you ask complicity joannes lowered his black wiry brows you and the entire attalietes clique in the senate attalietes felt cool soothing air surge into his burning gasping lungs was there a way to work with the orphanotrophus joannes the fact that the huge black capon did not simply let the mob do its work was evidence that he did not consider his own power secure might the monk be willing to compromise might they eventually arrive at shared goals how could an old man reduced to penury share your lofty visions orphanotrophus obliquity does not suit your delivery brother attalietes admonished joannes in his menacing rumble he was pleased however that the beast he was about to yoke still had enough spirit to be useful i offer you this in brief form you will donate to the offices of the orphanotrophus two thirds of your entire holdings in europe and asia nicephorus argyrus will forgive the debt on your remaining properties in exchange for the monopoly he is about to be granted on trade with venice amalfi and the rus and in gratitude for your generous donation to the indigent of our city taxes on the estates still held in your name will be excused by beneficium for a period of ten years i believe that when these transactions are completed i will find myself with an ally who is more fiscally powerful than ever and wealthier in wisdom as well attalietes wheezed with relief life was still sweet tonight he would ask the khazar girl to take him in her soft lips and let him feel the bursting ecstasy of his youth he blinked away the tears and saw the monstrous face through a golden haze of hope i am in your debt orphanotrophus i will make certain that you remember brother joannes turned and found his way out without escort the mob hushed again as the gate swung open and the orphanotrophus reappeared joannes quickly mounted and wheeled to face the expectant throng god has granted me the privilege of announcing to the blessed children of our sacred empress news of the most extraordinary miracle yesterday christian warriors led by the archangel himself and that dauntless foe of heresy the strategus of antioch challenged the devilworshipping hordes and effected the rescue of our mother our mother returns to us the din of the joyous response made joanness head ache and he struggled to maintain his concentration as he headed through the wildly cheering praying and sobbing crowd almost by some divine intercession petals began to drift like snow to the pavement before him strewn by hands that only seconds before had clutched stones and staves remarkable reflected joannes no longer giving thought to the celebration swirling around him like a cyclone two very remarkable things the astonishing rescue of the slut joannes had been prepared for a much lengthier period of negotiation the result was certainly not undesirable though it had proved quite prudent to have moved quickly to incite the rabble against attalietes the scum hardly would have been so vehement if they had known their precious slattern was safe but who had executed the miraculous deliverance of course not constantine though it was reassuring to know that apparently he had not sabotaged the endeavour blymmedes that might be a problem since blymmedes was known to disapprove of the grand domestic bardas dalassena and now attalietess soldierstooge belonged to joannes was it possible well the tauroscythian haraldr nordbrikt was already celebrated for his martial escapades and indeed he might be the most likely hero out of all this though of course constantine would have to receive official precedence how incredible that would be it would be as if fortune had blessed joannes again considering the other remarkable discovery of the previous night quite extraordinary the logothete of the dromus had brought him a transcript of the letter the hetairarch mar hunrodarson had dispatched to the unfortunate senator attalietes the senators son ignatius often surrendered such information in exchange for the logothetes collusion in the matter of young attalietess appetite for wellformed officers of the scholae hunrodarsons letter had offered his varangians to relieve the siege of attalietess palace a simple mercenary transaction no hunrodarson would have known of attalietess acute shortage of solidi the barbaros was friends with argyrus and so he had sought the same medium of exchange that joannes had just secured simply remarkable the hetairarch mar hunrodarson was announcing his ambitions apparently for all to see hunrodarson was not a foolish man either what could possibly have prompted this impudent assurance on his part well no matter let mar hunrodarson dream the hero haraldr nordbrikt and he would be a hero even if he had tried to defect to the saracens would now be a formidable rival to the hetairarch yes joanness instrument would return from asia more finely honed than ever and how pleasurable it will be thought joannes as the petals flew around him like a blizzard to see the two overinflated tauroscythian barbaroi impale themselves on each others blades haraldr nordbrikt you must know that i am hardly expert in these matters gregory blushed almost restoring the sunflamed colour that had begun to fade in the last few weeks that is i have no practical experience of course one hears many things if one is curious about the subtleties of language and well i confess that i have read some of the romances in the corrupt vernacular only to relieve the stress of studying serious literature of course haraldr looked over the misty plain of the river sangarius his ambertinted face a vivid contrast to the fields now dulled with winter he wrapped his woollen cloak about his shoulders and enjoyed an internal warmth by tonight he would have memorized every endearment every anatomically explicit term the greek language had incorporated in the eons since alexander had marched east to the land of the brahmans ahead the imperial carriages were gilt and scarlet lamps in the midday gloom farther beyond the bright standards of constantines thematic army were already lost in the leaden pall until today the retreat from antioch had been strangely foreboding in spite of every reason for celebration of course the pilgrimage had been terminated after the empresss harrowing ordeal clearly the saracen guarantees of safe passage were worthless haraldr had held his guard in constant battle readiness until five days ago when the imperial party had come as far west as ancyra where saracens had not penetrated for centuries and blymmedes still sent out two reconnaissance vanda well before each dreary dawn even constantine who had been so dilatory before the abduction had insisted on contributing his thematic army to her imperial majestys safekeeping and now quite obviously intended personally to command the escort all the way to the empress city certainly his principal motive was to reap an undeserved share of the credit for her majestys deliverance but nevertheless he had taken his command seriously on the return journey apparently the empress had suffered greatly from her captivity she had seemed well enough and at ease when she had received her champions after her rescue constantine blymmedes haraldr and kalaphates had all been honoured with gifts of robes and solidi and profusely grateful benedictions from the lovely imperial lips but then the empress had plunged into deepest seclusion each day she ordered the carriages to begin their creaking advance before dawn and would not command halt until the tinted twilight had begun to char into the smothering blackness of the anatolian night then she would disembark directly into her tent symeon had turned into a fierce ancient reptile hissing at the merest suggestion of an intrusion on her majestys privacy even kalapahates who had recovered sufficiently from his mostly superficial wounds to join his uncles retinue had not been permitted to see his blessed mother and maria since their eyes had met that terrible and beautiful morning nothing for six weeks now no word not even a glimpse of her silk slippers just the memory of what had passed between them in that moment when love and death had embraced over the great abyss of time they were still together plunging into a blackness lit only by the torch of their joined souls that was the truth she could not confront until now haraldr put his hand to the message he had placed against his heart tonight she had written i will send for you komes haraldr was doubly shocked he had not expected the empress and not in this setting glowing braziers offered the only light and a dry clean aromatic heat everything was tinted red the empresss lips were like fresh blood zoe curled on the cushions like a panther there was a sense of power even viciousness latent in her lithe limbs and there was much of her limbs to see the sheerest lilac silk hardly more opaque than the drizzling mist outside clung to her breasts and hips haraldr helplessly noticed that his blessed mothers nipples were large flat areolae komes haraldr the voice was like liquid desire can you speak without your little tongue haraldr had been asked to come without the ubiquitous gregory now he was grateful for the concentration greek required yes i have learned a great deal on this long road yes you have zoe said enunciating carefully i am impressed by your fluency haraldr thanked christs father lord god for the many tongues he had created in his tower at babel the barrier of language seemed to take the seduction out of her imperial majestys voice it is my intention to become as you romans say civilized zoes eyebrows quivered and set with a slightly elevated arch yes but you must retain the impetuousness of your race i believe i owe my present comfort if not my very life to your instincts i want to thank you more properly and more privately a serving eunuch brought wine in response to some signal haraldr had missed haraldr took his goblet perspiration began to bead on his back but he felt a certain stimulation maria had proven herself fond of such preludes then he almost choked christ citron surely he was not intended to use the empress as he had citron so komes haraldr zoe raised her goblet her smooth white arm compressing her ample breast the nipple had now become slightly erect let us raise a cup to your future as a civilized man and let us hope that you do not become too civilized suddenly zoe stood and haraldr scrambled out of the couch and onto his knees his head bowed as prescribed by protocol he could hear the empress swish towards him he closed his eyes in terror like a man expecting the blade to kiss his neck the imperial fingers tousled his hair like a breeze golden silk she said her voice frightening but only in its sorrow then the touch of the purpleborn fingers was gone eyes shut tight haraldr again heard silk rustle you may rise komes haraldr said theodore in his droning tenor haraldr stood and crossed his arms over his breast zoe waited by the curtained brocade partition apparently to take leave of her guest she was now wrapped in a glistening black sable cape faced with purple satin komes am i a fool to be certain of your loyalty we would both be fools if you could not be certain of that loyalty haraldrs unhesitating pledge brought him not even an inkling of anxiety in the long monotonous weeks since the rescue he had allayed many of his suspicions the romans he had concluded were more incompetent than treacherous when the arrows had begun to fly they had defended their empress with absolute unanimity the sorely misjudged attalietes certainly had been a colossal blunderer but ultimately he had given his life to defend the empress constantine was equally inept but had he truly conspired against the empress he would have obstructed or opposed blymmedess rescue mission rather than approving it and in fact facilitating it with his temporary withdrawal and joanness nephew michael kalaphates had come very close to his own mortality fighting at the door of the empresss carriage certainly the romans had their internecine feuds every court did but in this case it was obvious that the conspiracy he had imagined was actually a seljuk adventure and as for the attempt on his own life he still did not discount mars involvement but he was certain that no roman had sent his wouldbe assassin zoe fixed haraldr with the certitude of centuriesold power her seductive lips became muscular shaping her words as if they were to be carved in stone komes maria is coming for you she has much of which to speak with you but she will also ask a question in my name head erect zoe vanished in a whisper of sable and silk theodore ushered haraldr back to the lavishly cushioned couch he waited smothered in down and plied with wine for what seemed an hour then the brocade was lifted away and maria appeared with heartstopping suddenness she wore a coat of pale blue silk trimmed with white ermine the collar of snowy fur came up to her chin and her skin seemed like the whitest marble against it her raven hair was loosely pulled back and set in a single braid i am sorry our mother wished to speak with me she looked at her slippers the same white silk with pearl beads that she had worn to the banquet at antioch there was no intimacy in her voice it was as if hecate haraldr sucked in a breath almost audibly at the memory of what lay beneath that coat had never happened we are only two days from nicaea in a week we will be in the queen of cities i long for my home do you miss your home yes for the first time in weeks haraldr thought of the debt he must pay to the kings in whose footsteps he followed and yet how could he leave her now do you remember the stadium in daphne yes i remember everything at daphne perhaps her cheeks became more deeply tinted perhaps it was the play of the braziers on her usual glow together we heard the echoes the acclamations to the heroes of ancient hellas and old rome when we return to the empress city you will be the hero of new rome in the streets they will sing your name she looked up at him for the first time the intense blue of her eyes was always a fresh marvel who will one day walk in those ruins to listen for your name will they be as we were lovers in search of their own fate haraldr felt the surging in his breast and the stirring in his loins she acknowledged them or was it no longer them but a single being a new soul born in that terrible instant i know my fate he told her softly yes so do i she stood suddenly come to my bed haraldr struggled to his feet and reached out with a trembling hand maria stepped away no you must promise not to touch me except where i touch you you cannot ask me except what i ask you then she touched his hand with the hot brands of her fingers the partitioned chamber in the imperial pavilion had room for little more than a large wooden bed frame covered with thick down quilts there was no light from lamps or braziers but the room was quite warm maria stood and held haraldrs hand in the darkness for several minutes he could hear her breathe occasionally but the silence was otherwise absolute it was as if they were alone in the vastness of asia minor her touch seemed to fill him with a warm liquor that quickly dissolved his bones she dropped his hand and he could see the motion and hear the sigh of silk as she removed her coat he could sense that she was naked her vague form vanished and the quilts were ruffled by a breeze from the bed she said come to me like heracles haraldr stripped as naked as the statue and found his way to the bed he lay down carefully unwilling to break the strange spell she was casting after a few minutes she took his hand again she sighed or perhaps it was a muffled tiny sob then she began to explore his arm time became suspended she traced every vein every indentation the outline of every muscle and he in turn claimed the same territory from her how long did they float through black oblivion before she stroked his nipple and pressed her satin palm against his huge pectoral how long before her fingers crept to his belly and his to her wet fur and then the ritual repeated this time with lips instead of fingers they had long ago passed the stars there was no heat except their own finally she held over him just as she had in hecate but this time she lowered her nose to his the finetipped nose he now knew like his own flesh perhaps it was a freak of the shadows perhaps not but her eyes seemed to light from within and he could see the lapis gleam you are my angel she whispered my avenger and my destroyer i love you then she settled and brought him inside her how long they rocked on that warm impossibly brilliant sea he also did not know this time it was slow endless a complete dissolution of the flesh at the end they shuddered only slightly but in perfect concert and ceased to be they were utterly exhausted who are you haraldr started he must have dozed off had it been a dream who are you you are no land man from rus haraldr felt her eyes on him and reality reconstituting his body if only because for a moment he had actually considered telling her everything not merely the cryptic affinity he had offered serah but the oaths he had taken to that secret were too strong the risk too great even for love and then he realized a stunning new truth that this new love maria also commanded his silence in marias arms he wanted to remain haraldr nordbrikt in her arms he wanted to end the flight that he had begun at stiklestad to stay here among the romans to become civilized to serve his mother and father and to love her here for ever he knew that he could not indefinitely share both these loves norway and maria yet he would lose them both if he told her now so for now he would offer her the only truth he could i cannot tell you who i am she wrapped her arms tightly around his back and pressed her lips softly to his neck he nuzzled her lustrous hair and whispered in her ear who are you maria kissed haraldr on the lips and then released him and rolled away from his body i do not know she said her voice was so plaintive that haraldr reached out for her with pain in his heart what sorrow was hidden so deeply but maria sat on the edge of her bed and draped her coat over her shoulders it is almost time to prepare for our days journey she said wearily you must leave she turned to face him my last question is for our mother to it you can reply only yes or no haraldr sat up and stroked the ravens plumage she threw her arms around him and kissed him fiercely as if it were her last and then she pushed him away and stood up her arms wrapped against some inner cold our mother asks if you will when she commands sever the head of the imperial eagle iv keleusate the eunuchs voice clattered like broken porcelain on the bare marble floor mar hunrodarson lifted himself to his knees in response to the invitation but did not rise to his feet this was a calculated act of protracted obeisance the purpleborn augusta theodora could still look down on him as they spoke theodoras thin lips drawn like a string across her small face flattened into a wry suggestion of a smile the pale blue eyes sparkled like ice in the cold room as if the giant hetairarch were merely a callow suitor whose attentions theodora found too fervent and clumsy hetairarch theodora held her arms out and extended her long pale fingers towards the hetairarchs shoulders as if she were a conjurer commanding him to rise again the eyes flashed droll and challenging theodora turned swiftly and reclined on her couch keleusate offered the eunuch again he gestured for mar to sit on the blue silk couch opposite the augusta you are accompanying our father to thessalonica theodoras question was rhetorical how unseemly that he did not greet my sister or her rescuers on their return leaving their reception to the offices of his brother joannes i understand that he has not even sent her a message of welcome and now it seems that my sister embarrasses his piety to such a degree that he must flee to the arms of his saint before he can even look upon her again st demetrius has issued our father an urgent summons said mar he tried to imagine the pain and frustration cloaked behind theodoras chalky impassive features with her reddishblonde hair drawn back into a single tight braid the augusta not only looked older than her sister but also curiously more innocent the rumour widely bandied about by the satirists and street gossips was that theodora was still a virgin and while he obeys the summons of his patron he permits his hetairarch to make his own pilgrimages her inflection was acid perhaps customs have changed since i left the palace i had always assumed that the hetairarch kept a relentless vigil at his majestys side i will rejoin the imperial procession this evening said mar without a hint of apology it is often my habit to depute the care of his imperial majesty to my lieutenants i see theodoras grim lips pursed as they resisted a mocking grin you are so often occupied with more important errands the augusta looked straight at mar and then laughed the throaty masculine laugh of a woman too clever really to care about her sexuality such an ambitious man indeed havent i heard of your ambitions somewhere wherever you know i do not go out much she fluttered her hand in a gesture of mock femininity the voice that followed cut like a newly honed blade why do you think i would wish to further your desires mar composed himself determined to meet this notoriously direct woman with his own candour because i believe your majesty and i share a common enemy theodora smiled at mar as if she were indulging a small child in some elaborate masquerade but of course you must know that out here i have no enemies only water bugs and servants who prefer gossip to work mar leaned forward slightly have your tonguewagging servants told you of the orphanotrophus joanness most recent success theodora snapped back what do you mean hetairarch i know that joannes engineered the abduction of your sister there are many of us who suspect that i can offer proof theodora considered what use such proof might be to her sister or her mentor alexius very little without command of the imperial taghmata but any knowledge of joannes was a potentially deadly weapon can you produce this evidence shall i have ignatius attalietes sent to you he and i had a brief misunderstanding but i assure you that now his greatest delight is to do what i bid him it will be sufficient for you to speak in his stead hetairarch i am well aware of your reputation for thorough interrogation mar went on to describe the plot as revealed in an antechamber of the numera by the virtually hysterical ignatius a few seconds of listening to the screams of some of the other guests had turned the attalietes scion into a popeyed desperately rambling geyser of information enough information to expose the handprints of joannes all over the entire scheme theodora absorbed mars account impassively when he had finished she rose quickly and lithely she walked half a circuit of her apartments bare dull marble walls then stopped to look out of an arched window towards the distant city constantinople was invisible in the mist when she turned back to mar her faced seemed pinched even smaller than usual how would you check joannes hetairarch you acknowledge his freshly wrought alliance with the attalietes clique but you did not mention that joannes now equipped with the resources of the dhynatoi is sponsoring a rival to you the tauroscythian who effected the rescue of my sister this haraldr whose name is on everyones lips he has been named manglavite and the middle hetairia has been expanded to receive his band of cutthroats joannes has given him a palace near the forum of constantine she looked at mar piercingly as i told you my servants have time for nothing but idle chatter theodora wondered again if the rumours she had received about marias liaison with this haraldr were true of course it was only one of marias caprices but this one seemed more reckless than usual this haraldr will soon turn on his patron majesty at my command mar reflected the good fortune that had thwarted his own efforts to have haraldr sigurdarson eliminated when he had learned that joannes was haraldrs sponsor the meeting in neorion had left no doubt he had considered the princeling to be far more of a liability than an asset but in that impetuous decision mar now realized he had behaved like a norseman which was not the way to deal with these romans now he could see that haraldr sigurdarson was more useful than ever vastly so indeed said theodora you have persuaded this haraldr as you did ignatius attalietes i would think one of your kind far more resistant to such blandishments than a pathetic dhynatoi sodomite even the gods could not save achilleus once his peculiar vulnerability became known well between your abilities and those of this new tauroscythian achilleus whom you alone command it would seem that we romans are already as helpless as isaac upon abrahams altar why offer an alliance to a scorned indeed discarded augusta when you fairhairs have merely to let the sword fall do you pity me so much strange that i never suspected you of charity hetairarch theodoras mouth worked in minute contractions and her eyes glistened mar ignored the taunts as well aware as the purpleborn theodora of the power a norseman could never acquire no matter how keen his blade or intellect he would not insult either of them by mentioning it instead he would propose a more subtle form of patronage would i be too bold to admit that i envy the friendship you share with the patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith theodora showed small uneven teeth you have become so much more interesting than when i was previously acquainted with you hetairarch you have become so much more roman the corners of her eyes crinkled as she mused on the proposition fortunately the hetairarch had been clever enough not to propose making an empress of her theodora had no intention of challenging her sister even if joanness carefully seeded lies had convinced zoe otherwise but consider how profoundly the defence of the one true faith might be enhanced if the patriarch alexiuss mighty spiritual sword were joined by the hetairarchs mighty secular sword theodora signalled her eunuch emmanuel keleusate intoned the tall importantlooking chamberlain mar rose and theodora walked directly up to him her face vivid almost girlish i shall ask our patriarch to instruct you in the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith hetairarch strange that i had always thought you an irretrievable pagan he is present whispered the monk cosmas tzintzuluces he is waiting for you in the ciborium michael lord of the entire world emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans stepped into the nave of the church of st demetrius in thessalonica from the aisle vaults the brilliant frescoed presences of the saints the holy virgin and the pantocrator glimmered like welcoming friends the emperor was profoundly grateful for the familiar splendour of what was becoming if not his home then his sanctuary he did not come here for renewal he never could expect that much but for relief it was a place of temporary sustenance where he could arrest but not reverse the inexorable starvation of his immortal soul to the emperors left midway down the nave stood the ciborium a miniature hexagonal temple sheathed entirely in beautiful chased silver the canopy topped with a large silver sphere and cross the emperor proceeded towards the ciborium the thickly bearded monk cosmas tzintzuluces gently at his arm both men seemed to glide over the marble floor as if drawn by some supernatural force the monk paused and opened the silver door to the little chamber the emperor entered and fell to his knees before the small silver couch he did not need to see the physical presence of st demetrius to know that the holiest of martyrs and most potent of saints was spiritually present st demetriuss parreshia access to the heavenly father was proven beyond all doubt how many times had he saved thessalonica from the bulgars how many torments of the flesh had he eased with his healing oil how many carnal sins had he absolved with his cleansing waters heal me absolve me begged the lord of the entire world in silent desperate prayer i know you have approached the throne of heaven so many times on my behalf beloved martyr you have presented my case to the divine trinity with such graciousness and conviction that my heart bursts with gratitude for your holy offices and yet i still suffer and yet i am not forgiven tzintzuluces knelt beside the emperor crossed himself and bowed deeply in prayer he took the emperors powerful hands in his own spindly fingers he gently urged the emperors hands towards the empty silver couch let him touch you whispered the monk his one hand has now taken that of our father almighty his other seeks your mortal grasp reach out to him the emperors hands trembled slightly as he reached out he sighed it was as if his fingers had vanished into a warm ether and the pain the terrible strangling torment flowed from his entire body through his fingers into this allaccepting void it flowed joyously cathartically for a moment and then the pain was suddenly excruciating as if his skull had turned to hot iron and crushed in upon his brain the effluence of pain trickled and ceased obstructed by a sin too great to pass through any medium the monk looked anxiously at this suffering human being next to him yes tzintzuluces reflected he could without blasphemy indeed it redounded to the glory of god consider the autocrator a far more humble man indeed a mere novitiate in a universal monastic order for when christ the king summoned him the king of the world would have to appear before the heavenly tribunal as naked as any man and like any man even the pantocrators viceregent on earth had to prepare for that time for men tzintzuluces reminded himself are like oxen whose life cannot last they are like cattle whose time is short let him guide you whispered the monk the emperor choked back the searing visionblackening pain the holy martyr spoke soothed guided his voice transmitted through the spiritual ether within which he resided seeped through the hard shell of pain that crushed upon the emperors brain confess whispered st demetrius in a wonderful melody that was more music than voice confess dazed the emperor allowed tzintzuluces to raise him to his feet and lead him to the vaulted crypt beside the altar the very spot where st demetrius had accepted holy martyrdom they stopped before the sunken marble font the saints holy oil shimmered a fragrant faintly golden pool the emperor fell to his knees again when he looked up two holy men stood before him both of these living saints were maned with voluminous beards and unshorn licecrawling hair but otherwise were as withered and desiccated as desert lizards the taller of the pair wore a soiled loincloth the other stood in a coarse tattered tunic if the emperor noticed their unwashed stench he gave no indication instead he turned to tzintzuluces hands clenched before his breast the tears welling in his eyes these are new treasures the emperor whispered hoarsely and began to weep yes yes whispered tzintzuluces his own dark eyes glazed with adoration and rapture david and symeon the former a dendrite the latter as you have certainly heard the stylite from adrianopolis the very symeon whose fame has begun to spread throughout christendom they have left their perches to succour the holiest of all their brethren tzintzuluces looked aside briefly as a priest in silk vestments set a silver bucket a sponge and a towel beside the emperor the emperor spread his arms wide and his eyes swept from one holy man to the other like a drunken reveller forced to choose between two equally desirable courtesans finally he settled on the shorter cloaked man david the dendrites tunic hair and bare legs were soiled with the droppings of the birds that had shared his home of the last four years a solitary tree on the outskirts of a small anatolian village already the dendrites virtuous selfdenial had been credited with bringing widespread prosperity to the entire charsianon theme the emperor reached almost reflexively for the pail and began to sponge the filth and bird excrement from the feet and legs of david the dendrite he caressed the mans rough brown ankles and worked the sponge in between gnarled toes the emperors eyes were stricken tender above all grateful after he had carefully towelled davids feet the emperor turned to symeon the stylite had lived atop a single stone column for thirteen years now the emperor reflected on the holiness of this number that of the twelve apostles plus their lord that symeon the stylite had blessed the world with healing grace was beyond any doubt hundreds of miraculous cures had already been attributed to his touch in exchange symeon had surrendered his own flesh his toes eaten away by the maggots that lived in the filth his own filth at his feet were raw nubs delirious with joy at beholding the evidence of this sacred act of mortification racked with guilt over the crimes his own flesh had lured him to yea even to the very fires of perdition the emperor fell upon symeons grotesque filthencrusted feet he kissed these feet he bathed them with his tears he salved them with the golden oil of st demetrius finally the emperor turned his tearstained face to tzintzuluces he fought to control his sobs you know why the pantocrator has struck me down with the lightning bolts of this madness that visits me ever more frequently do you not why brother asked tzintzuluces softly i engaged in adulterous intercourse with her even as i served her husband romanus the same romanus who preceded me beneath the imperial diadem even as i served him in the capacity of servant and friend the emperor snorted and struggled for air suspicious of the rumours that attended our flagrant and unlawful yea unholy dalliance her husband and my emperor questioned me of these matters and here the emperor began to wail upon the holy relics i denied my crimes if not damned before there i threw my immortal soul into the fiery lake tzintzuluces crossed himself with a quick frantic gesture there is more said the emperor his eyes now fixed with an expression of utter horror as if he saw before him the demons who attended the gates of hell they murdered him it was not my hands that forced his head beneath the waters of his bath but those hands acted in my interest i know now the foul crime upon which my throne was raised i will never escape the torment of that knowing the crypt echoed with the emperors shattered voice as if the gates of hell had now opened and the damned shouted forth begging for release tzintzulucess face mirrored the terrible fear that racked his imperial disciple his lips parted with a curious slurping sound but he could say nothing the emperor stared at him a drowning man who had just realized that his saviour on the shore had no rope no bit of flotsam to throw to him and then symeon spoke his voice was shockingly elegant as if he were an actor rather than a selfmutilated hermit because you have listened to your wife and eaten from the tree which i forbade you accursed shall be the ground on your account the emperor still on his knees looked with shadowy pleading eyes at symeon symeon answered with barking syllables that echoed against the gleaming plaster vaults of the crypt and cain sayeth to the lord thy punishment is heavier than i can bear thou hast driven me today from the ground and banished me from thy presence i shall be a vagrant and wanderer on the earth and anyone who meets me can kill me and the lord answered no here symeons voice boomed mightily if anyone kills cain cain shall be avenged sevenfold so the lord put a mark on cain the emperor pressed his hands into his eyes i bear the mark he whispered his horror barely audible symeon torturously bent his withered arthritic legs and dropped to his knees beside his emperor though your sins are scarlet they may become white as snow though they are dyed crimson they may yet be like new wool he finished in a low wondrous tone tzintzuluces gave silent praise to the pantocrator for the wisdom of the stylite the sight of a woman is like the venom affixed to a poison arrow he whispered to the emperor the longer the venomed barb remains in the flesh the greater the infection of the corruption it carries symeons voice rose again a booming concert to tzintzulucess note of caution and the angel of retribution sayeth this of the whore of babylon with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication come out of her my people lest you share in her plagues for her sins are piled high as heaven and god has not forgotten her deeds pay her back in her own coin repay her twice over for her deeds tzintzuluces realized that with the help of the thriceblessed symeon he had now found a voice of his own a wonderful palliative for his imperial novitiates terrible distress if your right eye is your undoing he intoned richly tear it out and fling it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for the whole of it to be thrown into hell if your right hand is your undoing cut it off and fling it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for the whole of it to be cast into perdition you have fornicated with the harlot clothed in purple and scarlet boomed symeon now heed the warning of jehovahs messenger and come out of her cast the woman out thundered tzintzuluces in a voice he had scarcely known he commanded let not even the sight of her poison your immortal soul cast the woman out david the dendrite added his chorus to his colleagues ringing admonitions to the lord of the entire world the emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans even the massive brick walls of the holy crypt seemed to tremble with the echoes of the righteous yet ultimately merciful wrath of the pantocrator cast the woman out the emperor said weakly his agreement lost amid the clamouring oaths of the holy men nicetas gabras lifted the lid of the exquisitely granulated gold box and studied the seal on the rolled parchment tucked inside no he said he opened the second box this of silver chased with what appeared to be from haraldrs vantage seated behind his writing table a hunt scene no gabras pronounced even more emphatically the last box was blue enamel with red floral patterns no eustratius haraldrs newly appointed chamberlain turned to his master he almost imperceptibly raised the silver tray that held the three boxes and bowed slightly haraldr looked at gabras and raised his unscarred right eyebrow gabras ran the tip of his tongue very quickly between his lips and pulled reflexively at each long silverhemmed silken sleeve of his tunic as if he werent certain that the garment fitted properly the eidikos rank disputor said gabras briskly actuarius rank protostrator a vestitore none of them men of immediate consequence i will defer indefinitely their urgent requests for interviews with the manglavite haraldr nordbrikt haraldr nodded at gregory to indicate that he understood the greek then he nodded at gabras who tipped his bulbous head draped with long thin blond hair at the chamberlain eustratius the willowy eunuch turned and walked out the door with curious toebouncing strides haraldr dully praised odin and christ for the endless distractions of his new office household and fame an opiate of details that were meaningful only because they momentarily contained the pain and fear he focused on the words the bewildering roman system of titles and dignities eidikos disputor actuarias vestitore eidikos disputor actuarias the words rattled over and over again in his head like an absurd ditty briefly confusing the only thought he really had had for ten days now she had used him of course to an end so hideous that the memory of the words still froze his flesh to his bones sever the head of the imperial eagle he had fled from her bed like a man fleeing a demon in a dream hoping that as much as his night with her had been an incorporeal vision so too would its nightmare conclusion he had not seen either maria or the empress in the week and a half since they had tried to make him the agent of their treason mercifully protocol had shielded him on the road and since the arrival of the empresss huge caravan in constantinople neither woman had left the imperial gynaeceum but what madness had kept him from going to joannes as soon as he had returned the intent of the two valkyrja had been clear enough the head of the imperial eagle was the emperor and how many times had haraldr heard it implied that this empress had already murdered one husband as well as the rumours that she had been neglected by her new spouse and yet he had been unable to accuse the empress of such a conspiracy much less sentence maria to the inevitable interrogation in neorion now it was quite likely that the plot had been uncovered why else would the emperor have been absent on his wifes return and why were the two women virtual prisoners in their own apartments and how soon would it be before the two silksheathed valkyrja implicated him with the length of time he had concealed their terrible intentions he had been mad to spare maria even for a moment even after an eternity of her seduction when the emperor returned haraldr could only throw himself before the mercy of his father and beg that his pledgemen be spared but she had doomed him and she had known that when she had led his soul into the depths the pain of her betrayal was almost suffocating every word every thought was a struggle manglavite said gabras he looked anxiously at the large bronze water clock near haraldrs writing table might i suggest that eustratius inform your groom that one of your horses be saddled you have a meeting at the third hour in the palace with the grand eunuch do you have a preference as to the horse or perhaps merely the colour and would you a shout came from downstairs gabras turned towards the door and pursed his lips in alarm surely the servants arent quarrelling thought haraldr distantly gabras has already got them working together as smoothly as the gears of this water clock the shouts ascended the stairs and became an angry chorus then a moment later crescendoed in a blur of colours and cacophony of rattling armour a lean ruddyfaced blond in the full goldandred ceremonial regalia of the grand hetairia lurched into haraldrs office he shook off eustratius and two of his eunuch assistants like a wrathful bear shedding hunting dogs gabrass scarcely whiskered little chin dropped haraldr rose to his feet stunned uncertain whether to defend himself or to submit meekly to this emissary of the emperors justice manglavite haraldr said the norseman apologetically he made no effort to advance instead he threw back his red satin cape and smoothed it behind his leatherkilted hips his next words were in norse with a slightly rustic icelandic inflection but with the perfect diction of a man who could read and write the runes as well as a skald i am thorvald ostenson centurion of the grand hetairia i beg you not to regard the manner of my coming before you as an insult i petitioned to see you in the accepted fashion and your servant he gestured at eustratius who still glared at the norseman with small black eyes simply placed my request with all the rest even though i assured him that life and death were at stake in this matter ostenson held out a small rolled and sealed document the hetairarch mar hunrodarson asked me to make certain that you have read and destroyed this message haraldr broke the seal and unrolled the paper the message was in runic symbols a hand he had not seen before sir it read heed the warning of one norseman to another you are in grave danger in that house you must meet me tonight at the forum of constantine at the seventh hour i will wait for you beside the great statue make certain you are not followed your life depends on that you understand asked ostenson when haraldr finally lifted his eyes from the message haraldr nodded almost relieved at the simplicity of this ending if mar was in the city then the emperor had returned and his mighty sword was now already poised above the necks of the traitors the forum of constantine was to be the place of haraldrs execution haraldr looked grimly into ostensons acute cold blue eyes is it that simple he asked himself is mar acting as the emperors agent or to his own ends ostenson removed the paper from haraldrs fingers and looked up at the ringshaped candelabra that bathed the room in soft golden light the grey and foreboding sky visible through the three arched windows offered little natural illumination ostenson placed the message against one of the flames then turned the paper until it had been consumed to a brittle curled leaf he crushed the hot ashes in his hands and let the remains fall to the floor the centurion bowed deeply to haraldr and turned quickly before he left the room he paused and caught gabrass eye gabras turned away immediately faced haraldr and pulled on his sleeves i thought you would never come to me again she told him and he kissed the tears on her cheeks i love you she said his tenderness like a weight on her aching heart forcing her to think i loved you for love of her she explained very slowly each word tearing out a fibre of her heart but our love was greater the grief came over her like a wave and she cried until it seemed she were actually screaming under water unable to make herself heard choking but he held her and touched her hair his fingers stroking her as if they were made of light when he entered her the light flowed through her veins and she arched her neck and cried it was difficult to tell how long they made love when he had finished he rose above her and the light from the window made a halo around his golden hair he smiled at her and then turned slightly and his neck gushed blood once twice then spurting with every pulse spilling down his shoulders and chest she watched dumbly as tiny droplets bounced crazily against the silk sheets and when she looked at his face again the flesh had fallen away from it rotting before her eyes and his bare white teeth parted and he laughed im dead he said matteroffactly laughing after the terrible words you have killed me away away oh wicked thing murmured zoe cradling marias head and brushing at the tears that coursed down her cheeks marias eyes shot open startled sapphire blue against her flushed face you have gone through an entire life on that couch little daughter remorse a most profound ecstasy and then a horror that chilled me as if death zoe broke off having conjured an image she did not want to see maria suddenly remembered the nightmare she was awakening to and she sat straight up she quickly emptied the silver goblet she had left on a small ivory table beside her couch she hoped that the wine would wash the taste from her mouth a bitter bouquet of fear and death she looked at zoe is there news zoe nodded her blue eyes as hot and unrelenting as a midsummer sky i dont understand her any more thought maria for an instant before the observation was engulfed by general anxiety he is back said the empress it is over then said maria clutching at her silksheathed shoulders it has begun snapped zoe her bloodred lips cruel and scowling because you did not persuade your komes haraldr to kill for you does not mean that he has betrayed our intent we have been made captives maria pressed her hands to her thighs the tips of her fingers trembled a relative condition said zoe her eyes shot about her apartment as if she were a general surveying a battlefield we are not allowed to go out otherwise we are at our liberty we may summon whom ever we please and send them out again with whatever we please my husband is loath to see me because of his own guilt which has clearly become a chronic disorder in our absence he has no need to aggrandise that guilt or contribute to the already unsteady tilt of the imperial diadem upon his head by punishing me further zoe sliced the air with her delicate hand i believe the komes haraldr or rather the manglavite haraldr as he has now been so generously designated is still considering our request maria pressed her chin towards her snowy neck like a frightened swan i will not ask him to dance that closely with death again mother she said in a small girlish voice you did not see the look of horror in his eyes the betrayal the wound the outrage zoe stared at maria for a moment oh i am quite cognizant of your feelings she said bitingly our peril has somehow made this giant from thule as precious to you as a little pet i only hope you will not besiege me with your tears when i endeavour to slip my collar about his neck zoe narrowed her pitiless eyes i think your little pet can yet be goaded into devouring some of the palace vermin but mother pleaded maria you have heard of the honours joannes has showered on him the wealth the palace the servants even if he was not joanness property before surely his price has now been met it only means that he is in a position to consider wages of vastly greater currency zoes menacing tone silenced maria the air seemed to become heavy and stifling as if filled with a deadly miasma the double doors at the far end of the room slid open and symeon floated towards the empress and maria away zoe snarled mistress said symeon softly his ethereal progress undeterred his words seeming to draw him forward into the room i thought you should know zoe nodded viciously your husband has ordered that no one be admitted to your imperial apartments without the approval of the offices of the orphanotrophus joannes i have just spoken to the commander of the khazar guard commissioned to enforce this directive symeon bowed apologetically the heavy silence resumed maria pressed her palms together tightly and her nails scored the milky back of her hand very good symeon said zoe evenly and the eunuch drifted away as he had come zoe pulled her legs up on the couch and began inspecting her pearlstudded red silk slippers then i must be certain she finally said in a curiously buoyant voice only to entertain guests who enjoy the favour of the orphanotrophus joannes the snow fell fitfully in dry coarse flakes the wind blew the sparse accumulation into thin vaporous tendrils that swirled briefly above the darkened pavement and vanished into the night haraldr pulled his sablelined cloak more tightly around his shoulders perhaps his time in the hot southern realms had thinned his blood the buildings to either side of him rose like shadowed cliffs halfway down the block and three storeys above him a single undraped window lit by an oil lamp seemed glazed with gold glass he resumed his eastward progress up the sidestreet after another block he reached an intersection with a fairly large avenue he looked round the corner of the last building on the block two blocks to the south was the mese constantinoples broad colonnaded central thoroughfare this intersection was marked by the torches of the cursores the citys evervigilant police there were two of them pitchsmeared tapers stuck in their crossed arms like sceptres one of the men coughed the other stamped his feet and looked around briefly haraldr waited until the cursores attention had returned to his boots before he darted quickly across the intersection haraldr evaded two more cursores on a sixblock zigzagging journey down sidestreets and narrow alleys his route ended in front of a long twostorey building towering beyond the building perhaps three bowshots away was an enormous dark column vaguely silhouetted against the snowflecked night on top of the column stood a solitary figure a huge heroic ghost gesturing into the darkness constantine the great the first christian emperor of old rome who long ago in the twilight of romes old gods had built the great city that bore his name thus had begun the glory of new rome haraldr decided not to risk further exposure to the cursores by looking for a more suitable route into the forum which seemed to be completely hemmed in by two or threestorey buildings he crossed the street and quickly climbed the twostorey facade using the vines that had overgrown the featureless firststorey wall and wreathed the rusticated stone windows on the second storey he pulled himself over the jutting cornice of the tile roof scrambled to the peak and crawled along the spine of the building he paused where the roof pitched down again the forum of constantine was a large oval plaza denned by its darkness for a moment haraldr lingered over the view of the city now softly sprinkled in light and surrounded by black water he moved to the edge of the roof and looked down startled for a moment by the figures waiting for him the roof of the forums encircling arcade was a repository for dozens perhaps hundreds of statues their gestures and poses so lifelike that they seemed to have arrested their motion only because they had sensed his intrusion haraldr lowered himself from the cornice let go and fell a few ells before his feet resounded against the arcades wooden canopy haraldr stopped to examine one of the marble figures a woman almost as tall as himself she was cloaked in a gauzy robe that swirled around her legs and clung to her full breasts the sculptor had been so skilled that haraldr could see her nipples pressed against the fabric he reached out and touched the robe it was smooth almost without texture as if it were made of real silk he drew back her mouth was so delicate so subtly nuanced at the corners that it seemed she might at a moment part her lips and breathe life into her breast he waited poised on some great needle of fate with terrifying sharpness he remembered maria at daphne how she had touched a statues lips and drawn her fingers back as if she had come too close to the life locked in that ancient stone or had it been death she had touched haraldr dropped quietly into the forum and immediately ran towards the huge pyramidal ashlar base of the column he crouched beside the great marble plinth and looked up the statue wore a strange crown a fan of rays that projected about his head like shafts of frozen sunlight he made his decision if he opposed mar he would certainly die no matter whom mar was serving or what end he was pursuing but if haraldr dealt with him he might at least save his pledgemen he removed his cloak and placed it on the ground a few ells away from him then took his knife from his boot and removed his short sword from his belt and placed both weapons on the cloak he sat on his haunches and curled his arms around his knees the posture of a defenceless captive he waited the arm around his neck compressed his windpipe with paralysing effectiveness and his shout of alarm was strangled in his throat he was jerked to his feet and another arm wrapped his torso like a steel band no man has such a grip thought haraldr with dull recognition only odin i swear our lives are worthless if you call out whispered mar hunrodarson in a convincingly urgent cadence haraldr was released from the supernatural embrace and he rasped in cold air mar quickly scooped up haraldrs weapons and cloak and shoved them back to him not a sound he hissed for several moments mar searched the emptiness of the forum his temple pulsed follow me he barked as he dashed out into the darkness too stunned even to question his reprieve haraldr tried to maintain contact with mars fleeing back the arcade loomed out of the darkness forty ells away and mar stopped in a smooth motion he flung his briefly phosphorescing knife into the almost opaque passageway a cry like a soughing wind drifted through the columns mar sprinted into the arcade when haraldr arrived mar had already flipped the body over the man had dropped his outer garment in his flight and wore only a good woollen tunic and long dark woollen hose his spiky dark beard glistened with bloody sputum do you know him asked mar haraldr shook his head he had never seen this man before he belongs to joannes said mar he stood up and fixed haraldr with his fiercely intelligent blue eyes that house the orphanotrophus joannes so gratefully gave you is a nest of spies and informants haraldr considered this twist with detached interest as if he were now a spectator of his own life perhaps joannes merely assigned this man to protect me he said automatically reciting the questions of a mind too brutalized for guile mar narrowed his eyes if you live long enough to become a king they will call you haraldr oxwit you saw how well this man protected you when it appeared that i had attacked you mars scorn was a reviving lash the fates were giving him another toss the valkyrja hovered and waited deal with the demon had joannes learned of the empresss plot and haraldrs witless involvement and for that reason had him followed and if so why would mar have killed joanness informant assuming they served the same master haraldr fought a retching shudder was mar also part of the plot against the emperor deal fate told him deal as madly as you have ever gamed with me perhaps joannes suspects me of plotting against the emperor mar grabbed haraldrs collar and jerked him forward those are a dead mans words little prince if i had reason to believe you were capable of plotting against our father the emperor i would leave you with this garbage tonight he pushed haraldr away why would joannes suspect you of such a plot he has reason haraldrs heart was a drum mars eyes were cold blue lights what plot do you know of i have information said haraldr his chest ached from the effort of controlling his breathing it carries a price what do you want we both share the gift from odin said haraldr grimly i want you to swear to odin the allfather that my pledgemen will not be punished for anything i have done promise odin this oath that if you betray it he will draw back his favour haraldr knew that no man who had entered the spirit world and confronted his beast could ever break such an oath the christ might forgive those who broke his oaths as he had judas but odins gifts carried the obligation to honour them mar kicked over the corpse and pulled his knife out of the mans back his glazed eyes reflected the seriousness with which he took this step odin he intoned with a voice unlike his own i offer you this foeman then he took the knife and slashed it across his forearm odin i offer you my blood if i forsake this oath mar lowered his arm and the blood trickled into his palm his eyes now demanded as fiercely as his voice what do you know the empress has asked me to murder her husband the words came out like bloodvomit the release cathartic the taste as bitter as death mar turned away from haraldr and focused all his will so that he would not laugh out loud you have exhausted me with pleasure you are insatiable it is true come up here where i can see you no no i warn you i can stand no more of zoe reached behind her head and pulled her wet hair up and mopped it over her brow she touched her fingers to her own engorged nipples and shuddered you are excessive you are zoe ran her hands down her torso and then placed them under her surging buttocks digging her nails into her own rich smooth flesh wicked wicked you are she caressed her lovers cheeks and then pressed her hands to her loins stroking her drenched pubic hair you are a sinner she suddenly shrieked bucking madly and clenching her teeth her rigid body collapsed and she exhaled lyrically explicitly then lay with her head to the side for a moment before turning back to her lover oh delight have i wounded you oh no is your nose broken come here and let me see it to paraphrase a military maxim it was not the force of the attack but the surprise zoe laughed huskily will you counter with a thrust of your own she rubbed her hand under his scrotum and along his erect shaft you are armed i thought you found my attentions wearisome so i do zoe closed her legs do you worship me yes if i decreed that you should not i would disobey he slipped his hand between her thighs beg me he licked her nipples still erect they tightened into hard knots beg me beg to worship me beg for my naked flesh lover adoration morning star zoe grabbed her lovers pulsing member and squeezed hard i will take your essence this time little slave but you must ask for permission how will you ask for it she spread her legs suddenly here let me bring you in first her lover moaned oh light adoration ohhh take my souls nectar oh perfection zoe ran her nails along his flank when it happens this time will you swear to die for me i will said michael kalaphates drunkenly my love i will oh you wicked here is my understanding of what is afoot said mar when haraldr had finished his rambling frantic exposition they stood in what appeared to be a large park just south and west of the forum of constantine cypresses towered in orderly rows and a pool shone dully a hundred ells away first of all you must remember that the empress herself did not importune you to murder anyone i know the woman maria though to my regret not as well as you do and i believe i do no slander to the lady when i say that her beauty is matched by her volatility her impetuousness her wantonness forgive me comrade but she is reputed to be a woman of great passions and little discretion i hope i am not wounding you but when she was only a girl this was eight years ago when i was only a decurion of the guard when she was only a bud she took a lover a distinguished senator and military commander i cannot say with certainty who murdered this man but she was known to have visited him in his apartments shortly before he was found stabbed to death of course the empress protected the child and the scandal was suppressed but i have always suspected that maria killed the man i suspect that now she thinks she is acting in her imperial majestys interests as i do not question her love for our mother the empress but i do not think she is acting at her imperial majestys request haraldrs head ached from the metallic buzzing and his body seemed weightless the empress said that maria would ask me a question in her name and the rumours you know how it is imputed that the empress had a hand in in the death of her husband mars face hardened how do you know that maria asked you the question the empress intended and forget the libel of the streets and the theatres i can tell you for certain that the empress had no part in the death of romanus because i pulled his body from the bath in which he had drowned may the mother of heaven forgive me but the emperor was under the care of his physicians and besotted in spite of that he must have fallen and hit his head perhaps he never should have been allowed to bathe alone but that was no treason doubts still flocked like quarrelling ravens was mar performing his own drama and yet what he said about romanus could well be true i think there is something else you dont understand that was why i had to see you tonight mar held his hands up and examined his huge yet elegant fingers as if he were himself impressed by the marvel if i had known what i do of you now i would have behaved differently when we first met then i saw you as some sort of renegade a man who did not understand our devotion to our father and his imperial dignity a royal whelp who thought he could plunder the wealth of rome merely to serve his own ends i thought to teach you a lesson intimidate you use my knowledge of your background to frighten you into obedience i didnt know then that you were a man of honour tonight i am certain that your devotion to our father is as great as my own i no longer mistrust you but i hope for your sake as well as mine that you will begin to trust me this was not a norseman speaking this was the oiled tongue of a eunuch but why was mar wagging a praisetongue if he held the sword over haraldrs neck he needs me haraldr realized he needs my friendship more than he needs my fear you have dealt once and won your pledgemens lives deal with the demon again i trust that you will not break your oath to odin what would i gain by trusting you further i have satisfied my honour and you can only kill me once haraldr had expected at best the fury of mars anger perhaps a final mortal struggle but mar surprised him with an intense yet even stare what you would gain manglavite haraldr is the honour of defending a worthy emperor against a malignancy so foul that it threatens every life in the roman empire our own included haraldr could agree that the emperor was worthy of defending i have told you of the plot i suspected he invited you say that marias words were sever the head of the imperial eagle perhaps she meant joannes not the emperor it is often said that the orphanotrophus joannes is the grotesque head atop the body of rome there are many who love our father who would like to see his brother out of the way mar paused ominously the orphanotrophus joannes is evil he does not serve our father despite his lavish protestations he serves himself joannes has already designated you a plaything in his evil game haraldr weighed his desperate hope that marias crime was lesser perhaps excusable against the fierce love he had seen on joanness face when the giant monk had spoken of his brother the emperor how would joannes profit by opposing our fathers wishes as i understand it a eunuch would not be permitted to rule rome the eunuch joannes will soon have enough power to have a porter from the wharves crowned emperor to sit on the imperial throne as his surrogate and when he acquires that power no man or woman in rome including our father even including our purpleborn mother will be safe that is why we must work together to oppose him haraldr looked down at the hard winter turf listening to the appeals of two voices neither one of which he could trust was it possible that joanness fierce love was for his own power the power that only for the present he saw embodied in his brother and if mar were correct then marias crime was only that of using him to defeat a monstrous evil but could he trust mar im not asking you to accept my word on this said mar addressing haraldrs reticence you neednt believe that the man i killed tonight was joanness spy i can offer you proof that joannes has already moved against you with far more deadly intent why would he move against me if as you say i am already his plaything he intends to make you a considerably more pliant instrument as i say i can offer you proof you risked your life to parlay with me tonight if you meet me tomorrow night at the chrysotriklinos you will risk nothing further haraldr nodded his men would live to see their homes he would live at least another day that was vastly more than he had expected when he had ventured into this snowy night the stocky darkeyed little man had never known his real name but as long as he could remember his people his people being his fellow denizens of the notorious studion slums had called him the squirrel and as far as he was concerned squirrel was his name and his identity quick darting able to climb anything and perhaps he was a bit erratic too because in the squirrels business a man could not afford to develop recognizable patterns the squirrel stood at the entrance to the vast colonnaded terraced square called the augustaion he looked without awe or interest past the enormous brick column that rose from the centre of the square thrusting up the huge bronze equestrian statue of some longdead emperor now green with age frozen in perpetual hubris his great right arm pointing to the east his left hand cradling a globe symbolizing the entire earth the squirrel did not care to know that this emperor had been justinian who half a millennium ago had commanded an empire even larger than that established by the great bulgarslayer an empire on three continents stretching from persia to the pillars of heracles from the alps to the far reaches of the river nile the squirrel had no wish to know that justinians codex had established the laws that would determine his fate should he ever stumble in the performance of his labours he did not even care to know that justinian had built the sole object of the squirrels attention the great silver domes of the hagia sophia the huge church to the northeast of the augustaion today the glittering domes were as dull as the grey mossytextured sky the squirrel wrapped his dyed wool cloak around his torso reflecting to himself that he probably would have been able to gain admittance to the palace grounds today without showing the guards his tunic of the cheapest exportgrade syrian silk the uniform of a lowgrade secretary in the bureaux of the sacellarius still it was best to be prepared for any eventuality if one was not prepared for the unexpected in this business one would soon be most painfully deprived of the tools of ones trade the squirrel proceeded at his leisure across the square veering around a cluster of lawyers discussing a case in front of the massive marble columns of the senate building some drivel about the ecclesiastical canon asserting precedence in a case where customary not secular statutes the squirrel suppressed his urge to spit at the feet of the barristers they were windbags who blew nothing but ill to the people that was certain the squirrels demeanour brightened as he saw the khazar guards moving into the northern exit of the augustaion so the reports of the almighty emperors return were correct good information the squirrel told himself shaking his head with satisfaction there was no limit to the value of good information by the time the squirrel reached the exit of the augustaion the khazar guards had formed a cordon blocking the arcade that led from the square into the gardens and atrium at the west end of the hagia sophia the public would be prevented from passing but even minor imperial officials might be admitted to watch the emperor in his biweekly procession to the church the squirrel kept his cloak wrapped tightly about his tunic and produced a green sprig of myrtle just as any bootlicking minor courtier would to celebrate the fleeting passage of his swollenheaded father the squirrel clasped the myrtle reverently to his breast and was passed by the khazars without a second glance the squirrels anticipation plunged like an overfed gull when he entered the cypresswalled courtyard in front of the hagia sophia the fairhaired barbaroi thugs were already standing at attention alongside the route but where was the mob of dignitaries and sycophants and functionaries who usually assembled with their sprigs and blossoms and wreaths to cheer and chant their puffedup autocrator on his way to church the squirrel counted maybe forty or fifty courtiers along the entire path and each one of them with at least two of the fairhair beasts to keep an eye on him the squirrels instinct told him to take the rest of the day off but a more powerful impulse drove him forward choose your spot well the squirrel reminded himself because with little or no crowd to hide your movements you are only going to have one opportunity there about four paces to the right of a portly man in the green silk coat with the furtrimmed collar the squirrel walked right up to the edge of the marble path and took his place he bowed humbly to the portly man on his left quickly noting to his amusement that the overfed great whatever couldnt even get the clasps of his coat fastened around his silksheathed belly the mans ornate silver belt jutted out like the metal band around a bulging cask of fish sauce then the squirrel bowed even more humbly to the towering fairhaired monster before him not even daring to lift his eyes above the gilt leather kilt and polished gold breastplate of the varangian guard imagine that on your neck he shuddered eyeing the huge axeblade wrapped against the gilded breast by inhumanly thick forearms it was a sight to make a man consider taking the tonsure and conducting his business only in the name of the pantocrator but if the squirrel could practise his trade in plain sight of this brute what a tale hed have for his associates back at the devils walking stick what the squirrel watched the approaching horsemen in astonishment mounted varangians for certain and behind them the emperor on his white stallion with the goldandscarlet caparisons but instead of a stately canter they were all charging along as if fleeing the last trumpet and where was the usual procession the drums the flutes the massed courtiers in front bearing their candles and chanting their gibberish something was very strange here this clearly was not the time to try some fancy stunt but to flee now would certainly arouse suspicion and this unprecedentedly abrupt procession might in fact turn to the squirrels advantage the first ranks of varangians clattered past and then the demon of them all the hetairarch with the devils blue eyes glaring ahead right behind the hetairarch rode his majesty the squirrel waved his sprig wildly and shouted render homage the suns rays are upon us still holding his myrtle high and dashing as if to follow the charging procession the squirrel headed straight for the portly official it will take perfect timing he hastily reminded himself unnhhh the portly official grunted as if the entire west wind had been disgorged from his belly the squirrel wrapped one arm over the officials shoulder to keep from falling and with the other went about his days work i have disgraced myself oh your plenipotentiary worship sir the squirrel pleaded his labour already completed it was my unbridled love for our holy father if i may beg the forgiveness of one who certainly stands second only to the sun that rises before us so that we may live each day oh worship pardon me if only for my souls sake and because your christian charity doubtless exceeds your other uncountable virtues go away little thing the official snarled viciously before i have these gentlemen here escort you to the numera where your witless life might pass without further hazard to those worthy to surround rightfully the imperial dignity away refuse the squirrel bowed and began a slow casual retreat so as not to arouse suspicion the officials purse was already safely snugged within the voluminous folds of his poorly fitting tunic a fine grab the studions most adroit cutpurse thought exulting and the fat goose had a purse as heavy as judass but what now the imperial procession had halted and the varangians were leaping from their horses theotokos hadnt the emperor himself fallen from his horse yes indeed he was on the ground and the squirrel could not believe what he was seeing the sounds coming from his majestys throat what one of the barbaroi goons was rushing directly at him and as the squirrel looked about frantically he could see them thundering about like runaway bulls rounding up all the other witnesses a whores spit they were they could sew up these dignitaries in pork bellies and toss them in the bosporus but not the squirrel the wind rattled in the squirrels ears as he took off across the garden if he could reach the forest around st irene the smaller church to the north of the hagia sophia he could leap the wall and get lost among the warehouses behind the naval yards fear pumped his legs frantically as he dashed through a blur of wintergrey foliage he did not look back until he saw the churchyard wall north of st irene damn his soul the barbaros was still after him gaining with every freakish stride the squirrel bounded body stretching fingers clawing his powerful deft hands pulled and propelled his compact body over the wall the ground dropped away behind the wall and the squirrel fell farther than he had imagined he would no something snapped and the pain made him shiver he got to his feet and scrambled away from the rubblestrewn base of the wall towards the huge brick bulk of the nearest warehouse it was only twenty paces away but each step was excruciating if only he could find a door a passageway he looked back the barbaros came down from the wall like a great cat oh theotokos plead for me for i never even knew the comfort of an orphanage and i did what i had to do only stealing enough to eat and perhaps to have some minor luxuries and though i have fornicated i have never i beseech thee never taken another life oh theotokos the squirrel saw the small door barely visible at the end of the buildings east side he forced himself to run and ducked into the welcome darkness the smell of mould added nausea to the knifing pain in his ankle sacks were stacked everywhere musty burlap covered with dust he crawled quickly burrowing into a tumbleddown pile something kicked him in the face and dust came into his eyes boots bags of campaign boots for some great army that had never been assembled then the squirrel heard someone enter the warehouse and he winced holding his breath the footsteps meandered pausing to kick at the sacks he heard an entire stack topple then another closer another stack tumbled down and the dust was suffocating theotokos the dust the squirrels ribs smashed against his guts and he saw brilliant sparks the squirrel flew to his feet as if the hand of the devil himself had jerked him up the dust began to settle the face of the barbaros came out of the gloom fortunes scowl the squirrel told himself finding irony in defeat the devils blue eyes the hetairarch himself had run him down this could be a painful death the squirrel ruefully considered what did you see barked the fairhaired beast in perfect greek see hetairarch i am but a miserable thief who the hetairarchs knife blocked the vision of the squirrels left eye if your eyes are that useless then i am certain you wont mind losing them whispered the norse giant well worship i if i might presume in the presence of an eminence so overawing that i what did you see rabbit turd i ah i believe someone has poisoned our holy father has endeavoured to snatch the very sun from our skies and leave us bereft in a darkness that bite your tongue and listen wharf rat certainly worship his imperial majesty is ill more than ill he is plagued by demons who drive the reason from him and will soon snatch away his life perhaps it is a punishment from the pantocrator the hetairarch paused do you know that our emperor seduced your mother the squirrel quickly crossed himself there was only one woman in creation worthy of his respect indeed his love his purpleborn mother i have heard that worship whispered the squirrel in a husky truly humbled voice where do you live studion a long walk is your ankle broken the squirrel could scarcely believe his ears would a man who was about to slice his nose off and gouge his eyes out worry if he had far to walk i think it is broken eminence how much did you steal the squirrel pulled the purse out of his tunic and handed it to the hetairarch mar hefted the purse and then pushed the man down on the pile of boots wait here he said within ten minutes a man will come and bring you the donkey you are about to purchase mar reached in the purse and extracted a gold coin you will ride your new ass back to studion as triumphantly as your christ entering jerusalem mar tossed the purse the remainder of the coins untouched back to the squirrel when you get there go to your inn buy anyone who will listen a cup of wine and tell them what you saw today just as i explained it to you need i tell you that my own name is not to be mentioned worship you outdo fortune in the beneficence your unimaginably august and noble presence is capable of bestowing to those who are given life by the merest reflected ray of your shining being the squirrel trailed off the hetairarch had disappeared through a doorway like the archangel ascending back among the heavenly host theotokos theotokos the squirrel clutched the stolen purse as if it contained his miraculously redeemed life good information he happily told himself there is no limit to the value of good information what did you tell gabras asked mar that you would be drilling me on the night postings around the chrysotriklinos and trichonchos answered haraldr good you are starting to think like a roman now if he is told and i am certain he will be if he is told that we were seen together he will think nothing of it haraldr looked down from the terraced slopes that rose towards the massive colonnaded flank of the hippodrome the lights of the vast palace complex glimmered below the reflections off the variegated marble turned the intricate architectural tracery into a dazzling multicoloured blaze it was impossibly lovely and impossibly painful to think that maria slept there he could see distinctly the brightly illuminated porticoes of the gynaeceum the imperial womens quarters he could feel her breathing beside him like the faintest breeze her slightly damp warmth it hurt him more to think that she might have used him in a just cause it was easier to imagine her as devoid of any redeeming virtue with some perverse hope he wished that mars proof of joanness conspiracy would turn out to be as counterfeit as her love then he would give mar a last battle that would awaken every old god who slumbered in this city and die cursing her for her treachery i could drink this view until the last dragon takes wing said mar his eyes rapt at the shimmering nocturnal mosaic and yet here you must always be wary that you do not become intoxicated by this beauty mar shook his head do you know the lays of homer and the other tales of the trojan war haraldr nodded helen i think of her at these times too much beauty when there is too much beauty men will do anything to possess it to feel that she writhes in their arms alone sometimes i think that is true of this city and the glory it can offer men he looked over at haraldr were you thinking of maria i yes you have loved the stars i envy you and i pity you mar clapped haraldr on the back we must go the garden with its neat rows of shrubs pruned back for the winter and its fountains stilled ended beneath the triclinium a littleused ceremonial hall abutting the hippodrome haraldr followed mar through the main hall a space so enormous that mars sputtering oil lamp could not illuminate the walls or ceiling the two norsemens footsteps echoed eerily as if they were giants overwhelmed by the dwelling of even greater titans finally the embossed eagles on the bronze doors flickered and materialized mar took a key from his belt and unlocked them they entered a gallery that abruptly narrowed into a passageway only large enough for three men abreast then another much smaller bronze door the gallery turned this way and that more doors clanging like thunder in the dark narrow passages up steps down finally they reached a large circular chamber a marblebalustraded spiral staircase rose into the darkness the emperors box is above said mar gesturing with the lamp mar turned towards the wall the smooth plaster curve was frescoed with floral patterns the squarish wooden panel hidden by twining painted vines was impossible to discern until mar slid it aside and crawled through the opening haraldr followed sliding on his belly for a dozen ells the crawlspace opened into another mazelike gallery eventually they halted at a banded iron door after some difficulty with the lock mar finally pushed the creaking door ajar a large vaulted gallery led to a waisthigh stone railing mar leaped over the barricade the night seemed almost lustrous a whipping cold wind pushed the clouds towards the southeast and revealed a diamondstudded sky the hippodrome was completely darkened but the towering obelisks and columns that ran the length of the central spina were sharply defined against the uncountable rows of seats along the portico that crowned the enormous sweep of the stadium hundreds of statues stood as silent witnesses mar trotted across the firm sand to another arch barricaded by a stone railing this gallery ended in a staircase that dropped two storeys music and voices rose up as the norsemen descended an ancient crone waited on the landing at the bottom of the stairs she turned quickly a divination she crowed ill divine the both of you for a single coin she appraised the two giants with rheumy sporadically focusing eyes and smacked her toothless lips when i was a beauty i took on two like you whenever i wanted she tilted her head back and cawed you paid and you came back the next night both of you did the crone crawled forward on her knees dont i know you gentlemen indeed indeed fairhairs the bulgarslayers boys youve got gold that i know the bulgar slayer gave you each a coin for every nose you brought him butcher boys she crawled closer her eyes suddenly acute ill divine you the time my fair butcher boys then take her the whores yours shell spread her legs and take on every one the crone punched her tiny nutlike fist obscenely i know you boys her head slumped and she muttered something incomprehensible mar dropped a coin at her feet beneath the southern end of the hippodrome unfolded a tawdry haphazard maze of stables hovels inns brothels and small tenements all lit by so many flaring tapers that the smoke hung over the district like a local fog wherever a street was visible amid the densely packed buildings people were visible coursing and clamouring along little figures could also be seen perched in windows and balconies the empress city has many faces said mar you will find this one interesting mar followed a main street that zigged and zagged men in short tunics some carrying sacks of feed on their backs others driving donkey carts zipped across at the intersections heading down dusty side roads towards the hippodrome stables a cart with two huge striped cats caged inside rolled past followed by dozens of filthy barefoot children who ran along singing a song beside an intersection a woman stood on her hands her tunic had fallen away to leave her lower limbs completely exposed a man threw a coin to the pavement beneath her head and she spread her legs open the various fortunetellers were everywhere sitting on carpets or sheltered beneath painted booths a diviner an old man with greasy silver hair beckoned to them from one side of the street a palmist young with beautiful black hair and a big scar that parted her chin waved from the other hetairarch she yelled mar nodded and walked on a noseless man ran past them a small costumed dog under his arm mar turned left a dwarf directed singing by three pretty sad girls in clean white tunics a large crowd joined in choruses and coins showered onto the filthy street before the poignant little songbirds after a right turn the street ended against a cluster of wooden buildings wedged round a tenement with a crumbling vinelaced facade big man big big man the coarsely seductive womans voice came from a shallow porch in front of one of the wooden buildings mar ignored the disembodied invitation and slipped into an alley next to the brick tenement finally they stopped at a thick wooden door at the rear of a large newly plastered threestorey building a viewing grate in the door slid aside at mars knock the door opened inside was a storeroom that smelled of sharp fish sauce and flour another door and they were into the light hetairarch a short bald man in a sparkling blue silk tunic clasped mars arms his crooked teeth flashed in an open smile he had a clipped dark wiry beard welcome welcome mar turned to haraldr this is anatellon the charioteer he won seven races in the hippodrome the emperor constantine had a bronze bust made of him of course the emperor also made a fullsize bronze statue of my best horse said anatellon he threw his arms wide and emitted a curiously highpitched giggle he looked at haraldr and you need no introduction hareld slayer of saracens and seljuks and now manglavite of rome anatellon extended his arms his forearms were as thick as the forelegs of an elk and so hard that they seemed carved of marble after clasping haraldrs arms anatellon suddenly raised his hands over his head so you hacked him right in two he exclaimed bringing his arms down in a huge motion he giggled i like that haraldr looked around they stood in a bright antechamber next to a heavy wooden spiral staircase whirling music and frivolous voices came from a larger room beyond haraldr could see only glimpses of bright silk through a wooden screen carved with intricate leafy patterns anatellon led the two norsemen up the staircase to a dimly lit hallway punctuated with curtained openings every half dozen ells a woman went past them like a wraith her face as lovely and pale as a porcelain mask her white limbs and large breasts seeming to fluoresce beneath a gauzy robe her glistening dark hair was coiled in the fashion of the court and sprinkled with gems shes an alan whispered anatellon to his guests too good for this place i wont give her to just anyone even if they can meet the price ive already got a few highly placed gentlemen who want to take her into the palace and make a lady of her he winked at haraldr you could afford her the hallway ended at bronze double doors chased with images of four rearing horses the doors slid open and a young eunuch with a sweet cherubic face bowed the principal furnishing of the room was a large canopied bed anatellon gestured to three silkcushioned backless chairs with thick ivory armrests the eunuch quickly brought wine he served the glass goblets with overly elaborate gestures an unintended parody of the polished elegance of the imperial chamberlains mar motioned with his head at the eunuch and anatellon nodded the boy left the room and slid the doors shut behind him i havent told the manglavite haraldr any of the details because i wanted to hear the story myself said mar to anatellon what exactly did you see anatellon bent forward and tensed his bulging forearms three nights ago a man came to my establishment and sat downstairs i recognized him immediately as nicetas gabras what blurted haraldr not my chamberlain nicetas gabras believe me manglavite it would be most unhealthy for a man in my business not to know the faces of men owned by the orphanotrophus joannes mar nodded apparently vouching for anatellons reliability anyway i made it my business to keep a sharp eye on gabras to no end it seemed he drank a few cups then called for a girl he wasnt with her more than a quarter of an hour then he left but as he walked out he passed a man who had been sitting by himself all night the kind who find melancholy at the bottom of a cup anyway i was watching gabras very closely and as he passed this man he held his right arm by his side like this anatellon let his arm fall straight to the floor and showed three fingers like this a gesture you wouldnt notice unless you were looking for something anyway gabras leaves and this fellow stays and drinks for another two hours perhaps then he calls for the same girl gabras was with and well you should hear it from her anatellon got up and slid the doors open he spoke briefly to the eunuch waiting in the hall by the time he returned to his seat a young woman had entered the room she was not much taller than a girl but fully developed in the breasts and hips she had heavy sensual lips and a slight dusk to her skin tell these eminences what happened flower yes flower looked at the carpet there was a soft green tint to her eyes her wavy hair streaked with light and dark brown tufts hung freely over her shoulders you see i had intended to take this man to another booth darias because the previous guest had disturbed mine flower made a comical churning motion with her arms to indicate that the guest had apparently vomited this man insisted that i take him to my booth the third booth on the right flower shrugged why not i decided men make strange requests so i removed the filthy bedding and he reclined himself on the bare mattress i had begun to unveil myself in the manner most men find provocative when he told me to turn away so i uncovered myself and found him still fully clothed with his arm reaching beneath the mattress turn away he said quickly modesty commands me to ask you to turn away until i have become accustomed to my nakedness flower narrowed her eyes what i have never heard this before this is all becoming more curious than i can bear so i pretended to hide my eyes but i looked at him through my hair like this and as i spied i saw him reach beneath the mattress again and this time i discovered the cause of his modesty from beneath the mattress he miraculously produced a great fat wallet i could see it sag from the weight of the coins he concealed it within his clothing which he then removed then of course he asked me to join him and proceeded in the manner of men haraldr shook his head gabras the milkmouthed little swine do you have any idea who this excessively modest guest was yes manglavite said anatellon having been advised by flower of these further coincidences i made inquiries among my clientele the man is called the physician not because he dispenses palliatives purgatives and healing draughts but because he can so quickly alleviate all of the pain and suffering that this life brings upon us anatellon made a slashing motion across his throat where would two ailing norsemen find this apothecary asked mar studion said anatellon ominously studion mars inflection was the opposite of anatellons he said the word as if it were some sort of rare gem the oil lamps cast a yellowish light over the stacks of documents making them seem ancient archival joannes rubbed the deep sockets of his eyes wishing that these papers did indeed reflect the great flow of history and not merely the fragile aspirations of a single man whose life span would be so evanescent so insignificant against the great firmament of time unless yes here surrounding him in these figures this legislation these tax codifications were the dimensions of his immortality yes just as the builders of the great hagia sophia had proceeded from mere wooden models to an edifice that would reign through the millennia until the last trumpet blew then so these papers were the architects vision of the great edifice to his memory and yet like the everremembered architects of the mother church he needed a builder a back to hoist the bricks and place them within the exacting strictures of his schemata yes he had thought he had selected his builder well a back broad and noble but now that back was bowed afflicted each day it carried fewer and fewer bricks to the heavenscraping vaults each day his builder fell behind the schedule that had to be kept joannes looked at papers on his writing table brilliant this series of novels a novel was a new law mandated by the emperor would generate enough tax revenues to again fill even the great bulgarslayers vast underground treasuries revenues enough to send armies and fleets to the pillars of heracles again to regain alexandria and aleppo and bring venice and genoa to their knees to again reap the wealth of the tigris and the euphrates to humble the caliphates and the bulgars and exterminate the scyths from the face of the earth the world as the pantocrator had enjoined them it should be and it was already here in this beautiful paper construction the numbers could not lie let the sophists in their impotent bureaux invoke their mincing reservations about an overburdened collection apparatus let the handwringing strategi protest about the difficulties of enforcement it would work the numbers would become solidi and the power those solidi could buy would reach out into the world the numbers would increase and the power of rome would be restored but it took the force of an emperor to place such a sweeping reform before the people for in truth wasnt the emperor and autocrator really the master builder who himself could not build without the hundreds of thousands of sweating backs who laboured at his command if the master builder was not there to lash and cajole and inspire his labourers once again to put their shoulders to the load even when they were slumped with weariness and exhaustion then no edifice would rise and for all the labourers of joanness new rome now knew the master builder was a phantom a man who could no longer appear in public even for the briefest ceremony theotokos todays incident in front of the hagia sophia could have been the end yes that serious fortunately the barbaroi varangians had been able to detain all of the witnesses and convince them of the inestimable value of discretion the barbaroi thugs who built nothing only plundered what others had laboured to construct the hetairarch mar hunrodarson was moving too quickly even common gossip acknowledged that now and haraldr nordbrikt what a mistake to see the witless brute serenaded in the hippodrome his head bowed meekly as if there had ever been a humble thought in his vanityengorged skull build haraldr nordbrikt up and he would be more dangerous than mar hunrodarson the people of the city might actually come to like him haraldr nordbrikts ascendant power clearly required the pruning that had already been arranged for him was it to be tonight he would have to check with gabras joannes shook his massive head as if awakening from a bad dream that was what was insufferably offensive about these fairhairs in the palace the time one spent dealing with them added to nothing and took away from matters of real importance look at him sitting here fuming at pastyfaced pirates from thule when history waited time passing inexorably demanded his answer joannes brought his massive splayed arms down on his writing table and the impact echoed through the empty corridors of the magnara basement where was the answer where and then like the voice of an angel the answer came to him extraordinary was it possible perhaps it was and yet to do it would be more difficult than passing the entire peninsula of byzantium through the eye of a needle who could do that not even a conjuror but perhaps in the silence of the night the angels whispered again and joannes heard yes love love which had created the entire world out of the formless abyss had brought light to eternal darkness and had vaulted the endless waters love had done it once and might do it again love and luck what do you dream about halldors eyes snapped open he groggily pieced together the greek sentence had he been asleep how long odin well it was no feather bed being komes of the middle hetairia particularly now that haraldr was almost always occupied with his manglavite duties whatever they were ulfr thankfully handled the considerable burden of administration but it was still halldor who had to pound the excruciating ceremonial discipline of the court into five hundred swaddlingnew guardsmen most of whom still couldnt tell a lofty patrician from a lowly exarch or find their way from the magnara to the chrysotriklinos it was sufficiently taxing to make a man fall asleep next to a woman as beautiful as this you were dreaming i can tell the ladys blue eyes reflected the glowing candelabra far over her head halldor pulled his legs up so the bulge in his robe wouldnt be so prominent dont be embarrassed she said laughing i am not a virgin no youre worse thought halldor youre the wife of some official whose title halldor couldnt exactly pinpoint the essential fact was that the husband had been exiled for several years as temporary special strategus of some theme halfway to vinland the lady had issued halldor an invitation to dine with her and as some irascible old magister had pointed out to him it would have shamed the lovely woman had he refused surely even a semipagan tauroscyth understood that it was his christian obligation to console the lonely semiwidow so after a suitably proper fiveday interval during which the prospective liaison had become the titillation of half the ladies at court here he was asleep with nothing consummated did i bore you she asked stroking his long blond hair with fingers like slender ivory flutes halldor smiled at her her lips were as exquisite as a greek aphrodites her hair almost pure gold in the lamplight her breasts swelled against her silk scaramangium he touched his lips to her ear inhaling the scent of roses and fresh meadow flowers when did you ever bore a man halldor surmised that his greek had been fluent enough when she threw her arm around his neck and crushed her breasts to his with an embrace as tight as a shipbuilders vice he finally prised his mouth away from the tender aggression of her lips to ask the salient question where would you like to do this in my bath she said gulping her eyes glittering the child looked up his black eyes mesmerized by the sight of the giant fairhairs and their woman he hastily stripped the tattered rag from the torso of the fallen man and vanished squirming clusters of large rats continued to work on the face and toes of a fresh corpse only a few ells away the fallen man groaned mar held haraldr back a pox blotch he said he will be dead soon anyway haraldr looked about searching for an instrument of mercy he saw a large piece of scorched masonry that had crumbled from the ruined firegutted building to his right he picked up the big stone and walked over to the nownaked softly breathing man haraldr gasped the mans face and most of his body were a mass of pustulant sores only the feverish eyes were human they reached out and the man moaned holy cherubim save me haraldr looked at the tittering fearless rats waiting only for him to step back before they began to nibble on living flesh he brought the stone smashing down on welcoming eyes mar held flower in his arms she had bravely agreed to come along and identify the physician if possible she had not reckoned on this this is where they come to die when even the streets turn them out said mar as if anything could explain this a man entered the intersection his frock as black as the charred shells of the tenements that towered above him the bearded monk bent over another corpse one of half a dozen or so lying about in the muck and silently arranged the stiff chalkhued arms they come here to die because they know the monks will find them said mar over there he pointed north is the studius monastery they have a fraternity of monks who do nothing but retrieve and bury the corpses that here are shunned by even the dirt mar walked over to the monk and bowed then handed the serenelooking man some gold coins the monk dipped his head perfunctorily and continued his work mar took flowers hand and looked at haraldr he spoke in norse when you see the live creatures of the studion you will understand why i have taken us through the refuges of the dead they soon came among the living a dark alley opened up onto a fairly broad avenue which in spite of its breadth was almost completely canopied by jutting enclosed wooden balconies and makeshift platforms that in many cases joined over the streets the stench of human excrement was overpowering the surface of the street was spongy and to his horror haraldr realized that it was paved with welltrodden mud rubbish and sewage perhaps to the depth of an ell beneath the precarious wooden canopies and reeking slimy facades clustered hundreds of supine forms the lucky ones were covered with straw most of the rest many of whom had bare skin showing through their rags were huddled together in scores of human mounds each several ells high haraldr was incredulous wont the ones at the bottom suffocate he asked mar look again they are not piled on one another but on mounds of garbage the heat of decay keeps them warm they began their stroll through hell the clumps of bodies stirred from endless wet coughs and moans a man his scalp covered with great black scabs squatted in the street groaning and clutching his knees two boys perhaps ten kicked at a solitary old man a naked filthblackened child stood by a sleeping man and woman wailing block after block of this a man his greasy tunic thrown up rutting like a dog with what appeared to be a very young girl almost a child in one tenement there was a party two men stuck their heads out of a window and tried to drop bits of their flaming tapers on the bodies huddled below a naked woman squatted on a wooden balcony and urinated a boy of fourteen perhaps handless his mouth covered with sores offered the norsemen a sex act he could perform with the stump of his slender wrist haraldr could scarcely believe his reeling senses he had seen pockets of misery in hedeby and kiev the offalstrewn muddy streets crowded with cutpurses charlatans and crippled beggars but the studion was beyond his experience beyond imagining now he understood why he had been blindfolded on his initial entry into the city and why these wretches would attempt to burn their own dwellings this offended the gods and it should offend man he had known the empress city to be wanton even cruel but this was an infection of the body a great corruption that would contaminate everything she touched and yet the monk who came to bury the outcasts of the empress city was a part of her too no norseman would have had that kind of courage or devotion to the souls of strangers the beauty and virtue of this ravishing city were beyond imagining and so was her unspeakable evil perhaps that was also true of maria halldor draped the thick linen towel round his waist and waited the steam glazed the green marble benches with a film of condensation and clouded the plastered vault overhead halldor enjoyed this roman ritual particularly when there was a woman waiting at the end of his sweat when he had assessed that the foul humours whatever they were had been expunged from his body he mopped his body with the towel and entered the next chamber the large pool was almost obscured by steam like one of icelands natural hot pools on a winter day he heard a splash and saw a vague diffusion of pink halldor rinsed himself in the tub adjacent to the pool and then walked carefully down the opussectile steps he could see a mosaic pattern on the bottom of the pool but could not make out the motifs the water was cool but not chilling they say you are a great seafarer her voice was crystalline delightful halldor began to suspect that he would want to dine here more than once he wished the steam would clear so he could get a look at her in his arms she had felt like one of those statues come to life each curve perfect can you cross the water that separates us she asked her voice ringing delicately against a domed ceiling with a large glass oculus in the middle halldor stroked easily he had learned to swim at three summers he touched the far end of the pool and wiped at the water in his eyes you didnt navigate properly halldor reached towards the teasing voice and made brief contact with slippery flesh she thrashed away suddenly he could feel her against his back her breasts and thighs sliding by this time he got hold of an ankle and pulled her into his arms you have been netted he said she laughed and pressed her entire body against his and kissed him letting the water drain from her lips like a thin aphrodisiac oil yes she said laughing but do you think you can spear me then she ducked out of his arms and swam away the filthpaved road turned abruptly left into the triangle created by the southward sweep of the marmora coastline before it met the great wall of the city we have met all the honest folk of the studion mar said in norse motioning back towards the long dark boulevard of misery they had just traversed let us now go among the liars thieves cheats whores and murderers the buildings here were better maintained with plaster and wood patchwork frequently visible though whole facades of crumbling brick and rotting wood also awaited repairs that might never be made signs and even an occasional statue appeared here and there above the arcades of dingy inns and food shops prostitutes their faces virtually painted on prowled like cats pretty thing eminences said one sourly as she passed eyeing flower enviously beneath her cakedon powder large boils raised pale welts cutpurses ran beneath the arcades in shadowy packs and they soon became bolder swarming into the street to run about the norsemen like crazy jackals trying to determine whether a lion was sufficiently wounded to permit an attack at an intersection five or six whores held a man upside down by his quivering legs another garishly painted woman sat by his head with a rock bashing his teeth out cheated her explained one of the women to the gathering crowd the inns became larger and crowds milled in the street a man in silk passed accompanied by more than a dozen retainers all wearing swords and cheap steel breastplates i get you best price for the girl squeaked a voice that seemed to come from haraldrs elbow he never saw the source an old man completely blinded by cataracts pounded on haraldrs chest and vanished into the crowd a woman smiled her rotted teeth like old wood between her brilliantly painted lips flower clutched at haraldr mar had turned away and was bent over a young man who had fallen to his knees he grasped the mans forearm in his huge fist the squirrel mar hissed your hand in my cloak told me you must know where i can find the squirrel the foiled cutpurse said nothing his boyish face reddened and scowled the crowd began to cluster there was a snap and the cutpurse howled and cradled his arm mar immediately grasped the other arm when i finish with your arms ill start with your fingers that might be a permanent disability in your profession the thief whimpered and blurted the devils walking stick mar let him stumble off through the crowd the devils walking stick was an inn situated in an ancient building several blocks closer to the seawall the name derived from a trident carved in relief apparently centuries ago on the stone above the arcade the street in front of the inn was almost solidly packed with boisterous shoving young men and a few beleaguered whores cutthroats the lot said mar who had virtually hidden flower inside his cloak if anyone makes a move towards you kill them you cannot expect to bluster past this kind simply because we are varangians and might reduce the entire studion to cinders if one of us is harmed here these men dont care they care about the next quarter of an hour and whether it will offer a strong draught and a tight cunt haraldr and mar walked side by side through the crowd their huge shoulders forming a virtual arch over flower hard eyes and scarred faces turned towards them but the bodies moved aside they walked beneath the arcade and through the arched doorway of the inn the air was smoky and redolent of cheap wine and unwashed men a dice game was under way at the nearer of two large tables a great cheer accompanied each roll at the farther table the centre of attention was a small darkeyed man wearing an absurdlooking brandnew brimless silk bonnet like those that were just coming into fashion with the imperial courtiers i rescued a miserable cutpurse from the numera the other day said mar hes over there im sure he can tell me where to find the physician stay with flower remember what i said they will try to insult you and perhaps even our father ignore the words watch the hands and the feet mar shouldered through the crowd the game came to a temporary halt flower trembled her head hidden beneath haraldrs arm like a frightened bird under its mothers wing dangerous snakelike eyes began to examine the partially hidden female form beneath haraldrs cloak mar reached the table and greeted the man in the red bonnet a group of men at the near table already turned to face haraldr stood up they wore cheap silk and clearly fancied themselves successful rogues the tallest was a giant among romans his dark beard stuck out like a shelf and his eyes sparkled let us have a look eminence the mans voice was deep even unthreatening he nodded at his fellows well pay good for just a look at her haraldr gripped the pommel of his short sword he wished he had worn emma but mar had warned him that a byrnnie might inhibit the quickness he would need in these streets hes dumb as a goat said a smaller man with a sharp white streak in his dark hair you might as well pay to see a turd walk as see a varangian talk well theres one no two turds just walked in here a third said chortling shut up barked the big man he knows what were saying the big man swayed as if he would take a step forward and haraldr prepared to take his head off but the mans legs spread wide and he set himself as if to declare his observance of a border between himself and the norse giant your emperor will be dead soon he said his eyes grim hes abed now dying hes not shown himself to us or seen our mother in all the new year well put our own man up there before we let a corpse rule us while the unholy monk joannes grinds us beneath his boot now youve seen studion eminence do you think your varangians can stop us if we get a will about us haraldr was taken aback he had expected simple aggression not the strange conviction of this criminal the emperors dying it was true that he had not been in the city to welcome his wife or the men who had saved her and that there had been no procession on his return but haraldr had assumed that the emperor was eluding his wifes treachery after all he could not simply throw the purpleborn into neorion but this was certainly a new facet to the complex structure of haraldrs doubts if the emperor was dying then joannes no longer shielded by his imperial relation might indeed be driven to extreme measures in order to maintain his power but why hadnt mar told him this that insight into joanness motives would have been much more convincing than this journey into hell haraldr watched while mar who had concluded his conversation with the redbonneted man made his way back through the crowd he quickly responded to his impulse if a man wanted to talk more of this for whom would he ask now the big man did his own calculating finally he put his coarse broad palm to his beard and compressed the springy mass a large sapphire with a fourpointed star flashed from a thick finger the blue star he said simply then bowed curtly turned and sat down out in the street mar pointed east odin favours our enterprise my friend had an associate who knew where the physician currently reposes between cures it is only two blocks away mar looked at haraldr quizzically it is worthwhile to have friends in the studion did you and that big man come to an agreement we exchanged greetings haraldr was acutely wary now but if he had to fight mar he was more than prepared you must water whatever they tell you here to arrive at the truth these louts are spreading a rumour that the emperor is dying that of course is nothing like the truth he has been ill but will soon recover but they are worried that joannes will rule in his stead regardless and i think they will rise up if they imagine that tyranny to be imminent from what he had seen haraldr could believe the last part of mars explanation but he was more convinced than ever that this proof of a plot against him was nothing more than a rambling ruse was mar hoping to exhaust him before he killed him the hostel where the physician was reputed to live was perhaps the bestkept building in the studion it had been a great town palace once and fitlooking horses were still stabled in the courtyard the physician lived on the third level his room adjacent to a wooden staircase with rather delicately carved railings mar knocked on the door waited a few seconds then stepped back and shattered it with one kick a naked woman cowered on a small linensheeted bed mar stomped round throwing wide the curtains and rifling a large wooden cabinet set against the wall he tossed some garish cheaply dyed linen robes on the floor he turned to the woman she clutched the sheet up to her mouth and her redrimmed eyes shone with fright i want to know where the man they call the physician has gone the woman stared and pressed the sheet between long pale legs blotched with several livid purple bruises you have three choices said mar looking around the room casually tell me now and i leave you in peace with a coin to buy you a room somewhere else tell me in the numera and depart with whatever i have not taken from you there third do not tell me the womans trembling arm shot out i want to see the coin mar quickly produced a silver nomismata he went out he said he was going to deliver a varangian to the neorion mar and haraldr stared at one another in surprise you still havent told me said mar to the woman the woman stood up and wrapped the sheet around herself the name of the patient was with the money she pushed aside the cabinet removed a chunk of plaster from the wall behind it and thrust her hand in the hiding place she cursed and turned she held a flaccid leather wallet mar snatched the wallet from the suddenly livid woman probed with his fingers and extracted a scrap of parchment he showed the scrap to haraldr is this gabrass hand haraldr nodded gravely as he read the name who is it he asked totally puzzled the strategus ex prosponon of vaspurakan said mar as bewildered as haraldr he doesnt even reside in the city he is in virtual exile his wife stayed here she is a vixen over whom many hounds have run themselves silly the cold realization reduced haraldrs gut to an icy knot halldor he said weakly halldor snorrason the cockhound mars face registered the connection theotokos well get horses down below how many women do you have in thule she fluttered her legs in the water and clutched halldors arms tightly around her breasts dozens she turned her head slightly and squeezed his arms tighter do you keep them in a gynaeceum i let them run about free naked in a field like deer extraordinary how often do you make love to them six each night how many times once each once she wriggled to face him six times one night she put her arms around his neck so we have three more times mar swung flower off his wheezing lathered horse and leapt to the ground dont tether them he yelled to haraldr he looked up at the sheer facade of the big town house a light showed in a thirdfloor window mar pounded once on the great ironstudded wooden door and it immediately flew open he turned back to haraldr the lock has been broken a few candles in sconces lit the entrance hall mar motioned to the spiral staircase they left flower in the entrance hall and climbed silently to the third floor short swords unsheathed haraldr put his hand down and felt the sticky slippery texture of freshly pooled blood in the dim light mar pointed to the body lying at the top of the steps the man was dressed like a typical servant in a wealthy household mar signalled haraldr to stay back and crept towards the light that filtered around a door slightly ajar at the end of the hall haraldr heard a noise at the secondfloor landing he looked down flower was crawling up the steps something crashed in the hall mar was on his feet whirling his hands at his throat a black shape like a giant hump clamped to his back a horrible gagging came from mars throat and haraldr leapt for the deadly parasite on mars back but before he could reach him mar turned and smashed his back against the wall flying through the woodandstucco interior construction as if it were paper haraldr charged into the room through the hastily improvised opening only to see mar propel his unwanted passenger into the thick masonry exterior wall with a sickening crunch the impact brought down great chunks of the ceiling and sent roof tiles clattering to the street below mar staggered forward and the hump slid off his back like a halfempty sack he pulled the attackers silk cord from around his neck and rubbed his throat bring flower in here he said raspily the attackers face unlike the back of his head was intact haraldr took a candle from a wall sconce and held it above the inert form flower bent over studied the face for a moment and shook her head that is not the man she said extraordinary thought halldor in spite of his conviction that it was never wise to let a woman know she had given unusual pleasure he groaned with enjoyment he would indeed dine in this house again she sat up straight and let him take her breasts in his mouth her pelvis shuddered and contorted do you want your thule women now she teased following with a hiccuplike laugh thule is so cold here it is so hot i will go around naked all day if you want ohhhh thought halldor have i finally met an adversary equal to my skills freyja bitch the woman can make the house shake my teeth are rattling halldor was not at first certain what it was that plunged through the oculus high above the pool it hit the water with a resounding impact floundered and then leapt for him he knew when he saw the silver glint that it was a knife he tried to throw his lover off him but she held him with that particularly potent grip and pain shot through his groin he felt a searing in his left pectoral and plunged under the surface the water immediately reddened whether i live or die he thought with characteristic clarity no one will believe this she still had him apparently thinking this was a game then her eyes opened and she saw the blood and released him where was the knife he saw the tunic billowing out in the water away from him and he realized that the assassin had come for his hostess not for him the knife shone with a terrible metallic brilliance through the steam and it lifted over her bare white breast halldor could not reach it but he splashed water at the assassins face and the knife halted for an instant in midair halldor leapt like a dolphin the man was strong but not nearly strong enough for a moment the knife slashed like a silver fish just beneath the surface bubbles roiled the water above the mans head and he went limp halldor threw the body onto the tiles and took the lady in his arms she cried for a moment and then kissed him smiling through her tears who wants to kill you he asked your husband no he is happy for me to have lovers since it relieves him of a duty he finds she broke off in alarm halldor looked towards the rinsing tub in sickening astonishment two more killers where was that knife through the rapidly clearing steam he recognized haraldr and mar halldor yelled haraldr he jumped in the water and embraced his friend mar disappeared for a moment what happened asked haraldr halldor casually pointed to the shattered oculus in the dome a spectacular leap for some reason he wanted to kill this beautiful lady the lady smiled at haraldr apparently concerned about neither her recent peril nor her present state of undress mar reappeared with flower and led her to the body it is the man i saw she said immediately haraldr shook his head and began to reconstruct the bizarre chain of events theorizing aloud so joannes learns that halldor is going to visit this ladys house the entire court has known for several days and sends his man gabras my chamberlain nicetas gabras to arrange an assassination but the assassin intends to kill the lady why he was posing the question to himself as well as to mar mar set his lips grimly because that is the way the roman mind works and it is in particular the way our orphanotrophus joanness works this highly placed lady is murdered and the accused the obvious assailant is the komes halldor snorrason of the middle hetairia joannes coerces haraldr with his comrades scandal or perhaps he has a broader objective i believe that in spite of his temporary buildup of your unit his interest in the long run is eliminating the varangian guard entirely so that no emperor could enjoy the security we provide as you well know there are several factions at court most notably the dhynatoi who share this objective they would be only too happy to use this scandal to reduce numbers in both the middle and grand hetairia if joannes goes directly after you or one of your men he signals his intentions and invites your just retaliation this way he forces you to defend yourself against the indignation of others that the lady is dead is of no account for joannes any treachery is conceivable and any innocent life merely expedient haraldr examined the face of the assassin again then looked among the faces of the living one by one it was preposterous that mar would have arranged such an elaborate drama including an attack on himself to make such an oblique point and gabras was a certain link to joannes this was not the kind of proof he had expected which made it all the more convincing yes joannes was his enemy an enemy far more devious and ruthless than he could have imagined just a few hours ago and while that still did not make mar his friend he realized another essential truth to fight this demonmonk joannes he would need mar just as badly as mar needed him the lady reached out and touched haraldr on his arm a look of concern on her face we are fine she said we have not been hurt she displayed a beautiful wet smile and looked over at mar and flower since you are all here why dont you stay the komes of the khazar guard looked at the list and frowned i am certain there must be some mistake manglavite i dont have your name here the komes looked up and shrugged sympathetically i could send a man to the orphanotrophuss office and find out why most likely they are still working as i say i am certain there wouldnt be a problem for you i appreciate your offer komes said haraldr but dont concern yourself with the matter my business can wait haraldr nodded politely turned and walked back down the steps leading to the massive bronze doors of the imperial gynaeceum he felt both relieved and ashamed relieved that the khazar guards at the entrance to the gynaeceum had been unable to admit him only the select few on joanness list were now allowed access to the imperial womens quarters and ashamed with himself for even trying to see maria he wandered without direction among the terraced gardens beneath the hippodrome lacquered with moonlight and beaded with lamps the intricate architecture of the palace complex revealed a geometry concealed by the days dazzling polychromes tonight he had given fate yet one more toss and had decided to confront maria to find out if she had meant joannes or the emperor and in whose name she had asked her deadly question and if his life had been of any consequence in the matter but now fate had signalled agreement with what reason had told him all along forget her it was of no consequence whether she had employed the ruse of love to kill a good man or an evil man not where love was concerned he thought of what mar had said the previous night about the roman mind he had not until then fully understood the complexity and cruelty of that mind and now he knew that if he was to leave here with his life and that of his pledgemen he would need to anticipate and to an extent acquire that convoluted habit of thought but one could not love with a roman mind the heart could not wear veils could not embrace one thing as a means to acquire another he had at least confessed to her that he concealed a secret in his breast she had worn a mask from the beginning and he hated her for that as much as he had once thought he loved her he stopped by one of the little pools ringed by trees and bordered with stone benches he sat and watched the fish slide silently through their pearled domain their orange scales dull gold in the moonlight something in the faint phosphorus of the water made him think of norway of standing high above trondheimfjord the water like a slab of polished lapis lazuli beneath him farther to the west the windtextured bluegreen expanse of the open sea scattered with silver shavings by a setting sun norway he had the wealth now he had the dedicated nucleus of an army go home and yet with that same thought he realized he could not at the very least he had considerable doubt that the soul of his pledgeman asbjorn ingvarson had in fact been avenged but now there were other souls crying out to him studion the images of the wretches leapt at him like the fearless rats that would prey on their moribund flesh he could not deal with those images he could not leave them behind either a bug rippled the water and several fish thrashed to the surface in response destroy joannes haraldr realized he could not help heal rome or begin to assuage his own troubled soul without accomplishing that and to destroy joannes he would need to think with the roman mind to begin with he would need mar not a reluctant grudging boyish collaboration with mar but a difficult yet necessary partnership with an ally he could not trust yes he would embrace mar he would embrace the devil to slay the beast at romes dark heart and when joannes had been destroyed perhaps he and mar could part comrades and perhaps they would have to ask odin to choose between them and should that turn out to be the case the best way to learn how to defeat a man in single combat was to second him he could not sleep his mind raced with the purpose before him he took the route he and mar had taken the night before and emerged onto the curious landscape beneath the hippodrome it was much like the previous night the circus animals and the sad tawdry performers the booths of the palmists and the diviners but tonight he was unaccompanied by the fearsome hetairarch and the people came out to meet him saracenslayer manglavite little boys rushed up to touch his cloak and scurry away two stooped old men scuttled along beside him not daring to look up satisfied with some silent conversation a prostitute ran her fingers lightly over his sleeve tilted her head and cocked an eyebrow she was darkhaired and very pale and young enough still to be pretty and for some reason he was moved by her but he walked on for a moment thinking he would actually go all the way to studion and greet the people there the torso and head of a small boy rolled up to him in a little wooden cart haraldr looked into the brown eyes of this partially disembodied waif they were frightening in their voracious almost feral need and yet their honesty affected haraldr more than fawneyed supplication he reached into his purse and gave the boy a silver nomismata suddenly the boys eyes had a heartbreaking innocence as if by magic a dozen boys appeared haraldr quickly distributed the rest of his coins finally holding up his empty purse to show he had no more the boys vanished quarrelling among themselves haraldr remembered the way the alley behind the row of wooden buildings why was he going here he wondered briefly but he knew maria had left his heart wounded and withdrawn but she had left his body eager and questing the sexuality of the empress city was not hers alone she had only initiated his seduction not consummated it and every woman he held in his arms from this moment on would be the answer to marias treachery the denial of fates caprice reducing her at last to the anonymity of remembered flesh and that alone he exited the alley and saw the large freshly plastered facade straight ahead he went to the dark wooden door and knocked the viewing grate slid aside he had to wait for a while and considered leaving then the locks rattled and anatellon the charioteer virtually exploded in his face haraldr nordbrikt esteemed manglavite and slayer of saracens anatellon took haraldrs arms in his rockhard fists you honour us sir please please come in as anatellon ushered haraldr inside he giggled in his curious genial fashion you dont even need to tell me esteemed sir youve come for my alan girl i dont care who was at fault here this should have been brought to me this is something the manglavite and i should have settled among ourselves mar slapped his hands flat against his writing table he looked at centurion thorvald ostenson and then addressed the uniformed varangian standing next to ostenson its fortunate for you that no one was seriously hurt but i need to impose some kind of penalty because i simply cannot afford to have the men of the grand hetairia quarrelling with the men of the middle hetairia im going to confine you for two weeks and fine you five silver nomismata and you can tell your comrades that the penalties for future violations will be considerably more onerous we are not here to settle personal grudges mar gestured at ostenson to show the varangian out when the varangian had left ostenson closed the door again and studied mar frank farmboy astonishment on his ruddy face may i speak hetairarch i didnt appoint you centurion because i thought you were a fool go ahead hetairarch that was a very minor incident and one that did not take place in the palace precincts some varangians of both the middle and grand hetairia were drinking at the same inn and one of the manglavites men lured this mans whore away by flaunting the gold in his purse and it wasnt just the whore they were fighting over the men resent that the members of the middle hetairia are in most cases wealthier than them i am aware of that centurion that is why i want to make certain that whatever feelings of ill will that presently exist are not exacerbated ostenson still looked astonished hetairarch i dont see how our interests are served by allowing the middle hetairia and the manglavite to presume such importance we are working with the middle hetairia towards a common objective as soon as my plans are complete i will explain them to you fully and you will understand in the meantime i need harmony among the two divisions of the varangian guard and i am charging you with that responsibility i myself will be working closely with the manglavite haraldr nordbrikt hetairarch ostenson paused and then decided to test the limits of his relationship with his commander hetairarch when this common objective is achieved wont it be dangerous to have so strengthened haraldr nordbrikt he is already a hero in the city you cannot drink anywhere without hearing his name saracenslayer saracenslayer i think he has the potential to be a dangerous rival to you and you are merely encouraging his rise it happened too fast for ostensons comprehension he saw mar leap to his feet and lunge towards him and then felt the huge force of inertia as he flew into the wall behind him when he came to he was leaning against the wall his feet outstretched his head hammering mar was sponging the back of his neck mar pulled ostenson to his feet never presume what i am or am not doing centurion he said evenly the bogomil twisted a lock of his long stringy hair and looked earnestly at maria with all sincerity trying to avoid so much as a glance at the jewelled icon of the virgin hanging on the wall behind her he regarded such images as manifestations placed upon this earth by satanael the eldest son of god to confound those who truly believed in god and his two younger sons christ and the holy spirit the antichrist the bogomil intoned in response to her question will be satanael in his final form when he is vanquished the entire world will blaze with flame and a hurricane of wind and dust will scour the earth and raze the very mountains and obliterate the valleys and all that will remain will be as flat and white as a sheet of parchment how marvellous maria tried to envision that glazed featureless bonewhite surface perhaps death was an allconsuming white light she fancied to herself not the darkness she had so often imagined but of course these were the fables of heretics she smiled at the gentle fanatic who sat on the carpet opposite her before his conversion to the bogomil sect the young man had been an idle dhynatoi scion whose only passions were dice polo horses and betting on races in the hippodrome he had often kept company with ignatius attalietes so why do you bogomils oppose the sacrament of marriage she asked steering the impromptu sermon towards another of her favourite subjects it is impure the unchaste love of a man for a woman is an act of obeisance to satanael who created the physical world but if god perfected adam who gave life to eve who was seduced by satanael and gave birth to cain and a daughter you bogomils call perfection i am correctly stating your beliefs am i not the bogomil nodded his placid dreamy eyes blinked once then twice suddenly wary so if a perfect woman resulted from the illicit union of satanael and eve was there not an element of purity in their congress but satanael and eve were not joined in the sacrement of marriage nor was there love between them exactly so eve and satanael fornicated as beasts do and yet their spawn was a perfect woman child and accursed cain i am only suggesting that the woman fornicated and conceived a daughter who was without sin i do not care what crimes your satanael urges men to commit satanael is prompting you to say that zoe appeared beneath the carved stone lintel of the door that connected marias antechamber to the imperial apartments she clapped her hands little daughter you have confounded the heretic the empress walked over and rustled the bogomils hair he shrank away from her as if satanael himself had reached forth his hand you would do better with the euchitae my darling zoe said to maria they abhor the world of the flesh while permitting every kind of sexual excess the bogomil shot to his feet and scurried out of the room without another word zoe looked after him with mock despair why is it that our invitations to paradise are invariably extended by men with a peculiar one would almost say unnatural horror of women perhaps they remember that it was a womans crimes for which they lost eden her tone was suddenly wistful zoe frowned slightly even this casual distressing of her features seemed to age her dramatically little daughter you are not still reflecting upon the fruit you did not succeed in offering to your companion haraldr saracenslayer or whatever i really believe that of all the melancholies you have nursed over the years this is the most severe and worrisome i cant imagine that you still dote on him perhaps he has not forgiven you your little betrayal of his earnest tauroscythian passions but he has certainly forgiven our sex you do know that he has become a frantic devotee of priapus in the months we have been confined here do you not apparently he is intent on impaling a new woman each day perhaps it is some tauroscythian custom he has taken a whore to live in his palace and do you know danielis the wife of the curator of the magnara she is one of his conquests as well can you imagine her i always considered her to be so conventional when i heard of the two of them i conjured the most remarkable image and of course you have heard about our dear little anna i must say there is a point at which we must be just a bit censorious of these affairs she is just a girl she is not a virgin said maria sullenly oh dear i seem to have missed that when was it maria looked at zoe as if reproaching her for her high spirits zoe frowned again and sat next to her she stroked marias sablesoft black hair like an admiring suitor i am not mocking you out of spite or even boredom my little darling you know that in my heart you are my firstborn the dearest child of my soul if not of my loins this melancholy of yours which has apparently driven you to interviews with bogomils has rended my own heart so i have negotiated on your behalf zoe kissed maria on the cheek i have won your freedom to come and go as you please mother maria threw her arms around zoe so that is why you were teasing me she hesitated but i will not leave you here alone you are not leaving me alone zoes smile was enigmatic maria presumed that zoe had taken a lover she was often closeted in her sealed apartments late at night i think you should go out tonight said zoe your friend nicephorus argyrus has initiated another clever enterprise he has opened a hostel for the sumptuous lodging and extravagant entertainment of visiting merchants and embassies this because he now has exclusive agreements with most of our major trading partners i believe genoa is the only substantial monopoly that has as yet eluded his grasp his establishment has quickly become indecently fashionable symeon says that on any evening you could find enough roman dignitaries there to convene the senate conduct the palm sunday procession and conquer the caliphates argyrus has provided a dining room and boxes at the theatre suitable even for ladies of your class and symeon says the merchant invites scandal by encouraging the sexes to mix discreetly maria said nothing but her eyes glimmered with the ineffable confusion of her feelings anticipation dread bitter longing carnal heat would she see him zoe cupped marias chin in her hand i know what you are thinking little daughter but you must be careful if you encounter your tauroscythian you may be forced to decide if what you feel for him is love or merely desire maria looked quickly away there was no answer to that dilemma that would not cause her pain uncle michael kalaphates turned to his uncle constantine and shrugged expressively constantine looked at his nephew with momentary exasperation and then reached into his cloak and pilfered his purse for half a dozen silver nomismata michael greedily accepted the donation and leaned back over the massive ivory gaming table ill win it back double uncle he said eagerly at last the boy needs me thought constantine bitterly even if only to fill his perpetually exhausted purse constantine looked around at the jostling garrulous patrons of nicephorus argyruss new establishment a magister in a silk robe had just bumped into a venetian merchant wearing an entire shipload of gold around his neck the sotted quaestor was somewhere over there taking bets on a pentathlon contest and the puffedup pigeonbreasted proconsular patrician digenes ducas whose voice so often stirred the senate whispered in the ear of the elegant whore on the arm of a young topoteretes of the imperial excubitores a sharpnosed patrician what was his name evagrius with a precisely trimmed short grey beard nodded curtly at constantine and turned away constantine imagined himself shaking the arrogant fop and shouting i am constantine to whom you virtually prostrated yourself in the senate chambers last month constantine the former strategus of antioch vanquisher of seljuks and saviour of your mother celebrated by the mob in the hippodrome and not the least brother of the emperor michael and the orphanotrophus joannes in the presence of whom even your silkandscent magisters tremble ah but there of course was the thorn that so clearly kept constantine from plucking the rose of romes adoration brother joannes a month ago such as these had indeed been ready to throw their faces to the floor before him but a month ago joannes had not yet made it entirely evident to the entire court that he regarded his brother constantine as a temporary accoutrement a discarded trumpet of his own power joannes had not sent for him once since the ceremony in the hippodrome and the reception at the senate had not even inquired of him or their nephew such signals did not go unapprehended by the viciously acute eyes and ears of the imperial court if joannes had no further use for his brother constantine then neither did these swaggering dignitaries michael kalaphates whooped at a successful toss of the dice give me the trinity he crowed three was his number at least the hoy has use for me constantine told himself again his gloom deepening as he thought of the other michael his brother too his father as well even joannes had received them appeared with them if only briefly ah well michael was so far away it was as if the imperial sceptre had finally severed the already tenuous blood ties as savagely as a varangians axe they would go to their graves as strangers holy trinity michael kalaphates leapt up from the table and embraced his uncle showering him with silver five times over including what i had lost he danced around his uncle his fashionable silk bonnet beginning to slide towards his right ear let me keep it uncle i have learned of a winning team of four that can be had for a pigs ear well buy a trainer and a driver and rule the hippodrome constantine smiled keep it of course you are my family you know constantine shook his head in amazement the boy was as impetuous as a thundercloud but half his schemes seemed to come to something the others well they were best forgotten michael kalaphates was his family now uncle our friend the manglavite has come in with the hetairarch bile burned in constantines chest the boy needed to choose his friends more carefully that was certain thugs like that would buy him more trouble than even he could scheme his way out of yes said constantine his voice acerbic the hetairarch and manglavite are virtually without employment these days it is difficult to go out at night without encountering one or the other and sometimes the two together arm in arm like herod and pilate they are always courteous to us constantines brow furrowed they are both so agile when a beast learns its masters tricks too easily the master should wonder if the beast doesnt intend some day to teach him a few tricks well as we are not their masters i intend to greet them michael held his arm up manglavite the two norsemen worked through the crowd some of the dignitaries greeted them eagerly while others discreetly turned away as they passed manglavite hetairarch michael joined perfunctorily by constantine bowed in greeting now i know we have picked an auspicious destination for our evenings adventure do you intend to stay for the theatre they say this new drama is quite one might say transparent so we have heard said mar his manner genial then he grinned look for us before you find your seats and if your cup runs dry before then tell your serving boy that the manglavite is buying your draughts you must relieve him of some of his gold before his vaults sink into the earth haraldr nodded his agreement he had spent enough time working with mar to be comfortable with him if still wary and while mars roman duplicity required a norsemans caution haraldr had found mars roman urbanity engaging even beguiling he had to admit he enjoyed going with him to a place like argyruss haraldr and mar bowed and went off into the crowd what does nordbrikt do with all his money asked constantine when they had left women said michael he has taken a whore a girl from alania who is said to rival fair helen and it is said that his mistresses include several ladies at court apparently there is also something to be made of his relationship with the daughter of the grand domestic you have met her perhaps there is a match there i thought he was quite set upon maria the empresss dear companion dont i recall some mention of their liaison during our recent journey that ended some time ago and were it to resume i can assure that such a liaison would never be allowed to come to fruition constantine laughed and squeezed michaels arm playfully you have won a purse full of nomismata so now you imagine yourself privy to the secrets of the empresss apartments michael smiled and put his arm across his uncles shoulders i have certain contacts dearest uncle they interest me mar spoke in norse as he and haraldr walked away from michael kalaphates and constantine true joannes has shown them little favour replied haraldr but that is a far reach from saying that they might be inclined to conspire against him you saw them in antioch what is your estimate of their abilities the uncle could not be expected to figure out how to dump shit from a chamber pot michael kalaphates however i believe to be far more able than he is given credit for a bit of the praisetongue but all in all a very worthy young man certainly very keen and perhaps keen enough to realize that his uncle is not rewarding his talents in near the measure that his qualities deserve possibly we should deliberate this matter before we proceed though and then proceed very cautiously mar pursed his lips i am worried that we will not always have the luxury of caution joannes has made no move against us for weeks now you know how a camp is always the quietest when there is to be an attack in the morning hetairarch manglavite esteemed dignitaries nicephorus argyruss leathery face beamed with its usual effusion of genuine affection moderate inebriation and irrepressible selfinterest he swept the two norsemen into the main dining hall a miniature palace lined with sumptuously carved emeraldshaded carystos marble columns the lofty coffered ceiling had been painted a celestial blue i insist that you join us boomed argyrus he guided the norsemen to a large table set in the apse at the end of the room the table was littered with goblets of fine glass silver and burnished stone silver plates and utensils and the savaged remains of a suckling pig it appears you have finished eating said mar drily gentlemen dignitaries esteemed colleagues the fourteen or fifteen guests at the table continued tearing at bits of pig arguing and shouting at the ceiling haraldr recognized a komes of the imperial fleet who licked his fingers with a look of grave deliberation two senators and a genoese admiral said to keep a saracen mistress in a town house only two blocks from haraldrs palace a small man raised his oversize head from the winesoaked white tablecloth and tilted it slowly as he appraised the new arrivals with glazed grey eyes the logothete of the symponus haraldr observed the official responsible for the financial administration of constantinople they are also drinking tonight in the studion thought haraldr would the logothete sleep as well he wondered if he could hear the oaths the cutthroats of studion were growling into their cups argyrus put his arm around haraldr and addressed no one in particular i gave our worthy manglavite his first employment when he came among us you might say he learned his lessons at the foot of the master my name means silver but when i touch a man he turns to gold argyrus rapped haraldrs massive shoulder as if he expected it to clink like a golden statue im proud of him he took his advice from me and made himself a rival to croesus of course i was generous when i dealt with him and the only gratitude i asked was that he remember his mentor nicephorus argyrus serving boys quickly cleared and set places before mar and haraldr could escape from nicephorus argyrus they sat and looked about the room with the current moratorium on imperial banquets due to the emperors illness argyrus had drawn half the imperial court everyone seemed to enjoy the relative absence of decorum the noise required haraldr and mar to raise their voices in order to pursue ordinary conversation let us forgo supper and ask the servants to bring us dessert mar smiled salaciously and looked around the room the curator of the magnara is here so i imagine his wife has accompanied him to give the proper public display of their mutual infidelity haraldr noted this with interest since he had slept with the curators wife danielis half a dozen times and i do not see the grand domestic bardas dalassena no doubt he is home wringing his hands over his dispatches so we can assume that anna has probably come haraldr nodded and signalled the servant he had at first been taken aback by the protocol of the imperial court which was quite different from that practised in the more liberalminded private homes like argyruss or in a notoriously permissive environment like antioch among dignitaries it was considered scandalous for women to dine side by side with men they instead dined in a separate chamber but when dessert was served the women were invited to join the men at court the suffocating protocol constrained this contact to elaborate formality here however the interaction frequently exceeded propriety thus the popularity of argyruss venture the women had already begun to trickle into the dining hall generally in groups of two or three here and there a man would stand and invite a lady to sit she might accept or she might pretend that she had not seen the gesture even if the desperate gallant was flapping his arms in her face like a frantic bird and hold out for a more desirable opportunity haraldr had come to enjoy the flirtatious ritual the nods the gestures the raised eyebrows the subtle communications and often quite complex strategies that the participants had evolved haraldr sensed someone hovering at his shoulder he turned and rose immediately anna he said and bowed deeply anna fixed her intense agate eyes on his and nodded a servant brought her a chair she and mar greeted one another before she sat each week she is more beautiful thought haraldr her colouring was still fresh virginal her cheeks and lips flushed brilliantly but her eyes had become heavier darker more sensual and full womans breasts now swelled against her dark blue scaramangium you will make eros weary of his errands tonight he told her you are the most lovely woman here she put her hand lightly on his tonight i only hope to dispatch eros to one breast mar coughed dramatically and jerked his head to the right haraldr wished he had a wizards incantation that would turn him into a fly but it was too late she had seen him danielis wife of the curator of the magnara walked among the tables her long swanlike neck erect her arms relaxed her fingers slightly poised as if she cradled some fragile invisible object her husband the dignitary responsible for not only overseeing but also financing all of the official diplomatic receptions at the magnara palace was seated several tables away and had already deposited his decorum head first in the lap of an actress reputed to be the mistress of a famous polo player that circumstance was hardly to danieliss discredit far more humiliating to have been invited to sit by her own husband but with haraldr her widely acknowledged paramour also occupied she was in an awkward situation as was he mar stood his face regal his eyes waiting to make contact with danieliss she looked at him and the entire room seemed to hush for an instant she then raised a sharp dark eyebrow in a gesture that was at once almost imperceptibly delicate and wildly erotic as danielis moved to take her seat beside mar haraldr nodded at him gratefully haraldr had seen mens eyes in combat even berserks more pacific than annas when she saw her rival seated only a place removed from hers danielis leaned forward and inclined her head slightly towards haraldr she had large greyishblue eyes that contrasted vividly with her dark hair and a long chiselled nose that seemed to pull her face down slightly giving her beauty a hint of sadness that haraldr found appealing manglavite she said in her demure almost soothing voice anna lady said anna as if she were an executioner addressing a client she placed her hand on haraldrs thigh but haraldr could not help thinking of danielis unlike most women of fashion who now wore only the long sheathlike scaramangium robe in imitation of their empress danielis persisted in wearing both a dalmatic a short sleeveless tunic and a pallium a long shawllike garment with an opening for the head over her robe a swathing of radiantly patterned silk that concealed her up to her chin but once unwrapped danielis would insist that haraldr perform as her stallion he was never certain which role she enjoyed most for herself the mare or the bareback rider anna pressed her breast against haraldrs arm anna he reflected for all her sparkling eyes and busy hands was the opposite of danielis anna had lost her maidenhood somewhere on the road to antioch apparently to some clumsy lecher who had made the experience painful she was still wary so haraldr had not pressed her they had twice been alone in his chambers and merely had stayed awake conversing occasionally caressing almost until cockcrow when he had ordered guards and carriage to take her home she had been very good for his greek and she made him happy anna have you heard of the new drama asked danielis as the servants brought out stuffed pastries shaped like little churches on silver plates no oh i see i believe you have confused the genres this is a mime or rather a comedy in the form of mime yes i think you are correct how wise of you to know that danielis plunged her fork deep into her little pastry church the content is considered improper i have been told that the actress will lay aside her cloak and bare her bosom in emulation of aphrodite no she will remove her cloak and appear before us quite entirely naked as the ancients have shown us in their statuary danielis made a sharp quick little inhalation her public expression of shock hah thought haraldr when danielis is as naked as aphrodite she gasps like a posthorse anna danielis asked do you think that viewing this spectacle will inflame the passions of the gentlemen present how wicked it would be if this emulation of aphrodite encouraged our gallants to an emulation of hephaestus but lady said anna her pupils like needles hephaestus was the lame husband of aphrodite cuckolded by the warlike and altogether more desirable ares do we not see that emulation right here even before our aphrodite has yet appeared mar choked on his pastry danieliss nostrils flared and a vein stood out beneath her ear indeed said danielis her voice uninflected by the accusation and insult we have other emulations as well i am certain that we also have an athena among us annas nails clawed haraldrs arm athena was a virgin goddess but where annas voice was faintly tremulous a maiden would hardly have the temerity to enter this company perhaps the error in your understanding is one of terminology if i were for example to call a woman who squanders her assets a spendthrift and perhaps some would call her worse i would not then be correct in considering a woman who merely prudently budgets her assets a miser mar and haraldr exchanged helpless looks and i would not consider a woman danielis broke off realizing that her voice was rising and the conversation around her abruptly diminished she looked straight ahead and lifted her chin anna breathed hotly against haraldrs ear tonight i want to emulate aphrodite she whispered with more anger than desire haraldr wondered why he could suddenly hear the clinking of silver and glass a collective gasp drifted from the far end of the room anna turned her head and in spite of herself sighed the name maria the cold knife ripped haraldr from breast to belly he could not turn his head he could not be the only one who had not turned he did not recognize her at first her hair loosely braided glistening in the light of the candelabra was arranged simply around her head in the fashion of the ancient statues and wreathed with a band of fresh flowers woven with almost tapestrylike intricacy she wore no paint on her face but her eyes were so deeply azure that they seemed even from a distance to have been coloured in with some intensely concentrated pigment but it was her attire that had reduced them all to silence instead of a scaramangium she wore a long loose gown again much like those depicted on the statues held by a small gold clasp at each shoulder the shimmering white gown scarcely draped her breasts and seemed to leave half of her upper body exposed the delicate yet proud sculpture of her bare throat and arms was as astonishing as any immortalized in marble as she walked the fabric teased her audience clinging momentarily to the contour of her breast or thigh like another skin then falling into complex folds to reveal glimpses of bare bosom it was as if a goddess walked towards them naked except for the iridescent cloud in which she had cloaked herself every man who was free to choose her stood more in homage than invitation homeric paeans flew into the awed silence helen daughter of zeus she challenged aphrodite the golden serene almost oblivious maria walked towards the apse at the end of the room haraldr was numb he had loved so many since her had held so many tender breasts and opened so many white legs why had they all done nothing to make this moment easier she could still choke the breath from his lungs she was behind him her presence so strong that it seemed to bind his limbs romes goddess has returned welcome precious light we mortals beg even the merest moment of your grace nicephorus argyrus gestured to the chair that already waited for her you have no choice i will close this establishment dismantle it sink the bricks and stone in the western sea if you take your seat beside any but your humble host maria laughed the falling of liquid silver and descended like snow she was two seats down and across the table from haraldr he could see her face without looking at it even taste her flesh she nodded now first at anna then at danielis at mar and finally her eyes passed like hot brands through his heart they never paused never reflected only moved on like a great blue storm unconscious of the destruction it left behind anna put her hand gently on haraldrs arm and whispered in his ear you still love her the great black horse struggled against the reins joannes shouted at the komes of the imperial excubitores to grab the bit the stallion jerked his head jittered his flanks and settled joannes quickly dismounted the topoteretes who had sent for him waited outside the abandoned warehouse a blazing taper in each hand orphanotrophus he said as he bowed how do we get down there asked joannes brusquely if this were anything less than reported the topoteretess head would greet tomorrows petitioners at the chalke gate this way orphanotrophus the topoteretes held his torch up into the empty vault of the warehouse heavy distorted shadows flickered over the brick ribbings the floor had a thick layer of dirt a small animal darted along next to the wall the stairs were covered with freshly cut boards and a layer of earth for camouflage said the topoteretes he plunged his taper into the dark hole in the floor the ancient crumbling steps had been cleaned and repaired with hastily set brick and mortar joannes followed the topoteretes down fifteen steps in all the floor below was hard earth almost like fired clay the topoteretes thrust his torch up again joanness jaw tightened and his shoulders began to ache it was an old cistern probably one of the citys original waterstorage facilities long forgotten drained the residue of silt compacted and dried on the floor the mortar had fallen away from many of the thin slablike bricks used to build the vaults leaving the masonry surface as jagged as old teeth beneath the vaults were stacked thousands of spears joannes grabbed one of the spears and examined the shaft threw it aside and examined another how could this be how could this cancer exist in the body he knew as well as his own and yet leave him unaware of the symptoms no he had known and he had denied his own knowledge of this sickness this plague who is responsible he asked the topoteretes his question more wondering than demanding we are interrogating some individuals now orphanotrophus i am certain we will have some names for you by tomorrow names four five a dozen mutilated wretches yielding their final sobbing confessions pointless this was the work of many well organised and considering their means well funded there was substance here rage channelled directed plotted into the uncertain future and he was not ready for them thank you topoteretes joannes felt the weariness in his legs as he climbed back into the night he had known he had vacillated he had postponed he had hoped against hope soon it would be too late what had to be done had to be done komes rumbled joannes when he reached the street i want you to deliver a message for me tonight altogether remarkable michael kalaphates raised his cup to the stage just exited by the actress who had emulated aphrodite her subtlety was most affecting was it not uncle perhaps i am in a better position than you to appreciate her subtlety or lack thereof said constantine ah yes michael had in his excitement forgotten that his eunuch uncle had a rather different perspective on the female anatomy he tipped his cup to haraldr well for subtlety it would be hard to exceed the performance of our manglavite who this evening entertained three women with whom he is well acquainted all at the same table a display of courage as well as subtlety his courage has not been tested yet he still has to go up there if only to make his apologies mar pointed to the womens gallery on the mezzanine surrounding the theatre there was an open seating area at the rear and rows of curtained booths along each side excruciating dilemma michael broke off is it possible that the divine emulation we have just witnessed has aroused the ire of responsible authorities look at the grim set on the face of that officer of the excubitores i believe he is coming our way komes said mar identifying the mans title i hope hes not bringing news of another military debacle i hope he tells me my officers have rioted and my men have invaded the mangana arsenal mumbled haraldr with genuine hope of some sort hetairarch manglavite the komes bowed to his superiors and turned to michael you are michael kalaphates michael nodded and the komes handed him a sealed paper bowed and shouldered back through the milling audience michael identified the seal before he broke it my uncle the orphanotrophus joannes he said suddenly seeming quite sober he read the missive and rolled it up again before speaking he wants to see me as soon as the palace gates open in the morning haraldr noticed the look that passed between uncle and nephew and realized that mar had been right about them michael kalaphates and his uncle constantine were indeed interesting i believe you are receiving a signal said michael to haraldr he nodded at the mezzanine boxes his carefree demeanour instantly restored as if he regretted the lapse haraldr looked up to a row of curtained booths separated by columns topped with madly foliate capitals the drapes were tapestries woven to resemble animal skins a detail that had aroused considerable favourable comment from the more fashionable patrons the curtains of the fourth booth were slightly parted and anna peeked out she beckoned him with a flip of her fingers anna waited in the alcove that joined the booths a little string of viallike oil lamps along the wall cast a rich almost silvery glow over her face anna took haraldrs arms in her hands and folded her drowsy thick dark lashes maria is my dearest friend a tear left a silver track down annas cheek she threw her arms around haraldr and pressed her face to his chest i love you she said but i love her more he stroked her soft neck i love you i want to take you tonight he did not finish realizing although that much was true now it would only be to spite maria i am not ready said anna perhaps later when i have had more experience she looked up at him and smiled danielis was right i am not a woman yet haraldr held her close you are a woman he whispered to her anna nuzzled him and then pushed him away gently maria asked me to tell you something haraldr shook his head i will not talk to her until she answers a question for me he set his jaw she once mentioned a certain bird to me i must know if this bird is entirely black like a raven or if its plumage is of a scarlet hue anna raised her eyebrows discreetly turned and opened the narrow door to the booth she was gone only for a moment haraldrs heart pounded his life again on a needle of fate when she faced him again anna shrugged she says the bird in question is feathered like a raven haraldr felt both relieved and saddened now he could never truly hate her anna reached up brought his head down and kissed him seeming both relieved and sad herself for an instant haraldr wondered as he often had at greater length if anna had a secret dread of her fairhair gallant if he perhaps was a risk with which she taunted herself she still loves you said anna and then turned and ran down to the end of the alcove and danced down the stairs marias eyes were waiting for him when he entered the booth the blue flames blazing her arms were folded beneath her breasts her bare skin was like white marble in white sunlight her sexuality seemed to change the very atmosphere of the room flooding the chamber with a thick drowning honeylike liquor i wanted to kill you once her voice had the strange detachment of a seeress in hecate the knife it was not yours i did not bring it for my protection haraldr felt only a tinge of surprise he had known that really at the time drunk with her he had not wanted to think what the knife had meant and later it had not mattered the second time i loved you it was for her so that you would kill for her not her husband the orphanotrophus joannes i am sorry i could not make the distinction more clear we were desperate and yet too cautious we did not want to use his name until you had agreed our mother is surrounded by spies each word was a cold stone haraldr had to disgorge if i had understood that a service to our mother and rome was at issue and not a love that existed only in words lost to the night then i could have made cause with you i had something that in my folly i thought was real and found that it was hollow you had something real your love for your empress and yet by making a mockery of me you fouled that love my folly is a poison that corrodes only my own breast your folly is a poison that seeps into the world and corrupts everything lyre music drifted up from the stage the audience oohed at some revelation in a mime marias breasts rose and fell in a slight irregular rhythm yes her eyes flinched from nothing denied nothing yes i am the greater fool i betrayed you and i betrayed myself liar you do not believe that i have told you every truth now i know nothing of you a vague blush spread over her breast i know nothing of you land man from rus her chin tilted up you have loved a dozen women since you held me do you sob to each of them that they have also abused your love and you have loved more than a dozen before me no doubt did each of them earn your tearful remorse marias left wrist folded over her right elbow began to twitch slightly i ask nothing of you tonight not even forgiveness but you have asked me to hear your confession have you romans not priests enough to attend to those needs impulsively haraldr stepped towards her unwrapped her arms and seized her wrists it was a mistake he felt as if he had taken hot irons in his hands and yet was compelled by some desire entirely his own to hold them until his flesh was incinerated he had to grit his teeth in order to speak perhaps you have other needs she resisted for a moment and then clutched at his robe her lips savage and her teeth showing yes manglavite she spat out for those needs you are superior you are of my dozens by far the best you alone drive me to madness her voice was monstrously mocking and yet haraldr glimpsed that she also mocked a certain truth that was too painful for her not to admit make me your whore again manglavite she trilled angrily make me your whore haraldr let her go i am sorry he said for the first time she cast down her eyes no i am the one who has made love a currency of exchange between us or perhaps i mean a stick with which to strike each other haraldrs defences sagged again why would you wish to strike at me he asked sadly what did i do to invite your contempt the crowd below broke into raucous laughter maria sighed and folded her arms back under her breasts she looked directly at haraldr again you have not you have only invited my fear the audience laughed even louder maria gestured with her hand towards the noise the movement of her arm and the shimmer of her gown was almost magical this is not the proper place i want to explain to understand for myself she pursed her lips i have a villa in asia just above chrysopolis it is a short ferry will you go there with me not tonight tomorrow in the light of day haraldr nodded yes below him the audience suddenly fell silent and then a cymbal crashed like a tinny thunderclap this way sir said the komes of the excubitores michael kalaphates had an almost overpowering urge to wet himself the marble steps of the magnara gleamed like ice on the cold sunny morning but he had not been asked to ascend those steps to the waiting glory of rome instead he was escorted down a side ramp that sloped gradually then seemed to plunge straight to the bowels of the earth in a series of steep poorly kept steps the abrupt descent ended at a long dark corridor lit at intervals with smudgy lamps parchment that was the smell musty pungent almost palpable chamber after chamber full of documents halfway down the hall a man worked inside one of the rooms and his lamp illuminated the endless stacks the layered shelves of rolled parchments a compendium of romes centuries each ancient decision each longforgotten act a parcel of the huge accumulation upon which each succeeding lord of the entire world would raise his golden throne men died and yet here their deeds endured a chorus of voices to render invincible indisputable before man and god the will of one man the long corridor ended at a plain wooden door the komes knocked and was greeted by a small ageing eunuch who wordlessly pointed to another door at the end of the cramped antechamber most of the floor space in the room was occupied by disordered stacks and tumbled piles of rolled documents the komes knocked on the second door a beast seemed to growl behind the sealed portal the komes opened the door and waved michael in michael blinked the windowless chamber was flooded with light from a stark functional candelabrum fashioned from a single metal band the room was all papers and parchment and yet not a sheet was out of place the stacks immaculate the rolled documents set into plain wooden boxes the smooth whitewashed plaster walls were unmarked by any kind of decoration not even a solitary icon joannes sat in a backless chair behind an unornamented wooden writing table the varnished surface was eroded in places his heavy iron sealing pliers were placed neatly next to a row of rolled and sealed missives a pile of lead seal blanks glimmered dully in a little wooden casket a common coin that would have the power of life and death once the jaws of the orphanotrophus joanness sealstamp had pressed his imprint into the metal nephew joannes held out his freakish akimbo arms please sit his spadetipped fingers seemed to fling the dense smoky air towards the backless canvasupholstered chair behind michael you are well it was strange how joannes never asked a question only requested confirmation yes uncle sir joannes brought the splayed ends of his fingers together just beneath his smooth jutting chin let us consider you nephew i see before me a young man robust vital well formed indeed of agile wit and intellectual acuity a young man who unlike his uncles before him has not suffered the vicissitudes of the journey from amastris to the imperial palace a young man whose health then and mental equilibrium are unmarred by the struggles that have bowed and cicatrised his illustrious forebears our father was disgraced before our eyes a small man made smaller your father in no little part due to the efforts of your holy namesake and myself is now a droungarios of the imperial fleet michaels father stephan a former ship tarrer was married to joanness sister maria and had proved his lack of military experience by taking a severe pasting from the carthaginians in the waters off sicily you share in your fathers glory and of course you bask in the reflected radiance of the imperial dignity though the diadem does not rest on your head it is close enough to accrue to you a station and consequence that most men would deem themselves the idols of fortune to enjoy even after a lifetime of dedicated labour now let us consider what you have done nephew with these gifts extended to you in such profusion that it burdens my tongue simply to enumerate them yes joannes nodded and placed his huge hands on the document over which he had been working young michael kalaphates after a fitful education in the quadrivium in nicaea where he was more familiar with the actresses and prostitutes of the city than with his mentors in mathematics and rhetoric proceeded on to antioch where under the aegis of his uncle constantine he embarked upon his military training yes and dedicated he was to his new profession assuming that one believes a besieged city might be relieved by a roll of the dice or a fleeing army turned by the sight of a racing chariot and its team of four for indeed michael kalaphates learned little of the arts of warfare but is widely considered the levants foremost expert on sporting contests and games of chance joanness fingers drummed the table in a heavy padding ominous motion well let us bring the brief tale of michael kalaphates to its conclusion joanness eyes seemed completely shrouded in their deep sunken sockets michael kalaphates having been bludgeoned senseless in front of the empresss carriage is fortunate enough to hitch a ride upon the cart of a tauroscythian bandit he is invited to the empress city to enjoy his undiscovered celebrity which he quickly squanders earning his own reputation as a tomcat spendthrift dilettante petty speculator and drunken idler joannes suddenly stood and michael reflexively jerked his chair back towards the door you who were carried in a silken litter into the blazing light of the imperial diadem have already crawled off into your own shadow of iniquity joanness voice was like proximate thunder and as his face darkened the deep hollows of his brutish distorted face seemed to become as black as his frock his huge spreading arms made him look like a great vulture about to enfold his hapless nephew michaels eyes were bright coals stoked by terror let me tell you now how i might deal with you joanness tongue slid over his lips i could dispatch you to neorion this very moment you snivelling milksop they would bring me your skin before the sun has set and you would no longer be in it ah but seeing that such summary judgement might leave you with little time for repentance i could ask that you remain in a windowless cell in the numera until you expire from utter desolation or should i feel particularly benevolent i might request that your talents be employed in distant baku loading petroleum into barrels so that our warships are assured a supply of liquid fire then again the monastic life might suit you the cenobium at mount athos uncle uncle michael kalaphates fell to his knees no uncle crawling on his knees he manoeuvred round the writing table like a large eager dog grasped joanness enormous black boots and kissed them in supplication the bluster about the neorion and numera and even baku michael had identified as such mount athos was quite another matter his uncle would earn only the general approbation of court church and city for having dispatched a prodigal nephew to a grim cell in an isolated community where his only companionship would be stinking burlapshrouded prayerchanting eremites neorion would in fact be preferable joannes allowed michael to wipe his nose on his boots for a few moments observing that his nephew had spent so much time consorting with actresses that he had acquired thespian abilities of his own still the desired message had been delivered joannes viciously kicked the nephews ribs get away scamp even your snivelling needs improvement michael returned to his chair he rubbed his throbbing sternum thoughtfully what did his uncle want in exchange for sparing him even a few years of poverty chastity and worst of all obedience joannes sat and appraised his nephew wondering how many times he would have to whip this dog before it learned even a single trick still michael was energetic clever a natural dissimulator all raw materials with which joannes could work skilfully i would like you to assume a position of some benefit to your family certainly you owe us that much yes sir said michael sincerely an office of some sort why if it ensured his continued exposure to the culture of this great city why not from what he had seen of men with official duties here at court their interests were identical to his horses women rich food and strong drink joannes leaned back in his chair you have heard no doubt that our imperial father your uncle and my brother is not well he has borne the burdens of state for so long and so diligently that in the confidence of our familiar sanctuary i confess to you that i fear for his life oh no uncle no so thought michael the common gossip can no longer be denied and a pity it is indeed without an imperial relation even one who pointedly disregarded him life would be so much more difficult here perhaps he would no longer be welcome at argyruss our splendid father is not in imminent danger of course but we must be concerned now to relieve some of the burden upon him otherwise we may indeed have cause to mourn our lack of foresight we who are closest to him must now circle around him and like the columns that thrust up the celestial dome of the hagia sophia take a share of the weight that encumbers and threatens to bring our magnificent father plunging to the dust yes sir michael wished his uncle would get to the specifics something ceremonial perhaps that would be more desirable a chance to sport about with the hetairarch and the manglavite even the crumbs from their table metaphorically speaking would soon sate one to glorious excess the position i have selected for you is that of caesar caesar michael knew that this was the title of the emperor of ancient rome but with the endemic inflation of titles in the new rome a caesar might very well be the man who carted manure from the emperors stables caesar either the title was in fact that insignificant or it had not been used for many many years i see you are not familiar with the dignity you are to be assigned said joannes his shrouded eyes seeming to draw in light the caesar is only designated when the emperor basileus and autocrator has not sired a purpleborn heir in the event of the death of the emperor the caesar would succeed him to the imperial throne this is her majestys galley said maria the wind whipped at the black sable collar of her coat signal banners flapped in the rigging and the hull groaned slightly i am privileged to use it maria looked over at the group of a dozen servants wrapped in heavy woollen cloaks standing by the railing amidships please excuse me i must instruct them on the cleaning and management of the villa it has been closed for some months and many of them will be new there haraldr watched the bucoleon harbour recede with each powerful stroke of the biremes eighty oars the city was incandescent the lead roofs and marble revetments glittering like jewels in the glancing light of late afternoon gulls screeched as they descended to accompany the ship across the bosporus chrysopolis seemed to float by to the right a city splendid enough to dazzle the world by itself and then the urban clutter gave way to elegantly spaced villas surrounded by groomed cypresses and gardens rendered by winter into brownandgrey geometric sketches a large canopied richly enamelled white skiff deposited haraldr and maria and six of the servants alongside the steps of a stone jetty the skiff was quickly rowed back to the galley for the other servants and some supplies the jetty crossed a narrow section of rocky beach and ended at an iron gate set in a stone wall marias chamberlain unlocked the gate marble steps covered with dead leaves climbed through a series of terraces to the entrance arcade of a large threestorey villa from the porch in front of the villa haraldr could see grey spiky orchards extending behind the house for some distance they entered the house through a small roofless atrium a dead bird had fallen in among the leaves a narrow hall led to a twostorey peristyle surrounded by goldveined marble columns an ornamental basin at the near end of the peristyle was drained of water and the tiles were dirtied with dried scum it will take some time for the heat to circulate after the furnaces are started said maria i think it is warmer outside she put her hand on haraldrs arm it was the first time they had touched since the previous night she guided him back out to the porch they paused at a marble balustrade that overlooked the series of terraces they were perhaps a hundred ells above the water the sun had a rose tint as it flirted with the hills far to the west and the vast cities across the water glowed softly in the final diffusion of daylight my parents left me this villa she ran her gloved hand over the smooth marble railing you have never spoken of them she put her hand on his arm again there is too much of which we have never spoken who were your father and mother marias eyes were a vivid reflection of the glistening sea i never knew them they died were killed when i was an infant they were involved in a political matter they were banished their properties confiscated their names expunged from record our empress zoe then merely the niece of the bulgarslayer was my parents friend she was able to intercede and retrieve some of their estate and their newborn daughter in hope that there might one day be some sort of pardon but the ship carrying my parents into exile was overtaken by a storm and they were drowned the empress has raised me as if i were her own child so you consider her your family her sister is also my family i did not know you were close to the augusta theodora strange thought haraldr he remembered the interaction between the empress and her sister in euthymiuss mime a bitter rivalry generally acknowledged in palace circles yes she is my other mother i miss her maria bit her brilliant windrouged lower lip who is your family i am from norway it is a peninsula in the part of the world you call thule my father died when i was very young he was an important man in norway a man of noble birth and so you are of noble birth as well yes what dignity were you assigned in norway haraldr regretted his partial honesty i was a member of the kings court we do not have as many or various kinds of dignities in norway as you do here in rome i cannot believe you ever bowed to anyone i bow to our father and our mother just as i bowed to norways king perhaps you will not always do so i see when i lead the fairhairs to the despoliation of rome haraldrs tone was sarcastic maria smiled it is appropriate that you should be annoyed with me i was hoping that you would find my chronic melancholy seductive a girlish conceit i find you seductive yes her jaws clenched and her voice lowered i know that you are going to sleep in my bed tonight i know what you are going to give me in my bed i can see it in your eyes and feel it between my legs feel it deep in my belly do you know that i am already wet her eyes blazed back at the sun as it slid behind the horizon but how can i get you to give me back your love perhaps love is not necessary she turned to him and he was astonished to see the tears it has to be she said in a voice so small so desperate that he reached out to touch her burning face then swept her into his arms one of our treasures is sleeping whispered michael emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans he put his fingers to his lips to caution silence joannes glanced to the imperial couch beneath the rich goldembroidered canopy that draped the enormous fourcolumned bed beneath the breezesoft claret sheets lay the wizened gnarled figure of a man who appeared to have just emerged from half a century of keeping company with snakes and scorpions in some cave and indeed probably had the latest of the emperors treasures snored in long shallow rattles and his unshorn verminous hair spread out over the imperial pillows like a halo of excrement the emperor quickly guided his brother from the imperial bedchamber through a vast antechamber to a smaller audience chamber ringed with newly installed mosaics depicting the visions of ezekiel the monk cosmos tzintzuluces stood beside a small marble table and peered into what seemed to be a large gold reliquary shaped like a multidomed church the miniature domes were tiled with red gemstones tzintzuluces greeted joannes effusively joannes grunted a polite greeting in reply he tolerated tzintzuluces not the least because the intervention of this apparently sincere monk in the life of the emperor was vastly preferable to abandoning his majestys spiritual care to the wiles of the despicable patriarch alexius praise the pantocrator that he had created the monasteries thought joannes for without the debilitating rivalry between the priesthood and the monks secular government would soon be overthrown by ecclesiastical forces still tzintzuluces had to be watched like all truly religious men he was a fanatic and like all fanatics he had no plan only an ultimate largely abstract goal and men without plans were dangerous come see this brother the emperor took joanness arm and urged him beside the table he hefted the miniature church this is how saints cosmos and damian will look we are building around the existing foundations with these additions and the construction of an upper storey that will add a symmetry and magnificence that the previous architects neglected we have already ordered the quarrying of the finest lacedaemonian and sangarian marbles as well as thessalian onyx there is to be a fresco depiction of the martyrdom of the glorious saints and our mosaics extolling the pantocrator will emphasize the role of st luke of course the edifices of the rest of the monastery will be adorned with the same degree of devotion and respect and the surrounding neighbourhood will also receive a renovation as we have commanded the architects to consider new baths fountains a park joannes no longer heard his brothers raptures he had already computed the cost of the emperors latest expiation within a few dozen solidi a price that regrettably must be paid he told himself at least the emperors building projects were charitable not selfindulgent saints cosmas and damian after all had been physicians who did not charge for their services and this lavish reconsecration of their humble church would remind the vicious mob of the hospices monasteries and orphanages so recently endowed by their caring father and this activity would perhaps in some way serve as a rebuttal to the rumourmongers a dying man would not rise from his deathbed to commission whole new monastic complexes that he would never live to see joannes turned to tzintzuluces do you see how our father spares nothing for the welfare of his children joannes shook his head and attempted to smile wistfully at the monk he is so doting that i sometimes fear he will spoil them joannes approached tzintzuluces more closely and whispered in his ear the emperor was still talking almost to himself going into further detail about where the various mosaic scenes would be placed in the chapel blessed brother said joannes might i borrow our father for a time even as i admonish myself for depriving him of even a moment of your salutary ministrations what i hope to humbly offer him will i think also ease his torment just as effusively as he had greeted joannes tzintzuluces bade him farewell and withdrew content that even though he had momentarily released his sacred charge to the clutches of the world it would be in the company of a man equally devoted to him a man who like tzintzuluces himself wore the black frock of worldly denial she placed her hand in his the night was clear cold magical the cities spread across the black water like carpets woven from the stars the stars above them mirrors of the great citys brilliance she leaned back and looked overhead her arching throat swanlike erotic do you think they ever collide she whispered they swirl about in the heavens they are known to fall to earth but do they ever collide haraldr looked up perhaps they do or have in a time when there were no men to witness them when only the gods saw i know that like all things each one of those fires will one day come to an end yes every fire must exhaust itself but perhaps some burn longer than others do you know much of astrology i have met one of the astrologers attached to the imperial retinue i have also met others at court who consider the science to be pure chicanery is astrology an interest of yours an interest but not a belief maria lowered her head and looked across the water i do not believe that the movement of heavenly bodies determines our fortunes here on earth but i believe that like the stars our fates move in certain patterns and that we are bound to remain in those orbits no matter how strenuously we may hope and endeavour to escape them suddenly she turned and threw her arms around haraldr what made you bring your axe down that day how did you know that your stroke would not bring the sword down on my neck i did not know that but he was not certain what he had known in the instant he had decided later he had realized that if he hadnt killed the seljuk leader at that moment probably none of them including maria would have left the kastron alive now he only hoped in spite of himself that his answer hurt her i presented fate with an answer and left fate to determine the question or perhaps fate had already told you the answer you mean that what passes between you and i has already been determined she let him go and walked a few steps away her arms wrapped around her thick furlined coat the fine tip of her nose tilted to the stars again you and i are a moment when the stars collide you came to me across all time your path determined before the first stars were set in motion we are bound together your star and mine she lowered her head and looked at him and her eyes outshone all other lights i know this we are alone said the emperor please sit with me joannes awkwardly settled his enormous distorted form on the gilded throne his brother used for the most informal intimate audiences protocol insisted nevertheless that no one sit in the presence of the emperor much less on the throne beside him but these were unusual circumstances joannes studied his brothers swollen wrists puffy cheeks and shadowed weary eyes the deterioration was shocking did the humours that afflicted his brain reside in the other parts of his body when they were not causing the mind storms if so they had begun to destroy the body which they had made their host it is sometimes wearying is it not to labour on behalf of so many said joannes and yet i must serve my children even with my last breath replied the emperor they have never had a more just and devoted father than yourself do not let modesty overlook your own contribution dearest brother i do not mind admitting that i have tried to serve you with every resource to my avail yes you are my peter the rock upon which my throne has been erected joannes paused assessing the width of the portal that was opening before him finally he spoke i have given much thought as to how that foundation which i hope i do in some small part provide can be strengthened indeed tell me brother the emperors voice was earnest and somewhat solicitous as if he could bestow a favour simply by listening just as the son of god had both his heavenly family and his earthly family so does his hand on earth have two kinds of family the spiritual and the corporeal the spiritual family he has sought out and embraced and the proceeds of that virtuous endeavour will accrue to his glory both in this world and the next but he has not sought out his corporeal family with the same diligence the emperors expression changed from open curiosity to inscrutable deliberation his dark eyes suddenly seemed flat impenetrable as if they would take in no more of this information if a man wishes to take his ship upon rough waters the emperor said at length then he builds his vessel with sturdy wellplaned boards the rotten timbers he discards i am sensitive to your feelings concerning our brothers constantines blundering in antioch almost cost me my throne stephan will cost me sicily joannes trod warily his brother was no man to be trifled with even in this condition if only god could have shown them another way to place the imperial diadem upon his head he might have been the greatest of all emperors but guilt was eating away at him like a leprosy there is another threat to your throne i am ill i am not dying with the pantocrators help and gods forgiveness i will be cured of my affliction in the meantime i am quite competent to govern my children neither do i think that your life is in jeopardy nor that your abilities have been impaired the danger here is not in what we know to be true but in what others perceive do not imagine that this disease that has temporarily afflicted you has gone unnoticed and that it has not fuelled the fires of rumour i will soon appear before my children to assuage their anxiety and lay these rumours to rest i think it will be some time before we can with confidence allow your children the privilege of seeing you for your children to witness may the pantocrator forgive the boldness of my conjecture one of your attacks would turn these fires of rumours into a conflagration that would consume the entire roman empire we will wait then until i have received absolution st demetrius is working prodigiously on my behalf i can assure you if only the blessed st demetrius were able to proselytize in the inns and brothels of the studion as effectively as he litigates before the heavenly tribunal then we would have little to fear the emperor seemed to jerk into a more erect posture and for a moment joannes feared that another fit was upon him there had been two episodes the previous day after the second his majesty had remained unconscious for several hours but the emperor responded with the acuity that had been in better days taken for granted what reports do you have of insurrection i have myself seen an arsenal secreted by these rebels in an old warehouse just north of the studite monastery the quantity and quality of the weapons indicated that this group had resources we do not ordinarily associate with the unfortunate wretches who occupy that district there is a danger that this disease might be communicated to the classes of labourers and even the various professions and guild members the emperors broad shoulders and chest sagged with pain my children why would my children turn against me joannes wrapped his huge span around his brothers suddenly heaving shoulders it is not any lack of love for their father believe that it is that few can now resist the rumours there are many who claim you are already dead and the majority are certain that you are dying in their desperation and grief they wonder why their father has not like any good father provided for the future of his brood when he is gone they think you are gone from them and have left them no successor to your glorious and benevolent tenure so quite naturally they are inclined after enduring this lengthy period of distress to think of placing their own successor on the throne if you were to make a gesture towards them in naming a successor i think this incipient insurrection would wither like a weed with its roots plucked from the earth i will be unable to leave them an heir the emperors eyes were profoundly sad of course you are unable to designate a basileus and augustus as you could with a child of your own loins but you could provide the children of your imperium with a caesar is this the help you would have me receive from our corporeal family then you must know i will not hear of it stephan would destroy everything that we have laboured for i was not thinking of stephan their brotherinlaw stephan was the closest male relative with the requisite reproductive organs who then constantine thankfully is disqualified joannes observed to himself that this was not unlike the decisive moment in an interrogation in the neorion the moment when success and failure are both equally pregnant you have not met your nephew michael kalaphates i have taken it upon myself to become acquainted with him and i am impressed with his qualities he is intelligent presentable and is an experienced warrior that he knows nothing of statecraft is of no consequence because he need only offer the appearance of a princely character we are not in need of a ruler to replace or even assist you only a suitable image to present to your doubting children i do not need this nephew beneath my feet like an unwanted pet i assure you majesty that will not be the case i have already discreetly and obliquely approached him on this matter i made it stridently patent to him that he would be your slave a mere token of your godgranted authority to this he agreed with touching humility and gratitude that even in the smallest fashion he might have an opportunity to earn your respect and affection he is yours to command to send through the city riding backwards on an ass if you so wish and what of zoe without public expression of her approval to this succession any designation would be meaningless she is in no position to oppose us but even so we would be less than fair if we did not approach her with a measure of compromise even humility the christ forgave a harlot and is it not our highest purpose in life to walk where he has walked let us suggest to her that with respect to her purpleborn stature we would not dream of offering this caesar to her children without her blessing and sanctification and in further acknowledgement of her endowment by the very hand of the pantocrator we would humbly beseech her to take this child this caesar to her bosom metaphorically to suckle him with the milk of her impeccable macedonian lineage and formally adopt him as her son the emperor considered the matter for a remarkably brief interlude his chin was set his gaze decisive this is well conceived my dearest brother and most faithful servant i can only offer one caution as to this enterprise if the empress forms a personal enmity for our nephew the plan will not work yes i have dispatched him to her chambers this very evening to dine with her and convince her of his merits feeling that even if you did not signal your approval of this proposal he might at least tell us something of her activities and intentions he was quite quaking at the prospect but i am certain that his boyish charms will arouse her maternal inclinations the emperor stood how much lighter is my load than it was an hour ago he said come and embrace me my peter my rock the emperor held out his arms and clutched the giant monk to his own thick chest he was astonished when joannes suddenly burst into tears she awoke to his kisses on her neck she rolled over and took him in her arms and felt the length of his body against hers and pressed her breasts to his hard chest haraldr held her head and whispered in her ear you had a night vision he said soothingly why did you cry out i dreamed of you said maria in a voice like a hot breeze they were so warm together beneath silk and down the heated floor baking the cold from the marble walls of her bedchamber i often dream of you are we lovers often did i hurt you this time to make you cry no she shuddered against him why were you frightened she would not answer she nuzzled his neck and gripped his shoulders tightly make love to me again she said gently raspily tell me what you saw it was frivolous a vision with no meaning then tell it she paused to bite him on the neck very well she relented hoping that her acquiescence would indeed render the vision frivolous she pushed away from him slightly i saw you sailing across a cold black sea with hundreds of ships in your wake a man who was with you pointed to the heavens and thousands of ravens tittered overhead until they were like a cloud that blocked the sun a portent of death what happened i dont know i cried out and your kisses carried me away from the shores of sleep were you afraid that you would share my fate perhaps i was afraid that i would not she gathered him in her arms with a fierce passion make love to me it began again on a sea made of light boundless their frantic arms drawing each other into a single atom of being this common soul expanding until it embraced all time all creation i love you she screamed in her moment of paroxysm and then she drifted slowly to his chest and wrapped her arms around him again their kisses made him hard again before he had even left her this time they clung to each other flesh dissolving flesh sleepwalkers meeting in a dream lips to the others ear waiting for some enchanted revelation love love she said her voice quavering he waited deciding he would not tell her of his love this night might never tell her but of course she already knew she moaned softly and whispered again tonight the world has changed for ever yes he admitted controlling his voice i feel that no you do not know how i mean that it is not just these two breasts these two souls locked within it is a thousand thousand souls for a thousand years he took her face in his hands and found her gaze with his i know he told her and in that moment he saw like a distant image against an azure sea the reflection of a raven as it tracked across the blue depths of her eyes look nephew i have provided you with a final treat finish your pastry and you will see it zoe raised her hand at the hovering eunuch who had reached for her empty little silver dessert dish away she looked at michael kalaphates and shrugged i do not know who is responsible for training the servants i am sent perhaps your uncle the orphanotrophus joannes in any event whenever symeon finally instructs one in the proper decorum he is snatched away and i am plagued with some new oaf this one only arrived this very afternoon perhaps he will improve his performance michael kalaphates swallowed the last of his dessert and smiled effortlessly he studied the images chased on his silver plate and laughed you remembered my fascination with pagan scenes this is a satyr i believe you once told me and this lovely creature though she is as pale as her aureate spectre beside you is a maenad you remembered said zoe happily yet demurely we found we had much in common in antioch did we not i am so pleased that your uncle has permitted you to renew our acquaintance she cast her eyes at the servant although i am virtually terrified by the boldness of what i must remark let me humbly beg you that our acquaintance be given the opportunity to ripen into friendship i will beseech the holy virgin each night that before i have pined away each of my days i might be invited to sup with you again until then i will mourn deepeyed hera that i am for ever cast down from your olympian immanence zoe laughed huskily perhaps erotically i have enjoyed this interview nephew you may be certain that we will be more than strangers in the future in the meantime i will propose to your uncle that you be offered a dignity more in keeping with your charm and intellect now i must regretfully ask you to take your leave michael stood bowed and withdrew with his arms folded across his breast his eyes seeming to plead what protocol and the presence of joanness spies dictated that his tongue could not zoe nodded and the bronze doors slid shut on the shimmering vision of his mother michael passed quickly through an antechamber dazzling with mosaics and was escorted by a chamberlain down a series of hallways that turned twice before ending at another set of bronze doors the khazar guards at the gate to the empresss apartments halted him their komes carefully eyed michael then pulled a marker out of a little tally board before he finally opened the doors may i visit the virgin of kamilas to give thanks michael asked the komes referring to a palace chapel near the gynaeceum the koines reached for a document resting on the stone barricade and read it with dark darting eyes finally he looked up and shrugged it is permitted the little church consisted of two apses stuck on the first storey of a larger building used for wardrobe storage michael proceeded to the altar of the holy mother of heaven who floated serenely in the midst of a mosaic applied to the half dome of the apse he stepped inside the silver chancel screen and placed a single silver nomismata on the gold altar table metal against metal made a dull mysterious ring in the absolutely still chapel michael did not hear the priest until he materialized seemingly as magically as the holy spirit by his side the priest picked the coin off the altar with slender cadaverous fingers he turned about and michael followed him into a little room full of sacramental candles the priest pulled a battered rusty knife out of his cloak and pried a slab of marble pavement from the floor he lit one of the candles and handed it to michael the first part of the passage was through raw earth michael cursed the gummy soil that quickly dirtied his best silk after forty fathoms the dirt tunnel intersected what appeared to be the basement of a longrazed palace a few bits of plaster still clung to the ancient brick vaults michael transited the unbearably dank basement to a crumbling perimeter wall crawled through a small opening and entered a stonewalled passage so narrow that he had to walk sideways this ran for fifty fathoms before ending in stone stairs that climbed almost as steeply as a ladder at the top of the stairs michael perched himself precariously on a little ledge a door that looked like it had been designed for a small child was just at his left he removed the key from his boot unlocked the door and squeezed through into a treasury of littleused chalices porcelain cups glass basins bronze lamps and icons the antechamber beyond was empty and the lamps had been extinguished he took a second key quickly unlocked a small bronze door bordered with embossed eagles and at the end of a featureless but aromatic hallway parted the dark silk curtains the bed beneath the great gilded dome reminded him of an altar the goldbrocade canopy thrust up by twisting golden columns the scarlet curtains threaded with thousands of tiny chirhos the monogram of the christ he approached the bed with excruciating precision then reached out his hand steady and flung the curtain aside wicked nephew said zoe she was naked except for her rings her heavy breasts and sensuous belly thrust out the jewelled fingers of her left hand beside the shaped golden pelt between her legs with her right hand she reached out and touched michaels face take that filthy thing off michael stripped frantically and fell on her majesty his face buried in her breasts she laughed in great throaty peals yes little nephew i shall have you to dine again that is i shall have you dine upon me you would have been a surpassing thespian my little slave i believe that your odious uncle is even now receiving a favourable report from his spy she pushed him away and sat up her hands cupping her own breasts now tell your precious mother about this clever scenario in which you are to play the buffoon symeon has heard the most fantastic rumours michael eyed the empresss pubic triangle while he hurriedly spoke he wants to make me the caesar yes but you must adopt me first i am to charm you zoe fell back with the force of her laughter she writhed with mirth for a moment and then reached up and kneaded michaels scrotum my little boy she said puckering her lips facetiously my precious little boy she shrieked suck at my breast my little cherub she let him go arched her neck and pressed her voluminous white bosom upwards a finger at the tip of each thick erect porphyrycoloured nipple there my child my paps will give you life michaels attention to her breasts calmed zoe reducing her boisterous laugh to gentle moans she began to slide her pelvis over the silk sheets in snakelike motions love slave she said with a moan you must now play sophocless tragic hero and enter your mothers womb she lifted his head come to me little oedipus i shall not even make you bawl for my favour give me your essence michael eagerly lowered himself between the twitching imperial legs zoe wrapped him with her gorgeous limbs ah my little slave she sighed my precious tiny caesar my dear nephew and soon adopted son she gasped and fought for control as his buttocks pumped above her loins listen to me little one once you are named my husbands heir you must reward the uncle who has enabled this delicious incest do you hear me yes yes he began to wail reward unnnh joannes zoe pulled her knees forward reached back behind her buttocks and wrapped her thumb and forefinger around michaels thrusting member she squeezed first firmly then so painfully that he stopped his motion and looked at her with watering eyes she pressed her lips towards him and whispered her words hot on his heaving chest i want you to kill him i thought it might be instructive for you to see this manglavite haraldr joannes selected an instrument from the table and held it towards the light you might be called upon to spend more of your time here in the neorion he looked back over his shoulder his eyes almost invisible inside his grotesque head then he walked over to his subject his step heavy his boots resounding in the sinister chamber the naked man was chained between two bloodstained stone pillars his legs spread slightly a long wooden rail supported by ropes that could be raised or lowered on pulleys supported his arms two assistants waited dutifully beside the wretch one was tall by all but norse standards and had the charred blue skin and short wiry black hair of afrikka the other was a small noseless armenian haraldr had been told that condemned prisoners might prolong their lives by assisting in the punishment of others interrogation manglavite haraldr is an art superior to that of the painter the carver in stone even the goldsmith who chases pure images of the virgin with skill and delicacy joannes pointed to the helpless wretch who in his terror had already deposited faeces and urine on the bare stone floor this inert clay capable only of the most basic human responses is the raw material from which i will fashion an object of both beauty and utility in the eyes of the sacred state we both serve though some might perceive our creation as fearful even repulsive remember that the most hideous acts of cruelty are beautiful to the pantocrator when they serve to create martyrs to our glorious faith or when such acts serve to punish the condemned souls who have rejected his sacraments if the fiery lakes of hell are beguiling to our lord because they purify his heavenly empire then we his servants must find pulchritude in the interrogators designs for by them do we purify the earthly empire joannes turned quickly to face haraldr elbows whirling rigidly as if he were the enormous toy top of some evil titan you manglavite haraldr are privileged to apprentice yourself to this art he whirled back to face his raw material a man of about twentyfive or perhaps thirtyfive with short dark hair and a patchy black beard it was impossible to tell who he might have been what his character was for neorion had already taken the humanity away from him as it did everyone victim or victimizer who entered its grim portals like any artist the interrogator must carefully consider where to begin the novice tends to strokes that are too delicate or conversely too broad i rather prefer to joannes nodded to the blue man who seized the victims head in his huge dark fingers begin with an unexpected flourish a conundrum to delight the eye of irony joannes took a short knife resembling the instrument of a surgeon and held it to the mans mouth the dark eyes above the gleaming blade glared with a kind of noble defiance and haraldr asked odin to help this man die well and quickly for he deserved a good death when a man undergoes interrogation the object of greatest concern to him is his manhood he is least fearful for his oral cavity and the organs therein for he knows that he must be left his tongue if he is expected to provide us with the verse we have so arduously prompted him to compose with a deft instant motion joannes began to carve around the mans mouth and in a mere moment he flung aside a small bloody mass like a piece of rotten fruit the armenian scrambled after the discarded flesh and dropped it into a large wooden bucket haraldr fought his swoon and surging gut the poor victim jerked his head as much as he could and his exposed reddened teeth chattered while blood poured down his chin he was in every other way intact but he was already in countenance a cadaver a fleshless skull but a man still speaks credibly without lips said joannes he stepped back and appraised his work the interrogator like the artist knows when his work is finished for that is when the object he has created praises the pantocrator in the voice he has intended for it joannes reached down and grabbed the mans penis this creation of mine can already praise the pantocrator by informing us who is arming the rabble of the studion the man rolled his head with the great gaping bloody smear where his mouth had been but said nothing if we take the testicles as was my fate we leave the means but not the desire if we take the penis we leave the desire but not the means joannes yanked on the penis and sliced it cleanly away he turned and showed the bloody limp member to haraldr perhaps i should perform this alteration on you tauroscythians joannes grinned an obscene heavylipped smile more terrible than his scowl i am concerned that yours and those of your henchmen will trouble you more than this is troubling our friend here he tossed the penis into the armenians bucket then wiped his hands on a towel offered by the blue man the slut maria with whom you are enjoying yourself is a chronic malefactor a delinquent whose immoral licence flaunts every standard and expectation of a christian community she is anathema to all who worship the true light of the world she is not anathema to our purpleborn mother said haraldr when mar and i destroy you haraldr vowed silently her name will be one we shall invoke over your foul corpse joannes could scarcely conceal his astonishment haraldr nordbrikt was challenging him haraldr nordbrikt and the hetairarch mar hunrodarson fowl of the same feather but to his face even the hetairarch was not so carelessly impudent but that was the difference between the two the hetairarch was much more clever and more dangerous and that was why haraldr nordbrikts tongue would not earn him lodging in the neorion that very evening someday growled joannes you may be asked to assist me with the whore maria in this place i enjoy working with women i often ask them which set of lips they are most loath to part with it becomes quite easy to distinguish between those who are vain and those who are lustful ice clotted haraldrs veins she a hostage to him he had not thought of that when he had so blithely taunted joannes christ odin the flame of rage collapsed into mocking embers joannes turned back to his artwork satisfied that he had made a useful point strange he thought how these huge varangian brutes could be moved by tiny chattering creatures like women our talk has been most useful manglavite it gives our creation an opportunity to reflect on his own reticence let him now praise the pantocrator but the pantocrator was only praised in the dignity of the wretch a man who haraldr reflected was probably innocent and if not then guilty only of righteous outrage haraldr was exhausted brutalized pained by his own agony in watching joanness methodical deft dismemberment of this once human being he could not imagine the courage and strength of the simple man who was mutely accepting this terrible attrition of his mortality finally after the armenian had filled his bucket joannes pronounced his creation a disappointment if only because the clay was of too poor a grade to be moulded into any object of value he turned away from his failed creation for the last time manglavite haraldr nordbrikt he rumbled i have been musing as i often do when i am at my ease in my workshop and one of the subjects i have entertained while i have worked today is how to best employ your abilities it comes to my mind that you are currently in complete disuse in fact one might claim disutility in your office of manglavite i have thought of a more useful vocation for you and your varangian fellows until our father resumes his customary protocol since our christian community is increasingly plagued by this rabble in the studion an example of which we have before us you and your men will be assigned to duty as cursores in that district until such time as i am convinced that these precautions are no longer necessary joannes walked to the forbidding steel double doors he waited until his assistants had opened them and left the chamber with their bloody towels and buckets of viscera then he looked back at haraldr with a grin like death i leave you todays legacy of my art perhaps flawed but one you might yet learn from joannes slammed the huge doors shut behind him the stench of filth and viscera was suddenly overwhelming haraldr was alone with it it was a demonic crimson mask of bloody pulpy flayed facial tissue without nose ears scalp or lips only glaring lidless eyes and clenched exposed bloodsmeared teeth its crotch was a bloody gash its belly a gaping reeking empty cavity where the bowels had been ripped out its legs truncated at the ankles twitched frantically the veins gently pumping blood into pools on the floor most horrible of all its spurting handless wrists jerked up and down with conscious articulation as if trying to recapture with phantom digits the life that had been carved away from it piece by bloody piece and then the rolling bloodwashed irises made contact and haraldr realized that there was still a man inside it just as there had been that terrible night in the studion he unsheathed his sword and prepared a quick end to this long ugly yet noble death he came close forcing himself to look in the eyes and he realized that this death and the one in that fetid ally stained him with blood far more deeply than the many lives he had taken in battle now there were two how many more wretches could he slay out of compassion before he had to question the quality of his mercy he could never give this man what he was owed but he could give him what he could he drew back his blade wait the voice stood on the threshold of the spirit world haraldr held his blade at the beginning of its merciful arc the man looked at haraldr with a bitter yet kindred defiance the blue star he croaked barely audibly then with the last fibre of his strength he lifted his head now he pleaded haraldr brought his blade screaming through the mans neck his strength fuelled not by odin but by the desperate hope that somehow this stroke would sever the head of the imperial eagle what will you do asked the purpleborn augusta theodora her pinched face and dull brown braids were unadorned despite her goldlaced purple robe she seemed as plain as a butchers wife i could refuse to crown this caesar answered alexius patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith his small black eyes stalked like agile panthers above the craggy hump of his nose imperial protocol dictates that the caesar be crowned by the emperor and so i could refuse to sanction the ceremony simply on that basis but of course the paradox of our caesar is that we must have him because the emperor is not well enough to crown him you would be coerced if you refused to crown him alexius smiled i fear no coercion if my jurisdiction were merely the empire of rome then i would offer this caesar nothing about his head but penitential ashes and glorify the pantocrator with my own martyrdom but my empire is that of all souls and so my considerations are rather more complex alexius stroked the ornate rings on his left hand with the fingers of his right it is unfortunate that your sister zoe has so warmly embraced her husbands heir were the empress opposed even mildly i could take her reluctance to the people of the city and before the three days that it took our lord to be scourged martyred and resurrected had passed the people of this city would have hurled joannes and his dhynatoi accomplices into the abyss that spawned them but now the fortunes of our secular empire and those of my beleaguered spiritual empire will go from bad to worse your sisters husband has listened to the christ with one ear and the demon joannes with the other and that is the source of the torment that is destroying his body if not his immortal soul i believe and pray that when this emperor supplicates the heavenly tribunal he will find expiation but when this caesar inherits the imperial diadem he will hear only joannes and his soul will endure the fiery lakes of eternal woe theodora crossed herself father you cannot think that the emperor is so close to his mortality he will recover certainly he is an extremely robust man alexius stroked his silvery beard if he recovers it will not be soon and during his illness he will have yielded that much more of his authority and perhaps his soul to joannes my child your love for your sister is an example to christian charity and i too pray for her soul each morning and evening but joannes has used the objects of your sisters lust to enslave her people whether we are to be ruled by michael the present emperor or this new michael the caesar is of little consequence to the suffering folk of rome who know only that it is joanness boot on their neck yet as long as your sister continues to place her carnal aspirations above the obligations of her purpleborn sanction her people will obediently suffer that scourge but god will not suffer this outrage with infinite patience he has already risen up the bishop of old rome and his blasphemous filioque to warn us of our transgressions alexius studied theodoras troubled face she wore her almost childlike expression of grief finally the patriarch gestured at the barren walls of theodoras apartment his golden rings caught the light for an instant my child your spiritual wealth has increased in this place of exile yes i do not miss the palace i prefer to dream of the lords mansions alexiuss thin elegant lips parted with genuine warmth but his dark eyes still paced menacingly i am certain you will be well received in those mansions in your devotion to our lord you are similar to your sister eudocia may the pantocrator keep her soul in his eternal light though she came to her faith too late to save her mortal being from the consequences of her sin theodora seemed startled by this her face retained the innocence of regret but her eyes were alert wary the prey observing the stalking beast indeed continued alexius where the christs steps have gone i see yours following and yet there is another path that the christ has also charged you to follow a charge he gave you from the moment of your souls conception and now the christ cautions us that you have strayed from this path alexiuss eyes no longer paced they crouched i need not tell you that christ the pantocrator crowned in heaven was also crowned here on earth theodoras pale blue eyes shifted yes the crown pilate gave him a crown of thorns our lord accepted the crown of thorns because beneath that excruciating diadem he would lead mankind to the resurrection and eternal life alexius smiled sympathetically all worldly crowns are crowns of thorns my child mine own bleeds me even now the christ was offered all the kingdoms of the world if only he would fall on his knees before satan we who rule the world must turn away from like blandishments and take only the crown that earns us favour in the kingdom of heaven and that crown is pain i too have renounced the kingdoms of the world at last father i have alexiuss eyes leapt forward no you have renounced the crown that brings only blood and pain and death to your brow and in so doing you have denied your people their hope of resurrection you are the purpleborn child chosen of god to do his will here in this valley of sorrows what you have achieved here in your exile is a strengthening of your soul but that soul must now assume the holy burden it is obligated to bear or it will cease to quest for eternal glory soon our lord will bid you rise up and bear your cross to golgotha theodoras features sharpened my lord cannot mean that i should betray my purpleborn sister alexius inclined his head slightly his thin lips almost musing no i am not asking you to initiate anything against your sister but the day will come and soon when the people of this city will appeal to their christ to deliver them even from the tormented bosom of their purpleborn mother and for that day you must be prepared your line the great house of macedon founded by your uncle basil the bulgarslayer is through its unyielding defence of the one true faith the very artery that nourishes every soul born unto life and that artery must never be severed or we are all damned and how would my barren loins perpetuate the dynasty of macedon if ever i was fertile i am now too withered to bear fruit you are not the last of the bulgarslayers line theodoras eyes could not deny the shock of this jugular attack you have known yes for many years i know the circumstances your sister eudocia gave birth to the child at the convent on the isle of prote i do not know the child or even its sex but i know that it was not stillborn theodora drew her tall slender torso erect her pale eyes were steely and her tongue newly sharpened then we will not discuss the child i am in passing health and when the christ calls me to my golgotha i believe i can offer you ten good years of my life years in which you can with all your resources wage your battle against the bishop of old rome then if we are both still alive we will discuss the child alexius inclined his head slightly and smiled the bargain was acceptable theodora flushed aware of how easily the father had led her to this precipice of fate but now far less concerned for the consequences of that leap than she ever could have imagined she would be the child the child had to be protected and so ultimately did her sister they were her family father do you intend to employ the hetairarch mar hunrodarson to hasten the moment when the people of the city cry out for their deliverance from my sisters lust if so i must have your assurance she will not be harmed my child i have not even met mar hunrodarson what would i have had to discuss with him until i knew your wishes in this matter now that i understand your requirements i will accede to mar hunrodarsons request for an audience and listen to what he has to offer but first i must place a crown of thorns upon the head of our caesar v standards observed the parakoimomenos lord chamberlain of the imperial palace what is missing today are standards rome has been built on the rigorous observance of protocol and the unwavering preservation of dignities today this is all changed today would long be remembered as the nadir of the imperial dignity but what was one to do abandon the legacy of rome entirely to the whims of these lowborn parvenues no one held ones head high and tried to preserve what one could the parakoimomenos was a strikingly youthfulappearing man for his sixty years castration had made him callow and plump for most of life but his late maturity had finally brought out classic thracian features he had been born the same year the bulgarslayer had ascended to the imperial dignity had entered the imperial household as a mere chamberlaininwaiting when he was only sixteen years old and his aptitude for the astonishing minutiae of imperial protocol had advanced him inexorably through the various eunuch grades nine years ago he had realized his dream parakoimomenos the highest of all eunuch offices the official responsible for every aspect of public and private ceremony in the imperial palace the man who presented the face of glorious rome to an awestruck world then three months after this apotheosis rome had fallen to the cruellest fate the pantocrator had asked the bulgarslayer to set his throne beside those of the rulers of heaven at first the deterioration of standards had been gradual the bulgarslayers brother constantine had been a profligate a petty tyrant and a sloven yet he had not simply discarded the prescribed imperial protocols his successor romanus had been an even lesser man but his efforts to transform his pygmylike stature into a giant reputation had at least provided the solidi to maintain some semblance of imperial dignity and decorum but the lot who had purloined the throne from romanus the emperor was a good man in spite of everything but utterly devoid of culture as one might expect of the station from which he had risen still he desired in his simple uninformed fashion to observe proprieties but the orphanotrophus joannes there was the source of this veritable river of ignominy that now polluted the memory of glorious rome the parakoimomenos looked out from the arcade of the church of st mary chalkoprateia confident that all was in order on the street the facades of the buildings were cloaked with silk tapestries embroidered with the imperial eagles and the enormous crowd held at bay by the batons of the cursores stood in their best woolandsilk tunics clutching armfuls of laurel myrtle and olive branches two hundred tauroscythians of the grand hetairia gold helms and breastplates explosions of light in the sun waited at rigid attention arrayed behind them was the sublime vision of the court of imperial rome ranked as the pantocrator himself commanded the first two rows were magisters in their white silk tunics spotted with gold medallions and behind them the proconsular patricians also in shimmering white silk but without medallions arms cradling the porphyry tablets that proclaimed their rank and then the patricians in light rosecoloured robes with their tablets of white ivory and behind them the other fifteen ranks each with its different colour silk and particular insignia of dignity behind the court were the bands already a few booms of the kettledrums and blaring notes on the trumpets rose above the anticipatory murmuring of the crowd the parakoimomenos noted that the ranks were in good order that no witless patrician had in a desire to see what was going on wandered up with the proconsular patricians he turned and faced the bronze doors of st mary chalkoprateia the manglavite and hetairarch flanked the portal of the ancient basilica the bulgar slayer would have been proud of the two varangians thought the parakoimomenos the hetairarch with his axe motionless on his chest red plumes rising from his gold helmet so that it seemed he would scrape the sky the manglavite was new of course but he learned quickly and had a noble bearing look how stately he holds the fasces symbol of the centuries of romes uninterrupted hegemony hopefully he will not fall to his knees like some unwashed pilgrim when he sees the interior of the mother church for the first time the parakoimomenos reluctantly abandoned his reverie and stared at the bronze doors as if his imperious gaze could somehow keep what was inside for ever incarcerated yes in a few moments they would emerge and shatter this marvellous illusion of elegance and dominion as if to spite the parakoimomenos the doors flew open the caesartobe stepped into the shaded illumination of the arcade wearing the long white silk tunic symbolic of christ crowned with a simple pearl tiara and shod in purple boots behind this impromptu heir this centurion in the illgotten cloak of the christ was the debaucher of every known canon of politesse in holy rome the orphanotrophus joannes the chants began immediately the political officers had rehearsed the crowd well welcome caesar of the romans welcome strong arm of our father welcome new luminary in the firmament of imperial rome the manglavite stepped in front of the caesar and led him across the church porch and into the street the hetairarch walked at his side the parakoimomenos watched with horror as the orphanotrophus joannes took his place ahead of the magisters he had known that the man intended to do it had even forced his reeling mind to visualize it but actually to see it the blaring thumping band seemed to mock the parakoimomenos as he took his place between the manglavite and the caesar the manglavite began to lead the multicoloured army of splendour south to the avenue of the mese his long powerful legs snapping in a ceremonial goose step that was impressive and intimidating the glittering caravan wended slowly through the city amid the huge thunderously chanting petalthrowing crowds backed up for blocks on either side of the route eventually the procession transited the vast augustaion square passing beneath the towering equestrian statue of the emperor justinian and exited into the garden in front of the hagia sophia the manglavite turned directly opposite the western entrance of the mother church and began the final leg of the journey as the massive domes rose before him the parakoimomenos armoured his spirit against what he would see within within that in itself was an outrage that might indeed bring the great dome down on their heads this very morning in all the centuries of romes greatness had anyone other than the supreme authority on earth ever been crowned in the hagia sophia indeed not until today when a shiptarrers son would receive his crown directly from the hands of the patriarch himself not as was prescribed by all that was holy from the hands of the emperor well this entire scenario could have perhaps been even more devastating to civilised sensibilities at least the orphanotrophus joannes hadnt insisted that the imperial diadem be placed directly on his own monstrous head standards today the word was meaningless the central dome of the great church rose like a mountain peak above the sheer massif of the hagia sophias west facade haraldr concentrated on the relentless cadence of his steps and ignored the other rhythms the chants of the crowd the pounding of the kettledrums the last hour had been perhaps the most powerful experience of his life except for stiklestad today on the streets he had understood the fundamental awe that overwhelmed this crowd their sense that a god walked among them it did not matter to them who this new deity was or where he had come from the simple fact that he walked in the purple boots of imperial rome was enough to evoke an inexpressible virtually paralysing wonder and beneath this wonder was another current of emotion that swept through the crowd a current so powerful that haraldr had felt it swirl treacherously about him on every step of the procession fear the patriarch alexius waited on the porch of the hagia sophia flanked by the hundreds of priests and deacons who attended the great church wrapped in layers of tunics stoles robes and scarfs of embroidered bejewelled and enamelled silk the assembled clerics seemed like nothing less than a manyheaded treasure trove unlike his priests who were bareheaded alexius wore a towering crown of pearls gems and granulated gold beneath this miniature cathedral dome his black tiny eyes were so fierce that they actually seemed to disturb the air in front of his face creating a vortex that no man could enter without trembling michael shuddered visibly as he bent to kiss the jewelled reliquary suspended from a goldandruby chain around the patriarchs neck alexius led the entire procession into the mother church if i had been brought here my first day in the city haraldr thought as he entered i would have lost my reason the structure which seemed as solid as a great mountain from the outside was constructed of pure light and diaphanous colour on the inside to either side of the nave were two levels of massive columns transfigured by light into floating bands of mossy green and rose and carnelian where the columns should have spread to receive the weight of the structures above them they dissolved into a lacy embroidery of vines and leaves the vaults that floated on this sculptured foam were glimmering mosaic halos above the two towering arcades were walls pierced so extensively with windows that they seemed like great sheets of sunlight and above these walls suspended so loftily that its presence could only be felt not seen in its entirety was a dome as vast as the sky a pure golden canopy that seemed to float above the rest of the colossal interior for a moment haraldr had the vertiginous sense that he along with the rest of the church and everyone within was being lifted into the heavens by the dazzling light of christs being alexius walked towards the eastern terminus of the nave where an ovalshaped colonnaded tower a small cathedral in itself rose beneath the great dome like a peak surmounted by a golden sky from the vault within the tower a whiterobed boys choir filled the great church with high sonorous melodies alexius ascended the purpletinted marble steps to the platform atop the tower this lofty pulpit called an ambo was encircled with a balustrade of solid silver embossed with twining ivy and flowers set with sapphire stamens in the middle of the platform was a golden table upon which had been placed several folded goldembroidered scarlet silk garments alexius his voluminous sleeves billowing like clouds of powdered gems blessed the clothing in a deep chanting polyphony the parakoimomenos escorted michael to the golden table and assisted the caesardesignate into the garments first the eaglemedallioned robe then a mantle and finally a long scarflike pallium stiff with jewelled and cloisonne plaques during the ritual michael recited the prescribed prayers in a noticeably quavering voice the choir lifted a final soaring note that seemed to ascend directly to golden light above then fell silent there was a brief rustling as the ranks of assembled dignitaries composed themselves then the vast space became completely supernaturally silent as if all sound had been banished from the entire universe the sound of eternity haraldr told himself alexius moved as slowly as a dream his swathing of silk and gold coruscating like liquid light as he moved he lifted his own immense crown revealing thin matted silver hair placed the miniature jewelled dome on the altar table and took up a diamondandpearl diadem he stepped forward with the same unearthly deliberation and held the diadem high for all to see he glared over the massed courtiers almost as if he taunted them with his power over this symbol by the authority vested in me by christ crowned in heaven he chanted in extended harmonic syllables i bestow this crown on earth the ringing tones echoed and vanished in the light michael stepped forward his head bowed and his hands clasped in front of his breast alexius looked down upon michaels bare humbled head with a gaze so furious that haraldr wondered if he was about to strike the young man alexius held the diadem high above over michaels head motionless hovering a cluster of light waiting to raise the head beneath it to heaven above or throw him down into the fiery depths michaels shoulders began to tremble and the crowds tension became audible the cumulative sigh of hundreds of anxious inhalations the diadem plunged like an executioners blade almost miraculously halting a scant thumbs width above michaels unsteady head the patriarch gently placed the jewelled cap over michaels dark curls before michael had even raised his head organ music rolled through the vaults as if the dome of heaven had split open and unleashed the music of creation the audience thundered in response holy holy holy glory to god in the highest and on earth peace to all men may the caesar live long haraldr looked at michael kalaphates remembering the young man he had jested with at argyruss that man was dead resurrected as caesar of imperial rome already his face had been transfigured by the light perched above it it was as if the bones had somehow been realigned to give his face a sharpness a more powerful sense of structure his neck erect his entire body seeming to swell and rise with the deafening acclamations michael kalaphates caesar of the romans made the sign of the cross over romes glittering elite most of whom only a month ago had not even known his name alexius allowed the acclamations to fade and die before commencing the final ritual the silence was not so absolute as before the tension eased and somehow the patriarch seemed reduced in stature and vehemence almost wearily alexius returned to the altar table and with tentative fingers picked up a small sack fashioned from plain white silk he returned to michaels side and displayed the insignificant parcel to the court the lord marshals the armies of high heaven he chanted but all men are dust and ashes the silk sack was filled as mandated by custom passed down through the centuries of romes greatness with the ashes of a nameless pauper michael accepted this token of his mortality with steady hands he turned to descend and receive the homage of his court and as haraldr moved towards the new caesar to lead him down the steps their eyes met for a moment too long too piercing to be chance the caesar and the manglavite remained locked in some ineffable communication that their terrified souls would not permit them to understand it is a humiliation said mar angrily the men are looking forward to it haraldr shrugged it gives them an opportunity to go out into the city and make contact with the people i am certain they will have enough young winsome customers to make the effort worth their while even if they dont want the money look at them said mar pointing to the varangians who roamed the augustaion collecting the sanctified boughs branches and twigs that had ornamented the imperial coronation procession they alone had the franchise to sell these remarkably valuable relics in the city a custom established by the bulgarslayer first they are janitors then pedlars is this worthy for warriors it is simply a custom the men enjoy there are many ceremonial duties performed by the varangian guard that are not really warriors work i dont hear you object about those mars handsome mouth distorted and his nostrils flared perhaps it is time we do object when rome wishes to flaunt its might who marches ahead of all we do but when the senators and magisters and sacrum consistorum are dividing the proceeds of that power we in great part provide where are we we are picking up firewood like peasant women haraldr sighed inwardly steeling himself for another argument he and mar had for weeks now disagreed increasingly strenuously about how to deal with joannes in haraldrs opinion their alliance should be strictly defensive until the emperors true condition had been ascertained even mar hadnt seen the emperor for more than a month in spite of the rumours or perhaps because of them haraldr was certain that the powerfullooking man he had met could best any illness unless it was some sort of plague that would have long ago carried him off mar did not disagree with haraldrs prognosis of the emperors health but he wanted to confront the emperor when the coup against joannes had already been virtually completed but of course they had no plans for this coup because their accomplices so far consisted of only a few disgruntled minor officials to strike at joannes now would mean that a thousand varangians would have to go to war with virtually the entire roman empire haraldr looked around and lowered his voice i dont think it is wise to be discussing your discontent with the dhynatoi and their accomplices in a public square why draw attention mar stuck his finger in haraldrs chest i dont want you to think i am threatening you he hissed but you are haraldr sigurdarson rightful heir to norway you should be sitting on a throne instead of polishing someone elses but now you seem only too happy to be joanness servant you urge caution at every turn let us see if the emperor recovers now it is let us see if this caesar turns out to be as pliable as joannes would hope you always have a reason to hold back what alliances have you brought us you yourself said this caesar interests you that was before joannes bought him with a crown and i am working on the most important alliance we could possibly have and when i have enlisted this confederate you are going to have to prove that your bluster is backed up by hunland steel well i certainly intend to wait and see what this miracle alliance is i hope it is someone more important than that clerk in the magnara who is able to tell us when joannes arrives in the morning and little else haraldr looked around again but i dont think this is the place to discuss this and when will we discuss it since you are always off ploughing your woman your value as an ally has become virtually nil since you took up with maria this was another theme mar had begun to carp on with constant jests and cryptic allusions about haraldrs lover was he jealous maria has encouraged me to pursue our cause if you will remember that was once the source of a considerable misunderstanding between us well now she is taking the opposite tack a month ago you were cautious since you started fucking her you are submissive when she changes her mind again will you rush over to the magnara and try to assassinate joannes and get us all killed that woman is dangerous to you and to me mar poked his finger in haraldrs chest again you argue with joannes mar lowered his voice over maria and he sends you to the studion you are fortunate he permitted you to leave neorion now with the entire middle hetairia stuck in the studion we have no chance of a joint defence if joannes orders the imperial taghmata to move against us and you are going to lose men in there trying to police those miserable swine a lot more than you think the studion is going to swallow you up and joannes knows that i think i can advance our purpose in the studion this was another area of disagreement haraldr was convinced that the citys wretched poor were valuable allies and mar completely discounted them mar looked skywards for assistance yes out among the people that has become your special folly that and maria you are a fool for that woman and you are only beginning to dance the fools ditty she will break you do you think you are the first haraldr glared but not with righteous denial he had heard many of the stories and she had never denied the substance of any of them nor had she apologized for them i know about her why bring that up because the crow shit she drops on your head is going to get in my hair as well i have known her much longer than you have you are merely a lull in the tempest has she ever told you about us yes but he didnt know really and the thought sickened him far more than any of the others she said she has known you for some time you were close once i did not ask dont worry i didnt fuck her to be truthful with you i thought she was mad she was even wilder then she had such rage real rage in a way that odin would understand she wanted me to punish her really i do not mind admitting that i often enjoy punishing men but not women i have never struck a lover you have never had a lover that i have seen said haraldr before he had time to regret the words mars hand was on his throat the force was so great and immediate that haraldr thought his windpipe would instantly collapse almost as quickly mar took his hand away and looked around to see if anyone had been watching his eyes were a murderous glacier blue dont overestimate your usefulness prince of norway he hissed then turned and stumped off joannes stroked the neck of his snorting black stallion i hope it pleases you nephew he shouted to michael kalaphates michael craned his head to look up at the peristyle entrance of his new palace it is magnificent uncle so hellenic what do you think uncle constantines horse clambered over the marble porch it is indeed magnificent sir it reminds me of antioch out here you can open the entrance up with a freedom that is not afforded in the city well done brother it is a palace fit for a caesar michael reined his gleaming white arabian round and looked east towards the golden horn the natural harbour that flanked constantinople on the north the great buildings of the surrounding cities were sparkling miniatures from this vantage and the ships that crowded the narrow waterway seemed like expertly painted little toys his new residence which looked much like an ancient pagan temple with its twostorey peristyle and clean rectangular shape was surrounded with beautiful cypress groves and a vast woodland park for hunting the closest building other than his own stables and servants complex was another ivorywhite palace set on a gentle green promontory about twenty stades away and although the caesar did not know it not considerably farther away was the country palace of the augusta theodora the three men dismounted joannes signalled to the retinue waiting on a paved road that ascended the hill in gradual loops the hundreds of grooms chamberlains guards cooks wardrobe masters huntsmen and priests filed past in yet another procession to the glory of the new caesar grooms arrived to take the horses but joannes waved off the boy assigned to his stallion and continued to hold the jittery horses bit i must return to the palace as you know how much of the burden now falls on my shoulders i simply wanted to see you settled and know that you will be happy here uncle i am delirious said michael doffing his scarlet bonnet in respect i only wish that your solicitude for my comfort had not inspired you to place me so far from the arduous toils and manifold concerns of the imperial palace for to help you heft the burdens of our beloved empire would in some small way relieve the enormous incumbency of gratitude your copious generosity has placed within my breast as surpassingly splendid as these comforts are it would equally gladden my heart to know that i could be immediately yea instantaneously at my uncles summon should he need even the merest assistance this is where i need you nephew resting contemplating building the reservoirs of strength and wisdom that you will need for the sake of all rome should you ever be required to wear the imperial buskins like the worthy stylite perched atop his column who praises the lord with his utter immobility your service is in your patience and sedentary devotion as precious to the pantocrator as the bustling about of all the imperial taghmata now nephew brother i must bid you farewell and leave you to the pleasures your father and i have long sought for you michael and constantine watched joannes pound off on his powerful stallion then walked through the bronze doors of the residence admired the fountains in the inner courtyard and found a small reception room that had only one door constantine looked about in the hall before he quietly shut the door behind him can you trust any of the servants asked constantine in a low voice yes said michael his scarlet boot distractedly nudged a ramshaped bronze lamp set on the small marble hearth i brought my old cook ergodotes and made him a vestitore i am certain he is reliable good you have someone who can get information in and out have i not you as well michael seemed surprised constantine cleared his throat i had rather hoped you might ask me to live here with you uncle michael beamed and embraced his uncle of course i had not even dared to suggest you join my luxurious exile you will make this elegant incarceration not only tolerable but also amusing and perhaps productive the shadow crossed michaels face again yes what concerns me now is that our father might recover sufficiently if only temporarily to regret his acquiescence to joanness scheme then michael looked at constantine with vulnerable pleading eyes this situation is more dangerous than i had expected i am a decoration so to speak that could quickly become unfashionable michael erupted and viciously kicked the head off the bronze lamp damn him damn him we will be his hostages as long as he lives michaels face was crimson and his eyes had a curious opaque glaze he exhaled sharply through his nostrils twice in rapid sequence i have been considering a plan along with an associate of mine it is quite dangerous i will understand if you wish to hear no more of it constantine opened the door quietly and checked outside in the hall then came back in the room his forehead was perspiring but there was grim purpose in the set of his jaw they took the manhood from between my legs he said softly they did not take the manhood from here he thumped his welllarded chest tell me about this plan blood blood the girl stood as naked as eve and shook her dirty burlap tunic in ulfrs face she spat made a punching motion with her fist then pointed at askil eldjarnson and rattled off a string of words that ulfr guessed he wouldnt have known even if his greek was as good as haraldrs he did recognize one of the words however rape ulfr looked down at the shrieking gesticulating girl she had greasy brown hair and teeth like a glacier rift another word he could understand virgin she pounded on askils chest and spat in his face look at her komes ulfr said askil calmly but mournfully she has lice and breasts like kneecaps the gangly thinfaced icelander spread his hands in a gesture of incredulity if a man visits the butcher why would he pay for the meat and steal the entrails ulfr nodded sympathetically the girl was sixteen if a day and if there was a woman of sixteen summers in the studion who was still a virgin whether she wanted to be or not she deserved to be appointed one of these christian saints blood had been smeared on her tunic and around her pubic area in an improbable quantity she was saying she had been raped not sacrificed to odin ulfr guessed she was a precociously shrewd whore with a clever new cheat he would tell the men to watch out for yet another studion snare varangian devils yelled another woman a toothless sootfaced hag of indeterminate age devil sent you devil take you back ulfr could not understand everything shouted by a burly man with a dirty rag over one eye but the essence of it was that in addition to raping children varangians also fornicated with the emperor ulfr looked around more than a dozen people had congregated most looking on silently with sullen flickering eyes something was wrong people in the studion wouldnt assemble on a filthy street corner in the dead of night to involve themselves in an ordinary misery like the putative rape of a young woman and the younger men six seven of them were too well fed to be from the sounding blocks they were professional troublerousers from down near the seawall not the ragged beggars and petty thieves that afflicted this area im going to pay her something for her virtue said ulfr to askil in norse he had reached inside his wallet for a coin when a swaggering swarthy young man of no more than twentyfive walked up and put his arm around the girl and said i am her father ulfr nodded at the word father and smiled sardonically very well he produced a copper follis and held it out to the man the girl swatted it away silver shouted the father who now caressed his alleged daughters bare flank ulfr deliberated his instinct was to offer hunland steel as payment due this impudent little thug or better still break him with his bare hands but he remembered what haraldr said about how cheap trouble was in the studion and how dear the cost might be to put an end to it if it ever got out of control he produced a silver nomismata the girl snatched the coin and ran off vanishing so quickly into the putrid shadows that it was as if she had never existed her father stood openmouthed for a moment and then scurried off in search of her ulfr looked at the crowd and told them in greek to be off the burly man the old hag and two others went growling and mumbling into the night ulfr noticed that the band of toughs had swelled to a dozen he was just about to tell askil to unsheath his long sword a motion and a blur from the crowd askil grunted and fell to his knees and the stone plopped on the fetid pavement at his feet ulfr brought his long sword shrieking out of the sheath he had no recourse they had been attacked and now they had to kill or the life a varangian would not be worth the dung on the streets of studion ulfr studied the flashing blades that now ringed him knives no swords no armour no spears he asked odin to guide him to the most deserving victim and instantly whirred his blade halfway through the neck of one of the tallest toughs the rest looked at the gushing twitching body and reconsidered their boldness askil was on his feet his long sword unsheathed he charged and scattered half a dozen into the night the rest backed away slowly from ulfr jabbing their knives futilely like performers in a mime one of them yelled something about varangians who slept with goats ergodotes former cook and newly appointed vestitore to the imperial caesar michael kalaphates stabled his mule in the courtyard of the little inn on the outskirts of the venetian quarter his principal concern on this night was the unsavoury proximity to foreigners these venetian sailors were scoundrels at the least and most likely carried plagues that would make a healthy body rot like a melon left out in the sun well they probably wouldnt be up this far unless they ran out of rats and dogs to eat down where they were as far as the other socalled danger was concerned why worry he was now the trusted servant of a demigod out on the lords good business for his holy master ergodotes flipped a copper coin at the stable boy strolled behind the inn and identified the entrance to which he had been directed the house behind the inn was a curious ruin perhaps an old chapel of which only the basement remained the plaster was completely peeled off and only the bare bricks set with thick courses of crumbling mortar remained the wooden roof stuck on top of this decaying foundation was of much more recent vintage than the brick walls but was not in considerably better condition the door was solid and new though sturdy oak studded with iron braces and nails ergodotes knocked three times waited then knocked once ergodotes thought he would collapse from the stench when the door was opened he assumed the occupant must live atop a sewer or never discarded his own slops and the shrieking and howling quite unnerved him come in before the demons snatch you the man inside chortled he was short fantastically obese with a head as smooth and round as a marble sphere this sphere pivoted back and forth on his neck as if run by some sort of clockwork mechanism come in here the fat man chortled again as if even his most mundane pronouncement were a source of great mirth he waddled through the small dark vestibule of the dwelling his stained tunic out before his stupendous belly like the sail of a genoese merchantman the main room resembled the factory of a chemist or pharmacologist a complex jumble of vials jars bowls mortars and pestles with all sorts of dried and fresh leaves berries chunks of rock and dried mushrooms scattered among the utensils jars of reptiles stood in rows against one wall and against the opposite wall were wicker cages full of howling monkeys well you knew the street you knew the knock you knew this was me because who else would be here the fat man chortled yet again he needed to squat only about a palms width in order to seat his amorphous rump upon a backless chair lets hear who you are and what you want ergodotes explained his mission when he had finished the fat man whistled a tune for some time his head swivelling periodically thats a big one he finally said for the first time looking crestfallen but id like to add him to my collection youre certain i would he laughed wildly and the monkeys went into virtual hysterics in response when did you say youd bring the money ergodotes finalized the details getting a lengthy chuckling discussion of how the poison would work and how his specialist would deliver it to the acquisition one thing asked ergodotes when he was satisfied that everything else had been taken care of how do we stop if we must change our plans you cant do that said the fat man howling as if it were the funniest thing he had said all night provocations said haraldr four incidents last night yours and two others already tonight he looked at ulfr searchingly there is a plan here well theyre getting nowhere said ulfr was anyone hurt tonight other than the ache in askils head hedin had his leg cut said haraldr thats what concerns me that there is no apparent reason for these quarrels ulfr the studion is like no place we have ever known the palace for all its splendour and vastness is like a court in the north only more complex the studion is like a dense almost impenetrable forest with its own laws its own warnings its various hidden lives that can suddenly appear to challenge ones own he pointed down the street at a vista of towering brutely simple brick buildings ramshackle balconies reeking lanes and wretches sleeping on the streets they are doing something out there and we dont know what but we are certainly part of it the caesar looked out on his empire a doe loped into a clearing and then darted back into the thick brush on the golden horn the sails were like bits of coloured paper michael turned away from the window when will he do it he says tomorrow night replied ergodotes he did not think it would be difficult to arrange since i had given him most of the information he needed michael recoiled from the sharp pain in his stomach was he moving too precipitously did he need more time to contemplate to prepare then he remembered no felt in his belly almost as if a woman had grasped his manhood that moment in the hagia sophia the moment that had transfigured him the moment that seemed like a thousand times the ecstasy of an ejaculation a thousand thousand times more than the exhilaration of a wager won a sensation that wrapped the soul like the arms and legs of helen who drove the stronggreaved achaians across the water to troy that sensation would never release him the beauty the light the chords of pure sound the godliness god hadnt there been a moment as the chants of romes dignitaries rose to beseech the dome of heaven when the pantocrator had answered yes yes there truly had been only if a man had been there could he know this even believe this and how many men had ever stood where he had stood that day the pantocrator already moved his caesars hand was not that clear yes the caesar could not move fast enough now had not god created all of this in scant days and as god was present at his creation so the caesar would need to be there when his creation began he was caesar heir to the lords of both the old and new romes he would look in the dying eyes of the man who denied him his indescribable passion his eternity his soul of pure light and damn him to the tomb where the voices of the adoring multitude were for ever silent ergodotes said michael tell the centurion of my guard that i am to be escorted into the city tomorrow yes majesty ergodotes withdrew with his hands crossed over his breast he had reached the door before michael remembered with a jolt the detail he had neglected ergodotes he whispered coming close where will it be ergodotes stepped back in the room closed the door and told his caesar the secret the new moon floated over the studion her full lustrous serenity a mockery of the squalid world below the bonfire had been set at a crossroads and the flames cast an orange glow on the surrounding facades and down the four arms of the streets turning the intersection into a fiery crucifix the young man had stripped off his tunic and stood in a dirty loincloth his bare buttocks tensed he let out a whoop and dashed towards the pyre of burning boards and branches just when it seemed he would plunge into the flames he lifted throwing his arms skywards and pulling his legs up he hurtled through the raging tongues and rolled into a ball when he landed on the other side after he had popped back to his feet he was given a drink of wine from a clay jar his friends pounded his back and two young girls threw their arms around him and kissed him the crowd cheered and another young man stripped off his tunic and prepared to take his leap i dont like it said haraldr i dont like anything in this studion said ulfr but of all i have seen this least offends the gods at least there is some joy in this they say it is an old pagan custom to leap over the fires on the new moon haraldr looked down the long blocks of misery another fire blazed at an intersection five blocks away look at these he said pointing to two ponderous listing enclosed wooden balconies that met over the street and were saved from collapse only by their mutual buttressing this is why elsewhere in the city the logothete enforces the separation of balconies by at least four fathoms here one spark could turn the entire studion into a pyre perhaps that is why the regulations are not enforced here said ulfr i am certain that is the reason trouble ulfr pointed to the distant intersection where the second fire blazed the crowd perhaps sixty men women and children seemed to have been sucked in around a single scuffling vortex shall i call for a decurion no well go down there haraldr had the notion that the worse the odds against the varangians the less likely these people would attack them two varangians against sixty or a hundred reinforced the notion that the fairhairs had supernatural powers a decurion and his squad of ten might make the norsemen seem like mere mortals by the time haraldr and ulfr reached the crowd the agitation had ceased and the group almost seemed to be waiting obediently for the varangians the desperate dirty faces even backed away to form a little cordon this is one of them said a rheumyeyed man of about thirty he shoved forward a scowling curly blondhaired youth about a dozen years younger than himself the boy had cuts on his lips and eye blood spilled over his sparsely bearded chin the crowd erupted into a blizzard of accusations arms raised hands waving haraldr salvaged a few words from the hurricane of shrieking voices apparently a number of the youths accomplices had thrown things at the crowd in order to distract them the youth had then either purloined some clothing or fondled some women or both nonsense thought haraldr these were not crimes in the studion what was really going on here he nodded to ulfr to be ready the crowd continued to protest finally the rheumyeyed man grabbed haraldrs arm and pointed skywards the tenement rose eight perhaps even nine storeys from the street and the fire had been set on top of the highest balcony just below the peaked wooden roof small figures gestured against the glow and suddenly embers showered down a large blazing coal plunged right into the middle of the crowd and everyone scattered only adding to the chaos of oaths now haraldr understood the alarm as miserable as it was studion was home for these wretches and up above them in the night were the seeds of studions destruction ulfr grab some of the more able men haraldr grasped the tunic of the rheumyeyed man and pulled him along the man understood and signalled to four of his friends another group of six or so young men followed ulfr into the tenement the dingy smokestained building reeked of human waste the stairs were narrow wooden slats with frequent gaps at the third landing a little boy sat deftly skinning a small rodent with a sharpened tile the halls were grim and bare but surprisingly free of rubbish apparently the tenants threw everything into the street in the hall extending off the ninth landing two young men their tunics pulled up engaged in sex haraldr shoved the lovers aside and pushed the door at the end of the hall open at least a dozen more young men sat on a bare wooden floor passing wine jars and shouting at each other a naked woman straddled one of them they seemed curiously unawed by the giant fairhair crashing in on them stay stay stay shouted haraldr waving his short sword if you rise your legs will be cut off he shouted at ulfr to enforce the order and looked out at the balcony the arch that opened into the wooden structure had crumbled so that the balcony seemed more like an extension of the room the fire had just burned through the ceiling of the balcony and was now kindling on the floor get their tunics yelled haraldr he assumed that no water was to be found in the building and that the best recourse would be to smother the flames get them off ulfr directed his helpers to collect the coarse burlap garments a youth leapt and lunged at one of the rhuemyeyed mans friends in an instant all was bloody chaos ulfr held back not knowing who was friend or foe too late he discovered that their only allies had been the rheumyeyed man and his four friends the youths who had already been in the room and the six who had followed ulfr quickly stabbed and bludgeoned them to the floor haraldr did not hesitate his sword cut down four of the youths before the rest squeezed out of the door the woman remained in the corner with a wine jar clutched to her breast haraldr hesitated his instinct telling him to get out but he looked at the twitching corpse of the rheumyeyed man and his dead or dying friends one moaned pitiably flopping like a wounded seal in his bloodsoaked tunic and decided he owed the people of studion this chance lets get their cloaks he shouted to ulfr the balcony exploded and spat embers and searing drops of pitch which had apparently been used to ignite it a fiery curtain forced haraldr back towards the door ulfr shouted and haraldr turned the hallway was a furnace the floor awash with blazing pitch haraldr looked about at blank windowless walls and knew that here in this terrible place that offended the gods he had finally lost odins favour you are not the man i usually deal with they told me to expect you said the cephalonian socalled because he came from the island of cephalonia off the west coast of hellas not far from athens the cephalonian had hellenic colouring the blond hair and light eyes but he was no apollo or hermes in fact there was little about him that was memorable in a crowd someone would walk past him and never remember that they had seen him indeed so the eunuch who addressed the cephalonian was young still encumbered with a babys fat with puffy red cheeks and a sneering manner just who did they tell you to expect he looked around at the candlelit vats and tubs of the small medicinal soap factory wrinkling his nose at the astringent smell they told me to expect the orphanotrophus joanness chamberlain the cephalonian looked at the eunuch as if sizing him up then allowed his expression to indicate that he was impressed with what he saw thats what i was told the chamberlain himself which has to be you sir from the look and manner of your eminence the eunuch who was in fact a mere cubicularias a glorified janitor to the orphanotrophus joannes tried not to look too pleased indeed he attempted to harshen his demeanour well then man they must have told you what i have come for he snapped that too eminence the cephalonian wiped his hands on his tunic and went to a long low shelf at the far end of the room he came back with a little wooden box and displayed it to the eunuch just manufactured this morning special as he likes it be assured that the ingredient still has its pharmacological properties intact the cephalonian opened the box and let the eunuch inspect the foulsmelling piece of soap laden with special unguents to treat an eczema that afflicted the orphanotrophus joannes i dont imagine i need to tell your eminence not to let anyone else use this the eunuch appraised the cephalonian as if he were some kind of lesser lifeform his lips curled contemptuously surely you dont think we are operating a public bath do you man the smoke would kill them before the flame then something perhaps odin directed haraldrs attention upward the roof beams ulfr he shouted his sword already poised the two norsemen hacked as they never had in battle but the exertion was suffocating them the smoke pouring into their lungs a muffled crack preceded a stunning cascade of timbers and tiles not just the ceiling but the pitched roof of the entire building apparently had been supported by the beams air rushed in briefly reprieved their lungs and then fanned the blazing pitch where mumbled ulfr his head was gashed and he seemed disoriented haraldr glimpsed the moon through the rising smoke the remains of the roof rose above him like a tiled cliff ulfr we have to climb he scrambled over the tiles with desperate agility and clung to the peak of the roof ulfr almost slid to the street but also attained the precarious perch to the east the lights of the city ran beyond vision beneath them extending south to the seawall and west to the land wall the entire studion had erupted into regularly spaced conflagrations not merely at the street corners but also in dozens of tenements like this theyre burning it shouted haraldr the flames erupted through the tiles and collapsed another section of the roof the choking smoke thickened and obscured the terrible lights of the studion haraldr crept like a fourlegged spider down the eastward pitch of the roof he yelled up at ulfr balconies ulfr inched his way down and propped his feet on the cornice the roof of the balcony below was on fire well probably fall through the burning timbers until we hit a floor or ceiling that isnt on fire said haraldr odin has told you this asked ulfr what if theyre all on fire then we will not need a funeral pyre ulfr nodded i have been ready to die with you more than once he crouched on the cornice and prepared to jump i will see that a warm bench is waiting for you in the valhol he shouted and then he plunged feet first into the inferno haraldr held his breath he fell almost without impact through the roof of the balcony and felt only a slight scraping as he hurtled through the floor almost as soon as he knew that he had crashed through the next roof his fall ended with sudden impact and he felt a pain in his ankle the flames were all around him he smelled his hair singe he rolled towards the adjoining room the choking air seemed cool he sat up and slapped at his smouldering cloak ulfr squatted on his haunches looking at him ulfr and haraldr descended the stairs shouting to warn the tenants as they passed each landing the street was entirely deserted no onlookers no panicked residents scurrying out with their meagre belongings they saw someone running in the next block behind the flailing figure a wooden hovel several storeys high was almost entirely consumed by flames the upper storeys of the tenement they had just escaped were a blazing crown the building resembled a giant torch thrust into the night embers showered down ulfr shook his head what you said is right the studion is like no other place huge timbers fractured and plunged flaming to the street haraldr and ulfr ran west through an intersection to escape the falling debris they encountered no one it was as if the devils had claimed all the souls of the studion and were now razing it with fire ahead of them the wooden building they had seen from a distance collapsed with an explosive whoosh and blocked the street they went back skirted the burning tenement they had just escaped and proceeded north no side streets intersected this thoroughfare for several blocks and there were no fires up ahead the toughs came out of the shadows like silent dark spirits maybe twenty but no apparent spear shafts haraldr observed calmly the spear was the only weapon that could reach him before his sword could reach the man who wielded it haraldr unsheathed his sword too much killing this night he said grimly the sound of timbers cracking punctuated the enormous sibilation of the flames at their backs the toughs formed a blockade haraldr held the hunland steel high so that they could all see it well charge them he told ulfr the toughs scattered before haraldr had got within a dozen ells of them they jittered like anxious dogs for a moment before the shadows pulled them back into their lairs two blocks south the entire crown of a tenement fell into the street with a tremendous roar and flash of light haraldr and ulfr turned to watch for a moment then continued north haraldr rubbed his smokefouled eyes he thought of bathing he thought of the next time he would hold maria and feel her silk next to his skin he could no longer save the studion but odin had given him another day he was suddenly quite weary where was a side street they needed to turn east the street ahead shimmered the flames behind them soughed like a great wind and embers floated past the street was moving haraldr felt as if his legs had vanished his bowels iced odin clever tricky odin the prankster the street ahead was alive with people not hundreds but thousands backed up for blocks a crowd like that on the mese for the coronation of the caesar but this crowd was different bristling with shafts sticking up among it like the spikes of a sea urchin spears hundreds of spears nephew i was told you waited on me how gracious of you to point that out thought michael kalaphates since i have been waiting here in your antechamber since the third hour of the night and it is now the eighth hour of the night it is quite late nephew said joannes perhaps i was too strident in my previous criticism of your industry or lack thereof since you have attained your lofty dignity you perhaps allowed the pendulum to pivot too far in the direction of application it wearies me simply to observe the hours you obviously now devote to affairs of state my profound apologies if i have momentarily deterred you from your verily unceasing pursuit of our empires concerns uncle but i did have a matter of grave import to discuss indeed joanness sluglike lower lip lapped over his thin upper one i had rather hoped to insulate you from grave matters as your health is so precious to me as yours is to me uncle michael paused i have heard rumours of a plot it is not possible to walk beneath the chalke gate without hearing rumours of a plot nephew said joannes with deliberate weariness in his deep growling voice i believe it is as much as it tortures my very soul even to contemplate the words a plot against you my dearest uncle joanness deeply socketed eyes rolled towards michael like the swivelling spouts of an imperial dhromon let us not carry this amusement further nephew a lightning bolt crashed inside michaels skull joannes showed his awful teeth i know constantine is your favourite uncle you are both equally dear michael somehow replied he was numb with relief and fear the fear of a possibility he had never considered it had been a mistake to come here tonight sheer hubris no it was not possible that joannes could know well nephew i am touched by your sincere concern for my welfare but as i am most weary of as you so graciously phrase it my unceasing labours on behalf of the state i would like to bathe first i see no possibility of assassins lurking in my bath however customary such venues have become for murders of all sorts and even palace coups i would like to think that my demise would require more imagination on the part of the miscreant joanness chamberlain opened the door to a hallway as joannes stepped beneath the lintel he whirled dramatically and faced michael you have whetted my curiosity nephew why dont you join me in my baths and tell me of the imminence of this danger to my person haraldr looked south flaming wreckage completely blocked the street it doesnt matter he said to ulfr as he turned back to face the mob they have seen us we cannot let them know that we are afraid of them or the lives of my pledgemen will be worth nothing on these streets ulfr drew his sword an axe age a sword age the ravens will drink well tonight and this mob will soon know with how many lives the corpse of a varangian is purchased no ulfr looked at haraldr incredulously not yet haraldr unbuckled his breastplate and sword belt took off his helm and cloak and handed all of his weapons to ulfr odin permitted me this once before he said my friend ulfr trailed off there was no use protesting haraldr had made too many mad ruses work in the past but for a varangian to perish unarmed a prisoner perhaps tortured was a fate literally worse than death his bench in the valhol would wait empty until the last dragon flew i wont deny you your place at the benches said haraldr if they come at you take up your sword and summon the birds of death but wait patiently for my return i may be gone for some time haraldr walked towards the mob stripped of the badges of the feared varangians he felt strangely free and yet terribly frightened as well almost like a man in the middle of some prodigious dive he could hear no voices above the fire storms he came within spear range and for a moment wondered what it would feel like to have steel thud into his unprotected sternum the faces had the frightening uniformity of misery pale deep eyes mournful lips angry jaws men many women as well burlap cheap tattered linen rags stringy filthy hair scars sores a cleft palate a man on bare stumps they shifted as he approached their silence as awesome as the stillness in the mother church a middleaged woman came forward and stood a step in front of the rest vividly haraldr saw the hound at stiklestad that step beyond the howling wall and his brothers last steps why are you burning the studion she demanded her eyes flashing she had a long worn face a face that never had had a chance at beauty and was now past the age for it haraldr was stunned and then he realized what she meant of course two birds with one arrow joannes had ordered the studion burned and knew that the people would attack the varangians as the agents of that calamity we varangians did not set these fires the crowd erupted as angry as a tempest fists shook and spears bobbed up and down the woman screamed over her comrades see what they think of your lies the crowd seemed to lift her towards haraldr his pagan roots surfaced and he feared the spirit world he would enter without his sword christ he wondered where are you will you receive me in your paradise if i am denied the valhol they were around him the white heat of death he was clawed and punched and the woman was pushed into him she glared up with gritted decayed teeth is there another reason why you should not die varangian she shrieked he looked at her eyes thinking she was not the face of the valkyrja he had imagined and spoke the words that needed no prompting from any god the blue star the womans hatefilled eyes were suddenly as wondering as a childs she thrust her arms into the air screamed and began to push the crowd back the mob slowly quieted until the huge flames that were consuming their homes could be heard again what business do you have with the blue star i want to plead my case to convince the blue star that we varangians did not fire the studion i think i know who did order this the woman stepped back and studied haraldr for a moment then she shrugged and led him through the crowd haraldr looked out across the expanse of faces feeling another kind of roman power far different from the power he had felt at the coronation of the caesar but perhaps in a strange way greater and he knew in that moment that the two powers of the great city would some day come to a bloody reckoning as haraldr had suspected the blue star was among his flock herding them from behind his bulky form towering above the rest his shelflike beard jutting out proudly haraldr looked at the silly silken little henchmen beside their leader and wondered if he had done the right thing in so boldly confronting this very petty street prince so you want to see the blue star said the big man he held up his hand so that the sapphire ring was visible haraldr nodded the mans manner convinced him he had made his final mistake in the middle realm the blue star looked at haraldr for a moment and dipped his head that was the last thing haraldr saw the blue star nodding at him naked joannes gave credence to the bogomilist heresy that man was created in the image of satanael not god the smooth hairless white wax skin draped a demonically distorted form the great swelling knees and elbows the breastbone that curved like the chest of an enormous featherless bird the penis a solitary pathetic little pod dangling beneath an immense shovellike pelvis a torturous embroidery of scarlet eczema ran from his wrists to the shoulders of each arm i do not like to stay long in the dry heat said joannes he seemed curiously at ease he slumped against the marble bench and languidly waved his grotesque hand through the mist of steam the wet heat does not deprive the skin of its oils michael looked at the mosaic that circuited the walls of the steam room joanness apartments were in one of the oldest buildings in the palace complex constructed in a time when different fashions and canons of beauty had prevailed like this mosaic a woman and man walked before a graceful portico the architecture convincing in its substance the human forms swelling with the glories of the flesh the green and gold leaves behind the buildings almost rustling with the breeze it reminded michael of antioch where ancient revelries of the flesh were still redolent in the hot nights how different from todays rome the harsh attenuated forms one saw in art the airless ether that allowed only the spirit not the flesh to breathe he looked at his uncle joanness deep sockets were blank lids folded over the deadly irises what could he know of old rome him with his tiny vestigial penis his blind disregard for the beauty and splendour around him why did he then live amid the echoes of a pagan world he could never touch even in his imagination that was obvious during his residence in the cenobium joannes had come to despise the church and even its symbols and that was why the pantocrator his voice rising among the hosannas of the seraphim in the hagia sophia had decreed that joannes a monk without faith should die uncle i am quite wilted may i wait for you in the steam room joannes nodded assent his eyes still closed his huge head lolling even the sevenheaded beast has its moment of repose thought michael he rose and entered the large vault that contained both the warm tub for washing and the cold pool for swimming lit by candelabra the mosaics around the wall all secular scenes took on a sacredness and michael knew that even in this place the pantocrator was still with him guiding him he saw the wooden box on the broad marble rim of the tub how clever the foolish conspirator would have brought the soap as an offering but this was so subtle so intricate the caesar was clever enough to rule rome this was proof even if joannes did suspect him he would never anticipate this strangulation perhaps or a knife concealed in a towel fool when joannes was dying he would have the moment to know he had been a fool to look into the laughing eyes that had cast him into the fiery lakes michael entered the pool yes stay at a distance when the convulsions begin summon the servants he will be seen to die untouched the water was so vitalizing made him feel so alert he stroked and floated would they crown him again yes they would have to no longer merely the caesar but emperor basileus autocrator his hand in that of the pantocrator michael found himself growing erect he fondled his stiffening penis and enjoyed the silky surreptitious thrill he remembered as he often did how his father had hit him for that when he had found the caesar michael had always been the caesar wasnt that clear just as the christ had always been the lord touching himself at the public bath in amastris the filthy cheap one they had to go to carrying their own pails and greasy soap and dirty linen towels not simply beat him his pitchstinking fist crashing into the caesars face his father had told the men at the shipyard and they had held him over the nauseating vat of caulking pitch and told him they were going to burn it off and then they had tarred it his father and those men had tarred it so that he could not touch it it had not burned off like his uncles like they had said it would but it had burned and the caesar had run home and told his mother he and the pantocrator so loved their mothers they were so alike in that and she had taken him to the baths and sponged him herself as she had when he was smaller and she had touched it again and again and cleansed it and she had not let his father put his stinking hands on her after that never again the caesar stroked himself and realized that once he had destroyed joannes the pantocrator wanted him to destroy his father nephew i am ready to hear of this plot joannes settled himself into the long rectangular marble tub this tub is not sufficiently deep he said it was made for smaller men you would find it comfortable yes but i will not have need of your apartments uncle replied michael in his own silent reverie i will sleep on the imperial couch with my mother who is it that poses this threat to me the conspirators were not named uncle but the attempt is known in some detail the vlach cheese you are so fond of is to have a poison introduced indeed this may be a mere charade but would it not be prudent to avoid this cheese until more is known our holy empire can hardly afford the loss of its most devoted servant because of tainted cheese yes rumbled joannes he splashed water over his torso and then opened the lid of his soap box i think we affront providence if we take lightly such warnings even if only founded on hearsay you have shown prudence nephew a quality i had not thought previously to ascribe to you perhaps we should discuss enabling you to attend to some duties of state joannes removed the soap from the box and studied it for a moment the prospect lightens my heart said michael his heart racing and his arms trembling beneath the water joannes dipped the soap in the water and lathered the small yellowish tallowy brick in his hands this soap is my most sinful luxury while i am certain that the pantocrator has scourged my skin with this eczema to instruct me in christlike humility i am tempted beyond redemption by the soothing properties of the emollient ingredient a chemist skilled in pharmacology prepares this especially for me each day this was just delivered this very night i quite forget all cares when it relieves the torment of my affliction michael was so cold he thought his teeth would chatter why does he go on so much unless he knows but why does he lather the soap if he knows it is a deadly poison joannes began salving the lather over the purple blotches on his left arm michael was astounded by the surge in his loins in a moment he might ejaculate yes nephew one can grow dangerously complacent at the word poison as one is constantly besieged by such threats and as so many clumsy hands so to speak have sought to emulate the poisoners art ice spread from the nape of michaels neck down his back was it too late to stop it what if the ingredient only made him ill if he knew how could he go on lathering no it would work caesar emperor basileus autocrator light of the world his hand in that of the pantocrator yes the science of toxicity which has an undeniable social utility has few truly learned practitioners there is one specialist however who has advised me on the use of certain paralytics that are useful in interrogation i consider him the one true artist in his field though you would not find him aesthetically pleasing in his own right he is an immensely fat man there in centuriesold baths where pagans gambolled in an ancient yellow glow the pantocrator spoke to michael kalaphates as he had beneath the limitless golden dome of hagia sophia save yourself as i forgave from the excruciations upon my cross so i shall ask the father that you be forgiven uncle uncle uncle michael shrieked like a dying beast and thrashed from the pool and fell to his knees beside the marble tub his naked back as wet and trembling as a newborn foal save yourself oh theotokos save yourself the soap is poisoned michael seized the lathered lump from his uncles hands clutched at it desperately and lost it to the floor oh uncle uncle uncle i would sooner die myself i will die myself oh theotokos oh uncle he wailed desperately like a widow keening and with his face to the opussectile pavement shoved the soap into his mouth his limbs mad flailing the tentacles of an octopus pulled from the depths to die on a rock the scent of his urine mixed with the foul fatal bitterness of the soap joannes stood above him terrible in his nakedness he extended his distorted arms a demon retrieving a soul from the very bosom of the christ he grasped his nephews hair and jerked back michaels neck twisted and his terrified eyes rolled to gaze into the face of death joannes snatched the soap from michaels foaming jaws and threw it into the pool the soap is not poisoned nephew i will not be dead as soon as you would hope nor unfortunately will you your soul will be taken piece by piece according to the schedule i set in the neorion joannes wedged his knee into michaels back and pulled harder on his hair you might mercifully accelerate that schedule by telling me who is in this with you michael kalaphates caesar of rome stared ahead into the darkness and saw the fading golden arms of the pantocrator begin to reach out to him again the slut he screamed the slut commanded me to do it let him see me now said the womans voice she was not the same woman he had spoken to in the crowd this womans voice was calm grandmotherly but with a timbre of great authority haraldrs hands ached but his head was clear the blow had not concussed him only blackened his vision for a few moments and brought him to his knees the thugs had been able to tie his hands and feet and slip several cloth sacks over his head thrown into a cart of some sort a blanket or carpet over him he had jolted over the streets for half an hour he had heard the faint whoosh of flames some distant shouting animal noises the can had turned many times the sacks were slipped off his head and haraldr blinked into the torchlight he was seated on the floor in a small neatly kept room the woman was standing she was short whitehaired with the inflated features of a woman whose beauty had aged into plumpness she wore a threadbare but clean sleeveless linen tunic her substantial bosom pressed against the fabric beside her in a simple wooden chair with a curving back sat a man even older than she was his eyes were milkwhite with cataracts behind the aged couple looking down over their silvery heads stood the blue star i am the blue star said the old woman haraldr blinked you the old woman reached back and snatched the ear of the big man and pulled him forward until his jutting beard seemed to perch on her shoulder this rascal is my son he uses my name it protects me confused you confusion is my livelihood now you might say i must be known and yet not known this devil helps me with that she released the ear and batted her sons cheek thats all hes good for the blue star dropped her hand to the head of the old man and caressed his wispy white hair this is my husband he doesnt hear either she turned back to her towering son i let the boy know what i am about she looked at her son sharply so he wont blunder into something she came around and studied the bindings of haraldrs hands cut him loose she ordered her son haraldr rubbed his hands and ankles and looked up at her the blue star she began acknowledging his evident curiosity is the name that the people of the city once knew well this the woman with some difficulty due to the tight fit pulled her tunic down almost to the nipple of her left breast the birthmark on her ruddy fleshy breast was not blue but a faded brown that might have been deep purple once and not a perfect star but indeed had five somewhat irregular points the blue star they saw it believe me they all did from the bulgarslayer down to the porters in the hippodrome i could do things on a galloping horse you couldnt do on a gymnasium floor if you spent a lifetime trying one foot one hand my leg up leaps from one horse to the next to start to titillate them then swords and fire and what have you i have seen two emperors crowned you have heard nothing like the way they acclaimed me in the hippodrome for a moment haraldr saw the young athletes eyes and he imagined the beauty she must have been the spectacle of her and then he saw maria her beauty still alive still vivid and he realized he could not see her old like this could not see a time when she would not be fresh and in his arms the blue star was an old woman again one day during a practice stunt i had done a thousand times i fell i could not get up i walk now but with pain and difficulty her head bobbed slightly everything gone the silks the town house snatched away by god i came back here where i had started this man taught me that i had lost nothing she bent and kissed the old mans head these are my people varangian devils whores thieves vagrants they were his people too the bulgarslayer he raised many of them out of the dirt gave them reason to walk in the christs path proved that he would not let the dhynatoi crush them if they even lifted their heads out of the offal in the streets then the bulgarslayer was summoned by the king of heaven and the studion became a hell but we survived she fixed haraldr with cold brilliant eyes now we are not to be permitted even to survive mistress began haraldr dont call me mistress boy i am not one of the courtesans you fairhairs fawn over i swear to you by all the gods sacred to me and to rome that varangians did not light these fires tonight we tried to prevent them that i came to you like this should prove that i have no wish to punish those who have suffered enough i know that now the blue star barked at her son and he ran out for a moment when he returned he handed his mother a plain clay bowl she held it down for haraldr to see inside he looked back at her grimly the bowl was full of noses and ears freshly cut this is the record of our conversation with the arsonists we have not gone back as far as we can go or will go but the trail of noses and worse will lead us to the orphanotrophus joannes we have known for some time that he is the architect of our misery haraldr nodded you are correct but you must understand that you are not alone against the orphanotrophus there are many working in this cause i am certain that when the emperor himself recovers the blue star burst into a rich peal of laughter boy what use are you to me when you dont know the simple truths this emperor is not a bad man we know that but he is dying he will not see the next full moon and then his evil brother joannes will put his newly anointed puppet upon the throne and bleed the people of rome to feed his own ambitions and nurture his dhynatoi accomplices he will create a rome that only the few will love and robbed of the devotion of her people rome herself will perish we believe we have time said haraldr rome is not a corpse yet those of us who share your hatred of the orphanotrophus have decided to wait and see if the emperor recovers before we act but we will act soon enough do not doubt that and if the emperor does not recover will you support this caesar i believe the caesar has many good qualities and i believe that he is not likely to follow his uncle joanness policies blindly in fact he is inclined to the contrary he should be allowed to prove his sincere concern for the people of rome i would think it would be to your benefit to take the same position why hold your nose and throw the fish out before you have even smelled it if he shows the respect due the purpleborn and places his aegis over the smallest folk then we will joyously acclaim this caesar as our emperor if not we will act do not doubt that but i did not allow you here to speak of the future of rome it is the future of the studion that i carry in my bosom you say we are allied in a common cause and the manner in which you have come among us tonight is a coin of good faith that i am too old and too clever not to accept so answer me boy with the truth you have paid me so far what will you varangians do if the orphanotrophus joannes orders you to massacre the people of the studion haraldr felt weak cold and sick in his gut would there be such an order likely there would he rose from the floor and looked down at the blue star for a long moment if the orphanotrophus joannes gives that order then i swear by all the oaths i have already pledged tonight that i will kill him myself why have you come marias face was bloodless with fright what has happened i know that studion is burning we went to the roof and saw the fires he is not maria lowered her head and her dark loose hair tumbled over her shoulders the candelabra in her bedchamber had been extinguished and two oil lamps on long slender bronze stands sent strange shadows scurrying across the densely patterned pale blue antioch carpet he is safe said mar i sent some of my own men to find out as i had feared joannes attempted to bury him there i warned him marias breasts heaved beneath her sheer silk cloak she was like a corpse returning to life her lips suddenly flushed a brilliant red yes but you did not come here to bring me comfort mar studied maria warily no he paused wondering if his purposes were more clear to her than they were to himself why had he come do you love him yes you are going to get him killed yes maria folded her arms under her breasts and looked at mar with cold azure eyes mar shook his head incredulously if you have contrived some insane plot of your own i warn you that anything that now involves haraldr concerns me as well he is a norseman and my friend and i will not lie to you an ally whom i need above all others destroy another man with your foolish schemes and mad passions because if there is further danger to my ally i will destroy you in the silence that followed mar realised that he had not conveyed conviction her eyes were too clever too weary she looked down her lips curling slightly as if concealing an amused disdain you arent his friend perhaps you are his ally are we rivals mar stepped forward and slapped maria perfunctorily almost as if it were a ritual punishment that is a slander bitch maria laughed and put her ringers to her bleeding lip she dabbed and tasted the blood yes it was unfair of me to say that i do not believe that you could not love me simply because you want to love men i never knew why was i unattractive to you mars face twitched slightly he remembered the vision of her naked wanting him since then he had ached thinking of what it would have been like to make love to her why hadnt he she had not been the first woman he had turned away from why he had reasons he could not admit but she had been the culmination the one who had brought him closest and had therefore let him fall the farthest why hadnt he he was not waiting for a woman who was pure many who had offered themselves to him had been virgins the corners of marias mouth trembled and her nostrils flared do you think of me mar i want you to think of me i want every man who has ever touched me to burn with the memory of me she swished forward her silk cloak like a cloud i think of what it would have been like with you i thought of you once when i was with him and this is how you love him you are a bitch i love him she screamed her face brilliant i love him so much i wake up in the night sick with dread that he will never love me again i vomit i heave my soul up for loving him her hair fell around her cheeks and her shoulders jerked with strange dry sobs mar shook his head i pity you you are addicted to your passions you have taken everything as long as you have known life and so you despise anything you cannot entirely consume like a flame that hates water you will never understand men like haraldr and me we are norsemen when we are twelve summers old we go on the western sea in open boats and sail to lands you romans have never heard of where the ice floats in great islands and the absence of everything except his own will makes a man strong maria cocked her head slightly defiantly when i was twelve i took my first lover that man forced you and later you killed him for it i know the truth of that i loved him i liked it it made a whore of me so you pretend you are a whore with every man as it was with me i make love but i do not love as i had hoped it would be with you but with haraldr it is different who is he she blurted with a desperate belllike voice when he is inside me i feel his fate around my neck and mine around his we are strangling each other with this destiny two vines sucking the life out of one another you say i will get him killed yes i have known it i have prayed for it i have tried to do it and he gave me my life back so i could try again her eyes were insane incandescent who is he he has not told you who he really is mar sneered perhaps your love is not returned then you would understand the fate around your neck if you knew tell me she shrieked and fell on mar pounding his huge chest with her small white fists he showed his gleaming teeth and she clawed his face tell me he felt the blood on his cheek she lunged at an object on the ivoryinlaid trunk opposite her bed tell me or ill kill you mar looked at the knife and laughed she swiped wildly and he caught her wrist she strained to reach him with the knife and he deliberately wrenched her arm so that the blade touched his throat you want to kill me little bitch look it is only a thumbs width kill me she grimaced and let the knife drop mar looked into her mesmerizing eyes the rage the danger the invitation he knew his purpose for coming here now why had he concealed it from himself he brought his lips close to hers and she did not recoil as he had thought hoped she would he grabbed her hair and pulled her to him and kissed her and she pressed back her lips angry yet soft the kiss that had made him sleepless a hundred nights then she pushed him away tell me mar ripped her cloak off revealing a sheer silk tunic her nipples were erect beneath the mistlike drape she looked at him and pulled her hair slick against her head and held it and for a moment she had the utterly wild aspect of a blueeyed panther she dropped her hands and placed them on the draped neckline of her tunic and pulled down and ripped the garment from her shoulders the silk settled at her ankles like falling eiderdown set me free she said mar stared at her his desire a great engine in his throbbing chest if haraldr sigurdarson wanted to fight over her he would kill him he was a hundred times a man in every way except that he had never been able to take a woman and now he would he studied her body again reality exceeding even memory she had had him so close then now there was nothing about her he did not desire she helped him undress silently looking in his eyes the entire time her face inscrutable she took him to her bed and he was hard my fairhair she said pressing down on him demanding what he had hoped to plunder her breathing was quick and harsh destroy me she said raspily set me free she clutched at mars hair let him live maria ground her pubis against him until he grimaced with pain i like it my fairhair i like it she clutched his head to her breasts bite me harder she arched her spine and growled like a cat harder make me bleed intoxicated beyond any sense he had ever known mar took the soft skin of her breast between his teeth and ripped and tasted the blood and then his loins exploded they breathed in a furious contrapunto mar fell quickly from the precipice of passion disgusted with himself not because he had taken another mans woman but because he had fouled himself what had been different this time he wondered to make him do it did he really hate haraldr sigurdarson that much or was death closer than he thought his genitals felt cold and filthy with her wetness she was a whore he pushed maria away and retreated from her bed maria sat up and smeared the blood over her breast like a fascinated child she watched mar dress i liked it she said in a voice that sounded as if it were coming from some great distance you were as inept as a thirteenyearold boy i have seduced boys with beardless chins and had to teach them now i have taught you it is all for my pleasure as you say i am quite addicted to it mar looked at her as if she were a leper you are mad and empty he said pulling his boots on and then standing to confront her you are like the western sea with this great force this great tempest but like the sea you rage alone in emptiness and in silence without meaning unless a man dares to challenge you every man who loves you is a fool i was a fool to come here maria watched mar leave there was a highpitched sound in her ears she felt as empty as the sea mar had described there had been no pleasure only the gift of pain she had demanded she had hated it and herself and it had not set her free alexius patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith appeared in a burst of white silk and gold embroidery behind the luminous patriarch through the briefly opened bronze doors to his personal apartments mar caught a glimpse of servants clearing the silver and gold settings of the patriarchs breakfast table mar fell to his knees and lowered his forehead to a red carpet sprinkled with delicately woven gold chrysanthemums a sweet incense filled his nostrils rise hetairarch alexius beckoned with his ringladen fingers rise up it was a strange powerful face the feminine lips contradicted by the hawklike nose the eyes still guarded but fearsome nonetheless father you honour me nonsense it is my pleasure since his majesty is no longer able to join me for breakfast i often feel that i am losing conversance with the secular arms of our glorious empire i welcome this opportunity to conduct a private and indeed intimate interview alexius showed mar through a series of antechambers and patriarchal offices the bustling secretaries with their armfuls of documents and the hurrying dignitaries in silk and gold seemed little different from the officials of a major imperial bureau the difference mar noted was that here there was a powerful uniformity of purpose a sense that these officials served with unstinting obedience but one master i thought we might converse in my church said alexius i am intent on redeeming your soul for the pantocrator you know so i will ask for his intervention it is hard to deny him in the mother church they entered a short vaulted hallway that opened onto the south arcade of the hagia sophia alexius walked to a heavy marble balustrade and gestured into the vast chamber of golden light that extended beyond above and below them everywhere mar looked scintillae of colour accreted into architectural forms and then dissolved into light again this is rome mar told himself a huge structure so disguised by the multiplicity and splendour of its parts that it is impossible to tell what is solid real and what is illusion but one must not be dazzled by the lights there were real walls real columns here and if a man had the intelligence to identify and the temerity to remove the critical supporting structures he could bring even this edifice down it is quite fragile said the patriarch almost as if he had opened a window into mars mind look he pointed to the massive pier at the end of the arcade one of four that thrust up the soaring central dome if you focus through the light you can see how it is inclined backwards mar squinted the pier indeed tilted noticeably as if the weight of the presumably incorporeal gold dome were crushing down on it when i walk in here each morning said alexius i am in awe that god has permitted the dome to stand through another day alexius looked about the enormous golden shell with an unexpected warmth and familiarity as if he were watching a small child he would some day have to send off to life war love disappointment death after a moment the patriarch turned to mar the beasts in his dark eyes finally unleashed this is my fortress he said his voice even but now much deeper in resonance almost supernaturally compelling it is the most powerful structure on earth its strength is not in the mass of its walls but in their fragility the fashion in which they are transformed by the light of day into the pure light of gods eternal being some day men perhaps with means we cannot dream of today will defeat the walls of this city but how can anything defeat the light in which the pantocrator reveals himself to men the dragon of nidafell thought mar the last dragon will consume even the light of the pantocrator alexiuss eyes retreated i see i have failed to move you with talk of god let us then talk of rome and what we must render to if not our caesar then to the powers that have given us a caesar mar looked up into the golden carapace that seemed more an opening than an enclosure perhaps there was a power to this light it enabled the patriarch to speak with the direct tongue of a norseman instead of the oily mendacity of the roman courtier do not disappoint him we will not accept the continued intervention of the orphanotrophus joannes in the affairs of the empire alexius raised both wiry eyebrows and who are we hetairarch the varangians of the grand and middle hetairia alexius nodded his head that is no small thing one thousand warriors of proven and more importantly feared ability and even more importantly already quartered inside the palace gates indeed surrounding the person of the emperor but do the scholae excubitores and hyknatoi of the imperial taghmata these were all elite palace regiments share your resolution if not they would certainly deter the swiftness of your thrust perhaps with fatal consequences for all involved of course you are correct in your reservations answered mar if we had to defeat the imperial taghmata he said slightly smirking with the boast the endeavour might take us several days by then the people would have become aroused and could possibly create a situation that would force us to accept any candidate they proposed however earnest the intentions of the simple folk we might be left with another unsuitable candidate but if the imperial taghmata were convinced that both the people and other powers were resolute in their wishes they would acquiesce to our coup an artful hypothesis hetairarch but you fail to calculate the most significant of romes many powers if only because in that power is the will of the pantocrator manifest in human form i mean the purpleborn and is not the purpleborn currently an author of our predicament indeed the older sister is fortunately she is not the last purpleborn macedonian mar paused for effect the varangian guards would defend your client theodora to the last drop of our blood if she were to ascend to the imperial throne we would of course hope to consult on the choice of her consort and emperor alexius clasped his hands beatifically well said hetairarch i applaud the economy of expression you varangians are noted for the eyes suddenly leapt at mar for a moment literally stifling his breath in matters according to god i am undisputed on this earth in matters that pertain to caesar my concerns are manifold i govern a state within a state with all the predictable difficulties of such administration fractious metropolitans incompetent bishops rebellious priests in farflung sees like a state i have my enemies internally the growth of the monastic establishments independent of patriarchal jurisdiction has become an epidemic that leeches the church of its vital resources externally i must contend with malignant impudence of the see of old rome which threatens every soul in my state and let us not forget my mandatory allegiance to the emperor basileus and autocrator of the romans i am crowned by him and can in theory be deposed by him this emperor will depose no one alexius made the sign of the cross praying that the emperor would be able to complete in purgatory the penance he had begun here on earth yes it is the caesar we must concern ourselves with the caesar is in neorion mar caught the surprise and new respect in alexiuss catquick eyes four days now he is still alive my presumption is that he was overly assertive and joannes intends to knead him into a more pliable state all the more reason that the succession to this caesar be initiated alexius looked again into the golden vault i had intended to convert you and i see that instead you have begun to persuade me alexius turned away from the immense cavern of light gods patience is infinite but as he endlessly cautions us to observe our time here is short the centipede was as long as a mans hand and when it crawled over michael kalaphatess thigh it seemed to wrap his bare limb like a manylegged serpent he began to scream hysterically and retreated to the corner of his cell the slime wet and cold against his naked back he could see nothing he panted and tried to make his body pull in on itself disappear so that the beasts could not recognize him but the screams reached in sliding beneath the cracks in the door that even the light could not enter he could see the screams they were the only thing he could see they were sharp hot vines that curled around him and then grew huge red thorns that pierced right through his flesh on the fourth day the locusts came up from the shaft of the abyss cloaked in armour and smoke their light was blinding they flogged him with screams and led him into the abyss driving him forward with thorns and brands the fiery lakes burned on every side and sulphur poisoned his lungs the locusts would not let him retch the screams out of his intestines where the thorns had planted their seed and then they set him before the serpent and the serpent spat thunder nephew the serpent touched him it had the face of a man the screams died and left only hard little pods that rattled in his bowels soon the warm liquid dissolved them nephew do you know where you are yes yes i would tell you but man can no longer hear me i talk to demons in their own language yes neorion remember neorion nephew then there were dreams and in them the armies of gog and magog marched upon the earth the pantocrator spoke to him from a mountain far away he spread out his hands and revealed the kingdoms of the world all little cities seen from a great distance and then michael slept alone the demons could not discover him beneath a cloud nephew he awoke with a start the recognition like the sun on a hot sea neorion i have been in neorion how long do you know where you are nephew michael looked up and blinked neorion yes five days your collapse was more complete than i had intended joannes held out a silver goblet michael could smell the wine he took a deep desperate draught i am quite confounded as to what to do with you joannes said i had hoped you might make the acquaintance of some of your fellow guests perhaps attend them in their time of travail among us he waved his hand around the dimly lit forbidding chamber and the wine surged back up michaels gullet even though the racks and instruments joannes indicated were not in use now i feel that such a recourse would destroy your mind joannes picked up a pair of tongs and distractedly inspected them clicking the jaws together you are so weak he paused as if this phrase were a matter of great philosophical interest to him you are so weak that i consider you too valuable to destroy yes consider it as i did i am not unaware that the greatest prodigies of the sculptor are those in which the shape is first moulded in some malleable substance such as wax or clay and then fixed in eternal bronze by the foundry masters art because you can be shaped with such ease you will be the substance in which i create works of astonishing complexity and endurance i am certain you do not need my words to know how thorough my penitence is for my mad utterly demonic act against you yes i observed your contrition joannes gestured to the goblet drink enjoy that you have felt the lash now you have only to draw the cart you know i will do whatever you bid if only do not go on nephew what i saw in your eyes yesterday was worth a lifetime of supplications from your lips joannes set the tongs back on the table with the rest of his instruments you were quite voluble before your isolation i was intrigued by the depth of your friendship with our blessed mother having forced you to endure such an ordeal here i would not like to deprive you now of the opportunity to seek the comfort of your mothers solicitous breast i want you to go to her often and seek her counsel about such matters as you have previously i only ask that in exchange for your freedom you assiduously practise the mnemonic arts and recite for me whatever her majesty has to say however intimate or confidential should i discover that your recollection is less than complete we will continue your instruction here in neorion michael kalaphates looked up at joannes his eyes rapt with gratitude and whispered his thanks uncle yours is truly the voice of the angelic host i hoped you would not look for me maria stood on the porch of her villa facing a murky malachitegreen sea a dark steaming clouds rolled over the city to the west and a broad shaft of rain advanced along the golden horn she waved her hand as if throwing something onto the terraced lawns beneath her but nothing left her clutched fist why women are a mystery thought haraldr hoping that this vague boyhood platitude might explain her unfathomable behaviour i wanted to be away away from me yes then i will leave yes haraldr stood transfixed for a moment then realized that she would not stop him his hands trembled as he turned to walk down the steps to the jetty you are a liar she did not look at him when she spoke haraldr turned grateful for any sort of reprieve who are you her voice was so detached it was almost as if she did not know she was asking a question you did not tell me the truth haraldr clenched his fists and jaw with the excruciation of his silence he had sworn that secret to his brother and to jarl rognvald and so far had nothing but proof that their longburied cautions had been anything but essential to his survival and what jarl rognvald had told him about condemning other men had even kept him from telling halldor and ulfr whom he trusted with his life even for maria to know would be a threat to her but none of those reasons were conclusive even the soulbinding oaths to dead men only one reason truly held his tongue he could not trust maria what mar had said what many men had said about her still haunted him he was one of many a caprice as evanescent as those loves who had parted her legs before him two great fates warred for him now norway and maria but only norway would always be constant to surrender that lifelong fate to hers and then to see it discarded like a necklace she no longer admired would kill his soul before it ended his life yes i withheld the truth i will tell you what i told you the first time you asked that question then i cannot tell you mar knows the sensation of alarm seemed to lift haraldr off his feet for a moment he did not even know how to get at this mar would never risk their plans unless he had intended to betray them all along he would not tell me either relief quickly spawned anger you endanger yourself me my five hundred pledgemen and anyone you ask that question haraldr snapped we are not children playing some game yes your game is different she whipped her head around and glared at him her face distorted with anger and anguish you think that because people die in your games that they are somehow less trivial than a childs she jerked her chin up violently i know how it is to kill a man haraldr nordbrikt slayer of saracens and seljuks i killed my first lover haraldr was not surprised he had known almost for certain when mar had first suggested the possibility it explained much he would be patient with her i know he told her softly and he reached out for her maria recoiled get away i asked you to leave manglavite if there is a drop of civilized blood in your barbaros veins you will oblige me haraldr placed his hands on her shoulders yes manglavite she said in her high mocking voice then grimaced answer my question with your savage manhood make love to me and i will forget your lies rut the little bitch until her glassy eyes no longer question your great and mysterious purpose haraldr ignored her he had heard these words before he swept her in his arms and carried her into her villa past her gawking servants and laid her on her bed she did not resist she lay mute her eyes flat the fire receded deep within he kissed her neck swooning with the taste of her the softness of her skin he now suspected one of her caprices when would she erupt with manic passion surprising him with something he could not even imagine she maddened him with desire he felt himself harden and pulled at the ties of her scaramangium he reached up her robe and touched her thigh she shuddered and pushed him away stop she sat up do you care that i do not want to love you haraldr kissed her neck and she slapped him the sound seemed like a thunderclap i dont want your touch i dont want your stinking barbaroi hands on me with trembling fingers he touched her face gently barely brushing against her burning cheek since the last time i was with you i have made love to another man haraldr denied the knife in his gut you are lying maria loosened the collar of her scaramangium and pulled the fabric down to reveal her left breast the bite was a livid bruise the teeth marks evident her eyes were furious i begged him to bite me i asked him to do things you have never heard of i was his slut haraldr already had enough images of her with other men who is your lover she laughed wickedly a laugh he had never heard before not even in the passion of love do you want to kill him you were not forced you are not my wife no he made his decision and stood up he watched her selfconsciously stroke her bruised breast you love me that is why you are driven to hurt me you are as transparent as an image cut in glass but i will not beg you for a love that causes you pain you are a vain fool he turned and walked out she went to the window and watched through the greenishtinted glass as he descended the steps to the jetty when he was well out to sea in the small skiff she ran to the porch she could still see him the distant speck of his blue tunic i have undone what the stars commanded she told him through the salty wind whipping off the bosporus i have given you back your life then she prayed silently to the virgin that once before he died the death she blessedly could no longer bring him he would understand that she had loved him little boy zoe stroked the curls from michael kalaphatess forehead you should have come to your mother more quickly the weeks have been an agony for me it has been difficult for me my beloved michael reclined on the sitting couch his head propped forward by a damask cushion yes that terrible place it is appalling even to consider the things he must have shown you there she looked at him with a wryly erotic subtle puckering of her lips he performed no alterations on you did he precious little candle she placed her hand behind his neck and let her silkrestrained breasts touch his shoulder i am still frightened nonsense such plots are commonly initiated almost as commonly forgiven you will not spend the rest of your life dwelling under some cloud little one he will attribute your failed conspiracy to my antipathy and soon overlook yours you are too important to him now zoe looked away lost in a reverie she would never dare to speak of in any event i will involve you in no more plots you are too dear to me there are many brutes i can employ for assassinations you alone can author my pleasure she leaned forward and placed her dry sweet lips just on his he spasmed zoe observed his swelling crotch it seems i am the architect of your pleasure she smirked regally i touch you and raise a column i am so glad i am alive he said almost deliriously zoe stood and lifted his hand i have discovered an unguent that imparts an indescribable silkiness to my breasts and thighs you must try to find words for it after the caresses the sweating passions the grateful reunion of their flesh zoe held michaels head to her breast i will never let him hurt you again she said i am now more determined than ever he lifted his head in alarm and looked at her with doelike eyes no it is too dangerous she hushed him with kisses i know that is why i have selected a man both fearless and expendable who michael whispered his eyes wider still zoe pressed michaels head to her breasts again the komes i mean manglavite the tauroscythian haraldr whatever she felt the sudden stirring against her thigh and laughed gently why nephew i seem to have raised another column it was not necessary to bring that mar pointed to the ceremonial fasces that haraldr carried in his arms there is to be no procession yes i understand said haraldr but i thought that once on the grounds no mar was impatient and anxious in fact you shouldnt even have that out where it might be seen mar slipped his cloak off and wrapped the thickshafted axe in it he looked around and then whispered to haraldr they are bringing him in a covered litter with maybe a dozen hyknatoi to guard him they want to get him here without anyone taking notice thats why i am here instead of with him and they suspect something here is that why the middle hetairia has been summoned mar looked at his boots pensively i imagine so you are the principal unit for dealing with riots mar leaned over and whispered even more softly i am not certain what is going on any more you know how long it has been since i have even seen the emperor it had now been several months it is possible his recovery has been complete and the purpose of this visit is to establish that he can indeed appear fit and able before his subjects so perhaps all my cautions dont seem so foolish now haraldr said goadingly he was tremendously relieved to hear that the emperor was mending because otherwise he and mar had got nowhere with their increasingly fitful conspiracy to rid rome of joannes even mar had admitted he was making no progress on the miraculous alliance he had promised weeks ago it was obvious it would come to nothing mar shrugged placidly well we shall see what we shall see do you know what this is mar pointed to the gleaming new building set back from a quiet side street by a broad treerimmed lawn the twostorey edifice looked much like a prosperous new monastery a freshly plastered chapel with five tiled domes rose in the midst of a foursided block of living quarters they say it is a convent said haraldr yes a peculiar convent come with me the entrance to the convent was beneath a large arch supported on polished columns of rare green porphyry from sparta the massive wooden door was carved with images of the life of christ a grate opened and they were admitted by a young woman in the black frock worn by nuns and monks alike a black cowl covered her hair and she drew part of the cowl around to veil her face but haraldr glimpsed that she was strikingly attractive so much so that he was ashamed of the thoughts he had about her he has come asked the nun anxiously soon said mar we are ordered to check the building it is simply a ritual the nun led them through a vaulted hallway into a large refectory lit by rows of circular bronze polycandelons beneath the lamps sat hundreds of nuns in uniform black they tittered in a very undignified fashion when haraldr and mar entered and many if not most forgot to veil their faces their meal seemed extremely lavish the silver plates and glass ewers immediately apparent servants scurried among the tables carrying gilt platters piled with roast meats most remarkably many of the women were as young and attractive as the nun who had opened the door although many others seemed careworn or had pocked faces do you see the way they are looking at us said haraldr i thought nuns would have their eyes cast down in christlike humility these women are as brazen as he broke off in astonishment mar nodded and tried to keep from staring you will probably recognize some of the faces you may have passed them on the streets of the studion odin theotokos whores every one of them the simple canvas litter was borne up the marble path a short while later only a handful of armoured hyknatoi and a single sadeyed eunuch apparently the emperors personal chamberlain were in attendance haraldr stood by at a loss to determine the protocol involved in this strange circumstance and then fell to his face as the curtains of the litter were drawn aside when he stood again he could not avoid the sight though he damned his eyes for what they saw it was not the same man of course but an impostor a decoy no it was the man the essence the profound eyes and the decisive nose were still there but the rest was a painful parody of the magnificent lord of the entire world who had awed haraldr those long months ago the emperor had swollen grotesquely his cheeks and limbs and torso as sickeningly bloated as those of a floating corpse his fingers were like thick sausages his skin was jaundiced with red streaks it clearly pained him even to set his feet on the ground he looked around as if searching for someone to comfort him haraldr could not bear it he stepped forward and offered his arm glorious majesty please let me help you the emperor looked at him his eyes struggling for recognition hetairarch he gasped obviously mistaking haraldr for mar thank you hetairarch i need no assistance and then he began to walk an effort so pitiful to watch that it broke haraldrs heart it seemed an eternity before the shuffling hobbling emperor could drag his stiff dropsied legs across the inner courtyard to the chapel the nuns already knelt before the glimmering silver chancel screen and the huge mosaic of the virgin in the apse and they bowed when the emperor entered yet another lifetime passed before he reached the small rectangular ambo haraldr prayed that the emperor would not attempt to climb the marble steps to the canopied platform though it only rose to the height of a mans shoulders the sadeyed eunuch tried to restrain the emperor with a touch to his cloak but the emperor resolutely climbed so slowly that he seemed a wooden figure poised at each step he finally attained the platform steadied himself on the rail and turned about a dreadfully long interval passed before he could compose himself enough to speak his legs seemed to sway like fat bladders partially full of water my daughters he finally said raspily our lord the christ implores us to judge not others lest you be judged yourself as he cast the seven devils out of mary of magdala so let his hand on earth cast out the devils that afflict these daughters but i know then that my daughters would fear for the poverty of their mortal flesh if they abandoned all traffic in their beauty and through this cruel extortion might never know the face of the pantocrators forgiveness but the christ also told his disciples whatever you pray for in faith you shall receive so your father instructs you his daughters that if you pray to remain free of your sin and continue to abjure the flesh and renounce the profession of the harlot you shall receive whatever bounty my offices can provide and never labour again except to praise the pantocrator haraldr was stunned the man was providing free and luxurious lodging for prostitutes while his empire decayed like his own walking corpse better that he did die soon the emperor finished his discourse and repeated his excruciating procession the nuns kneeling throughout no doubt profusely grateful to the virgin for their extraordinary fortune the emperor reached the courtyard and looked up into the spring sky as if questing for some gesture of approval from the heavenly tribunal his head twitched then drooped slowly he gagged and fell to the pavement before anyone could steady him his limbs instantly stiffened and palsied his head pounded like a coppersmiths hammer against the pavement even as haraldr and the sadeyed eunuch knelt to help him haraldr looked at the emperors face in astonishment it was the colour of blood and his eyes were white the demons having deprived him even of his vision the emperors teeth gnashed like a beasts and his limbs were utterly rigid beneath the spongy morbid tissue that cloaked his entire form after many terrible minutes the fit passed and the emperors eyes returned to normal and he looked up apologetically his head was bloodied from his exertions against the pavement his breath rattled in his throat and he could scarcely lift his head much less rise to his feet haraldr had a curious instinct that there were two maladies present and that this one sapped his strength and left him vulnerable to the second which swelled his limbs but he was no learned physician he only knew for certain that the rumours in the street not the reassurances from the palace were the truth the father he had admired and respected was already dead and now even this bloated corpse would soon be mercifully interred haraldr stood in the empresss antechamber wondering if her invitation had anything to do with her husbands imminent mortality and if he would see maria the eunuchs quickly ushered him into her dining chamber the small table had only two elegant settings chased silver dishes and goblets fashioned of engraved gold leaf pressed between glass haraldrs breast emptied of the last hope that bound his heart to rome he performed the usual prostrations when zoe entered and she laughed as if the ritual were a jest not an obeisance to her purpleborn majesty when he rose from the thick crimson carpet haraldr was not prepared for what he saw any more than he had been two days previously when he had witnessed the sad spectacle of her husband it was as if zoe had taken youth from her consorts catastrophic deterioration as if only here in the palaces that were her native soil could her true beauty be fully manifest zoe wore the simple scaramangium that she had made fashionable but this highcollared robe was completely beaded with pearls her form appeared all light and silhouette without apparent volume much like a living mosaic she wore her hair braided over her head somewhat in the style that maria had displayed to such effect at argyruss hostel but with pearl and diamondstudded ribbons laced through the stunningly gold tresses her blue eyes did not have the heat of marias but tonight they were ineffably deep almost like amethyst keleusate the eunuch helped haraldr to his seat after which zoe sat twinkling like a galaxy as she moved a priest appeared and intoned the blessing and servants brought in the miniature olives and caviar the wine was poured and watered i have missed you manglavite of course maria speaks of you i have missed you as well majesty haraldr said sincerely he was bedazzled i must awkwardly and impudently confess that i had not realized the extent of my deprivation until i saw you a moment ago and indeed shame myself with the fervent desire of my eyes at this moment your greek is vastly improved manglavite zoe tilted her head slightly and her deep red almost amaranth lips gave a hint of amusement haraldr realized he had presumed too much she was not only more beautiful here but also more regal his forehead flamed zoe devoured her little olives in silence for a while occasionally looking up at haraldr as if he were a servant in front of whom she could eat without any sort of selfconsciousness haraldr was only slightly ashamed by the thoughts he had of her as he watched her sumptuous lips suck at the morsels he had grown up at courts and he knew that a dying king was a dead king and that his widow would if only by necessity soon take another man into her bed he remembered the way zoe had looked at michael kalaphates in antioch and reflected that this empress had no doubt already entertained her husbands successor maria had told him several times that she shared the same suspicion haraldr himself had had to consider a succession to the emperor the man he had fully expected to deal with joannes and right the wrongs of the studion was a grotesque moribund impostor everything had changed mar had been right they would have to take the initiative against joannes but how when the fish course had been served zoe peered from beneath her fine paintdarkened lashes and blithely asked are you in love with maria yes if it is a single combat you wish purpleborn then the king of norway will oblige you are you aware that i have opposed her liaison with you no but i am not surprised she is a lady of the highest rank i am merely a barboros manglavite a servant of rome i hope my service to her has brought her some satisfaction i consider myself free to serve elsewhere so you are angry with her i am pained by her but i am a norseman we do not curse the sun when it sets zoe set her chin on her exquisite hands how candid you are your heart is great enough to confess the pain that it carries i am sorry i have not importuned you about romantic matters before your outlook interests me zoe ate her fish in silence occasionally idly prodding the sauceladen fillet with a slender twopronged fork when she had finished she stared at haraldr for a while and he held her gaze in equal parts defiant and mesmerized do you think i love my husband she finally asked i would not presume to know your heart majesty i love him i will never see him again i will ask but it will not be permitted haraidr fell into the sadness of her amethyst eyes he perceived that she did love her husband even if she had taken a lover in his absence perhaps much like me haraldr thought with my alan girl you bear your pain with a grace that nourishes the soul your majesty any moment we have with someone we love is time stolen from destiny i had my interlude with the sun in my arms like you i do not curse the sun when it embraces the night zoe paused while the meat course a roast kid was sliced by a eunuch when the servant had moved away from the table she leaned slightly towards him her lips glistening in the candlelight i have heard that you keep or have kept several women have you gone back to them only to the whore i purchased from anatellon it is a hollow joy yes but most of our pleasures are small and the great joys in life almost always turn on us and bring us pain unwatered wine accompanied the desert zoe talked gaily for a long while regaling him with stories of the bulgarslayer ancient gods and scandalous romances when she called the priest to say the closing grace haraldr was greatly disappointed he had hoped to hear her husky voice long into the night and forget maria for a few hours he stood as protocol dictated and crossed his hands over his breast her pale eyebrow twitched slightly it is the first night it has been warm enough to sit on my balcony come and talk with me zoes balcony was a large arcade opening off her apartments the multicoloured constellation of the palace complex sloped to the sea beneath them chrysopolis blazed across the water to the east haraldr remembered the other balcony across the water and what he had felt as he stood by maria and watched the great city in the night now his soul faced a different meridian my return journey has begun haraldr thought i leave behind not only maria but the other love that can no longer hold me the empress city i have spent the night in these twin lovers arms and have known their narcotic passions and their lethal madness now i want nothing more than to abandon them to their own tormented fates i have a duty to perform for the people of studion and the soul of asbjorn ingvarson to avenge and then the vengeance that howls across the endless plains of rus and shrieks in my breast like the ravens song waits for me norway zoe stood close to him and put her hand on his neck and the touch thrilled him as if a mosaic virgin had reached out to him she pulled his head down and whispered next to his ear speak softly and the wind will carry our words away it is said that you and the hetairarch intend to strike at the orphanotrophus haraldr stiffened but at least she had used her charm and not her sex she had allowed him that much dignity we have intentions but no plans he said honestly he would not have told her if they did you cannot wait she said my husband could die at any time now if your majesty will forgive me when that does happen we must give the caesar time to gather strength if he could join us against joannes our chances of success would be immeasurably improved haraldr did not add that he and mar disagreed on this point zoe shook her head vehemently my nephew is a dear boy but he is weak he has been entirely subjugated by joannes when alexius prepares to anoint him with the imperial diadem i would not be surprised to see joannes snatch the crown from the patriarchs hands and set it upon his own grotesque head he will certainly occupy the throne my husband has restrained him under the next michael joannes will unleash a terror on my people such as you have never even dreamed you are suggesting that i personally swat down joannes remember that you have asked me to butcher that particular bird once before and you have heard my answer you were an innocent then you still are but the next revelation may cost you your life haraldr looked down on her intense questing face she was beautiful in this role as well and yet there was truth to what she said he had been taken totally unawares by the emperors condition he could not afford many more revelations like that mar had become increasingly unreliable if not treacherous haraldr had begun to suspect that mars goals extended well beyond the death of joannes and he had no idea how he and his men would then fit into mars plans and now the caesar could not even earn his lovers approbation but what did this ally offer you did not summon me here to save my life mistress what price do you offer me to save your own zoe smiled and tapped a perfect white tooth with a fingernail indeed let me be candid i must find a champion in spite of our estrangement my husband would never let his brother harm me if my husband were dead and my people broken to joanness bit i would be in great jeopardy her jaw set firmly with true hellenic nobility i am not afraid to die manglavite i am afraid to let joannes live yes i saw the studion burn haraldr once again felt fate gaming with him forcing him to play this wager would be huge once i had severed the head of this blackfrocked eagle how could you ensure that the imperial taghmata would not obey their dhynatoi masters and massacre my men in reprisal they would certainly not miss joannes but they would welcome the pretext to eliminate every varangian in rome i would go to my people and ask them to rise up against the taghmata that would alter the equation in your favour would it not haraldr ran through the myriad contingencies he and mar had batted around for months yes she was right with the distraction of a civil uprising the taghmata could be defeated then he admonished himself to deal with zoe as one sovereign to another he was no longer a mere servant of rome yes i believe you can guarantee that my men would not be punished but what would be my reward rome what monstrous guile madness had seized rome the good were perishing and the rest lived in the vast structures of their lies indeed my mother haraldr did not attempt to conceal the taunt in his voice you would adopt me as you did the caesar and name me after some emperor of ancient rome i presume or perhaps an invention more grand king of macedon in honour of alexander zoe moved away from him and looked out over the pattern of brilliant lights and inky water i would anoint you myself i would bestow on you the only real power that remains in rome the anointment in the hagia sophia is an empty ritual without the coronation that can only take place between my legs haraldr imagined himself captured by a whirlwind swept up in the madness of rome to think of her naked waiting was intoxication enough to think of the power that penetration would endow was to leave the middle realm and gambol among the gods but it was fantasy a boast on her part she played the woman but in her loins was only power and she would guard that power with empty promises indeed he said his momentary madness now restored to wry reason and to celebrate our betrothal i would pluck the girdle of orion from the skies he pointed to the constellation wheeling above them and fasten it about your fair loins as a wedding belt i have but to reach for it zoe smiled as if restraining a laugh like a child caught in some mischief my crown is not as inaccessible as your wedding gift but in refusing it you have given me the assurance i need that your ambition has practical limits let me give you the assurance you need if you wish i will swear on a piece of the cross upon which our saviour died that i will keep the other promise i have made tonight haraldr was aware of the importance of these relics among the romans but he saw no reason to make her take an oath on them if i fail i will be able to offer your complicity to barter for the lives of my men that is the pledge you have given tonight zoe resembled an ancient marble statue with amethysts for eyes then her lips twitched slightly you have become more civilized than i had ever anticipated manglavite haraldr but you have not lost your impetuosity either since i find you so candid this evening let me ask you this when i offered you rome wasnt there a moment when you lusted for her no matter the cost she paused and pearls winked dully as her breast rose with an inhalation that was imperceptible on her face wasnt there a moment when you desired me haraldr nodded zoes gemstone eyes warmed and the stone became living flesh she came towards him he could feel the heat of her her face was beyond beauty so if you fail we will both die that is a destiny that already weds us if we are to be consummated in that death then let us be lovers in this life and then she slipped her silken arms around him and pressed her jewelled head to his chest she was everything he had wanted her to be desperate innocent majestic tender her body and face a treasury of desire he made love to her for an entire night and as the dawn pinked the bosporus he wrapped his arm around her regal white bosom and realized two maddening truths he could love this woman and he could never stop loving maria john proteuon looked at his neighbour stephan and threw his arms up helplessly oxen stray he said not without sympathy but trying not to be too encouraging look he explained as he wiped his hands on his coarse rainsoaked tunic i have to help my brother with the ploughing because i am a soldier doesnt mean i must go looking for stray animals the next time some emperor wants to attack them john pointed north to the bulgarian border at the danube river a ride of two days i will go riding off and you will stay and you will not be helping me fight the bulgars any more than you are right now helping me to help my brother plough john gestured out in the field where his brother trudged along behind oxen yoked to the awkward topheavy curved ploughshare stephan stood in the heavy mist his brown hair beaded with moisture and his dull grey eyes swimming above gaunt cheekbones he looked as if he hadnt been eating well thought john which he probably hadnt with the increase in the window tax and the addition of the hearth tax and the constant worklevies taking men away from their farms to build these roads to nowhere honest farmers like stephan often looked like stray dogs john began to feel guilty as a military freeholder he was exempt from these additional taxes and in truth he hadnt had to spend much time fighting in fact he had once been mobilized to go to asia minor but that campaign had been called off or ended or something and other than that he just had to show his topoteretes that he still had a spear and helmet and a horse and since he hadnt seen his topoteretes in two years he hadnt worried much about that lately and the rain would soften the soil so that it would go easier tomorrow so what would be the harm in just looking for the animal for a while after all if stephan had lost his ox he would have to pull the ploughshare himself and it was clear he wouldnt last long at that john saddled his horse decided his spear would be an annoyance and helped stephan up behind him they rode away from the cluster of small brickwalled cottages and passed through the broad fan of tilled acreage that surrounded the village the common pasture was just a rockstrewn expanse of green scrub bordered by a wood that greyed into the mist it was empty didnt marosupous have his goats here asked john referring to another village neighbour they are gone too said stephan in his thick slow slightly slavic accent his mother had been a bulgar who had been born here before the bulgarslayer brought this area south of the danube back into the empire they are gone too exclaimed john leaning back so he could bat stephan on top of his idiot skull why didnt you say someone has stolen all the animals its clear i told you said stephan you told me your ox had been stolen oxhead not your ox and marosupous goats john pondered the situation he could go back for his spear collect his brother marosupous gregory and his brother but then hed be leading that clumsy band all over creation with no idea where the animals had gone stephan he said run back to the village and tell everybody what has happened i am riding over the ridge to see what i can see without a word stephan slipped off the horse and ran ankles flapping in battered knee boots john rode through the cold wet woods and out onto a rocky slope that climbed to a little promontory marked by a pile of large crumbling stones a fine idea he admonished himself sarcastically when he reached the lookout he could only see about two stades into the mist enough to make out a fragment of the narrow cart path that wound through the shallow hills before intersecting the big paved road to nicopolis john was about to pick through the scrub and take the path when he heard something strange out in the mist coming from the direction of the nicopolis road he reined his horse still and listened for a while how strange a sound he had never heard before gradually but steadily rising a sound like some kind of heavy rain perhaps rain and hail or a freak wind but no the sky wasnt right in fact a steady west wind was beginning to push the mist back from the nicopolis road animals yes but more than one ox and a few goats a herd that was it these thieves had made off with every animal in paristron theme it sounded like and were driving them down the road the first man to come up the cart path did not see john he wore a steel breastplate and helm and was armed with a bow and quiver and small round shield john didnt recognize the uniform but he could well guess that the man was imperial taghmata out here for what purpose god only knew john felt like riding up and telling this lout what he thought about the taghmata stealing peasants animals even during peacetime but as he wasnt armed and who knew what kind of renegade this man was or how many accomplices he had with him hed wait maybe he would see a centurion or topoteretes he could complain to john rode back up to the promontory and concealed himself behind the rough natural cairn on top the wind continued to sweep the mist off towards the nicopolis road and five more men joined the first all armoured alike one however had no bow an officer just the man to hear about this crime john nudged his horse back down the cart path the men called to him in some vulgar tongue john pulled back on the reins and looked down at them they were still distant but he could see their flushed smooth cheeks eunuch soldiers is that what they have serving in the taghmata now they called again and this time he recognized the dialect and realized that these men werent eunuchs he decided he had best return the way he had come and pretend he was just a frightened peasant which he was he reached the rocks and looked back to see if they were following below him the mist had fled from a section of the nicopolis road out of the opalescent fog marched greyish rows of spearmen in steel helms and hide jerkins flanked by horsemen armoured like the six he had already encountered how many wondered john his alarm building with every row that materialized out of the mist he waited and counted by the time he had reached one hundred ranks he decided enough was enough and charged down the slope as fast as his horse could negotiate the rock outcrops his horse was in full gallop and wheezing when he passed stephan on the outskirts of his village bulgars john shrieked so loud that the word burned his throat the whole christforsaken bulgar army the woman had perhaps recently entered her fourth decade of life she had a face that a passerby on this spring night would have found plain certainly unalluring but solid and well cared for a face of the middle class tending to lower the wife of a guild tradesman more plodding than prosperous perhaps her husband was a leather cutter or rawsilk processor who contracted work for more ambitious tradesmen who owned their own businesses she wore a long wool tunic with a wool cloak over that for there was a chill in the air a crisp postrain freshness and she was returning from the public baths near her home in the platea district next to the golden horn she carried her pail and towel in her right hand fear was a dim reflection in her dull brown eyes because although she was reasonably confident that the cursores were never far in her middleclass tending to lower neighbourhood there were some unsavoury tenements in the area one on her block and there had been thefts and assaults but this fear was a minor nuisance of life what tormented her was the anxiety of what she was about this night he was waiting for her at the usual place his black cloak a shadow that seemed to take life as it emerged from the darkness of the alley next to an arcaded fruit market he quickly took her next door into the graveyard of the small monastery at the end of the street she placed her pail down on the grass next to the toothlike rows of grave markers hating as always this business amid the screaming souls of the dead and waited for him to begin how many times did they meet this week asked joannes looking down on the womans plain pained face three times she said her voice muffled by shame so they are busy are they she did not answer the rhetorical question but looked at her sandalled feet dainty and smooth they were her most attractive feature what did your husband tell you they discussed asked joannes her eyes roamed as if she suspected the dead of eavesdropping the monastery chapel shrouded by trees was a dark forbidding presence behind the rows of gravestones hhe said they are against yyou orphanotrophus they are planning something he would not say what joannes nodded has he ever talked of any association between his group and certain malefactors in the studion i heard him talk to a friend she paused aware that ambiguities annoyed the orphanotrophus the friend was the baker i already told you about joannes nodded that she could continue they said that this group in the studion was well organized and would be a good ally they said that the middle class and the poor would have to unite against yyou orphanotrophus joannes bent over the woman as if he were about to grab her and shake the truth out of her but he merely leered the name of this group in the studion did they mention the name of this group the woman shook her head and stifled a sob but you will find out the name for me will you not i should think that when we meet next week you will know the woman nodded affirmatively her hands clutching at the borders of her cloak as if she were suddenly cold she looked up with tears on her cheeks have you brought a message from my boy is he well oh please the desperation in her voice would have broken the heart of a statue he is well rumbled joannes he is one of the neorions pets already i will have a message from him for you next time when you bring the name the woman looked up at joannes with the curious gratitude that victims of the rack often displayed to their torturers she sniffled and waited has your husband touched you this week asked joannes she did not think to lie no she said numbly joannes nodded she mechanically pulled her cloak aside and then slowly pulled her tunic up to her armpits leaving everything beneath that line of demarcation exposed joanness eyes never left her flat low breasts her veined nipples were puckered from the cold certainly not desire her eyes were closed joanness huge deformed fingers reached out and spread over her breasts and the spatulate tips pressed against her sallow flesh like the suction cups of a squid there was no movement in his face no expression in his shadowed sockets after a brief moment he removed his hands and the woman slowly pulled her tunic down she quickly picked up her pail and ran out of the graveyard and disappeared down the street joannes looked around the graveyard for a moment as if he wished to frighten even the dead with his terrible visage then he too walked beneath the stone portal and disappeared the dead rose from behind a large squaresided fountain in the middle of the haphazard rows of slabs one was an enormous spirit the other a small man who moved with the quick furtive utterly silent spurts of a creature used to going where it was not wanted the two spirits huddled their heads for a moment and spoke to one another you see once a week this night always the same time and the same thing the little man smiled showing crooked partially rotted teeth the only thing that ever changes is sometimes he feels her breasts and sometimes he doesnt haraldr smiled grimly and placed five silver nomismata in the little mans hands my thanks to you friend and to our mutual friend the blue star my gratitude and greetings the little man scurried off behind the monastery leaving haraldr alone with the dead he doubted that any of the souls buried in this hallowed ground were damned but if any were he had a message for them to take to the prince of hell at this time a week hence i will deliver to you the soul of the orphanotrophus joannes there were tiny black clouds high in the otherwise perfect porcelainblue sky and the sun was hot and his hair was golden with the heat she could not touch him any more but somehow her mind was inside his and she could see through his eyes though she knew she was so distant from him for a long time she did not notice the little black clouds become ravens flocking ever lower until she saw the glittering ice on top of the hill and felt the cold wind rip through his heart but beyond the ice was a creek gentle a surface of manyfaceted diamonds she whispered to him the king is on the other side and she knew when he reached the king beyond the creek he would be safe then a single raven came from the zenith of the black sky arrowswift its obsidian beak as sharp as death she felt it hit his neck and then she saw the blood pump out horribly and she reached for him desperately maria awakened shivering her tears like ice crystals on her face she sat up and listened to the stillness of the night and felt eternity round her like a black weightless shroud what does it mean she asked herself feeling as if her soul were a tiny flame fleeing ahead of her in the darkness what does it mean nephew you look so well this morning have you refreshed yourself with one of your sluts perhaps being young and foolish and this the season of renewal you have dedicated your earnest heart to one in particular joannes nodded to his secretary who closed the door to his plain immaculately cluttered office in the basement of the magnara michael kalaphates sat without greeting his uncle so you have renewed your liaison with the queen of sluts what morsels has the lovely woman given you to share with me uncle she has engineered another plot michael looked at joannes as if this were one of the most painful utterances of his life his dark lashes blinked furiously indeed how is she to accomplish this assassination i do not know the details uncle joannes picked up his pen dipped it in an ugly little porcelain inkwell and made a note on a document before him he looked up at michael once and wrote a few more words before placing his pen carefully in a small clay tray suddenly he rose like an eruption of black smoke his huge arms flying one deformed finger pointing to michaels nose like the sword of the archangel the slut has always had some plot against me you snivelling moron he thundered i do not need warnings i have the resources to deflect any of the blows that are directed at me joannes lowered his voice abruptly i need to find a way of luring her into drinking her own poison that is why i need details you witless harlotmonger can you remember anything yes michaels eyes were wide with terror her confederate in this enterprise is the manglavite haraldr nordbrikt thank you nephew you may see yourself out joannes did not look up next time we talk i hope you will have a more persuasive and thorough argument against your return to neorion when michael had left joannes leaned back in his chair and rubbed the deep sockets of his eyes so the manglavite haraldr nordbrikt would come against him excellent that made the decision so much easier yes one of the two tauroscythian swellheads had to go their connivance was too dangerous particularly at this time but then the preservation of one was just as certainly necessary and since the manglavite haraldr nordbrikt was clearly the more foolish of the two and would soon offer the same allegiance to the orphanotrophus as had the pathetic caesar the choice simply had to be the hetairarch mar hunrodarson it was time for mar hundrodarson to conclude his lengthy stay among the romans with a final exquisite night in neorion i cannot tell you mar slapped his powerful hands to his vast chest with a resounding thump as if ascertaining for himself that he was indeed the person to whom haraldr was speaking i do not believe what i just heard i have spent months trying to goad you into taking some action and now you have this insane plan that i can only assume has been inspired by your woman and i am informed that you are going to strike directly at joannes tomorrow evening but you cannot tell me where this assault will take place or who has convinced you that this scheme will not get every varangian in the roman empire killed why do i see the hand of maria in this maria is not involved i am withholding the details for your own protection if i fail the less you know the better i simply want you to be prepared when it happens haraldr knew this wasnt entirely the truth he didnt trust mar enough to name the empress but the safety of his pledgemen depended on mar knowing that the attempt would be made prepared we are not prepared if we move now without pledges from the scholae excubitores and hyknatoi everything will be lost i dont think you are aware of the considerable effort i have made to convert several topoteretes to our cause i am moving forward you are about to rush off a precipice and you are going to take the rest of us with you i have pledges that assure much more than a few topoteretes of the taghmata can offer us mar walked over and kicked at a stack of canvas tents he had agreed to meet haraldr in the storeroom beneath the barracks of the middle hetairia he looked about at the bags of field equipment battle armour and rows of ceremonial banners resting against the wall for the first time he realized how dangerous the prince of norway really was he turned back to haraldr the lives of one thousand men are at stake you had better name your confederates mars face reddened ominously do you think i would take any action that would recklessly jeopardize the life of any norseman first of all i am not going to have any trouble dealing with joannes in the place where i am planning to do this and when i succeed i have guarantees that the taghmata will be neutralized i am virtually certain that when they see what they are up against they will not even fight if they do we will crush them and i am supposed to take your word for this mar propped his hands on his hips maybe you have forgotten the lesson i taught you the night we met haraldr hadnt he clearly remembered how easily mar had overpowered him do you intend to beat this information out of me mar walked towards him that depends on you little prince haraldr had almost decided to reveal everything reasoning that he had already trusted mar with the lives of his pledgemen but mars physical intimidation galled him perhaps it does this time haraldr was ready he caught mars serpentquick arm and threw him against a row of standards mar flailed at the clattering shafts and rebounded against the wall in an instant he had lunged into haraldrs knees and sent him sprawling they grappled and rolled pummelling limbs thudding violently into the stone floor haraldr could not believe how powerful mar was he remembered wrestling with olaf when he was a little boy and yet mar was unable to pin him down they were on their feet mar glared perhaps not the rage but an inhuman fury haraldr put his shoulder down and bulled him into a pile of canvas bags mar was slapping him frantically at the ears a bag slipped away beneath haraldr and he pitched to the floor somehow mar was at his back mars arm was across his windwipe shutting it off and the knife was at his cheek this is madness shouted mar breathing furiously this is doing nothing to stop joannes he let go of haraldrs throat and put his knife away haraldr angrily shoved the canvas gear bags aside and got up on his knees it was madness he told mar where the assassination would take place and how the empress had guaranteed to exhort the city against the taghmata when haraldr had finished mar looked off to the side and rocked slightly on his heels for a pregnant interval finally he said quietly i think it will work haraldr rubbed his throat yes it will work he told himself and the next time we fight mar if i am lucky and you are not i might be able to kill you mar stormed through the halls of the numera to the wing containing the private rooms of his centurions he pounded on thorvald ostensons door and when it was opened a crack he burst in he ignored the young boy who cowered in ostensons bed and thrust his bronze oil lamp in his subordinates face i want you to go into the city and arrange an interview for me tonight without fail immediately ostenson gulped for words wwho is the concerned party hetairarch the grand domestic bardas dalassena mar watched ostenson dress as if he were afraid his centurion might climb back into bed when ostenson had left mar slammed the door on the bewildered boy and walked quickly to his own thirdfloor apartments he flung open doors and went out on his balcony wishing he could vent his rage for the entire palace to hear incredible who did he hate most himself haraldr sigurdarson or the conniving unbelievably clever slut sigurdarson incredible mar had spent months forging an alliance with alexius and theodora and in one evening with the purpleborn whore the boy prince had arrived at a plan that would probably leave the bitch zoe in power for the rest of her life had she also promised to make haraldr sigurdarson hetairarch or worse would she allow him to return to norway before he had begun to be useful this is what he had hated most about sigurdarson all along his extravagant good fortune simply to be alive and then his preposterous string of successes on top of that mar walked back inside his bedchamber picked up the enormous armoire opposite his bed flung it into the wall the massive piece of furniture shattered with a noise like a ship breaking up on the rocks mar was placated enough by the explosion of wood and ivory to think clearly for a moment of course haraldr sigurdarson was no longer worth the trouble of course he had to die the decision he had made in haste once before had been right then and it was the correct decision now but mar now wondered had he selected the proper instrument for haraldr sigurdarsons execution the enclosed atrium of the grand domestic bardas dalassenas hilltop palace featured a central fountain lined with gold tiles a lion reared up from amid the water mar studied the reflection of the candlelight in the still pool the fountain had been turned off five officers of the imperial taghmata stood guard a discreet distance across the vaulted marble chamber mar sneered inwardly he thinks that if i wanted to kill him i would send my centurion to him in the middle of the night to ask for an interview and does the fool imagine he is manifesting his strength by making me wait the ninth hour of the night passed before a topoteretes assigned to the offices of the grand domestic descended the spiral staircase he will see you now said the topoteretes the grand domestic did not greet mar when the hetairarch stepped into his quiet office mar studied the massive polished bronze water clock beside the writing table the whore flaunting her cheap jewellery thought mar with disgust dalassena riffled through the dispatches on his writing table a book on military strategy opened to drawings of stockade configurations rested on the lectern he looked up as if momentarily distracted from issues of momentous gravity the image of the military man thought mar the thick chest and powerful forearms the leathery chiselled brow and clipped wiry dark beard the image like everything in rome merely an image dalassena finally nodded for his topoteretes to leave conspicuously the aide did not close the door behind him and after a moment coughed in the hall so that mar would know he was still there mar could scarcely keep the glee off his face does dalassena fear me this much i am busy hetairarch dalassenas voice had a rich innate command mar decided he had politely suffered enough of this display he kicked the door shut and barred it with his back turd worm do you think those six boys outside can prevent me from breaking your neck like a twig to dalassenas credit his dark eyes flared with his own anger and hatred mar surmised that the grand domestic would retreat from death as long as he could but when he was finally trapped he would turn and face the valkyrja very well hetairarch dalassena shrugged apparently he had decided he still had a few more avenues for retreat i have offered you an opportunity to deal once before there is no reason why i should not offer conciliation simply because this time you are the supplicant i have negotiated with the devil many times in my career indeed you have thought mar and fair enough warning mar moved away from the door the topoteretes backed by all five guards lurched into the room and was quickly dismissed by dalassena and told to close the door again let me arrive directly at my point said mar briskly you were correct in your initial warnings about the danger of the manglavite then ordinary pirate haraldr nordbrikt he is a threat to all of us dalassenas eyes were startlingly quick and alert and you who can break necks like twigs which i do not doubt wish me to perform the execution why because if i am the executioner i will be unable to gain the loyalty of his men when he has left them bereft of his leadership dalassena jutted his chin out but i do not wish you to gain the loyalty of his men i consider them and you a scourge and would hope to see them march leaderless back to the snows of thule or perhaps the middle hetairia might fall upon the grand hetairia in a fratricidal orgy how suited that would be to my ends just when i think an ass has learned to talk with his rear end he turns around and brays at me said mar dalassena leapt to his feet his face livid with one hand mar slammed him back down into his chair listen to me fool who has bartered away his wits to the devil the deal you negotiated was with the dhynatoi not joannes now joannes is your master we both know that so far joannes has confined his attentions to the details of civil administration and left military matters to the emperor when his brother dies and we both know that is imminent joanness malignant hands will seize the military establishment surely you do not see the pathetic caesar leading the armies of rome and many are likely to be strangled in that grip dalassenas eyes said everything he had already heard rumours of the campaigns planned by joannes suicidal and yet not to obey suicidal dalassena thrust his chest out and exhaled through his nostrils so i bring you the head of haraldr nordbrikt and you bring the head of joannes mar nodded there was a pounding at the door dalassena shouted for the topoteretes to go away but the pounding continued dalassena stepped to the door his face reddening when the door was opened mar observed the face of the topoteretes something was wrong sir there is a state courier downstairs the topoteretess voice was dulled by shock you will want to hear his dispatch dalassena followed the topoteretes downstairs mar studied a carved ivory plaque on dalassenas wall it depicted st demetrius the warrior saint armoured in the fashion of an officer of the taghmata mars heart pounded has it happened if so then his haste had been more than prudent there would still be time joannes would be distracted by the massive obligations of a state funeral and the anointing of the caesar as the new emperor and perhaps by genuine grief yes there was still time mar thought his heart would leap from his breast when he heard dalassenas boots click on the marble again dalassenas face was not merely ashen but had a sickly vaguely greenish cast mar wondered if the man would swoon his eyes were stunned and impotent mar helped him to his chair dalassena rolled his eyes to mar like a dying man his voice already from the crypt bulgars he said the bulgars have already claimed paristron and macedonia and have blockaded thessalonica we have lost the western empire and they are ten days march from the walls of constantinople mar reached down clutched dalassenas collar and jerked the grand domestics deathly face up into the light that changes nothing we have settled tonight mar hissed we will throw the bulgars back and there are many perils that can befall a warrior as courageous as the manglavite haraldr nordbrikt in the heat of the battle mar let dalassena sag back into his chair dont you see it the emperor cannot lead his troops into battle you will have supreme command of the armies of imperial rome and you will have no more loyal colleague at your side than the commander of the imperial grand hetairia its madness haraldr shouted over the din inside the magnana arsenal the smoke from the torches of the optimatoi imperial baggage handlers fogged the light from the discshaped polycandelons blazing high above in the vaults at the far end of the enormous warehouse huge siege machines loomed through the haze like strange mechanical monsters the quantity and variety of military equipment being carted out and loaded on the pack mules and wagons was staggering strings of caltrops siege ladders bridge pontoons tents various sizes of portable liquid firethrowers as well as clay shells filled with liquid fire tents arrow containers leather field baths one optimatoi rushed by with a stack of bound tactical treatises why are they moving the siege engines out they are simply going to slow us down mar shook his head quizzically they think that thessalonica may fall it probably will shouted haraldr if we slow down to protect all this equipment mar nodded his agreement what are you looking for these haraldr reached in the canvas bag he carried and pulled out a soft leather ankle boot from which dangled long leather straps you wrap the straps around and they cant come off even if you step in pitch were going to run into mud and these he slapped his heavy leather knee boots are going to be trouble is the middle hetairia ready to march shouted mar just as an optimatoi carrying a basketful of horseshoes ran into him yes the decision had been easy haraldr realized first the body of rome had to be saved then he could deal with the head and the body could be healed then he could go home haraldr hefted several of the bags of footwear and shouted at a dozen of his men to start carrying off the rest are you returning to your barracks screamed mar metalworkers had started hammering on one of the siege engines yes then im going to my home in the city to get gregory my interpreter i dont want any chance of misunderstanding a battle order mar looked around the huge steaming clamouring sweatand flamesmelling warehouse his eyes jittering with excitement he clenched his steelhard fists and bellowed in the din i can already taste the ravens wine haraldr rode alone up the hill to his palace despite a steady rain the city was alive with speculation perhaps incipient hysteria a huge crowd had gathered in the forum of constantine to listen to the simultaneous harangues of various speakers with widely divergent views one longhaired youth probably a bogomil attributed the attack to the sinfulness of the city while a grizzled onelegged old man probably a veteran of the bulgarslayers campaigns recited a lurid litany of the atrocities the bulgars were even now perpetrating on the people of rome even in haraldrs fashionable neighbourhood people clustered on the street corners in small restive assemblies their concern was an imminent invasion of the city and it seemed as if every servant in the district was running to and fro on the street arms laden with bags of grain and clay jars of wine and oil as households stockpiled provisions for a siege some servants had even carted out large ivory triptychs or bronze sculptures to sell for ready cash haraldrs own street was no different the chambermaid from his neighbours house leaned over a balcony and asked him if he had seen the bulgar horde yet and was it true that they tortured women after they had raped them a cart groaned up the cobbled hill two eunuchs lashing the mule the vehicle was loaded with three fat snorting stoats no doubt illegally obtained from a pork wholesaler a woman in an expensive fur rain cape waited by the entrance portal of his palace no i havent seen the bulgars yet haraldr rehearsed mentally they are ten days march at least and we will certainly throw them back before they ever see rhegium much less the walls of the city go back to your husband and worry about the taxes that will be needed to pay for this campaign the woman walked over to haraldr before he could dismount her drenched cape cowled her head she put her hand on his boot and turned her face up haraldrs head snapped erect with the jolt of her hot sapphire eyes maria quickly took her hand away as if she had touched a glowing brazier she stared at him for a moment before she spoke i have no right but i must talk to you before you leave i must i have been waiting i have no time for your particular game mistress snapped haraldr i must play the game of war which as you say is no less trivial than a childs but one in which the wagers are paid in blood haraldr dismounted and stood over her her face was unpainted and her pale skin was beaded by the rain perhaps you can tell me how to kill a bulgar if he tries to make love to me i did not come to mock you she said softly her voice like crystal drops falling from the grey ugly sky i know i have she inhaled and stood erect i did not come to explain myself i can offer no apology what is done is done what can yet be undone i wish to undo what i have to say concerns your life haraldr shook his head wearily i should think i would be beyond your intrigues where i am going please you know i am not she paused and her lips tinted more purple than usual trembled you know the emptiness inside me i know you have tried to reach out to me i am not happy in my being her face had a desperate look he had never seen before i beg you to pity me haraldr remembered something she had once said and he wondered which eccentric star now prompted him to indeed pity her come inside haraldrs servants were in a frenzy rushing about with jars and granary sacks and taking the silver plates to the basement for storage his chamberlain nicetas gabras stood in the middle of the antechamber like a general directing an invasion haraldr just glanced at gabras in annoyance he had kept joannes lackey on because it seemed that in rome a confirmed spy was almost as valuable as a trusted friend every now and again however he had to resist the urge to stroll downstairs and literally tear gabras in two in front of his entire staff of cringing eunuchs and maidservants gregory shouted haraldr to the corners of the huge palace are you ready to go aviking with your norse comrades gregory shouted back a muffled response and after a few moments the little eunuch appeared at the far end of the antechamber he wore a linen cape and dragged a norsestyle hide gear bag in battle storm we fear no lee he exhorted with a selfdeprecating flourish haraldr grinned at gregorys kenning you are the first roman norseman he told gregory affectionately haraldr looked at gabras who was still directing his own campaign and had an inspiration chamberlain he barked leave this you are going to war gabras looked as if he had just had a knife plunged into his ribs yes you could be useful my interpreter and brave comrade here a veteran of much combat needs a batman to carry his bag to the front you are appointed to this position any delay in obeying this order will be punished by regulations governing the conduct of the middle hetairia the astonished gabras quickly capitulated to haraldrs icy eyes and attached himself to gregorys gear bag as if he had been born to the position haraldr waved for maria to follow him upstairs he walked quickly ahead of her to his vaulted candlelit bedchamber his alan girl stood in waiting her sinuous body sheathed in white silk and her opalgrey eyes anxious he kissed her marblesmooth white forehead and sent her out she walked gracefully past maria looking at her keenly almost like one stallion appraising another she is like a white leopard i saw once said maria raptly apparently unable to contain her admiration for an equally splendid female you must be beautiful together your gold and her ivory yes said haraldr and tonight when she wraps her panther legs around me she will truly regret that it may be the last time not because she loves me she hardly knows me but because i have kept her well and i have grown to see the beauty in the simple truth of that maria looked terribly pained at exactly what he did not know but he was pleased to see her anguish she bowed her head so that he could no longer see i am a mean bitch i did not want to speak of those things no let us speak of love your lovers and my lovers i have a new mistress now when i am in her arms i do not always think of you maria looked up with a faint hope written on her face i always think of you even when you are tearing flesh with some new gallant there was a lover that once i did it to i will not lie and say i did it for you i did it to save myself but there is no one now i am empty you have made your own bed mistress if it is empty then that is your own doing yes she seemed to have made some decision like a traveller who looks back on his home and knows in that instant he will never return i came to speak of a dream i had in that bed haraldr felt fear like a brief sudden gust in the room her dreams if they were to be believed had a curious prescience it was quite likely given her strange sad soul that she was one condemned to see ahead in time a seeress of sorts though apparently she could not induce the trance speak of it he told her she described the dream the ravens the king beyond the creek and the wound in his neck when she had finished she added i did not think it was important to tell you because i thought it was really about me that i missed you she shook her head blindly as if trying to toss some terrible thought out of it and a tear streamed across her temple i wanted to kill you once i thought you were the messenger of my death you know that but i dont want you to die she looked up with brimming eyes her lips contorting horribly for the first time in my experience haraldr observed amazed she looks ugly and in that moment his heart was touched she was a woman a human being not a goddess after all he had been no fool to seek her desperate lost soul please dont go to this war she said sobbing i will do anything you want i will leave rome for ever whatever i will enter a convent her shoulders wrenched with sobs please believe me you are going to die out there i saw it she clenched her fists until her knuckles burned weltred and then dropped her arms to her side as if drained of every feeling her voice fell the whispered words seemed like a cry from an abyss i could not live knowing your soul was not somewhere in this world he reached for her not so much from pity but from knowing that her fiery touch would perish this strange new incantation but she was cold almost lifeless and when she fell against him sobbing she was not an aphrodite with searing snakestealthy arms but a small girl in need of chaste comfort and somehow he touched her lonely flickering soul in a way he never had when he had felt himself deep inside her he pushed her away and held her hands afraid that at any moment the heat and light that obscured her real being might return i promise you i wont die out there he told her i am frightened so am i admitted haraldr but nothing in life is certain even destiny must sometimes stray from its own path or perhaps destiny misleads us into thinking it has strayed maria wiped her nose inelegantly and haraldr could not keep himself from holding her again you must go he told her there is too much our hearts must say to each other to again place the barrier of our naked breasts between them i will come back to you she drew away from him with her own understanding of this new virgin troth she clutched his hands one last time then dropped them and silently fled to the door but beneath the ornate lintel she paused and turned awkwardly as if her emotions had finally confused her limbs she looked back at him the blue eyes like a fjord on the last dying day of summer if i do not return he told her answering the question on her sad childs face then i want you to know that i died loving you the city of new rome did not sleep in the hours of the waning night it began to migrate from the street corners and anxious family enclaves to the forum of constantine from the districts of petrion and xeropholios from phanarion and the venetian quarter from blachernae where the great land wall meets the golden horn from sigma and deuteron even from the studion they came the guildsmen and labourers and merchants and vagrants and petty bureaucrats gnarled old women who had not been outside their homes for years babies at their mothers breasts they all came to watch the invincible armies of imperial rome go forth against the bulgar horde dawn polished breastplates scarlet tunics golden standards and banners emerged in the first diffusions of daylight the imperial taghmata had already assembled in a great procession along the avenue of the mese extending down to the chalke gate and the imperial palace complex behind the mounted regiments the imperial baggage train and the supply wagons of the taghmata jammed the augustaion and the precincts of the magnana arsenal the mules were even wandering into the open atrium of hagia sophia the head of the armoured column waited beneath the statue of the emperor constantine in the forum the enormous bronze emperor his countenance patinated with the centuries stood atop seven massive drums of porphyry a crown of rays like shafts of sunlight through a cloud haloed his godlike features and he stood with the trail of his simple tunic draped over his left arm his right arm raised as if exhorting his people he faced east searching for the rising sun that would send the armies of rome west to meet the enemies of his great city and the vast empire that he had founded the crowd that now ringed the forum and surrounded every building filled every street yard and park as far as one could see issued no ringing acclamations they were subdued their anxiety a low buzzing rumble like a distant windstorm they waited to see if rome would have a champion in this terrifying hour of need and beneath the statue of the first great christian emperor of rome the aspiring champions contested that honour the caesar must lead michael kalaphatess face crimsoned like the flushed eastern horizon as he tried to restrain his voice i have been acclaimed by the people and crowned by the patriarch that is my claim to ride out first bardas dalassena reined his arabian as equally white and gorgeous as the caesars mount his muscular forearms corded with tension you yourself acknowledge that i have supreme command the grand domestic grimaced when the emperor is present he leads the procession because of his stature as supreme commander and that alone none of his other offices pertain to this protocol that is specious replied michael his horse now circling dalassenas as if the two stallions were preparing to settle the matter nowhere in the protocols is it suggested that anyone precede the caesar except the emperor ever under any circumstance this is a matter of military not civil protocol shouted dalassena understand that i defer to you in the matter of command grand domestic said michael perfectly content as he was to relinquish responsibility for this illstarred campaign permit me to allow my children the comfort of knowing that the hand of the pantocrator will be the first to smite their enemies haraldr steered his dappled arabian away from the circling combatants and looked over at mar we need to do something he said in norse haraldr reined around to face the east thorvald ostenson at the head of the mounted ranks of the grand and middle hetairia held aloft the golden dragon standard of the grand hetairia company banners demarcated the five vanda behind the varangians were uniformed in newly lacquered roman steel byrnnies with brilliant scarlet plumes atop their helms behind the varangians the units of the taghmata headed by the goldenarmoured scholae beneath their gilded eagle standards disappeared down the mese a metallic river of latent fury it was not wise to dispatch an army of this size with any sort of doubts over their leadership but werent such doubts now unavoidable haraldr wheeled and faced the crowd to his right most of these spectators were various dignitaries from the palace precinct he could see anna dalassena and her mother standing in front a few were prosperous merchants from haraldrs own neighbourhood even these with their sophisticated understanding of the predicament had the look of peasants watching their village leader flaunt some ancient superstition haraldr could only imagine the speculation among the labourers and minor tradesmen whose duncoloured masses filled the western end of the forum if they did not get this column under way this armys first action might be against the people of constantines great city mar looked up at the green bronze face of the emperor constantine as if asking for advice he shouted for the bandmaster who commanded the two ranks of drummers trumpeters flautists and cymbal players arrayed on either side of the varangians to count twenty and commence playing then he charged his arabian between michael and dalassena the manglavite will lead mar said nostrils flaring but his voice even and dignified the grand domestic and the caesar will ride side by side behind the manglavite the hetairarch will follow the caesar and grand domestic just then the band blared into the lightening sky effectively cutting off debate the caesar and grand domestic at a loss to do otherwise lined up as mar had ordered but edged forward as each tried to move a neck ahead of the other haraldr finally blocked them with the rump of his horse anna dalassena ran out of the crowd and handed her father a spray of golden marigolds he took them with a look of mixed surprise and anger then anna came beside haraldrs horse and handed him a single white lily she held his hand as he took the flower he could not hear her well but he could read her lips easily from maria anna kissed his hand and ran back into the crowd as if on her signal the petals of spring flew into the air like snow the acclamation began at the chalke gate and swept forward with such force that it seemed like some great gust of wind even the band was palled to silence and the group of four horsemen at the front of the column turned in alarm haraldr wondered if the excubitores back on the mese hadnt begun to riot among themselves he looked at mar helplessly the sound was a hurricane that seemed as if it would throw the statue of constantine to the pavement petals flew into the air what could possibly be going on the horseman rode alone alongside the ranks in a huge rippling motion all the taghmata cavalry dismounted and the infantrymen dropped to their knees the oncoming horse was a white arabian caparisoned with gold and purple and the horseman in the finest gold armour wore purple boots with a purple cloak flowing behind his head was bare save for a single jewelled band round his forehead is joannes mad thought haraldr engaging an imposter to play the emperor the horseman was fifty ells away when haraldr realized that what he saw was not an imposter but a vision a miracle the man in imperial raiment was the emperor michael not the same man whom haraldr had adored a lifetime ago but not the same pathetic wretch who had writhed in dying agony at his convent for prostitutes he was still noticeably swollen but he rode erect in the saddle and handled his horse with power and ease and when the emperor was still a dozen ells distant haraldr could see that his eyes were more powerful more resolute than ever the eyes of a man who had seen the abyss and with the force of ultimate will had leapt over it grand domestic caesar shouted the emperor his voice audible even over the storm of his fame you will ride together preceding the imperial scholae michael kalaphates and dalassena made no attempt to compose their astonishmentslackened faces and spurred off exchanging looks that might have been passed between the centurions of old rome when they saw the door of the christs tomb rolled aside the emperor turned on haraldr and mar with a gaze of full recognition and furious purpose hetairarch manglavite you will ride behind me i alone will ride at the head of the armies of rome mar and haraldr bowed deeply and fell in behind the emperor made the sign of the cross three times then he spurred his horse slightly and the powerful beast took the first step west responding instantly to this signal the ranks behind began their march towards the destiny of rome above them the first clear shaft of the morning light caught the bronze rays that wreathed the head of the emperor constantine and gilded that ancient metal with the brilliance of the sun and so i must reiterate my conclusion that the author of the taktika cautions us against a frontal assault in this instance the grand domestic bardas dalassena flourished his hand as if he intended to produce this longdead military expert to support his views personally the emperor seated stiffly on a purplecanopied portable throne raised on a dais covered with cloth of gold studied the thick scarlet wool carpet spread out before him seemingly more interested in the pattern of highly geometricized imperial eagles than his grand domestics tactical discourse candelabra hanging from the lofty silk brocade vaults of the emperors campaign tent glittered the ornamental gold breastplates of the varangians of the grand hetairia who flanked the emperor in perfect arcs a priest set a goldframed icon and ornate gold censer at the emperors feet a persuasive and coherent summary of the advocacies of the esteemed leo said the emperor noncommittally before he finally looked up he directed his incisive eyes to the group of junior officers arrayed behind dalassena all of them like the grand domestic were attired in court robes rather than military uniform even though reconnaissance units of the bulgar army had already been engaged that very morning domestic of the excubitores said the emperor would you give us in the spirit of free and open speculation the views of the author of the strateghikon in this matter as i know that you are well read in his literature haraldr peered over the heads of the officers ranked in front of him and tried to get a glimpse of isaac camytzes the new domestic of the excubitores haraldr wished that his old friend nicon blymmedes could have been here to see this unfortunately blymmedes former domestic of the excubitores had been transferred to command of a garrison in sicily ostensibly for his failure to protect the empress near antioch actually because he opposed dalassenas chronically timid strategies but blymmedes had taught camytzes well and apparently the emperor was giving a competent junior officer an opportunity to speak without exposing him to charges of insubordination by his senior officer camytzes strode to a position equidistant between the emperor and his fellow officers he was probably only in his early thirties of medium height with dark armenian colouring that seemed to be characteristic of so many of romes best soldiers although dalassena himself also had the swarthy look of the armenikoi nicephorus phocus the esteemed author of the strateghikon as many of you know advocates the use of cataphracti in phalanx formation in order to cleave a defensive formation cataphracti dalassena snorted with a discourtesy designed to humiliate his young subaltern where are the cataphracti he looked about comically rome has not employed heavy cavalry for almost a century domestic dalassena wagged his finger for emphasis because they were too clumsy to be effective in battle this time the grand domestic looked around with immense selfsatisfaction camytzes waited for dalassena to step back among the other officers majesty i of course an aware that we no longer employ cataphracti we do however employ a powerful force of heavily armoured infantry accustomed to fighting in phalanx formation again dalassena burst forward i must protest domestic you are ill i will summon your unit physician to attend you in the field hospital immediately you imagine all sorts of mythical warriors have joined our campaign next you will call out for the achilieus himself to lead the stronggreaved achaians in this attack of yours dalassena guffawed boorishly at his own joke majesty resumed the longsuffering camytzes the force to which i am referring is the varangians of the grand and middle hetairia i have heard reports of the effectiveness of the wedge formation employed by the manglavite and his unit against the seljuks in asia minor here dalassena snorted again since that battle had in the balance gone to the seljuks and of course the effectiveness of the grand hetairia we have all seen with our own eyes camytzes stepped forward and struck his fist into his hand in a blymmedeslike gesture we have a superior striking force here we should use it to shatter the hun front hun was the derisive sobriquet for the bulgars and split their strength then we would find that the altogether worthwhile light cavalry tactics suggested by the author of the taktika could be used to surprise pursue and annihilate these remnants but without a crushing frontal assault the hun will be like a fist we cannot open camytzes smacked his fist again with the fist open we can easily hack the fingers off one by one the emperor looked at dalassena for a rebuttal dalassena paused weighing his options he decided that if there was a chance of success for this strategy he would oppose it if not this could be a defeat that would firmly entrench his prudent strategies as well as destroy this absurd myth of varangian invincibility the plan is crudely stated majesty but not without merits in its primitive configuration as it does combine elements of both the taktika and strateghikon however i would like to consult the meteorologist on this matter the emperor signed for the meteorologist to step forward an elderly man who walked with a stick carved like a serpent the meteorologist spoke in a breathless gasping fashion he had been with the bulgarslayer during his campaigns decades ago rain tonight rain early rain midday rain late day you will wonder that the forty days and nights have commenced he concluded gulping as if he were already submerged by the biblical deluge majesty said camyztes wet conditions will not favour an attack such as i have described i believe in this case the author of the strateghikon would caution us to postpone or revise our strategy majesty said dalassena we cannot postpone the dispatches we have received by messenger pigeon from thessalonica indicate preparations for an assault on the city once the hun is invested in thessalonica our problems multiply a hundredfold the domestic has proposed an innovative and excellent strategy he should learn to posit his theories with more conviction and our dauntless varangians who cringe from nothing surely we insult them with the suggestion that they would retreat before a foe as ephemeral as the rain hetairarch the emperor turned to mar who stood just to the side of his throne can you execute this attack in the conditions described mar bowed majesty i have consulted with the minsoratores who have surveyed the terrain i am convinced that the drainage is adequate to permit the grand hetairia to advance resolutely and without delay manglavite the emperors acute gaze identified haraldr in the pack of junior officers haraldr was still puzzling over mars comments about the terrain haraldr had also talked to the minsoratores the armys field surveyors who had reported difficult footing in the event of rain and mar had discounted haraldrs suggestion about footwear suited to muddy conditions still haraldr was convinced that his own men properly shod could deal with the footing majesty said haraldr the middle hetairia is also prepared to execute this attack the emperor placed his hands on his knees and leaned forward slightly then after suitable preliminaries our initial assault will be conducted by the grand and middle hetairia the emperor paused and looked around the room his eyes so intense that it seemed as if he were personally addressing each man i will take direct command of and participate in the varangian assault mar looked out over the lights of the imperial encampment it was as if a city had grown up in one evening on this empty plain north of thessalonica the fizzling smoking torches and campfires outlined a broad cruciform shape with the emperors brocadedomed tent a virtual portable palace at the nexus around this orderly city was a ring of pack animals and wagons dimly visible in the rain forming a substantial portable wall mar stamped his boot in a puddle the romans usually frightened off their enemies with this sheer display of material the bulgars knew better they had been under the roman yoke long enough to have borrowed roman equipment and tactics the truth was a good bit of this display had nothing to do with fighting capacity but with maintaining the emperors ceremonial magnificence out in the field in many cases particularly with commanders like dalassena the army seemed more intent on protecting the imperial baggage train than on attacking the enemy what fools two thousand norsemen their leader sleeping in his gear bag alongside his men could best the entire imperial taghmata mar looked for a tent on the northern wing of the temporary citys cruciform in a section allocated to junior officers of the imperial hyknatoi an incredible affront to the caesar thought mar he had not believed the emperor capable of such petty animosity and jealousy but it was just as well he realized it would make what he must do that much easier a single akrites stood outside the tent apparently the caesar was not even allowed a mandator to relay orders to him from the senior command hetairarch blurted michael kalaphates the caesar was mar reflected almost as genuinely surprised and happy as a man learning of his release from the numera odin favours this mar told himself let the pieces fall as they may michael offered mar a camp stool and a goblet of poor local wine they are even begrudging him imperialquality drink thought mar highness said mar i know you as a man who understands risks and who has also seen a good bit of warfare in the bargain since our father for some reason neglected to solicit your opinion on tomorrows enterprise i have taken the initiative and i hope i am not overly bold in this of seeking out your advice michael didnt believe the flattery for a moment but realized that it was an auspicious signal mar wanted something at least somebody still had use for him i would be happy to help as eminent a warrior as yourself in any way i could hetairarch but i must confess i know vastly more of the risks of wagering on charioteers than i do of the risks of battle perhaps i could offer you some other assistance good thought mar i didnt think kalaphates was a fool well highness i did come to discuss a wager of sorts perhaps to use a term familiar in commerce a speculation mar spread out his huge elegant hands as if displaying the sincerity of what he was about to say or perhaps his ability to impose whatever he intended to declare sincere or not let us say that it concerns the price of a certain piece of jewellery michaels eyes sparkled with interest the bauble that i am interested in is presently worthless because although there was a brief flurry of speculation in this particular piece of jewellery the prospective buyer let us call this hypothetical buyer uncle quite vanished when he discovered himself already in possession of a similar piece which he had previously thought lost this is a dreadful circumstance for the owner of this now worthless bauble for it is virtually all he has of value and without the income he had expected the sale to bring him he might not be able to eat he might even starve to death so there he is wandering the streets alone destitute when a friend sees his plight and offers to do him a favour mar locked eyes with kalaphates this friend offers to destroy the other piece of jewellery immediately raising the value of the remaining item beyond reason mar continued his manic glacial almost mesmerising stare this friend asks scant reward for this incredible benefaction for what scant reward would this friend ask hetairarch michaels dark eyes were almost as crazed as mars mar stood up his huge bulk seeming to fill the tent his voice in sinister contrast was a whisper your friend asks that once you receive payment from this uncle for this piece of jewellery and are assured that you will want for nothing for the rest of your life that you permit your friend to kill this uncle and snatch the bauble back you keep the money you have been paid for the bauble and your friend now has the bauble michael looked up at mar his voice like a falling feather the money as i see it is my life i keep that mar nodded the life of let us envision a caesar of rome a wellrespected extremely wellprotected caesar with his own personal treasury financed by a new land tax an income he can enjoy free from the burden of attending to affairs of state michaels eyes already savoured the vision and the bauble you receive hetairarch is the diadem and the attendant office of the emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans the dawn was unexpectedly luminous the cloud vault high overhead like pewter the clean steady rain almost like a glass that captured and intensified the light to a hawk soaring high above the armies of rome would have seemed a broad rectangular belt of gold silver and scarlet spread out over a dull green plain the emperor spurred his horse to the ranks of his senior aides who were grouped in front of the standards of the grand hetairia and wore goldtinted mail shirts and plumed golden helms of the imperial retinue the emperor armoured identically to his officers differentiated only by his purple boots and cape directed a command to his principal orderly droungarios the report of the mandator general the mandator general rode forward and bowed a stout not particularly militarylooking man who always wore a small enamel icon round his neck he was responsible for the final summary of all intelligence gathered by the akrites whom he supervised his spies in the enemy camp and the local peasants majesty they are encamped roughly according to the roman practice though not without critical variation in lieu of an earthwork perimeter and a cordon of caltrops they have simply spread stakes they may also have dug legbreaking pits they assume we will pursue a limited engagement today striking at their flanks with light cavalry as the ground is quite soggy at the bulgar front their deployment there will be light initially however the site is suitably graded to allow them to move reinforcements quickly the emperor wheeled his horse and studied the bulgar line visible as a jumbled mass of wagons horses and mules behind this defence the smoke from the morning campfires rose in thin tendrils that blurred greyed and merged into a huge foggy column finally disappearing among the high clouds it was a strange portent as if the sky had hung a vast ashen shroud round the bulgar camp let the priests go among the men said the emperor softly the hundreds of priests began to circulate the wisps from their smoking censers marking their passage through the ranks their sonorous chants like a dirge when the priests had worked all the way to the rear guard the emperor removed his simple goldandpearl diadem handed it to an attendant eunuch a second eunuch brought him his engraved gold helm on a silk pillow the emperor placed the conical helmet on his head his chest worked in slow heaves grand domestic he said evenly begin your diversion the band signalled the attack with the characteristic blaring of trumpets and pounding of drums and cymbals the cross has conquered bellowed the units of the imperial scholae five ranks of mounted archers and lancers as they lurched forward picked up speed and began their thundering charge on the bulgar centre the scholae quickly reached bowshot of the bulgar lines and the first volley rose like a dense flock into the air then abruptly alighted here there a horse went down the scholae stampeded the bulgars outermost cordon of pack animals and wagons then veered sharply towards the bulgar flanks to divert the enemys attention away from the centre they had just left vulnerable soon the flanks were heavily engaged bulgar standards could be seen moving towards the left and right perimeters of their enormous encampment after perhaps a quarter of an hour hundreds of akrites rode from a small copse just beyond the bulgars left flank directly through the remnants of the bulgars muleandwagon wall puffs of flame appeared as the akrites hurled clay shells filled with liquid fire into the wagons the fire and smoke drove most of the remaining pack animals away visible behind the black pillars of smoke was the vast mass of the bulgar army domestic of the hyknatoi shouted the emperor the imperial hyknatoi charged off as the scholae had before them this time many horses and men went down as the charge hit the exposed centre of the bulgar formation after several volleys of arrows and spears the hyknatoi retreated to join the flank attacks in the wake of their assault wounded and dying horses could be seen kicking the air like toppled clockwork miniatures a mandator came galloping back towards the roman ranks his horse steaming in the cold rain and his face bright red majesty the flanks are fully engaged domestic of the numeri haraldr felt fear as if awakening to a knife in his ribs the numeri were the infantry division of the taghmata they would support the varangian assault once if the breakthrough was made hetairarch manglavite haraldr ordered his men to dismount batmen circulated among the ranks of the middle hetairia and led the horses to the rear haraldr walked to the horses of the emperor and his aides mar also dismounted came to his side his icehard eyes already glimmered with odins gift proceed in ranks hetairarch before mar could turn and give the order the emperor astonished everyone within seeing by arduously dismounting from his towering white arabian if he felt pain upon standing he did not display it there was only a furious resolution on his powerful features majesty uttered the droungarios helplessly send my horse for me when our attack has been successful droungarios said the emperor these men fight on foot and as i am joining them so will i mar led the grand hetairia out in two relatively narrow ranks the middle hetairia followed also in two ranks of two hundred and fifty men abreast the emperor walked alongside mar beneath the dragon standard of the grand hetairia his step heavy purposeful fifty paces out of bowshot mar turned and shouted boar the ranks of the grand hetairia folded like wings against the middle hetairia creating a layered fleshandmetal pyramid with mars men on the outside and haraldrs men forming a compact solid inner wedge the emperor took his place just ahead of haraldr at the snout of the boarwithinaboar mar stood alone at the apex of the outer boar his face twitching with fury the guttural cries of the bulgars stilled as the varangian formation a huge lethal arrow pointed directly at their centre it was possible to hear a dying man wail theotokos over and over the rain fell in large clear drops mar raised his gilded axe in unison the varangians slammed their axe blades flat against the hard oak planks of their shields the sound was like the breathing of some colossal beast again again mesmerizing terrifying the boar advanced to this deadly cadence the bulgar arrows descended in buzzing swarms but largely clattered harmlessly off byrnnies helms and shields shouts came back to watch for the rows of sharpened stakes and the wedge rocked and surged as men manoeuvred round the crude barriers two varangians in the first rank tumbled into a shallow concealed pit one scrambled up but the other screamed as he was impaled on a stake the bulgars became individual faces stubbled chins red noses bad teeth mars oath could be heard curiously muted above the almost deafening din he pounded the canvasclad infantrymen at the bulgar front with huge bludgeoning strokes so relentlessly that it seemed his foes were ritualistically kneeling before him except that these supplicants had been anointed with brilliant blood as mar split their skulls and hacked off their arms mar stepped over his writhing butchered victims and before he had killed half a dozen men the bulgars fell back without even offering him resistance shoving and trampling their own in an effort to escape the varangian scythe the rest of the boar followed mar into the frantic scrambling bulgar retreat moving almost as steadily as it had when unopposed in the middle of the boar haraldr and his men had little more to do than protect themselves against arrows and step over the grotesque akimbo corpses most of them with gaping axe wounds at first the bodies lay in only a few inches of dark watery muck but soon the dead and dying were virtually submerged in the clinging ooze both the varangian advance and the bulgar retreat slowed inexorably the hail of arrows and spears became heavy and steady now varangians fell into the mud the boar stopped haraldr stood on a dead mans back and looked ahead mar was immobilized in muck up to his knees crouched behind his shield as the archers and javelin throwers pelted him mars men surged up to protect him but many of them were forced back by spearthrusting phalanxes of bulgar infantry haraldr quickly ascertained that the men of the grand hetairia hindered by their clumsy boots could no longer advance he relayed the commands back through ulfr and halldor the middle hetairia will now move to the front haraldr shouted his plan to the emperor who fearlessly joined him in slogging to the mired snout im taking the snout haraldr yelled in mars ear when we have passed your men will have time to take off their boots and can come in behind us mar nodded drunkenly he is deep in the spirit world haraldr thought did you hear me screamed haraldr yes we will fall in behind haraldr strapped his axe to his back and unsheathed his sword the rage seized him like an angry wolf he leapt out at a short stout bulgar infantryman in a metalstudded leather jerkin and slashed him across his torso severing an arm and crumpling his chest the dead mans comrades fell back at the appearance of this new norse titan and haraldr lifted his knees high to keep moving to keep pressing them his varangians stayed tightly behind him the bulgars made a brief stand with long spears but haraldr and his men fended off the metaltipped shafts with their shields then with swords and axes made the bulgars pay for their resistance haraldr looked back across the corpsestrewn bog to make certain that mars men were following alarm swept through him in a nauseating wave mar had not advanced a step and clearly had no intention to he had drawn his men into a tight circular shield fort they were waiting for the numeri to rescue them in an instant haraldr knew what had happened though he probably would be unable to convince anyone who did not share odins gift mar was deliberately abandoning haraldr and the men of the middle hetairia and if odin gives me another day haraldr vowed i will kill him for that betrayal the valkyrja hovered preparing to snatch away that day bulgar infantry by the many hundreds the vanguard of thousands were now trudging into the muck that separated the two varangian forces intending to encircle them both they were armed with long spears and good steel helms and metalplated canvas byrnnies haraldr knew that if his men were stopped and forced to form a shield fort the numeri would never reach them the middle hetairia would dwindle to a pile of twitching corpses over a long desperate afternoon there was only one escape to continue relentlessly forward to the very heart of the bulgar army and pierce it with hunland steel haraldr fought forward with a renewed frenzy and a solid front of bulgars spears set panicked and ran their retreat exposed a muddy little creek running perpendicular to haraldrs advance and behind the creek was a wall of wideeyed jittery horses crowded flank to flank their chests covered with quilted batting the riders wore mail byrnnies and heavy steel greaves this was the vaunted bulgar heavy cavalry what had maria said the king beyond the creek but the creek was not safety in her dream he had died before he reached the creek as he would here but if he could cross that creek could he defeat that fate he screamed at ulfr and halldor those men are not afraid but their horses are we must let them know the axe and push beyond the creek and for some reason he could not fathom he added the bulgar khan is just beyond it the little creek was muddied by the rain not diamondfaceted as maria had seen it in her dream and the water was bloodrusset haraldr waded in prayed to odin to accept these innocent animals as sacrifice and buried his axe blade into a horses quilted chest the scream of the poor dumb beast sickened him the horse toppled and haraldr pushed forward to yet another slaughter as he killed his second horse he realized that his feet were no longer in water and the men behind him were now able to start coming across the creek their masters brought the horses to what seemed unending slaughter for a time the sky almost seemed to rain equine blood soon the shallow slope rising from the creek was littered with dead beasts and their riders but haraldr knew that the torturous ascent was rapidly draining his reserves the axe was a weapon for short bursts not this sustained butchery haraldr prayed to all the gods that this cavalry was the khans last line of defence the headflinging frantic horses retreated haraldr looked back and saw most of his men advancing well up the slope when he looked ahead he saw the khans last defence and knew that he would never see the king beyond the creek at the top of the rise waited another wall not terrified animals but huge fierceeyed redfaced men in long mail coats armed with hunland steel the khans elite guard and they were so many they blocked the horizon haraldr knew that there was nothing left but to take as many of these souls as possible with him to the valhol they came forward eagerly grunting thrusting spears hammering at emmas silky invulnerability his ribs ached with the blows that had yet to break the links but were breaking him up inside his men were dying all around him and in some strange reflexive requiem he silently tolled their names as they fell joli stefnirson kolskeg helgison thorvald kodranson a javelin glanced off his neck and he could feel the blood immediately that was what her dream had promised him that was the destiny he had seen in her eyes the first night she had drawn him into them he was isolated it seemed that even the final desperate shieldfort had collapsed his arm seared with every stroke and yet the furiously cursing metal demons still could not overwhelm him he had no idea where his men were ulfr halldor the emperor was he tolling their names because they too had fallen a blow from behind almost knocked his helm off a light flashed before his eyes he shook his head to clear it but the light still glared the sun the sun had burst through the clouds and driven a slender brilliant shaft into the bulgar horde just ahead of him he knew that he must reach it he hurled himself forward in one last desperate assault before that light like odins voice faded beneath the black wings of the last dragon he sent a jaw flying in a crimson spray his sword crunched a byrnnie so hard he could feel the bones shatter beneath the steel skin he went forward on faith and courage not knowing why he had to reach the light and he realized that other men had joined him the men he had thought lost first the emperor and then ulfr and halldor and jolis brother hord he could look back now and see hundreds of his men still with him still advancing questing with him for the light the push from behind was now the blood lust of the middle hetairia something fractured in the great body of the bulgar army for a moment the khans guard hesitated stunned at the resilience of the bloodied yet still furious beast that had penetrated to the living heart of their great horde to the last human redoubt of their khan and then they gave in to some collective primal fear many dropped their weapons and ran towards the encircling skeins of the roman cavalry preferring capture to a less certain fate on the tusks of the beast they could never kill some of those too close to the boar to think they could outrun it had simply dropped to their knees to beg for mercy among those terrified petitioners was the bulgar khan haraldr looked around wondering he stood within the shaft of sunlight now a light reflected off the helms and byrnnies of the bulgars as they humbled themselves in sunglazed mud all around them was a litter of discarded weapons as if a ghost army had vanished leaving behind only artefacts borrowed from the living far to the left and right the horsemen of the scholae hyknatoi and excubitores could be seen standards proudly aloft as they herded huge ragged groups of bulgar prisoners behind the bloody horribly diminished ranks of the middle hetairia were nothing but corpses the emperor stepped in among the kneeling bulgars alounsianus he commanded the name of the bulgar khan a desperatelooking mediumsized man whatever cleverness or courage he had employed to gain his throne utterly blanched from his face rose up from the mud and clasped his trembling hands in supplication the tossing clouds closed on the sun and the dimming light flickered over the defeated khan then the clouds rolled aside the sun exploded in its full radiance and as he swooned from loss of blood haraldr was certain that he was floating up towards a golden dome vi the prefect of the city and the logothete of the symponus waited for the parakoimomenos of the imperial palace beneath the arch of the golden gate the great land wall loomed above them the invincible ashlar expanse glazed with the morning sun attended by his retinue of imperial cubiculari gleaming like antimony in his white silk and crowned with his pure silver hair the parakoimomenos exchanged nods with the prefect and the logothete exquisitely done said the parakoimomenos as he looked down the avenue before them freshly swept and watered almost bonewhite the mese extended east towards the distant imperial palace and as far as one could see the entire route was a multihued corridor of brilliant hanging carpets and tapestries a human tide held back by cursores and khazars crushed in on either side of the avenue the parakoimomenos blinked into the ascending sun and gauged that it was time for the long day to begin komes of the walls he directed open the gates the komess ceremonially armoured assistants cranked open the massive bronze gates and the dignitaries stood aside to let the procession enter the city the first rider was seated on a dulleyed decrepit donkey he wore tattered rags and garlands of pig intestines swarming with flies were draped over his shoulders the rider could not see the spectacle before him because he was seated backwards on his transport he could not see behind either because his eyes crusted with scabs and ooze had been put out with hot irons the sightless man raised his head in response to the fantastic gale of obscenities and jeers that greeted him and the empress city could now see the hideous noseless face of the man who had dared to assault her alounsianus khan of bulgaria had finally breeched the walls of rome the bulgar generals followed on foot then their officers and men an unending procession of haggard confused sullen faces and filthy brown tunics as the pantocrator is merciful most had been spared their eyes and noses the army of the vanquished flanked by steeltrimmed khazars became a strange dirtcoloured serpent of misery slowly crawling through the brilliant polychrome of the triumphant city the parakoimomenos again computed the time as the last of the bulgars disappeared down the mese incredible he had had no expectation that so many barbaroi wretches had been taken prisoner he signalled the logothete of the symponus at whose order hundreds of street sweepers descended on the avenue the newly swept streets were washed again this time with rose water hundreds of labourers spread thick richly patterned carpets over the perfumed pavement dozens more workers hung polycandelons and even ornate candelabra in the streetlevel arcades residents suspended oil lamps and pungently smoking censers from their balconies jewelled icons were placed on balustrades or cradled in the arms of their proud owners the surging crowd of onlookers sprouted ceremonial branches and sprigs of laurel and olive then all the lamps were lit completing the transformation of the entire citylong length of the mese into a glittering cathedral nave outside the walls a band blared and the crowd answered with ringing cheers the parakoimomenos nodded to the designated cubicularius to bring forward the victory crowns two simple yet precisely woven laurel wreaths and the goldandpearl bracelet that would also be presented to the emperor extraordinary thought the parakoimomenos the varangian haraldr nordbrikt would receive the second wreath of victory and walk directly behind the emperor of course the bulgarslayer would have approved but nonetheless it was extraordinary and the other changes the middle hetairia would march directly behind their emperor and manglavite and the grand hetairia would not march at all they were apparently mopping up remnants of the bulgar army near nicopolis and the rumours that the grand domestic would soon be promoted to strategus of cilicia and the domestic of the excubitores named to replace him already the imperial chrysobulls appointing the heroes to their new dignities had become a virtual purpleink deluge in the offices of the parakoimomenos well the parakoimomenos reflected such is the nature of war to endlessly shuffle the offices and dignities of imperial rome the parakoimomenos watched as the voukaloi took their positions by the gate the ceremonial chorallers wore black robes velvet bonnets and necklaces of fresh roses he nodded to their leader to prepare himself then he walked through the golden gate into the shadows of the great land wall and threw himself on his face in the street for the prescribed three prostrations when he rose he did not permit himself even to look upon the face of the pantocrators glorious viceregent on earth with a trembling hand he gestured that the city awaited its god glory to god who has magnified the light of the emperor of the romans choralled the voukaloi glory to the holy trinity for returning our glorious master victorious the bellclear chants echoed as the voukaloi repeated them again and again interweaving the choruses into an intricate continuous tapestry of sound as he had been instructed haraldr made certain that he remained five paces behind the emperor he could already see the multicoloured incandescence of the mese through the shadowed arch of the golden gate and the sight made his knees weak he remained beneath the arch while the emperor received the gold arm ring and then stooped slightly to allow the prefect to place the laurel wreath upon his head the acclamation of the crowd swept through the arch like a gale then the emperor turned to haraldr and beckoned him into the light for a moment haraldr had to shut his eyes against the glare and with the thunderous clamour blocking all his other senses he felt as if he no longer walked the earth but had been swept away by a rushing cyclone haraldr bowed and the emperor took the second laurel wreath and placed it gently on his head his hands brought haraldr erect his weary eyes the campaign and its final brutal assault had certainly taken their toll glowed with profound gratitude then the emperor stepped forward and led haraldr into a whirlwind of glory such as only rome could bestow the storm raged for hours from the forum of arcadius to the forum bovis to the forae of taurus and constantine then the augustaion and into the hagia sophia for a reception by the patriarch neither the tempest of acclaim nor the blizzard of strewn petals ever abated behind the emperor and haraldr the middle hetairia and the imperial taghmata received the same joyous reception after leaving the hagia sophia the procession stopped in front of the chalke gate and the emperor ascended to a golden throne that had been set up in the open square the voukaloi were now accompanied by the pulsing notes of a golden organ the ponderous sound machine rose like a small building beside the throne when the music stopped the crowd hushed magically leaving a ringing silence in the ears the emperor described the campaign in great detail and enumerated the spoils of victory at prescribed intervals the crowd burst out in ritual acclamations then the emperor turned to haraldr and began to emphasize the valour of the varangians of the middle hetairia and their manglavite this man saved rome concluded the emperor eliciting a whooshing wavelike oath from the crowd haraldr looked out at the glittering avenue filled with rapt faces and saw the funeral pyres of the one hundred and fortythree pledgemen of the middle hetairia who now wassailed at the benches in the valhol he prayed to odin to give them this vision of the victory they had earned and he promised them that when mar returned to the empress city they would be avenged the final act of the extended drama was played in the hippodrome the emperor was allowed to refresh himself in his apartments beforehand and then he joined haraldr and his retinue to climb the marble staircase to the imperial box while the dignitaries prepared for his entrance the emperor took haraldr aside it was not the first time they had talked privately after the battle they had discussed the engagement as one warrior to another and they had relived the fragile immortal instant when the conjoined wills of just two men had somehow broken the collective wall of the bulgar army in spite of or perhaps because of this days apotheosis the emperor seemed even more human than he had in that earlier interview it is often said that it is less fatiguing to win victory on the field than it is to celebrate that victory in constantinople he told haraldr softly with a wistful little smile then two patricians appeared to escort him into the imperial box haraldr followed and looked out on the scores of thousands of people who filled the stadium the elongated oval race path was completely obscured by the bulgar prisoners who stood mute and motionless within the ring of the khazars amid this beaten mob emerged the ancient columns and obelisks and statues set upon the stadiums central spina a great bronze bull a beautiful woman said to be the helen of the iliad a naked aphrodite and an armoured ares grotesque demons and a soaring bronze column formed of three twined serpents the hippodrome was silent the emperor made the sign of the cross three times he nodded at the request of the parakoimomenos and the voukaloi stood and chanted the roman hymn of victory let us sing to the eternal god most high for pharaohs chariots he hath cast in the sea when the singing had been concluded the stadium fell silent again the bulgar khan alounsianus was brought into the box and the swarthy logothete of the dromus threw the vanquished ruler down on the imperial dais and pressed his mutilated face against the goldembroidered purple imperial boots the emperor stood his face to the crowd and placed first one boot and then the gilded tip of a ceremonial spear against the khans neck down on the floor of the hippodrome the khazars shoved the rest of the bulgars into the sand forcing them to emulate their khan the crowd reacted with manic earsplitting glee haraldr saw in the sad eyes of the emperor little taste for this ritual humiliation demanded by agesold protocol and the psychic needs of a frightened populace haraldr thought again of how only a single step had separated these two men the triumphant victor and the mutilated vanquished he realized that if he had halted at that moment when it had seemed that all that was left was to die well then the khan would be standing here now displaying to the captive populace of rome the head of their emperor what had pushed him on when even odin had wearied of his fate perhaps maria and yet perhaps she had only been an agent of some greater fate a destiny so profound that even norway was only a part of it a destiny that now encompassed all rome perhaps the entire worldorb but even as he saw the huge dimensions of that fate and felt himself drawn towards its whirling vortex his soul was chilled with an equally profound foreboding haraldr looked across the stadium oblivious to the leaping chorusing mob in the seats and watched the setting sun spill over the roofs of the great city like a golden lacquer the dust stirred by the grovelling bulgars rose in a faint fog to cast an eerie apocalyptic dusk over the proceedings destiny whispered to him in that haunted twilight an ineffable confusion of riddles and replies the gods commanded me to save rome that day thought haraldr will they perhaps one day ask me to destroy rome today i vow to serve this emperor well yet why does my soul tell me that there will come a day when i will throw the sightless face of a roman emperor into the dust giorgios maleinus considered himself quite gifted at his profession a tall man who suffered from a rheumatism of the joints that was making him progressively shorter as he neared his sixth decade he drank too much and had few illusions about his social standing in the city he knew hed never even be permitted to buy an exarchs diploma and for that matter he didnt give a phoney saints splinter whether he ever got to stand in the same room as the emperor or not the fact that he was at this moment in a room face to face with the emperors brother proved how much all those cookedup titles were worth yes the swollenheads at court came and went but giorgios maleinus was always in business the business of buying cheap and selling dear eminence said maleinus his inflection deceptively rustic i would like to invite you as my guest to see the property make your own judgement of the facilities when you compare what you see to the price i am asking you will consider yourself fortunes favourite fortunes favourite thought constantine bitterly the emperors miraculous recovery was fortunes boot in the ass his poor nephew the caesar was in virtual exile denied even the privilege of entering the palace it wasnt fair either perhaps the caesar hadnt been a hero in the bulgarian campaign but no one had given him the chance to be excuse me eminence said maleinus rubbing at his swollen red nose with his stiff fingers but would you like to see the property ah quite tell me why this superlative establishment is offered at the price one might expect to pay for a rocky hillside and a wooden chapel well eminence youre not a man to toy with that is certain so i will give you the truth in the sight of the pantocrator the monastery on the isle of prote once enjoyed a generous typicon drafted under the bulgarslayer may the pantocrator keep his soul and it grew surpassingly wealthy some say under the patronage of someone in the bulgarslayers family they dont say who apparently the patron died and the typicon was not renewed now just so you cant say giorgios maleinus concealed the entire truth from you the reason the typicon wasnt renewed is because there was a bit of a scandal out there really said constantine faintly interested at least some outrageous rumour would enliven this dirt merchants pedestrian presentation constantine looked out of the window of the virtually nonfunctional office he had been so generously granted in the palace complex the view was of the blank south wall of the numera and longed for antioch yes eminence it seems that the chartophylax of this monastery an ancient fellow got it into his head that the brother abbot of the establishment was actually a demon they say this old bookbuzzard murdered the brother abbot and fled to cappadocia i think the sin of sodom was about the place and that was the cause of the trouble but whatever the emperor wouldnt renew the typicon and the establishment was out of business but ill tell you eminence though the monks have been gone for four or five years the establishment is a jewel in the diadem of the pantocrator so to speak youd just have to clear out the birds nests and you would be back in business so why hasnt someone already bought it for this immorally scant price you have mentioned arranged for a new typicon and reaped the bounty of prote surely anyone with even minor influence at court could obtain a new charter thats the trouble eminence and why i see yourself as a prospective purchaser of unusual qualities it seems that your brother the esteemed orphanotrophus joannes had mandated that under no circumstances may a new typicon be drafted for the monastery at prote i thought that with you being cut from the same bolt so to speak indeed constantine hoped his flushed forehead would not bead so quickly as to betray his sudden fascination with the monastery at prote well sir you are a most persuasive orator i can hardly see what harm could come from sailing out to view this establishment particularly since we are enjoying fair weather the emperor indicated to his chamberlain that he would speak informally with the visitor and the whiterobed eunuch backed away like a statue on wheels mar was invited to approach the immense purplecanopied golden throne the emperor had resumed his daily audiences in the chrysotriklinos the main throne room for nondiplomatic receptions and he presided beneath the exact epicentre of a huge golden cupola supported by eight regularly spaced apses a ring of silver candelabra wreathed the dome with light the days business had run well into the night hetairarch the emperors voice betrayed no weariness of his resumed duties he assumed his usual perfectly erect posture his hands resting flat on his thighs his eyes were as hard as the gems of his diadem you are well yes majesty mar wore no uniform or badges of his office only a dark wool cape with a cowl he had been ordered to keep over his head he had been brought from paristron in a curtained carriage and had been escorted to the chrysotriklinos as soon as he had arrived in the city i have learned that you have completed your assignment in paristron with industry and thoroughness my children particularly those of the paristron theme who were displaced from their homes are grateful to you and in the name of the pantocrator i thank you for them mar bowed majesty the emperor flexed his fingers and propped his hands lightly on his thighs i have been considering your next assignment hetairarch in your absence i have reflected upon the performance of the grand hetairia in the battle in which we were victorious over the bulgars i have concluded that your contribution both personally and as commander of the grand hetairia was short of the standards expected of a unit commended not only with the protection of romes autocrator but with the preservation of the glorious history and legacy of the grand hetairia the emperor leaned forward slightly and stared intensely at mar as if looking for something behind his glassy eyes there are those around me who suggest that the actions of the grand hetairia and principally the hetairarch were either treason or cowardice or both the man who led us to victory that day your fellow tauroscythian haraldr nordbrikt is particularly suspicious having experienced that battle myself and having seen the very real difficulty you and your men were in i think haraldr nordbrikts interpretation of your actions while understandable has been inflected by the loss of his men and the emotions of that day but since i do understand the feelings of haraldr nordbrikt and since i can hardly afford to have my varangians fall on one another to settle this matter among themselves i have made certain that you and haraldr nordbrikt have been separated so far and i intend to continue that separation hence your assignment in paristron and the secrecy with which you have been brought here perhaps at a time when our borders are more secure i will permit haraldr nordbrikt to discuss your actions with you personally but for the moment i need you both in my service the emperor allowed his hands to settle slightly hetairarch i know as perhaps no other man does that you are an officer who has served me well and faithfully through many campaigns and who until this regrettable incident has had to apologize to no one for his courage or his loyalty but you are also an officer who has let his performance erode to the point where comment has been occasioned as i am certain you understand such comment cannot be permitted of the emperors personal guard for it invites active indeed armed speculation that could be fatal not only to the regent of rome but also to the empire itself accordingly i have determined to relieve you of your office of hetairarch and to transfer you and your men to italia henceforth your title will be droungarios of the catapanate of italia this new position as you know is a significant responsibility in fact the situation in italia was critical and the emperor considered the dispatch of the suspect mar a necessary gamble right now the province was as good as lost to the saracens and any treachery of mars could hardly make the situation worse and perhaps mar would redeem himself the emperor regretted that haraldr nordbrikt would not have his vengeance as soon as he had hoped but the emperor regretted many of the things this office had forced him to do i intend that you interpret this appointment as an expression of my confidence that you will regain the discipline and effectiveness that have served your emperor and the roman empire so well in the past the emperor made the sign of the cross the indication that the audience had ended mar crossed his arms over his breast and retreated from the colossal throne the deposed hetairarch concealed within a ring of khazar guards was escorted through the silver doors and ushered to the curtained carriage waiting beside the porch of the chrysotriklinos before he was sealed inside mar took a final look at the black lightrimmed bosporus the torches of his escort cast an orange reflection in his brooding irises and for a moment it seemed that mar was gazing out on a sea of fire hetairarch haraldr may i fill your goblet said the wife of the magister whose name haraldr had not remembered she fluttered lashes as thick as bowstrings and revealed her fleshy bosom as she filled her own gold cup from a stream of ambertinted wine flowing from the lips of a bronze ram the tribute fame demands thought haraldr he smiled politely and accepted above him the gilded intricately perforated cone of the mystic fountain of the triconchus rose like a golden cypress amberhued wine gurgled from within the elaborate fountain and collected in the bronze pool at the base then was spouted to the guests via the mouths of various bronze breasts plates full of nuts pastries and fruits surrounded the wine spouts and marble steps descended to an open plaza crowded with the elite of the imperial court magisters patricians proconsular patricians senators the wives were deployed in force for these openair receptions readily encouraged the informal mixing of the sexes hetairarch importuned the logothete of the dromus his ragged rodents teeth showing you must come to my offices and furnish me with the most current information on bulgar infantry tactics i need to know which of their weapons are most effective from whence they are obtaining them that sort of thing perhaps we can inhibit the trade in these materials the logothete peered into haraldrs chased golden goblet discard that common stuff hetairarch let me introduce you to a vintage from italia the logothete pointed to a cubicularius standing near a largerthanlifesize waterspouting bronze lion the eunuch tipped his silver ewer and poured haraldr a goblet of rubycoloured wine the logothete looked up at the new hetairarch with the dark eyes of asia i believe there is some misunderstanding between you and the orphanotrophus joannes no the orphanotrophus and i understand each other entirely haraldr silently reflected on that understanding he had decided that he would wait and see if the emperor was as courageous when seated on his throne as he was when slogging over bulgar corpses and if so give him an opportunity to deal with his brother joanness crimes but this delay did not concern him because he realized he already had joannes on the rack just like one of joanness own victims in the neorion and until the emperor or if necessary haraldr himself meted joannes the ultimate justice he deserved haraldr would force joannes in his own fashion to praise the pantocrator the logothete licked his lips i would like to mediate your differences as a servant of rome i am concerned with reducing fissures at the level of government you now occupy and i believe that the orphanotrophus currently finds himself in a posture that would encourage him to forge alliances on terms quite favourable to his newly won friends haraldr drained his cup and handed it to the hovering eunuch thank you logothete the wine was excellent at some time i should like you to advise me on how i can import this vintage you may tell the orphanotrophus that i have received his invitation and am considering a reply haraldr walked back past the mystic fountain he was detained by the greetings of half a dozen dignitaries along the way he looked enviously at a gull soaring in the lapislazuli sky and wished he could enjoy the beauty of this day and setting without the grasping company of the elite among romes elite who merely seemed to increase in avarice insincerity and dissimilitude the higher they rose in their multihued hierarchy even the women seemed to have lost the joy of flirtation and approached their prospective liaisons with the grim intensity of grizzled field commanders of course there was a battle to be won on that field as well haraldr reminded himself hetairarch the wife of the senator and proconsular patrician romanus scylitzes ambushed haraldr in front of the gleaming silver door of the triconchus the domed palace that faced the mystic fountain on the east she was blonde elegant with small perfect grecian features and a beauty curiously enhanced by the evidence found in small creases about her eyes and lips that it had recently begun to fade her husband was the most notorious windbag at court reviled by even the pompous hellenes with whom he affected intellectual kinship you will think me silly when i tell you my husband is watching us haraldr looked around and located the vigilant husband the whitehaired senator and proconsular patrician surrounded by his posturing cronies in the attalietes dhynatoi clique was indeed conducting a clumsy clandestine surveillance each time he sipped from his cup his eyes darted over the rim of the goblet and allowed him a glimpse of his wife please do not think that i presume she stammered her cheeks flushed in vivid contrast to the high pearlstudded white collar of her scaramangium he is watching to see if i do as i am told he wants me to thank you profusely for stemming the tide of the bulgar advance im sorry that i cannot quite remember the phrase that compared your feats to those of alexander but i am to thank you because our own estates in thessalonica theme were spared a great loss by your bravery tell him i accept his gratitude and am greatly pleased by the emissary he has sent to express it haraldr understood now the emperor had granted haraldr one third of the tax revenues from paristron macedonia and thessalonica for the next five years and apparently the land magnate scylitzes was hoping for some kind of reduction in the amounts his estates owed however i cannot intervene in the matter of his taxes which i understand have already been reduced by various connivances scylitzess wife almost purpled with shame and haraldr was sickened by the imminence of her tears i am sorry he said you were only performing your filial duty i should have been more gracious no she said shaking her head and appearing to gain control of herself it is we who should be ashamed he would not approach you on this issue because he would never deign to speak personally to a she blushed again barbaros offered haraldr he watched the insufferable scylitzes spew forth his putative eloquence in accompaniment to the spouting of the fountain so with all those words at his avail he must send his wife to speak for him i appreciate your liberality in delivering his request he he says i should offer myself to you if necessary would you you would not accept i would accept your offer i simply would not agree to reduce his taxes because i could not in fairness accept so much from him and give back so little in return the woman smiled at the flattering reprieve from both her husbands demands and the prospect of having this giant rip her in two although she now wondered if the barbaross tongue was capable of other subtleties you are a kind man hetairarch she said bowing slightly as she returned to her flatulent spouse for a barbaros haraldr told himself completing her thought he was about to find some excuse to make to the parakoimomenos when he noticed that even scylitzes had been rendered momentarily speechless he walked around to the fountain to see what marvel had occasioned this miracle maria he watched her emerge from the ambulatory surrounding the sigma she did not wear her usual revealing costume but instead had donned a white scaramangium and pallium in spite of the heat still there was the same sensual graceful insouciance in her walk that arrested both men and women haraldr watched the eyes of the dignitaries as they studied her and he realized that maria was considered much like him an exotic undeniably puissant force but also dangerous and unsavoury because of her openness and candour she had come to represent all the secret schemings and scandals locked in their own far less honest breasts she saw him and came directly for him her face glowing and her fierce blue eyes wet she held out her hands but did not embrace him i will not burden you with my questionable repute among these august personages she said smiling radiantly but with tears now rolling off her lashes haraldr wanted to hold her but reasoned that she knew the manners of this court far better than he i am sorry i have not been able to see you haraldr said this new office requires all my time i am fortunate to be able to enjoy if that is the word even a quasiofficial function such as this but of course you are always with me you were with me there she shook her head and the tears ran down her cheeks i am so glad you are alive just knowing that has made each day a joy do you know that you saved my life but i didnt she said happily you went in spite of my warning and yet you are alive she looked up at him as if beholding the miracle of his resurrection my dreams are meaningless she said this with such great happiness and relief that haraldr decided not to tell her about the creek and the king who had waited beyond it you saved me because your soul helped me forward when there was nothing else he improvised a distortion that was less profound than the truth you do not have to say that she said what you told me before you left was enough suddenly her eyes doubted that was true he told her and still is why in fact i survived out there i do not know for certain but you were indeed with me then yes that has the resonance of truth she said drawing herself up and projecting her breast with wry selfconfidence she seemed very girlish and keen perhaps more like anna since you have been gone i have spent much of my time listening for the truth and what have you heard a great deal will you tell me her eyes were utterly clear and guileless like a completely still fjord i want to very much you are the reason i have begun to hear these things or if not hear them for the first time at least begin to listen to them she smiled at him and shaded her marblehued forehead against the sun one thing i know is that i have always put the act of love or perhaps in my case act of hate before the idea of love what you said about flesh coming between our hearts is true you know the love i have here she patted her abdomen with both hands but i want you to feel the love i have here she touched her fingers to her breast and for all my experience with the other love i do not know much of this she pressed her fingers against her heart love haraldr was so deeply touched he doubted that his own sincerity was equal to hers perhaps i am no specialist in this he touched his heart love either i believe it is a study that takes time its truths are not arrived at in a night of hot wet embrace she smiled deliriously but wistfully as if remembering a pleasure she would not taste again our passion was something grand and glorious but it was a tower that rose too high on a foundation of air can we tear it down and begin again and this time build something solid even if less brilliant and overwhelming to the senses something we can live in haraldr still could not trust her or himself but she offered something that was far more rare than gold or even imperial diadems in rome simple friendship with the prospect of real love and perhaps he had wondered at her choice of phrase they could build a roof beneath which they could live perhaps together i want to try he told her not as your bedmate or even as some silly innocent gallant you to me like i am with halldor and ulfr besides i am totally occupied with the responsibilities of hetairarch i know she said her face radiant when you are free for a moment have a message delivered to me i will meet you here or in one of the gardens we will be afforded only the time and privacy to talk agreed said haraldr his golden face beaming at her let us clasp arms in the manner of comrades he clutched her lithe forearms in his huge grip and laughed i will consult with you at my earliest conceivable convenience esteemed eminence she bowed and smirked verily your hetairarchship it will be an overawing honour surpassed only by the appearance of the glorious pantocrator himself at my morning ablutions they looked at each other and enjoyed their spoof of court flummery for a moment then maria bowed and turned to leave after a few steps she turned and said i am so glad you are alive before waving farewell and skipping off among the gawking dignitaries uncle whined michael kalaphates how can you run off on this this excursion at this time michael swooped his dice off the ivory tabletop and bolted to his feet as if the bulgars were at the door you are all that stands between me and a life of ascetic contemplation michael swept his hand at the lavish trappings of his hall the silk tapestries from persia the silver candelabra the gilded chairs pity me uncle if you can scarcely endure the life of contemplation i lead in this palace can you imagine me in a monks cell uncle you are all i have constantine threw his arms around the trembling caesar nephew nephew you know you are quite capable of fending for yourself i am extremely anxious uncle said michael he smoothed his silk robe as if in eliminating the wrinkles he was exerting control over himself now i am not even admitted to the palace i tried three times last week michael clutched the dice in his balled fist it is all so plain remove me from the public view and when everyone has quite forgotten i exist tie me up some night and carry me off to mount athos that is the plan uncle i assure you that i wont permit that said constantine i may be of little consequence to our emperor and the orphanotrophus but my blood flows in their veins and i can vouchsafe that i will remind them of that if they move you one stade from this house i was strategus of antioch they seem to forget that i am a man of ability i know you are a man of ability uncle as well as my dearest relative and most cherished friend that is why the thought of your leaving for even two days quite unravels me constantine clasped michaels shoulders we need to find a weapon to use against them i have been sitting in that gaol next to the numera for two months to try to stumble over something nothing until this maleinus individual appeared i am not particularly given to the notion that the pantocrator personally prepares our agenda for each day but i must confess to the singular intimation that the hand of providence is guiding me and you as well nephew towards the holy establishment at prote of course you are right uncle i only wish i was not subjected to this confinement together we could have made a pleasant excursion of it id wager this maleinus is fond of dice and horses when will you go the sooner the better nephew i will be back in three days michael nodded bless you uncle if i survive to tell this tale i will reward you in any way i can constantine and michael embraced the caesar escorted his uncle to the door and watched him ride off through the ring of khazar guards and down the broad paved road until he passed from sight behind a cypress grove michael turned and reentered his antechamber then stopped to stare at the mosaic on the wall to his right a lifelike depiction of an eagle devouring a snake his face began to crimson deeply suddenly he threw his dice at the picture so savagely that the ivory cubes and ceramic tesserae exploded into shards and dust monastery michael shrieked his neck corded and every vein in his face seeming to stand out he raised his head his throat gurgling slightly towards the goldcoffered ceiling this is not what you promised me sir he shouted in vicious spitting syllables this is not at all what you promised do you recall the conversation we had that day sir you stood beside me your hand was in mine you made me tell you my secrets while all of them were watching do you remember i told you how i could see the music floating in the dome and how much i wanted to touch myself and how my father wouldnt let me and you told me that your father had never fouled his mother he screamed madly again you told me i could make them all pay for what they did to me it was your idea and now you have abandoned me to them you are going to let them take me to a monastery michael quieted but his neck stiffened and his head jerked up as if he had been pulled by his ears what what he said softly he lowered his head slightly very well he said seemingly half to himself half to his unseen conversant but remember that i am not a patient man soon we will have the torpid heat the empress zoe ran her ringer along the surface of the silver wine cask tracing the engraved outline of a dancing nymph in the finely beaded condensation does the heat make you long for thule hetairarch haraldr i think of home often the heat is not relative to the issue haraldr had dreaded this interview and yet he would have requested an audience with her had she not requested to see him the matter had to be settled yes said zoe she leaned back against the cushions of her sitting couch a gust of dry warm wind swept through the arcaded balcony and she blinked her goldthread lashes i have often felt that there is a claim on you she waved her hand and her delicate ringers seemed to stroke the thick fragrant air not merely the kind of claim that one heart places on another but the claim a land makes on its people or perhaps the claim a land makes on the man who would rule over her haraldr stiffened and drew his torso erect he had been uncomfortable when she had asked him to take a couch opposite her and now he wished he had remained standing she was certainly only guessing this business of the prince who had come with the rus fleet was still about albeit now a vague virtually forgotten rumour but haraldr had hoped he would never hear it again maria says you came from an important family in thule continued zoe in a slow deep timbre do you aspire to rule over your home some day haraldr decided that she was not setting a trap that in fact this was her way of pointing to the snare in which they were both caught yes i have thought of ruling some day in norway my home it is now my fancy but then i once for a moment of madness fancied myself ruler of rome and in that intoxication i dreamed that i took rome in my arms haraldr inhaled silently and held the breath zoes eyes blinked and closed i understand your vision i saw it once too it was a dream exquisitely beautiful as dreams often are she paused and stroked her forehead lightly as if brushing away a gnat my husband awakened me from this dream haraldrs heart thudded yes i believe that i was awakened in a similar fashion and saw that i had dreamed zoes finger traced over the engraved silver nymph again the beauty of dreams is that life does not hold us accountable for them haraldr eased backwards the relief surrounding him like an eddy of the warm breeze and life can never entirely destroy the beauty of dream in his gratitude he felt a residue of the passion that had joined them once the beauty no the substance yes life so often destroys the substance of dreams and yet so often provides us with new dreams new beauties zoe sat erect and propped herself up with a silksheathed elbow her blue eyes had a diamondlike glimmer i have already thanked you in the name of rome and the purpleborn empress for the lives of my people and the safety of our empire but you also know me as a woman hetairarch zoes full crimson lips curled with the merest hint of salacious irony and i have not thanked you as a woman for saving the life of my husband he saved my life as much as i saved his majesty zoe nodded yes like achilleus he has taken up his sword again clad in the armour of the gods zoe stared as raptly as if the emperor stood before her in his golden breastplate he will come to me hetairarch haraldr i have beseeched the virgin with my prayers now that he is well he will come to me haraldr sincerely hoped that zoe would find this dream fulfilled yes he is a proud man and justly so and he did not want you to see him reduced by his illness but i can assure you that his health grows more robust with each day when he is the man you remember then you will have him again you are a gracious man hetairarch zoe eased back against the silk cushions you made love to me and yet you do not begrudge me the resurrection of my love so in kind i will not begrudge you the restoration of your love zoe leaned forward and looked at haraldr earnestly maria says that you two have conversed yes we are starting to know each other that will not be easy for you hetairarch i have known maria all her life and yet she remains one of the great mysteries of my life for all her beauty and spontaneity she has an ancient soul profound and perhaps unfathomable i do not know the depths of it zoe smiled warmly and the small wrinkles at the corners of her eyes became visible when she was a small child my sister and i took her to summer at botanci on the sea it seemed to us that she stared at the sea for weeks nothing but that and yet she seemed so happy to be alone as if she had a secret childs friend a nymph who came up from the water when we were not looking finally we asked her who was out there i remember her words so clearly because they were too sad for any child to speak everyone she answered us the world will end in fire i want to remember the time when there was only water haraldr tried to see maria as a child and wondered if even then as she sat before the sea that had watched her grow and would see her wither and turn to dust if even then she was moving towards him and he to her she has told me that you were her parents friend were they worthy people zoes eyes were distant as if she now sat beside that little girl and also stared into eternity they were the best of people there were none more worthy they loved her more than zoes lips quivered how they loved her perhaps they would also have seen into her weary tender breast and understood her the rest of us can only love her i want to love her and understand her yes zoes eyes were flat again unmoved do you want to take her to this norway when you return i dont know it doesnt follow that what a man plants in a summer meadow he can reap beneath the winter ice zoe laughed a silvery chime that was pleasant despite its melancholy how apt hetairarch haraldr i am glad you have come to us from norway well we must enjoy this summer for it may be the most beautiful we will ever remember she pressed her hand flat against the cold silver cask and looked at him and smiled there you see it eminence giorgios maleinus shouted into the southerly bluster the reefed sail of the small galley clattered the yardarm above him sixteen crewmen scruffy labourers who could scarcely row in unison bent to and fro at the oars prote east to eden south to prote i say glorious is it not eminence constantine thanked the pantocrator that he had not brought him to the isle of prote to acquire a monastery this island was small rocky graced only with a verdant wooded spine like a green cap on a bald mans head even if the imperial palace had been placed somewhere behind the groves the price maleinus was asking would carry a loss the island could not support any kind of profitable husbandry not even a herd of goats or a single winepress not to mention the vast acreage of arable land required to make a monastic establishment truly profitable if i actually had intent to buy mused constantine i would at this juncture wring maleinuss neck the jetty on the northern end of the island was formed from large rocks obviously stripped from the islands own craggy flanks and tumbled into the sea the galley tied up at a wooden wharf still in good repair my lady maleinus gestured gallantly to his cousin irene an amplebreasted woman with proportionately substantial hips and observed constantine enough paint on her sagging face to decorate an imperial galley constantine gratefully reflected that he was not one of those eunuchs troubled by such desires maleinuss inducement would perhaps be put to better use by promising her to this crew of cutthroats to ensure they didnt make off with the galley in their masters absence the stairs neatly hewn in raw rock led to a completely disused complex consisting of a small stone chapel and a row of uninhabitable at least by any civilized standards cells it appears that one would have to do more than shoo away the birds maleinus said constantine sourly what could he possibly discover in this miserable wreck no no eminence prostested maleinus his face as red as his nose his lips gulping like a fish as he gasped from the effort of propelling the considerable irene up the steps this this is merely the convent it does not even figure in the price hasnt been used for two indictions if that no eminence you have not seen the wonders of prote constantine walked over to one of the cells and kicked at the door the decaying planks fractured and one could hear the scratchy alarmed rustle of small unseen creatures its a ghastly place said irene in the struggling chirp of a large bird with a small voice to think of the nuns all closeted away in here to think of you irene thought constantine walking the streets of the venetian quarter well as i understand this was once the home to some relative of the bulgarslayer indeed constantine felt the pantocrators hand lift his sagging spirits which relative well most likely a woman eminence maleinus laughed wetly at his own jest ending in a hacking cough other than that well eminence you know how rumour dodges our efforts to grasp her and get a good feel of her he winked at constantine and then at irene the birds fled in noisy regiments as the intruders crossed the forested ridge atop the island constantine immediately noted the architectural detailing when the monastery complex revealed itself between neatly arranged rows of cypress trees the multiple domes of the chapel set on elaborately patterned cornices deeply recessed arched windows divided with slender marble columns carved window panels even in the rows of monks cells visible just above the thick defensive wall theotokos exclaimed constantine to himself someone with a great deal to atone for and a great deal to atone with had been the benefactor of prote that conjecture was amply supported as maleinus proudly displayed his merchandise the chapel with its silver chancel screen and superbly executed mosaics a storeroom full of golden censers and sacramental basins the monks cells had floors of the richest opussectile marble and the goldtiled fountain in the courtyard near the library would have been suitable for an imperial residence theotokos constantine eyed maleinus with new respect the old bandit was still asking more than the salvage price of this booty but not so much that he wouldnt find some fool at court to give him his price you see what the word of giorgios maleinus is worth now dont you eminence yes youll never see me with some fancy title but those that have them are not loath to deal when maleinus comes offering now eminence let me lead you to the crowning glory of this elysium theotokos constantine could no longer keep his tongue at the sight of the library theotokos there was a profit to be made here simply in the sale of the gemstudded gold silver and ivory book covers not to mention the value of the manuscripts maleinus must need the cash quickly constantine surmised indeed indeed eminence maleinus brushed the dust off a gilded scriptorium his redrimmed eyes suddenly had the vigour and greed of a badger contemplating a fieldmouse nest perhaps not the most extensive library outside our empress city or your antioch but certainly the richest yes eminence even an illiterate would soon learn of the glories of paradise were he to acquire these volumes maleinus virtually collapsed from his rattling laugh and attendant cough what is this said constantine coolly gesturing to the slightly open sliding door at the west end of the library he had decided to consider this offering on its own merits of course there were details the cost of shipping these items and the necessary agents in constantinople had to be figured in that maleinus paused and shrugged as if to say that the truth could not hurt him that eminence is the source of the great mystery of prote and i might add the reason these riches wait to be plucked for the price of a harlots favours constantine slid the door ajar with difficulty and squeezed through the opening the room was lit by a solitary window that looked out over the exquisite gold fountain constantine stared in disbelief at the litter of scattered documents it appeared as if someone had taken the entire contents of an imperial bureau and simply had dumped them into this little room a gilded lectern emerged above the pile of parchment like a lone tree poking above the pumiceburied slopes of a volcano the father abbot was a prodigious correspondent was he not maleinus picked up one of the parchments and let it drop without reading it letters probably would make interesting reading if one had the time or inclination i saw one addressed to the logothete of the praetorium as you can see the father abbot had access not only to the heavenly tribunal but also to the imperial court the one who was killed constantine worried that his throbbing heart might burst he was short of breath no the man who was killed was his successor father katalakon the name of the man who wrote all this was father abbot giorgios strange isnt it him and me with the same name him having led a life of denial and myself well my virtue would not heal the sick eminence yet here i am to dispose of his riches maleinus laughed and began to cough the man who murdered this father katalakon you say he has fled to cappadocia the chartophylax oh the old bookbuzzards bound to be dead no matter where he went i dont believe much of the tale anyway an old man like that no you might say that rumours breast was produced so that the truth would stop wailing so to speak eminence like i say the sin of sodom was probably on the place you know the vice is common among these cenobites dont you eminence maleinus winked at constantine out in the library irene tittered indeed thought constantine as he surveyed father abbot giorgioss letters i do not believe the tale either and while this place reeks of sin it is not that of sodom but if there was a great secret among these papers why wouldnt joannes have burned the lot or was joannes merely interested in concealing something else only one thing was certain the arms of the pantocrator verily embraced this opportunity constantine closed the door completely and again looked round the dazzling library maleinus gave him a few moments to calculate before nudging him along act quickly eminence there are parties at court who are bidding to double my price on this but id like to count the brother of our holy autocrator and blessed orphanotrophus among the clients giorgios maleinus has enriched constantine raised his hand to silence this astute prince of pedlars you will have your price minus i trust a suitable discount for a single payment in gold as soon as we return to the empress city good sir haraldr set the canvas bag on the rough wooden table the parcel was so heavy that the table creaked and canted a bit the blue star folded her arms round her stout bosom and watched quizzically she wore the same sleeveless lined tunic she had the first time they had met her whiteeyed husband sat beside her haraldr opened the bag to show the blue star the hundreds of gold solidi i have a dozen of these bags for you he said i reason that they are safer in my strongbox at my town palace but they have been set aside for you and the people of the studion ill bring them as you need them i hope you will buy food with them for a mere instant the blue stars eyes seemed as innocent as a girls perhaps as she had looked when she first dreamed of crowds cheering for her in the hippodrome she pulled haraldrs head down from high above her and gave him a grandmotherly kiss on his cheek haraldr thought of his mother asta and how long it had been since a woman had kissed him like that the theotokos just said a prayer for you boy right at the feet of god and if i get there and that is no certain thing i will say a prayer every day for you until you join us the tough look came over the blue stars face again but this isnt what the people of the studion need boy yes this will feed them for a while not as long a while as you think and not as many as you think do you know how many eat out there her question was rhetorical but to himself haraldr guessed as many as lived in all of norway and sweden combined when it gets bad enough theyll tax the poor peasants in hellas and anatolia take the food from their mouths and give it to us to take a bite out of our anger so you might say that their tax collectors can bring us these bags of coins too boy though not with the goodwill that is in your heart the blue star took haraldrs hands in both of hers he could still feel the gymnastic power in her fleshy grip what these people need is food for the soul they need to believe that someone cares about them and not just when they are so desperate with hunger that they might crawl out of the sewers and prey on the dhynatoi they need to believe that someone is looking over them so that if they clear the lot next door and plant vegetables the soldiers wont come and trample them they need to feel that they can fix the holes in their roofs without being burned out when a cursore is murdered five blocks away they need to believe that if their child gets a pox someone up there on those hills cares whether that child lives or dies the bulgarslayer did that for the people of the studion he didnt do as much as you would think boy but he did enough to give these people hope they did the rest the studion isnt dying because people have no food boy it is dying because people have no hope haraldr tried to imagine what it would be like to awaken each morning in the hell of the studion and look up at the great palaces on the hills hope he said at length well i will continue to bring you this gold because i do not think a full belly will deprive anyone of hope but i also believe i can send you the kind of hope you are talking about the messenger of this hope will be an immense black bird the blue star looked at him as if he were mad hetairarch haraldr nordbrikt joannes stood in greeting and haraldr reflected that nothing was more hideous than joanness smile he looked like a horse baring its teeth joannes waved haraldr to the simple canvas chair haraldr had to concede that the orphanotrophuss office evidenced only industry competence and selfdenial joanness face settled into its usual glower after the ordeal of the smile hetairarch i will not mince words with you i have been wrong about you and have wronged you grievously i will not pretend that an apology or a snivelling ingratiation would have meaning to a man who has overcome myriad obstacles some of my own design to rise more quickly than any outsider before him now that the former hetairarch hunrodarson is out of the way i have nothing to lose and everything to gain by making you my ally joannes placed his fingertips together and brought his huge face forward until his brutish smooth chin hovered above the deformed digits his voice though restrained seemed to pound the walls i want to deal with you i want to make a gesture of good faith and what would that be orphanotrophus would the serpent permit me to inspect its fangs as a gesture of its good faith we norsemen are naturally curious but we are not by nature fools joannes tilted his cathedral of ringers forward i want the gesture to be of your choosing then i shall arrange for a delegation from the studion to talk to you orphanotrophus their request will be your gesture joannes nodded soberly i am willing to address the grievances of the studion joannes dipped his head for a moment his eyes fading into deep shadows may i show you something hetairarch i have seen as much of neorion as i care to see sir joannes sneered apparently at himself i should have known a man of your intrepidness would not be persuaded by such displays no what i have in mind is a display that i feel will coerce your intellect since your passions are clearly beyond my influence did you not say you norsemen are curious what i have to show you may explain the roman empire and perhaps my own actions more completely and convincingly than anything else you have seen in your time among us joannes collected two resined tapers and a small bronze oil lamp in the antechamber of his office he led haraldr down the long hall of the magnara basement the orphanotrophus walked in enormous lunging steps that flung his black frock out behind like the billowing sail of some deathship he turned left at a small corridor unlocked a small very dirty bronze door at the end of the little hall and led haraldr through the usual maze of the imperial palaces subterranean passageways they emerged at a heavy steelbanded door with two locks joannes lit the tapers from the oil lamp before they entered the light flickered up into a vault perhaps three storeys high but no wider than a mans arm span without a word joannes led haraldr along what seemed a fairly steep decline the vault curved noticeably as it descended and soon haraldr understood that this was some sort of enormous spiralling gallery not unlike the chambers of a conch shell that descended into the earth on they went to the accompaniment of dancing shadows and joanness scraping boots for a moment haraldr fancied that they would find the bulgarslayer down at the end of this gallery sending up imperial chrysobulls to his still devoted people or perhaps the embalmed corpse of constantine the great attended by ancient eunuchs haraldrs imagination yielded to a sobering chill what would he see was there a place more horrible than neorion the ceiling lowered and the curves became tighter until it seemed that the gallery could no longer turn in its own width finally the descent stopped at a wall a bare flat stone wall beneath a ceiling that now almost grazed haraldrs head joannes turned suddenly his face a surface of deep shadowed craters and smooth jutting boulders this is the secret of rome hetairarch his voice echoed like a demonic oracle tell me what you see haraldrs flesh crawled surely joannes had not arranged for his confederates to follow them down the orphanotrophus would be the shield behind which he would fight his way up i did not come here to play at riddles joannes passed haraldr silently and ascended until the roof of the spiral gallery became sufficiently elevated that he could thrust his taper up over his head he turned again to haraldr this is the treasury built by the autocrator basil called the bulgarslayer there was a time when what you see here was a glittering warehouse of the wealth the bulgarslayers armies brought back from the ends of the earth chests stacked to the ceiling full of gems tableware silken garments oriental carpets heathen idols hetairarch i do not have words to describe the wealth that was amassed here joannes shook his head gone gone before my brother even lowered his head beneath the imperial diadem what the bulgarslayers brother constantine did not gamble away his successor romanus squandered haraldr could not contain his wonder but how this he gestured at the huge expanse they had explored how even in a century of spendthrift when an emperor sends a fleet of dhromons to the pillars of heracles because he desires a certain type of large fish to feast on as romanus did when instead of exacting tribute from the pechenegs an emperor pays them a ransom when an emperor supports whole establishments of monks in a fashion that a magister of rome would find profligate then even a mountain of gold is not enough you want to see where it went hetairarch look inside the churches and monasteries look at the silver ciboria and gold icons revetted with gems and the larders of the monks stuffed with pickled fish and black caviar from rus look inside the palaces of the dhynatoi with their golden thrones and mosaic ceilings look at the estates that the prostitutes of the phanarion have purchased in asia minor because the powerful men of rome are as generous with their favours as the harlot is with hers but do not look here hetairarch do not look about these empty vaults for the treasure of rome because the people of rome have stripped rome bare your dhynatoi accomplices and their attendant parasites have stripped her bare i do not see the bulgarslayers missing gold on the streets of the studion joannes dropped his head wearily what would you have me do for the people of the studion hetairarch do you think i can levy the dhynatoi to provide a palace for every wretch in the studion you would be surprised how much of the dhynatois wealth is owed to merchants like your friend nicephorus argyrus and how much of the wealth of merchants like argyrus is owed to the venetians and the genoese rome used to seek her wealth throughout the entire world from the pillars of heracles in the west to the gates of dionysus in the east now the rest of the world comes to rome to leech our wealth rome has forgotten that her destiny is at the ends of the earth joannes waved his winglike arms expansively and the movement of the torch in his hand sent shadows racing through the empty galleries hetairarch do you think the walls of constantinople can produce wealth or can even protect that wealth without the attendant empire to conquer is to produce wealth to rule is to produce wealth to win the right to tax is to produce wealth and that right that power is not won in the great houses along the mese or among the gardens of the imperial palace or even beneath the golden dome of the hagia sophia it is won at the ends of the world haraldr was taken aback by joanness passion in spite of his overweening authority his virtual omniscience joannes had always seemed fundamentally limited a glorified fantastically efficient servant to see that he had a vision of rome was disturbing like learning that a huge beast was capable of human reason yes haraldr admitted a norseman would agree with you wealth and power are won at the ends of the earth if we norsemen did not believe that i would probably be some ignorant farmer dreaming of the land beyond the next hill praying that men do not come in fast ships to burn my crop and steal my wife if we were not willing to go to the ends of the earth in our open ships our lands would scarcely give us even that much but a norseman does not go aviking and think nothing of the family and people he has left behind it would shame a norseman to win gold in some distant land and come home to a village where even one man lived as the tens of thousands do in the studion joannes studied haraldrs pensive face i need you hetairarch haraldr i have already confessed that i do not ask you to trust me i ask you not to condemn me until you know more of my policies let me offer this as a gesture of good faith to you and to those wretches to whose plaints i am not entirely immune there is nothing here for me to give them joannes fanned his torch through the empty vault however i have resources of my own acquired i might add by dint of unceasing labour compounded by unremitting frugality from my own resources i will build a charity hospital in the studion the largest and the finest the world has yet seen i ask that you do nothing in return save wait for me to make this gesture and to render judgement on me when you know more of rome and my policies if then we are still enemies i will consider you a worthy adversary and i would consider you worthy of destroying as well orphanotrophus the next time we speak i will expect to hear of your remarkable progress in the construction of this hospital joannes nodded the great hollows of his face suddenly seeming more like wells of weariness then pits of evil monastery uncle you know that the word alone is anathema to me look my hands are trembling michael placed his palsied hands straight out and the beautiful dappled arabian he had been examining whinnied as if verifying his masters claim oh damn me i have disturbed phaethon michael turned and stroked the horses probing nose and i have shouted at you my precious uncle michael clasped constantines shoulders warmly i am certain your decision was judicious uncle it is simply that with each week that passes i feel my time in the world of of pleasure running out i hate to think i will never see a horse run again unless it is some mangy mule sent to fetch one of my eremite brothers nephew trust in me remember i have managed the second city of the world and the affairs of a vast and prosperous theme i can certainly manage to make a profit on the sale of this monasterys property in any event i will not require a contribution from your purse i have scraped together the requisite solidi and already settled with the former owner do you think your purchase will quite enrage joannes it may discomfit him more than that nephew constantine went on to describe the letters of father abbot giorgios michael listened so raptly that he even batted phaethons nose when the horse nudged him when constantine had finished michael embraced him oh uncle for the first time since our emperor returned from the dead i have hope when can we see the seraphimsent correspondences of this father abbot giorgios i have already dispatched a ship and porters to pack and deliver the items i warn you that many tedious weeks of sifting through these documents await us uncle you must remember that i am also not without certain qualities of industry when the rewards are sufficient until we find the treasure we are seeking amid this abbots dross i will display a dedication to the task that would make the stylite upon a column question the vehemence of his own commitment michael took constantines arm and escorted him away from phaethons stall without even a farewell to the neighing horse this is the oldest part of this garden said maria she stepped through a bed of metallicorange marigolds and entered a dark sycamore bower the evaporation from the trees sprayed the baked lateafternoon air with a sweet cooling mist we can sit there she pointed to an almost sarcophaguslike bench the thick marble base was decorated with marble carvings partially visible through clutching tendrils of ivy a statue of a woman her body stiff and geometric but with a soft graceful face and long braids gently falling over her shoulders faced the bench from the middle of a small pool rimmed with crumbling granite bricks the cold touch of the stone bench was refreshing it is not greek said haraldr meeting the eternal gaze of the statue but it is not in the fashion of egypt either i think it is greek at a time when the sculptors of athens borrowed from the ancients of egypt before they learned to surpass them i am not certain anna would know is anna well i think she will soon be betrothed to an officer of the scholae he is a good man both courageous and intelligent enough not to grovel before her father maria turned her head suddenly as if just noticing something you are not sorry are you no i am happy that she has found someone worthy of her haraldr frowned at the stone face but i feel that she has taken a part of me and you have taken a part of her yes that seems to be the way of life endless partings where something is always taken and something is always left behind i wonder if at the end of that long road anything remains of ourselves perhaps the soul we began with is not the soul we are destined to end with the destiny of the soul is immutable but the soul itself is constantly transformed or perhaps the same soul is destined to wear many disguises that is the way odin more than once tricked fate then it is important to know when the soul has been transformed or when it merely masquerades haraldr fell silent and watched a mayfly skim over the surface of the pool a shout floated distantly from the polo field had his soul merely deceived him and her soul fooled her that was the question that stood between them as they struggled to reach each other again at length maria whispered into the rustling silence perhaps that is the cruelty of fate that until the end we do not know if our own soul was true or merely lied to us from behind its mask might it not also be the cruelty of death that we will never know maria pulled her arms around her silken waist as against a chill i pray to the holy mother that at death we will at least have the comfort of that revelation i pray that when fate takes me i will leave enough of my soul in another breast to know that i will live on until the day all souls are taken you know that will be true look at the souls who already live in your breast yes my father my brother jarl rognvald he could not say the other name you are fortunate one of the souls who lives in my breast only stabs at my heart haraldr sensed that he would be a fool to presume that he was the cause of her pain he waited maria moved her white silk slipper gently over the tops of the tall slightly wilted grass a sulphuryellow butterfly drifted erratically through the bower and out into the bright sunlight the small crowd at the nearby polo field acclaimed some feat of horsemanship with a muffled applause will you let me tell you about the first man who loved me marias question seemed directed to the statue haraldr touched her hand for a moment and let it go then allowed her the silence to continue i was very young not even a woman it was a time of great turmoil in the palace the emperor constantine who had been a very old man when he had inherited the autocrators diadem from basil the bulgarslayer acutely sensed his mortality if he was to perpetuate the macedonian dynasty he knew he had to find a soninlaw for one of his purpleborn daughters romanus was prefect of the city apparently of some ability at that level of government although he was utterly incompetent as an emperor but he had the majestic speech and stature expected of an emperor and for a man may the theotokos forgive me for a man as shallow as constantine that was enough he became fixed on this man as his successor even though romanus was already married to a decent lady that was no matter the wife was forced to retire into a convent the divorce granted and romanus was offered up to theodora she had the courage to refuse her father and has been punished for her denial ever since zoe could never resist her father and ever since has paid the wages of her acceptance but that is another tale the object of this prelude is to say that the two women i had always relied upon for love and guidance were suddenly undone by this fate their lives swept away for ever and so i who had always feared abandonment was at last alone maria paused and worked at her lip with her pearlwhite teeth a man came to me during this time a man old enough to be my father and at first he was my father he was the father i had always dreamed of a man of military accomplishments who had risen to high civil authority in the senate his hair still dark with youth his hard blue eyes gleaming with knowledge haraldr looked at marias elegant profile and realized that she still loved this man he bought me books of romances with the most beautiful illuminations talked to me of iberia or alexandria or anywhere i dreamed of going told me wonderful secrets about the lofty dignitaries who surrounded me marias lashes fluttered as if she were viewing some beauty too dazzling for vision shortly after constantine died and circumstances made both zoe and theodora even more distant from me i began to become a woman my menses had begun to flow my innocent breasts were now tender and swollen drunk with the wine of that first womanhood i began to seek the love between men and women and of course i fixed upon the most immediate object of desire i embarrassed us both at first and yet i almost immediately sensed a power i had of course never known i possessed even though i had always been thought a beautiful child it was gradual as delicate as the rain that slowly wells out of a mist but our relationship became no longer that of father and daughter but of maria stroked her silksheathed knees we became like husband and wife maria stood her arms folded under her breasts and studied the grass as she trampled it in short somewhat pawing steps i honestly do not remember much of what that love was like it seems so long ago i only remember a kind of silver nimbus around it an innocence that seems incredible to me now but we held each other and made love like husband and wife so i thought and i believed that we had indeed pledged a troth i begged him to marry me before this sin profaned my soul he kept deferring disclaiming about my age the blue flames of marias irises began to glow apparently i was old enough for his arms to wrap my naked loins but not old enough for a wedding belt to girdle my waist but in my innocence i waited and then one day i learned the reason for my waiting i remember that like yesterday a slut who hovered about the court waiting for whatever dignity might fancy to dip into her came skipping to my apartments where i was learning homer as a girl my age is bound to do she announced as gaily as her own betrothal the engagement of my lover to anna ducas an arrogant dhynatoi bitch who had already inflamed my jealousy with little intrigues that had seemed great at the time and apparently were i did not wait i raced to confront him at his apartments and caught him in a position with the bitch that even the most skilful of lies could not extricate him from she had the effrontery to seize a knife and threaten me with it i kicked and punched the sin out of her and sent her fleeing and the knife clattered to the floor i saw it and i saw him too speechless with shame even to lie i would have accepted anything except his beatendog shame marias teeth flashed between brilliant grimacing lips it was as if the knife had been set there by some greater hand than mine even now maria was rigid coiled as if responding to the grip of that great hand i seized the knife and in my fury plunged it into his astonished breast i still see his eyes and the feeling the feeling of entering him with that knife was as it had been when he had first entered me and stabbed me with love her eyes glowed but her cadence faltered ever ever since then love and hate have been inseparable in my soul haraldr stared at the statue for a moment its whimsical stone features seemed for a moment sad as if stone like flesh were also a prison he looked at maria still standing her arms clutched as if her stomach ached her eyes feverish with pain he reached out and extricated one of her hands and pulled her down beside him i understand your pain he told her as he clutched her cold stiff hand i tried to become a man too soon as i think you tried to become a woman too soon i cannot be as honest as you and tell you everything that happened but there was a battle and everything i knew and loved was taken from me that day even my pride and honour it was as if fate stripped me and broke me and ground me into the offal of my own fear i remained screaming unable to move awake in that nightmare for many years because of the love of an old man who is dead now and the help of the gods i no longer live in that nightmare but my soul still sears with the shame and agony of that day i am marked by it for ever marias grip was fierce astonishingly powerful i am not ashamed of what i did but i am still angry it is the anger that reduces me because i have let loose its misguided arrows all my life haraldr could say nothing she had bared her breast to him and indeed had no reason for shame there was nothing in her tale that did not make him think more of her he felt shame because the lie born at stiklestad was still with him and the anger he should proclaim to the world was still hidden but he could not answer her truth with one of his own he thought again of the ambivalent fate that had whispered to him high above the hippodrome and heard again its caution was this new truth of hers merely another mask for her soul or was her soul merely a mask for some devious fate he did not know and so all he could do was hold her desperate hand and listen to the hot wind rise and rattle among the sycamore leaves the magister and strategus of armenikoi constantine tztezes paid a common prostitute to costume herself as the whore of babylon go about her business with a young man while he watched and then michael kalaphates let the letter drop onto the stack a look of profound disgust added to the weariness that creased his handsome young face you dont want to hear the rest uncle suffice to say that when the young man had finished with this ersatz whore of revelations tztezes proceeded to enact the rulers of biblical notoriety who had drunk deep of her fornication michael narrowed his eyes and this uncle is the kind of narrowminded prig who calls a sportsman like myself an apostate to satan it is remarkable that father abbot giorgios did not despair of human nature said constantine wryly yes the father abbot seems to have been remarkably magnanimous as long as human nature brought him marble revetments for his cenobites cells and goldandruby icons for his personal treasury i tell you uncle if i ever i would make these pompous dignitaries think that the trumpet of judgement has sounded michael picked up the stack of documents and set it down on the table with a muted thud well enough of that let me review what we have constantine straightened his pile of parchments and watched michael attentively it was extraordinary what the young man was capable of when he fixed himself upon some goal michael had first discerned father abbot giorgioss filing system then deciphered the chartophylaxs own rather cryptic system crossreferenced all the documents and within two weeks knew the identity and predicament of each of the father abbots numerous highly placed correspondents the vast amount of purely scholarly and religious correspondence of course he had quickly identified and discarded michael placed his hands on two stacks these are living holders of imperial dignities who would be subject to immense embarrassment if the contents of these letters became known michael lifted the hand that rested on the other taller stack these documents pertain to deceased individuals whose families still hold positions of responsibility michael strutted for a moment enjoying his moment of latent power we will use this only as a last resort or to protect ourselves if circumstances should prove to our benefit i quite think extortion a rather limited sport one always begins with an outcome which becomes quite tedious to the true speculator michael moved with new assurance to a small stack of perhaps a dozen letters and placed both hands upon it this uncle has all the indications of a superlative wager michael riffled the dry parchments the account is graphic is it not the purpleborn eudocia the late sister of our present empress zoe and the augusta theodora becomes enamoured of a young courtier by the way uncle they say eudocia was a fright her face blemished by some pox she becomes enamoured of this young swain lets him have his way with her his seed bears fruit she confesses to her father and her young man mysteriously takes the tonsure of a monk and disappears to a lavra in syria she goes off to the convent at prote and brings her bastard into the world and the childs rather deeply blue blood in fact one could almost make the case for it being purple is known only to father abbot giorgios eudocia gives up the child and lives out the rest of her woefully brief years in an even more remote cloister the emperor constantine dies we even have the death of the childs father recorded it is all here the account of an artfully buried secret michael sorted through the stack and picked up two letters except for this here we have a letter in which eudocia thanks the father abbot for seeing to the confidential delivery of her child and promises her confessor a new gold altar table michael waved the other letter here we have the unfortunate womans profuse gratitude for seeing to her own placement in another convent and of course the promise of one hundred solidi to purchase bound manuscripts for the library both letters are marked in both the father abbots and the chartophylaxs filing notations and both sets of notations indicate that one letter is missing the letter written between these two the letter i am willing to wager uncle that describes the disposition of the child yes said constantine he also rose and began to pace with excitement and the fact that the chartophylaxs notation indicates the missing letter proves that he was in possession of this rather propitious secret is it possible that the chartophylax did kill this father katalakon in order to preserve the secret possible but remember that the scent or perhaps one should say reek of joannes is on all of this yes that is the key uncle michael pulled an ear thoughtfully let us consider three possibilities one that joannes found the letter and knows the secret two that joannes looked for the letter and did not find it three that joannes knows nothing of the letter and merely suspended the typicon for some other reason you know how meticulous his management is and how extensive his piques are constantine nodded agreement two chances out of three uncle is considered very attractive odds to an experienced sportsman i say we should send someone to cappadocia to locate this chartophylax or his remaindered effects in the event of his death which seems likely and bring us back that letter there is no one we can trust with such a treasure michaels face collapsed into his usual boyish irresolution i had not thought of that poor ergodotes the only casualty of my plot against joannes constantine approached michael and slapped his shoulders of course there is someone we can both trust by the goodness of the pantocrator you have an uncle who knows the area passably well the former strategus of a neighbouring theme michaels lips were slack with shock uncle you cannot mean to uncle the heat alone no nothing is worth the prospect of having you away for those months not to mention i will not allow it nephew you yourself have traversed most of the route the caves of these eremites are only three days from caesarea mazaca a most propitious destination is it not my caesar i should be able to join a caravan within the next two weeks and be in cappadocia by early september i will be back before december michaels eyes were wet with gratitude uncle bless you i only hope that upon the occasion of your return i will still be here to welcome you maria awakened to the brilliant early september light streaming into her bedchamber the curtains rustled b with the already tepid morning breeze her arcade was a wall of gold she had dreamed again of thunderbolts fracturing a glassy sky a flaming sea her own death the dreams are what i fear not what will be she told herself i have proof of that what will be is today i will see him i will have hours to be with him enough time to break through this wall that still keeps us apart as close as we have come these past months today he will share with me the secret that burdens his soul maria sat up at the knock on the door her chamberlain entered and ushered in maria diaconus daughter of the patrician and senator alexius diaconus and marias new ladyinwaiting because of their shared name maria referred to her as little maria little maria was fourteen blonde as slender as a reed and entirely too young to be gambolling about court but clearly her parents were eager to auction her innocence in the interests of their ambitions maria had resolved to keep a keen eye on her i couldnt sleep said little maria in her flutelike girls voice i have been up before the sun i cannot believe this day is actually here little maria walked to the open arcade and looked out over the domes of the palace and across the bosporus they say there will be dancers and a drama in mime and an illusionist and acrobats and animals and that women will have their own hunt she rattled off without pausing for breath do you think we will be able to dance if the empress decides we can dance we will dance with men perhaps if you are extremely good you might be permitted to dance with men so will you dance with the hetairarch little maria smirked surreptitiously how did you know he was coming i have been asking do you know who else is coming that saracen prince who wants to be caliph of egypt little maria lowered her voice to a ridiculous hiss and steered her bluegreen eyes about the room they say the emperor may even appear i doubt that maria thought to herself not wanting to spoil the girls anticipation it was enough that zoe had been freed to entertain at her villa on the bosporus and that her majesty was conducting the event with the zeal of old maria only hoped that zoe herself would not presume that the emperor might attend her ball mistress do you think i might be seduced this evening said little maria blithely maria reached over and gave little marias long blond braid a sharp pull not tonight little flower when you are ready to be plucked i will find someone appropriate to seduce you well there it be worship if you can find yourself this chartowhatever out there then you knows your way around better than me and ive been running these ugly humped demons out here for two indictions its madness worship ive seen it all happen and its madness kept me busy though constantine looked through the shimmering latesummer heat that cloaked the cappadocian valley incredible of course he had heard of it but he had imagined a few dozen of these desert dwellers incredible spread out to the horizon was a land of dull almond and bronze colours tortured by wind and rain into thousands and thousands of jagged toothlike spires all of relatively uniform height all crowded in dense disordered row after row the landscape in itself was something of a marvel but what was truly remarkable was that this fantastic expanse of weathered stone was a city not a town or a village but a city of homes carved into these coneshaped limestone spires it was hard to distinguish a single spire that was not pocked with small square windows and rectangular doors and even large recessed balconies the rock city crawled with life brown and blackcloaked monks scrambled up and down the wooden ladders that led to their perches and the roads that ran into and around this strange metropolis were crowded with these eremites and their donkeys laden with sacks of provisions and clay jars of fresh water or wine thousands of cooking fires further smudged the hazy atmosphere constantine could see a monk beating a rug on one of the balconies the scene was not of this world constantine tried to compose himself the heat and dust were suffocating he would die before he could possibly find one old monk out there but he could not allow himself that despair he was a man of ability and a man of ability would use his superior intellect to conquer this forbidding holy otherworld constantine wiped his drenched face with his dustsoiled veil the chartophylax coming here would go to a world he knew books manuscripts eremites would not have these things at least in any abundance only a church would constantine squinted over the spiky terrain certainly some of the larger more complex porches indicated chapels but there were bound to be scores probably even hundreds my esteemed sir he asked the camel driver where would one find the largest chapel in this district the camel driver spat into the floury dust there worship he pointed to a large conglomeration of blunted cones that seemed much like a ragged natural version of the piledup multiple domes of an orthodox cathedral this rock chapel was a good eight stades distant and where might one find a donkey and some water jugs youre in luck worship as it is my cousin who sells mules to the eremites down there constantine looked out over the sweltering tortured city of denial and told himself that the hand of the pantocrator was indeed upon this enterprise i am emphatically certain that his wifes father had an armenian on his mothers side theophano attalietes wife of the senator and magister nicon attalietes hefted with a motion of her left elbow and entire vast bosom the trail of her jewelled and goldembroidered scarlet pallium as if the garment were some sort of volume bearing the genealogies of everyone present she looked imperiously down her fat painted nose at the almost as grotesquely splendid wife of another senator by the lords hand woman he allowed his daughter to marry a merchant and he has had venetians at his home as far as theophano attalietes was concerned the matter was settled she and her gaggle of bejewelled dhynatoi cronies would not greet andronicus diogenes or his wife despite the fact that diogenes owned two dozen separate estates in asia minor and his father had been a distinguished general under the bulgarslayer i am faint muttered theophano who appeared about as faint as a charging bull she nudged her companion and nodded towards the gilded presence of nicephorus argyrus snapping her fingers quickly she organized her eunuchs and ladiesinwaiting all of them attired in white silk into a gleaming motherofpearl wall before her lest the preening merchant attempt to approach her she could have strangled her husband nicci for having had anything to do with that man but at least that was over at least her baby ignatius had not been forced to marry one of the disgusting merchants bastard daughters i am bleeding for our empire theophano erupted do you see it or have the demons been sent to test my incomparable piety she nodded her round adipose head with frantic bobbing motions the brute the tauroscythian brute he is in the costume of a stable boy and with the imperial crest on his breast he he is rather well spoken offered the wife of senator scylitzes timidly but nonetheless suicidally he he did save our emperor theophano turned to madame scylitzes like an executioner woman she intoned in an acid voice the emperors horse also served him in battle we do not invite the horse to walk among ladies of ancient and noble lineage nor do we consider the beast well spoken simply because it can stamp its hoof three times when its master utters the word three i suggest that you endow an icon to the mother church woman and pray to the holy mother to be released from your untoward empathy for savages i believe your costume has drawn the ire of theophano attalietes said nicephorus argyrus to haraldr they were close enough to catch a few words of the womans exclamations haraldr had worn the controversial new mens fashion to the empresss ball a thighlength tunic worn with hose or perhaps it is merely your fair complexion argyrus pointed to theophano among the cluster of tonguewagging senatorial wives do you realize i could arrange for you to own that fat sow before this evening is over haraldr laughed i would sign over to you my entire fortune for the privilege of not owning that argyrus gestured theatrically at the vast interior court of the empresss villa the colonnaded square was variously filled with set tables a stage fountains buried beneath trays of delicacies and silver ewers of wine and a glittering crowd of hundreds of dignitaries in a display of silks and jewels beside which an imperial coronation paled bonnets and pearl collars framed the beefy jowls of the magnates and silk parasols held by uniformed eunuchs shielded the painted faces of their ladies from a sun that had already disappeared behind the courts soaring peristyle there are more prejudices here than gold earrings argyrus said the dhynatoi of undilute blood or so they think look down on the dhynatoi who have an armenian or persian in their history but then any dhynatoi from the eastern themes looks down on the dhynatoi from the western themes and all the dhynatoi look down on a merchant like myself though i could buy any one of them needless to say you barbaroi do not deserve consideration then there are the eunuchs who think they are quite above everybody except another eunuch who holds a higher office the priests meanwhile look down on the monks whom they consider unwashed primitives and the monks look at everyone else as sinful the civil bureaucrat despises the military man and of course the military man despises everyone except for the seljuk warrior whom he secretly admires the hellenes at court consider everyone else untutored louts and everyone else considers them pompous heathen windbags it is a miracle that anyone in rome talks to anyone else argyrus looked around and tipped his gold goblet towards the peristyle a friend of yours has arrived someone who really has risen above all this the level of noise was too high to hear the comments maria inspired but she clearly created a ripple of sensation in the crowd haraldr had wondered what new innovation would distinguish her attire since her greekstyle costume had already inspired many imitations this time she wore a dancers uniform except that her short thighlength tunic was cut from embroidered white silk and her long underskirt was of sheer chiffon and slit to the waist the sight of her scarcely veiled legs gave haraldr a queasy feeling in his stomach the thought of wanting her that much frightened him hetairarch have you ever considered making a wife of our helen our maria argyrus eyed haraldrs frown warily i hope i have not presumed on our friendship no i have thought of it maria wended her way through the crowd her teeth sparkling at the many compliments and greetings her blue eyes blazing challenges at the disapproving dhynatoi matrons by the time she reached haraldr a troupe of young women and their ladiesinwaiting followed behind her eager to watch the woman their parents so vehemently condemned maria greeted haraldr and argyrus with impeccable formality nodding and then introducing her ladyinwaiting but then she glanced over at theophano attalietes and the glaring senatorial contingent and placed her hand on haraldrs arm i must introduce you to the wife of our foremost senator she said and you as well nicephorus argyrus nothing not even her fortress of attendants could save theophano marias ceremonial title mistress of the robes was exceeded only by the dignity of purpleborn augusta and of course that of empress maria performed the introductions in front of the bosomheaving almost apoplectic woman theophano was forced by her own rigid sense of etiquette to croak hetairarch and sir at the two subhumans satisfied maria led haraldr and argyrus away she will suffer the torments of the damned when she sees that you are to be seated to the right of the empress haraldr became almost rigid of course explained maria i am always at the empresss left and you are across from me haraldr wondered at how small rome had become i think the man you want never left caesarea my brother said the monk his eyes reddened and his brow furrowed from the effort of painting deep inside this rock tomb there was no other word for it thought constantine yet the raw fervour of this painters vision had converted the rock chapel into a primitive paradise where brilliant polychrome apostles hovered in precisely carved niches and goldhaloed pantocrators looked down from the smoothsurfaced perfectly contoured apse and dome the pungency of fresh pigment challenged the omnipresent smell of limestone dust constantine thanked the monk left him a copper follis from his dwindling supply of coins and stooped beneath the arched doorway into the fastapproaching stillsearing cappadocian twilight despair had returned he had already visited half a dozen of the largest chapels and the suggestion that the chartophylax had remained at the bishopric in caesarea was beginning to have credence even though constantine had already ascertained that there was no record of him in the episcopal files there was now only one large chapel left that might have any significant documentation constantine wearily mounted his wheezing mule the treacherous pathways between the cones were now crowded with monks scurrying to reach their sanctuaries before dark this city of monks had attracted the usual urban vermin constantine had seen the secular clergy of this place lurking in the shadows or just blithely sleeping in the shade waiting for the darkness to come so that they could perform their sacraments of assault and thievery constantine identified the final chapel and when he reached the broad base of the spire he could hear evidence of expansion going on within the cone he laboriously ascended the wavering wooden ladder his hands were already blistered and pulled himself over the lip of the porch the noise was thunderous and the dust a hot talc thrust up his nostrils constantine pulled his veil tight around his nose and mouth and entered the single doorway inside barechested monks were visible through the reddish pall they pounded iron chisels with heavy mallets like wretches condemned to the inferno a monk working with a file smoothed the surface of one of a whole row of columns that these men had hewn out of solid rock the sound of the hammering caused actual physical pain to the ears and constantines head ached one of the brothers shouted at him through the din how can i succour you brother the monk was as powerful as a wrestler and sweat yellowed with limestone dust beaded his entire face and beard he signalled one of the brothers to bring constantine a drink of water the monk who brought the clay jug had dark furious eyes a strip of cloth was wrapped around the middle of his face covering the slits where his nose had been constantine ignored the fearsome visage and greedily slurped from the noseless mans wooden ladle the lords work is unceasing screamed the monk over the unremitting din i will not close my eyes in sleep or my eyelids in slumber until i find a sanctuary for the lord a dwelling for the mighty one of jacob thundered the monk quoting psalms constantine had no reason to be encouraged even the least scholarly monk knew psalter by heart he shouted back into the sweatglistened ear of the monk i am looking for a chartophylax formerly of prote he would have come here five perhaps six years ago there was a flash of recognition in the monks eyes he signalled his brethren to stop hammering but his words were a disappointment a chartophylax of prote you say the monk shook his head and wrung the silted sweat out of his beard still constantine noticed that the other monks seemed to betray some knowledge the noseless monks eyes shifted from constantines scrutinizing gaze well of course we have archives that go back to the time of gregory of nyssa you are welcome to inspect them he signalled the noseless monk to show constantine the way the noseless monk lit a taper and led constantine through a narrow series of galleries then up a carved staircase to a room fairly well illuminated by two small square windows constantine sighed the rockwalled scriptorium with a single dustcovered writing table apparently the monks here were more interested in works of stone than works on parchment was lined with shelves full of dusty sheaves many bound in ancient wood covers he would be there late into the night after an already exhausting day but something told him that it was important he begin if he slips said zoe leaning forward in her golden throne and pointing to the oilglazed acrobat performing atop a pole balanced in the middle of the table then lady manganes will have a virtually naked man in her plate yes said maria i wonder if she will ask for some garos sauce to be ladled over him zoe laughed and lifted her fluted scarlettinted wineglass haraldr felt both very sorry for her and very devoted to her the pain of the continued separation from her husband showed in a kind of haunted darkness around her blue eyes it was clear that she had hoped the emperor might appear and surprise her and yet in spite of how cruelly love had treated her she obviously did not begrudge maria and haraldr their long adoring looks instead she had played the gracious messenger of aphrodite she even had silenced the voukaloi and organs and made a toast to love with an obvious inference to the couple sitting next to her well said zoe her disappointment a thin edge on a voice determined to provide others joy i have tipped everyone toasted everyone who deserves to be toasted sent enough bared acrobats breasts and buttocks among them to enact the forty martyrs of sebaste the martyrs in question had been forced to strip and stand in the snows of rus until they perished shown them the latest beasts from the indus provided them with unremitting chorales and have successfully commissioned a mime of the liaison of ariadne and theseus so explicit that i believe lady attalietes split her scaramangium in a combination of ecstasy and outrage i believe that i can only exceed myself by ordering our illusionist to begin maria slid her arms across the table and leaned towards haraldr she was slightly taken by the wine but to charming effect you must tell me what you see she said some people will see nothing some will see different things many will see the same thing it is interesting to compare zoe touched haraldrs arm think of this as a waking dream do not be alarmed the first time you see it if you see it you may think that angels or demons have taken hold of you it is so wondrous she smiled warmly and wistfully at him haraldr settled back tense with anticipation despite the wine he had considered much he had already seen in rome magic now he would see what the romans themselves considered magic the stage was a construction of gilded wood that had been erected at the east end of the courtyard just behind the empresss table it was a virtually freestanding building with a high vaulted ceiling from which three elaborate candelabra hung providing the platform below with an intense golden light at zoes command the organs flourished and the tables full of diners hushed expectantly an old bowed workman of some sort shuffled out onto the platform inexplicably the workman instantly vanished and in his place was a much taller man young and handsome wearing a loose black scaramangium much like a monks frock who am i asked the man in a voice that carried like a heralds and yet at the same time seemed conversational as if he were sitting across the table abelas yelled some of the young men and women who apparently had seen the man perform before abelas listened for his name and then whirled like a cyclone and when he was still again his face was as white as a corpse and streaked with brilliant tendrils of fresh blood that ran down from his thick black hair who am i he shrieked and whirled again when he faced the audience this time he was the old workman he began to shuffle off the stage then a burst of light and a flock of white pigeons fluttered above the stage and carried abelas away leaving only a mist where he had been it was incredible haraldr could see the birds a dozen of them at least transport abelas over the roof of the villa and off into the night haraldr heard murmuring among the crowd and looked back to the stage a dwarf in a black robe stood where abelas had been who am i asked the dwarf in a voice identical to abelass abelas came the return chorus the dwarf clapped his stubby hands as if applauding the audience for this feat of identification who am i the dwarf flew up into the air his black robe trailing like a column of smoke and then the smoke cleared and a woman stood there naked except for a single leaf over her pubic triangle the crowd tittered who am i asked the woman in abelass voice abelas the woman bowed and skipped off the stage two huge cranes rose up from where she had stood flapped their wings and flew off into the night the crowd applauded wildly haraldr took a deep draught of unmixed wine spectacular but explainable he had recently been shown the complex hydraulic lifts that raised the emperors throne and had held in his hand one of the clockwork birds that had once bewitched him abelas was a wizard but a wizard at mechanical stunts and sleight of hand haraldr drank again relieved he had feared that abelas might have access to the spirit world fortunately that was not the case the organs flourished briefly and abelas emerged again a plainlooking man perhaps late in his third decade in a loose white scaramangium he held up his hands for the crowds acclaim and snakes coiled from his fingertips he shook the snakes off and in a prodigious catlike leap bounded to the empresss table almost weightlessly dodging the litter of plates and goblets with his dancing feet he planted himself in front of lady manganes and leaned his torso far over her seemingly in defiance of both anatomy and gravity his hair seemed darker and his black eyes burned in the candlelight who are you he asked her lady manganes a fleshily attractive woman with a spark in her own eyes smiled mischievously anna manganes she said a hint of invitation and fear in her voice abelas whirled his arms in front of her face and made a motion as if pulling her soul right out of her body who are you salome said lady manganes in a voice quite unlike her own she seemed to listen for distant music and rose swaying tapping imaginary cymbals with her hands then she leapt onto the table and began to whirl faster and faster and yet her feet never disturbed a single utensil abelas let her go on for a moment and then touched her head lightly at which she stopped and climbed down to her seat abelas leaned over her again who are you lady manganes she said shrugging abelas bounded across the table and stood in front of haraldr the fulfilment of a dread that everyone at the table had experienced haraldr glanced for a moment at maria and saw her bite her lip was it possible that she had engineered this trick haraldr vowed to resist whatever wizardry abelas used to induce the trance he had heard of old women from biarmaland seeresses who had similar powers to command other minds who are you asked abelas haraldr met the furious eyes as black and deadly as hot pitch hetairarch said haraldr the hands whirled and haraldr saw the rings flashing around him like dozens of brilliant moths it is the hands the lights that compel thought haraldr he focused on abelass eyes and pulled his consciousness away from abelass darting fingers who are you haraldrs eyes flashed knowingly at abelas hektor he said so as not to spoil the wizards show he was trying to figure some stunt to perform when abelas crouched over him and placed his hands on haraldrs shoulders they both shuddered from the jolt abelass eyes retreated and then plunged like arrows into haraldrs soul this man knows me haraldr told himself with utter certainty this man knows who i am not simply that but everything things that i do not even know abelas nodded drunkenly as if in affirmation of a truth so terrible it made even him swoon for a long moment haraldr and abelas remained locked in the dance of fate then the illusionist dipped his head as if to kiss haraldr on the cheek we are both merchants of destiny he whispered to haraldr in a harsh frightened voice he danced away and leapt to the stage the hetairarch has suggested a fitting climax to my vision he declared to the entire crowd the candelabra above the stage began to spin slowly at first then so fast that it was dizzying to follow the lights abelas was gone his voice seemed to come from above the tables slowly in a mesmerizing cadence he began the story of the creation a nearly naked man and woman came on the stage and it was obvious that they were merely actors the light was distracting whirling creatures and foliage appeared around adam and eve somehow mechanically propelled onto the stage then a fish flew through the air out over the audience too brilliant to be a bird in some sort of guise or even a lantern many people pointed and watched the characters on the stage vanished in an instant of flickering light but some of the images lingered like ghosts a moment longer the lights of the spinning candelabra were joined by other lights and all were in motion go to the end said abelas haraldr did not notice that a senators wife had moaned and fainted only a few places down from him much of what followed was clearly a spectacular enactment of revelations the opening of the seven seals the blowing of the seven trumpets the horsemen of doom the lamb and the beasts and the naked whore yet there were evanescent glimpses of less substantial things great fires and the star named wormwood that glowed above the stage for what seemed a long while perishing everything below finally the stage cleared again and abelas appeared alone he reached up towards the spinning lights and began to describe the city of new jerusalem his arms and hands seemed to weave a tapestrylike image of the pearl gates and streets of translucent gold the crowd gasped as if his hands were indeed building this marvellous city before their eyes haraldr saw only abelass flashing rings then abelas intoned i am the alpha and the omega and haraldr could no longer blink away the fire in abelass cupped hands the flame grew expanding into a great golden shimmering globe that seemed to engulf the courtyard the voices around him exclaimed in a chorus and haraldr knew that they all shared this vision the light within the globe became brilliant almost blinding and haraldr remembered what abelas had whispered to him not the thing that he had heard but the thing that had been whispered when he was unaware he was hearing look for the dragon the voice had said a point of darkness like a black star against a golden sky grew until its huge wings spread over the globe of light like an obsidian dome and he felt the cold gust of doom and the brilliant light vanished haraldr shook his head the vision faded into the reality of candlelit tables and silken dignitaries where had he been had abelas entranced him from the moment their eyes met the stage was completely dark and abelas was gone the crowd was in a frenzy of speculation about and recapitulation of the wonders the illusionist had shown to them husbands attended women who had fainted two men were almost to blows over something and many simply sat in drunken bemused awe then haraldr realized that maria was crying constantine rubbed his eyes the oillamp cast spooky shadows over the rock walls of the scriptorium were he the timid type he probably should have begun to see demons crawling about the place as it was the demons were the doubts crawling about his mind he closed the volume of archives he had just finished with a poof of dust rose from between the wooden covers like a small djinn spiriting forth he looked over the shelves hoping against hope that he had missed something no he had been through all of them and found nothing he wondered how late the hour was and where he would go in the morning this had seemed so promising the looks in the monks eyes this afternoon that was what was wrong they had certainly heard of the man and yet there was no record here no this was the place he could hire soldiers in caesarea and return and demand the monks cooperation he could arrange a loan there certainly to pay the mercenaries suddenly the shadows did bother him if the brothers had lied it was not safe here he remembered with a start that he had left his mule tethered to the ladder all this time constantine picked his way nervously through the darkened galleries at one point he reached a culdesac and for a moment thought he would panic tombs he hated being inside these rocks he reached the chapel and was startled by the growl no snoring the monks did slumber before the lords sanctuary was complete but they slept beside their work constantine crept outside and set the lamp on the ledge and gingerly descended the ladder into what seemed a well of darkness when he reached the base of the spire he looked up at the light on the rock balcony above him and decided he should go back up and risk climbing down with it otherwise he was blind in this strange and now pitchdark otherworld then he glanced around the base of the ladder and realized that his mule was gone constantine climbed arduously back up the ladder and retrieved his lamp but as he set out on foot he quickly regretted having gone back for it the shadows that danced around him in and out among the spires were more terrifying than any stumbling in the dark could possibly be where was he going surely there was an inn somewhere or some cenobites who remained awake he would pay them to lodge him if only he could see a light cold water seemed to drain through constantines bowels who was there the same thieves who had stolen his mule constantine parried with the lamp as if it were a sword thrusting it towards the craggy folds at the base of a cone he saw red feral eyes vanish into the night wild dogs possibly more vicious even than thieves he would have to get a loan in caesarea now simply to pay for his passage home once he had reimbursed the mules owner the scraping again constantine looked about the ground for some good stones to throw at the dogs why hadnt he at least brought a staff the black blur flashed from the shadows and punched the breath from him his lamp spilled and burning oil washed over the rocks hands clutched at his cloak and probed for his purse he rolled into the dust gasping for air the hands now pummelling his head he forced himself to his knees and pounded back with his chubby fists eliciting muffled groans from his assailant the two men entirely unknown and virtually unseen by each other traded blows in the fading light of the spilled oil constantines chest and arms seared with fatigue but he still flailed with unexpected force the assailant fled a clattering shadow disappearing into the night constantine remained on his knees gulping the dry dusty air his head ached and his temples thumped with raging blood even in his distress he could hear the footsteps behind him and he whipped his head around the figure was over him and he looked at the face in the last flickering light of the spilled oil and screamed he induces a trance like a soothsayer said maria that is commonly done his skill is that he can make hundreds of people see it at once he has learned the ways of the mind and how to make the mind see what it wants to see he leads your mind to its own fantasies but most of what you saw were tricks to make you susceptible to the final illusion maria stretched her arms across the little dessert table and grasped haraldrs hands zoe had set up the tables all across the porch of her villa as well as on the terraces descending to the bosporus the entire hillside twinkled with candlelight like a miniature city the stairs marked with glowing silk lanterns were brilliant boulevards there was no moon and the sea was sableblack nevertheless you cried at what you saw haraldr wondered if she had seen some new vision of his fate or perhaps her own at what i let myself see i saw the fire and the raven because i dreamed these things because i am afraid for you not because they will happen but because i care for you because i she trailed off the missing words obvious you saw the dragon at the end because that is your norsemans myth but you are the only one who saw it we all saw the light of new jerusalem because we have all been in the mother church and abelas persuaded our minds to see it again abelas is very gifted some say dangerously so do you know that he was escorted to his ship by his own allemanian guards and has already sailed off in the dark he worries that people who saw terrible things will try to kill him the church would like to see him out of the way because he casts doubt on the veracity of miracles and he will probably be mad within a year i would say his art will soon be lost and even the chronologists will be too frightened to record all of what we have seen haraldr clutched marias hands what she had said about abelas had as she would say the resonance of truth but if abelas had the gifts of a soothsayer or seer he could without question see into time and he had known haraldr had seen him born had seen him die had seen the last dragon fly at the end of time and perhaps haraldr thought abelas saw my soul unmasked he knew you didnt he said maria haraldrs eyes registered the shock maria was also gifted perhaps dangerously so haraldr wished that zoe had not left them alone he felt unsure of himself with her now in the light of the candle she was not the same friend he had grown to love during the long summer afternoons she was the lover he had known on those endless nights he knew what she wanted the unmasking of the secret that separated their questing souls and he still could not give it to her no haraldr could not look at her he did not know me maria looked down and her fine dark lashes seemed to work at vanquishing tears when she looked up again there was a kind of tragic acceptance on her face look she said they are going to dance the dancers a troupe of twenty beautiful young women dressed much like maria except in more colourful and less precious silk formed a ring their arms interlocking to form a continuous chain to the music of flutes and cymbals they began to sway first at the hips sensually then incorporating their entire bodies with fluid undulations of their locked arms and precise movements of their feet slowly they built to ever more elaborate frenzied rhythms movements added to movements until the ring swayed twisted and spun like a top with the power to change its shape endlessly soon younger men and women many quite drunk began to form rings of their own swaying and whirling with less grace but equal fervour maria impulsively grabbed haraldr and led him to one of the rings on the terrace below him they spun about with a large group for a while and then the circles broke into fours and finally couples were left to their own improvisations the music whistled and chimed to an elaborate climax the night was a blur of flashing silk and candlelight maria soon outpaced haraldr and moved in with the professional troupe her grace almost the equal of theirs and her undulant hips and bared legs even more erotic on and on she went her eyes and teeth shining fiercely finally the music stopped to offer the exhausted dancers relief maria came to haraldr her breasts rising and falling rapidly and her forehead wet she wrapped her arms around him and he could feel that her passion had only been momentarily diverted she looked up at him her eyes still on fire i would give my soul to make love to you tonight she said can you give me yours he held her to him i know what i must say to you he said tell her he pleaded with himself every inhibition was gone at this moment the oaths to norway the risk of exposure the fear of her betrayal and yet that truth had never seemed more deeply buried in his breast if he told her everything would change between them and he loved her too much at this moment to want to change anything marias eyes teared as she waited finally she dropped her head why i will share anything with you if you are a criminal a traitor a slave if you have a wife a queen a whore i dont care i have to know who you are dont you see what it means that that is so important to me i want to know how to place you within my life i will do anything you want me to but i have to know she looked up at him again at that instant haraldr realised that they both stood on some great precipice and they could either leap from it wrapped in one anothers arms or walk away from that brink separately strangers for ever he could only answer that fate with silence i have told you everything she said her voice the plaint of some small doomed animal she shuddered with a single sob released him and ran madly across the terraces her legs pumping and her fists attacking the night air you are an angel of the lord said constantine as the noseless monk dabbed the cut over his eye with a wet cloth i apologize for regarding you as another cutthroat who knows how long i would have lasted out there i followed you said the monk they lied back there the chartophylax brother symeon he was once of our lavra he is in trouble men in constantinople we monks protect our own the monks voice had the curious resonance of the noseless he spoke as if it took a great deal of time for his words to travel from his brain to his mouth so why have you helped me because he is a friend of mine the chartophylax brother symeon constantine decided not to pursue the matter the noseless monk was a not too bright good samaritan and perhaps he thought that constantine was someone who could help his friend with his legal problems and perhaps constantine could can you take me to see brother symeon the noseless monk nodded and turned into the night adeptly picking a path through the jagged bases of the spires the darkness was overwhelming it was as if the monks single taper were a candle adrift in a vast dark sea the monk moved swiftly and constantines heavily fleshed chest ached brother symeon awaits he told himself as he grimly pursued the black shape before him the key to all rome may be out there in this hideous night they began to climb scrambling over tortured worn rocks the air was suddenly cooler in pockets to his left constantine glimpsed a few glowing portals he imagined the jagged presence of the cones around him without actually being able to see them the ladder needs repair said the noseless monk he thrust his taper towards a weathered wooden lattice that climbed into the blackness watch that the steps dont break you being big constantine heard the old wood creak beneath him as he climbed after what seemed an endless purgatorial ascent the monk paused ahead of him and the timber beneath his foot groaned cracked and sagged constantines foot flew out into the dead void and his shoulders seared with pain as he suspended his ponderous bulk from his burning hands where he found the will to pull himself to the next rung he could not say perhaps the hand of the pantocrator the monk helped him over the ledge constantine guessed from the condition of the ladder that brother symeon was a true eremite who never ventured from his cone cell he probably raised his food and water up with a rope brother symeon called the noseless monk as he stopped beneath the tiny hewn door brother symeon i have brought a man to help you a man from constantinople brother symeon constantine heard no answer brother called the monk to constantine come brother symeon will see you constantine ducked beneath the entrance scraping his head against the rough lintel he could straighten up inside the cell the noseless monk held his taper out so that constantine could see brother symeon constantine moaned with shock and despair and his knees went out from under him pitching him to the rough stone floor the fountain resembled an enormous pinecone the surrounding cypresses echoed the intricately perforated marble shape water bubbled with a musical faintly chiming sound maria was standing in the pool her chiffon underskirt pulled up to her knees maria maria turned her eyes seemed shrouded swollen why she said you asked me once why i wanted to cause you pain now i ask you why she thumped her breast with a tight fist and glared if there is some vengeance that you want now my breast has no more armour no need of armour the knife is in it twist it if you want haraldr waded in after her and she stood erect with her breast out as if challenging him to a combat he put his arms around her and pressed her warm cheek to his then he held her away and found her eyes i told you once i was from an important family in norway that was no lie but not all the truth i am the rightful king of norway uncrowned only because i have not returned to claim what is mine maria held him as if he were the last thing she would ever hold in her life she kissed his face and neck with wet passion her tears spilling onto his robe i knew you were no land man no mere nobleman she whispered i knew it the first time we talked i knew you bowed to no one then maria stiffened with shock mother of god she murmured as if greeting death when must you leave just as suddenly she smothered him again i will go to this norway with you she murmured hotly i will be anything if you have a queen i will be your concubine haraldr held her to him and looked up at the brilliant mantle of stars they were falling now the two of them falling from those heights and while there was fear there was also a joy he had never imagined i have no queen and everything in my soul wants to make you my queen he paused and stroked her hair lightly and listened to the sibilance of fates warning as he plunged through the stars could she hear it but there would be terrible dangers for you on the journey and i see you here in the light and sun and beauty of rome and it breaks my heart to see you there in a night that lasts for months with the rough men of my court in the shrieking cold of our winter i would die to see the light go out of your eyes she clutched his robe and looked at him with a new blue flame would i have a life here without you i have seen the beauty of norway in your eyes and there is no place on earth where winter is not followed by persephones return there are rough men in our court too hetairarch even if their words are oiled she pulled his mouth to hers and whispered before she let their lips touch and if the night is long then we will kindle a fire inside it that will burn for ever maria pressed her breast tightly to haraldrs and he could already feel her naked body next to him beneath thick down covers in the royal hall of norway at nidaros brother symeon has not been well constantine gasped and clutched at his throbbing chest not well brother symeon who sat against the wall opposite the door his legs crossed in front of him was a pile of bones to which still clung not even a few desiccated shreds of flesh apparently mice were agile enough to scale these heights even if dogs werent the scavengers had left some tattered fragments of the late chartophylaxs coarse wool habit constantine watched in astonishment as the noseless monk ladled water into the skulls gaping intact jaws apparently the demented monk had tied the bones together with leather cords as his skeletal companion had begun to fall apart sinew by rotting sinew constantine recovered his wits quickly enough to decide on a course of action do you think brother symeon is well enough to talk to me he asked the monk i wouldnt want to disturb him hes expecting you said the monk somewhat irritably as if this were a fact any fool should have known brother symeon said constantine i believe that i can help you if i may presume to examine your correspondence constantine hoped that the monk would communicate brother symeons assent but after a moment the monk turned to him and stared as if constantines reply were now expected i seem to be having difficulty hearing brother symeon constantine told the monk if you could perhaps help me by relaying his words the monk swivelled his head to brother symeon and shrugged he waited a moment and turned back to constantine hes talking as loud as he can shouted the monk to deafening effect in the bellshaped cell cant you hear him constantine reflexively put his hands over his brutalized ears and whispered yes yes i heard him that was quite loud enough brother symeon thank you for your gracious invitation to examine your documents he began to cast his eyes about the cell whatever possessions the chartophylax had left behind surely would be easy enough to locate and hoped that he had not overestimated brother symeons hospitality apparently he had not the monk said nothing as constantine walked over and picked up the simple wooden box that rested on the floor just to the right of brother symeon despite an unadorned exterior the little casket was sealed with heavy engraved bronze hinges and a sturdy bronze padlock constantine paused and considered his words very carefully finally he said brother symeon if you please would you ask your brother there to hand me the key to this lock the monk swept dust from the floor pried up a little stone slab plucked the key out and delivered it to constantine praying fervently to the pantocrator constantine inserted the key and turned the lock and was rewarded with the firm unlatching of the mechanism the box was lined with lead sheets and the papers were loose inside it constantine sat on the floor and held the taper so that he could read after a long while he shifted and said interesting brother symeon i can see that you were quite blameless in that matter and i can assure you that the responsible authorities in constantinople will soon know of your innocence indeed they will thought constantine in addition to the usual eremite meanderings about the uncreated light and other such theological musings brother symeon had chosen to preserve an account of his own fall from grace apparently he had discovered the evidence of the bastard child and communicated the secret to father katalakon who had gone to joannes with the information apparently over the objections of brother symeon joannes had immediately incarcerated father katalakon in the neorion and had dispatched some thugs to transport poor brother symeon to the same location but brother symeon had been hidden by his brethren and then spirited off to the sanctuary where he had ended his days constantine went back through the parchments certain that the crucial letter had to be among these documents but no he peeled away the lead lining and found nothing he went through the parchments again then he almost burst into a sob at the realization joannes had the letter still all was not lost it was conceivable that father katalakon still lived no but just the knowledge of the crime joannes had committed and the secret he suppressed would be useful no suddenly constantine knew the utter despair of his position sitting here in the hot cappadocian night with an addlebrained noseless monk trying to pull secrets from a pile of stinking bones while his nephew might already be chanting the psalter on some distant island he wanted to let soothing desperate tears flow and yet he told himself that a man of ability does not succumb to such predicaments constantine thrust his taper out into the cell were there perhaps other caskets no then something glimmered in brother symeons tattered habit there behind the empty rib cage yes it was large enough yes indeed yes brother symeon began constantine his voice tremulous with excitement i am ready to return to constantinople to plead your case but in order to do so i must take with me that letter you have sealed in lead sheets and sewn into the lining of your frock please excuse me while i remove it constantine crawled over beside the skeleton and reached warily he prayed to the pantocrator that he would not knock brother symeons skull off its perch of strungtogether vertebrae the thin lead container came away easily and with trembling hands constantine peeled the pliable metal sheets apart he saw immediately that the parchment was inscribed with the critical file numbers above the top margin he rose to his feet as he read in the eerie torchlight incredible it was all here the name the disposition of the child incredible had they ever told the child perhaps but perhaps not no wonder joannes wanted this secret buried it would change everything brother symeon said constantine bowing before the openmouthed skull these documents have convinced me that the entire roman empire will soon be indebted to your scrupulous regard for the truth each time will be better from now on whispered maria this was the beginning her wet body pressed against haraldrs and she kissed him on the neck their lovemaking had been different from before with none of the sudden violence or exhausting ritual that had marked their passion in the past tonight had been tender and intimate in a casual endearing way they no longer clutched for each other in the huge vortex of fate but simply felt their closeness in the quiet room maria propped herself up on her elbow i want to wait until we return to norway to marry you she said i want to become your wife in your land by your custom i want norway to be my home no i want to marry you here as quickly as custom permits i want you in my bed every night that doesnt matter i will live with you as your mistress haraldr leaned his head up and looked at her are you telling me that your orthodox church would object to our marriage no but they would submit you to excruciating rites of instruction in the one true faith may the holy mother forgive me but i would rather have your heathen body next to me than have you off in the hagia sophia chanting with the priests i will marry you in your church it is christs church is it not i dont think i want this odin to bless my marriage bed yes my brother left a strong christian church i may have to rebuild it but we will be wed as christians so that is settled you will find churches in norway very small palaces even smaller this room is small this bed smaller still they began to kiss simple kisses punctuated with whispered confidences and slowly they made love again and when they were done they lay so close together that each seemed to be breathing for the other but between them there were still secrets vii hetairarch joannes bowed and gestured for the senators to remove haraldrs drenched cloak the cold december wind flung the rain at their faces like bits of scree im sorry that it is not a good day to be out but then it is worse for them joannes nodded at the enormous crowd of miserable soaked indigents who clustered outside the portal of the new redemption of the world charity hospital you were correct hetairarch said joannes as he looked out over the sodden dullcoloured throng this was a shame that rome could not long have suffered joannes took haraldr by the arm and led him down the arcaded walkway to the street may i show you to them you are a popular man here since you began distributing free food in the studion and it will do you well to be seen with me thought haraldr as he walked beside the giant monk haraldr glanced at the deformed face and thought of the vision joannes had revealed deep in the bulgarslayers empty treasury could joannes ever find in that vision a just rome that served all its citizens unlikely and that was why haraldr would have to deal with him before he and maria could in good conscience leave rome but the emperor despite a minor setback earlier in the autumn no doubt prompted by an overly hasty resumption of his duties after the bulgarian campaign grew stronger each day he had exercised with the men of the grand hetairia two days ago and it seemed likely that he would soon return to his wifes bed perhaps the emperor could give joanness vision the depth it was missing perhaps joannes would be forced by the sheer momentum of gestures like this to change his policies a man could be ensnared by his good deeds as easily as he could by his sins haraldr entertained his own vision being able to leave rome without the bloodbath that would follow the final judgement of the orphanotrophus joannes your hetairarch boomed joannes the crowd was mad with delight hetairarch hetairarch hetairarch they chanted waving their arms high i detest ceremony said joannes somewhat sourly as the acclaim finally ebbed or i would have arranged something as it is it seems that the appearance of the hetairarch is quite enough ceremony for them he urged haraldr back from the street you must see it i readily confess to sinful pride over it it is a marvel no facet of the healing arts has been left unpolished no comfort for the ailing neglected joannes the obligatory senators trailing behind him like whipped dogs was greeted at the entrance to the hospital by many of the staff of physicians which included half a dozen women in long linen robes joannes gestured down the long vaulted hallway to his left the dictates of modesty prevent us from visiting the womens wards but i assure you that they are as well equipped and staffed as the mens facilities that we will see needless to say our women physicians are a great comfort to the infirm of their own gender for they allow our female patients to discuss freely symptoms peculiar to their sex and submit to examination without exposing their female organs and their inherent delicacy to their opposite gender haraldr wanted to guffaw in open derision at joanness sudden concern for female delicacy no such gender distinctions were made in neorion but it had long ago become clear to him that rome was an empire built on saying one thing and doing another it is also an empire built on astonishing knowledge and achievement thought haraldr as the chief physician a sagaciouslooking man with a long silver beard and wide worried eyes led them through the wards row after row of beds all occupied with clean linen mattresses and pillows stuffed with wool not straw and with clean mats on the swept floors beneath them quilts covered most of the patients and a hypocaust system just like those in the palace circulated hot air beneath the floor providing a clean dry heat the chief physician explained that the different wards were kept at various temperatures depending on the nature of the ailment and which humours were contributing to the symptoms joanness entourage paused by the bed of a man with a face as yellow as syrian silk the chief physician pointed out the toilet that the man had been provided the same as was furnished to all the patients his own sponge basin towels and soap for bathing arranged neatly by the bed and a chamber pot set at the end of the bed an assistant brought the chief physician a copper basin full of steaming water and the chief physician carefully soaped rinsed and dried his hands on a clean towel the chief physician then pulled back the batted quilt lifted the yellowfaced mans robe and pressed his abdomen with long searching fingers he looked up at the group around him the rheumatics have yet to be evacuated he said as there is danger that they may lodge in the body and be transported into the heart i will ask the apothecary here he gestured to a younger blackbearded physician to prescribe an herbal purgative the chief physician stood and pointed to a pastylooking wretch sleeping two beds down from the yellowfaced man another physician held the mans elbow over a small copper bowl and collected blood from a slit just inside the crook of the arm if the purgatives do not induce the evacuation then we will have recourse to a phlebotomy as you see practised there six enormous wards of perhaps a hundred beds each occupied the main rooms of the hospital subsidiary chambers housed a bakery baths a kitchen and chemists laboratories for the production of medicinal potions and salves there was even a tool room where the dignitaries were shown a grindstone ingeniously attached to a whirling lathe for the purpose of meticulously sharpening surgical blades joannes watched the surgeons assistant hone a small steel instrument when the screeching of the grindstone stopped joannes turned and whispered to haraldr i am beginning to understand your northmans wisdom hetairarch these blades he gestured at the shining rows of surgical instruments on the workmans bench will do far more to ensure the peace and stability of the studion than the blades i have used in neorion i would like to believe that you have learned that lesson orphanotrophus haraldr whispered back you would save me the effort of putting a particularly keen edge on my own blade joannes continued to study the immaculately boned scalpels but he nodded his understanding you must enjoy this while you can said maria it is not seemly for a man to bathe with his wife she playfully splashed the cool but comfortable water in his face perhaps that is your custom i will make the queen of norway sit in the sauna with me until she is as red as a lobster and then take her outside and rub snow all over her myself i do not wish to scandalize your people haraldr pulled her almost weightless floating body towards him and felt her hot silky breast like a rare oil spread on his skin so a man troths you and suddenly you have become a woman of convention like lady attalietes maria rose above him like a sea nymph her wet breasts shimmering in the light did you imagine that you made love to theophano attalietes last night i am only concerned that my children do not have a mother of bad reputation haraldr kissed her deeply and imagined the kings she would bear him and norway fierce powerful with the passion to lead and the intelligence to mediate kings who would marry the strengths of norway and rome and perhaps some day even rule over both finally maria pulled away and hung her arm round haraldrs shoulder her legs fluttered above the tiled bottom of the deep pool i am concerned about your reaction to joanness latest contribution to the welfare of his brothers subjects she said his enthusiasm had troubled her since he had returned home that evening with tales of quite ordinary healing arts he has built several of these hospitals already usually coercing various dignitaries into financing them and he always ends up appropriating most of the operating capital to his own coffers while the institution quickly declines into a putrid alms house or even a brothel yes but that has always been in the middleclass precincts where the need for such care is not desperate believe me little light i have no illusions about the character of the orphanotrophus but now that he has extended his arms to the people of the studion the people are not likely to allow so easily those arms to be withdrawn and the emperor is i believe almost fit enough to impose his own stamp on the business of the empire joannes will soon find himself wedged in on both top and bottom and forced to make far more sweeping accommodations if joannes can be coerced into saving lives and offering hope isnt that vastly preferable to the lives that would be lost if i were to attack him perhaps i am becoming too much like a roman but cant a better vengeance sometimes be achieved simply by the threat of vengeance maria let her body drift to face haraldr and put her other arm round him i think it is dangerous for you to assume you have learned to think in the roman fashion there are layers of that mind which you do not understand and i hope you never will i will not share your optimism until the emperor has acknowledged the wife who has given him and his brother their power i can assure you that is imminent can you promise not to reveal this to her majesty i would not want her to know and then find that i am mistaken of course she laughed you are my majesty she is just the empress i heard the emperor discuss with one of his chamberlains the movement of some of his robes to rooms adjacent to her majestys winter apartments oh theotokos bless you said maria i am going to go to the church tomorrow and leave candles on the altar and pray that it is true it means that you may soon have to leave her said haraldr soberly looking at her directly perhaps for ever i know said maria her eyes already tearing but when she has her husband back she will no longer need me so much besides i heard a venetian discuss a route through the frankish lands that seems much safer than the one you took through rus i think we could return sometime on a pilgrimage haraldr hoped they would able to return he would not want to leave thinking he would never see the empress city again he pressed marias head against his i will bring you back maria nuzzled his cheek do you understand why i cannot leave zoe until her husband returns to her she asked even though they had already come to that agreement of course said haraldr i would not leave myself unless that matter was resolved i have great devotion to our empress as well maria wrapped her smooth strong legs tightly round haraldrs waist and slid her arms round his neck let me show you something she growled sensually that would be quite beyond lady attalietess comprehension michael kalaphates watched the servant ladle pungent garos sauce over his roast mutton uncle i hope you are pleased with the new cook i imagine i havent told you yet how his predecessor was afflicted he maintains that a serving girl gave him the infection so he has lodged himself in a room near st artemius and goes there daily to coat the diseased member with wax melted from cakes bearing the saints likeness it sounds to me like a case of the cure being rather more excruciating than the disease in any event i should like this new cook to compensate for the deprivations you suffered on your surpassingly arduous and fateful journey although i must say that i have never seen such health and vigour on your face my dear uncle you look quite like an emperor with the lustre of a successful campaign in the field about him uncle forgive me if i do go on you have no notion of how lonely it has been here without you this is a miserable season here in the north to think that antioch is still simmering in autumns radiance constantine smiled at his nephew across a tablecloth embroidered with gold peacocks i can assure you nephew there were many evenings on the road between here and cappadocia when i more than empathized with your loneliness but i dont think you need to concern yourself with the fate of isolation any longer michael squirmed in his seat like a small child anticipating his easter treats you have no idea how madly i want to ride into the forum of constantine and proclaim the secret you have so assiduously uncovered but i quite defer to your judgement in the matter you have been unerring in your perceptions so far i learned long ago that the time to bet with a man is when he seems to have won so many precarious wagers in a row that he cannot possibly win the next throw when i hear about your ghastly adventures and think how close you came to not returning at all i quite lose my appetite i truly believe uncle that it was the hand of the pantocrator that brought you back to me michael paused and sopped up the thin vinegary garos sauce with a piece of mutton still uncle i must remind you that all runs of luck inevitably come to an end even alexander of macedon was felled just when he seemed invincible i have to confess to a certain disquietude despite our extraordinary good fortune constantine wiped his mouth with a crisp linen napkin we must proceed very carefully nephew i need to return to my putative office in the palace and begin deliberating on who shall be the first initiate into our exclusive little cabal that is a very important selection it is tantamount to naming your chief minister also remember this because i consider this caution to be of utmost importance to your success in the office to which you will now unquestionably accede rome is like a horse or let us say a team of four that has grown accustomed to a certain hand on the reins if a new driver desires to race this team he should first stand beside the old driver and observe his techniques in handling this team his idiosyncrasies and use of the whip before attempting to take the reins and whip in his own hands believe me uncle i am quite accommodated to the temporary usefulness of joannes in our scheme i sincerely think that there is a great deal to be learned in watching him he certainly knows how to wield the whip effectively he has erred i think in never allowing the beast a lick of salt or a soothing word and pat on the neck both are necessary to produce a swift team astutely put nephew but i think joannes may be realizing that i have heard that the hospital he has endowed in the studion is now accepting the wretches for treatment yes it is reported to me that he had the mob assembled today despite the wretched weather he even brought out the rabbles hero our friend the hetairarch michael broke off as his chamberlain scurried into the room he looked up quizzically at the slender eunuchs blanched face what is it man the komes of the imperial khazar guard entered the room to the rattling of his armour and squeaking of his wet boots and leather fittings he bowed i am sorry to disturb you majesty he said to michael but the emperor has summoned you to the palace he has provided you with escort for your immediate departure your uncle is to accompany you the komes stepped forward to present the purpletinted document michael rose and accepted the paper like a man walking in his own nightmare his hands trembled and his face was the colour of wet chalk he stared at the purple text with wide black eyes god save us uncle he whispered it appears our luck has already turned what is that whispered maria drowsily haraldr sat up and listened a door closed downstairs and he heard someone clanking through the halls one of my men said haraldr damn i hope it is not something that will require my presence in the palace i hope not too said maria wrapping her warm arms round his waist it is sad enough to say farewell in the dawn light at this hour of the night the chamberlain knocked on the antechamber door and haraldr called out to him to enter the light from the oil lamp glowed through the archway that separated the two rooms what is it john asked haraldr haraldr it was ulfrs voice i am sorry but the emperor has requested that you attend him he wants to be escorted to the monastery of the anargyroi what whispered maria to haraldr i thought he was spending less time with his holy men to go off at this hour in this weather will only make him ill again i think this may be the day we have waited for said haraldr the emperor is going to anargyroi to ask the saints forgiveness for once more entering his wifes bedchamber haraldr kissed maria and got out of bed with a sudden eagerness to meet the cold wet dawn i dont want any more pastries and i dont care for any more wine shouted michael kalaphates i am the caesar and i demand to know why i have been summoned here in the name of the emperor and have travelled most of the wretched night only to be greeted by chamberlains offering me pastries and wine i demand to know when i can expect his majesty to receive me my uncle and i have waited for what i count as three hours now we did not come here to mince pastries and sip wine to the accompaniment of cockcrow michael stood and glared at the trembling chamberlain satisfied that his outburst had conveyed the importance of his abused imperial dignity the chamberlain bowed and retreated with his arms crossed over his breast constantine looked around the sumptuously appointed antechamber green thessalian marble revetted the walls and a silver candelabra illuminated the complex opussectile patterns on the floor he plumped the scarlet silk pillow against which he was reclining and fingered a gold tassel we are in the same building as the imperial apartments he said as you know i have never been invited there but i have been privileged to familiarize myself with the location apparently our informal reception is in keeping with my imperial brothers regard for our importance when i think that he has not even had the courtesy born of blood to greet me in the time i have been here well this is preferable to neorion said michael with false bravado when the simpering chamberlain reappears i think i will have more of that wine it is quite a bit better than i am getting ah michael turned to the swishing of a silk robe but saw that it was not the chamberlain the elegant silverheaded parakoimomenos entered the room and fell on his knees before the caesar as prescribed by protocol well at last someone who can tell us what is going on here said constantine the parakoimomenos stood and bowed majesty eminent sir the emperor has commanded that you be lodged here in the imperial apartments until such time as he asks for you please send for me personally if you feel that any courtesy has been withheld from you i will now direct the chamberlain to assist you to your bedchambers the parakoimomenos bowed and retreated as prescribed the renovation and expansion of the monastery of the anargyroi was still under way a lattice of wooden scaffolding visible in the first faint lightening of the sullen wet sky surrounded the unfinished west wing and several broad areas of graded earth flanked the walls awaiting the spring plantings the reception portal in front had been finished and the intricately foliate arches had a lustre of newly cut stone that even the lingering night could not conceal the emperors curtained litter was borne quickly through the south wing of the monastic complex and out into the newly landscaped courtyard in front of the church why the secrecy whispered ulfr as the litter carried by burly khazars halted beneath the open arcade in front of the church there is hardly anyone about in the city at this hour to see him and i am certain he does not need to fear an assassin from among his people i think said haraldr that he is overcome by a certain modesty if i am correct as to what he is about he has led a rather saintly life for many months and now he is returning to more secular pursuits haraldr could not help but remember with both acute guilt and pleasure his night with the empress the emperor would soon forget his saints and holy men the monk cosmas tzintzuluces looked inquiringly at the hetairarch haraldr nodded for the monk to assist the emperor from his litter haraldr liked tzintzuluces though he did not quite understand him the monk truly loved the emperor and his ardent if extreme piety was unlike that of most monks one encountered at court unquestionably sincere haraldr also felt a certain sympathy for the frail sadeyed monk who would soon have to watch his prize novitiate once again succumb to the perils of the flesh with trembling fingers tzintzuluces pulled back the curtain haraldr and ulfr prostrated themselves when they rose they clutched each others arms in a desperate reflex no haraldrs mind screamed by all the gods no i have seen this important imposter before and he is not my emperor by all the gods no bloated beyond recognition his purple robes and glittering imperial diadem the only indications of who he was the emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans struggled to stand haraldr rushed forward to help him and was met with the appalling stench of a corpse he was aware only of the tearblurred aura of the brilliant lights and glowing altar as he virtually carried the limp grotesquely pulpy body into the sanctuary tzintzuluces and two priests helped him lower the emperor to his knees haraldr stood his mind reeling and backed away joannes was beside him tears fell from the recessed sockets of joanness eyes and glistened on the smooth slabs of his cheeks holy father joannes moaned in a weak almost hysterical voice a voice haraldr had never heard before it was so sudden the fit came on him two days ago he suffered as never before and then yesterday i thought we had lost him i thought joanness misshapen shoulders jerked spasmodically and he wailed tzintzuluces left the emperor to the attentions of the priests and placed his spindly arms around the huge bulk of the fearsome orphanotrophus joannes bawled like a child we must allow him to make the sacrifice now said tzintzuluces gently we must joannes fell to his knees and pounded his chest until it seemed the walls would shake take me he pleaded to the altar take me in his stead tzintzuluces continued to soothe joannes please we must he has so little time joannes mastered himself with a great effort of will yes he whispered his giant arms trembling with an animation of their own yes we must his voice trailed off to a strangled sigh and he slumped to the floor tzintzuluces returned to the kneeling quaking emperor and whispered to him the emperor began to speak in rattling syllables punctuated by gurgling sounds it was obvious that the same enormous courage and physical will he had shown against the bulgars would be necessary simply to complete the ritual he now undertook most holy lord king of kings he pronounced torturously may you find me a worthy sacrifice accept me to your unstained bosom receive me in pure grace when i have achieved my consecration the emperor lifted his bobbing bloated head to the priests i am your willing sacrifice the priests simultaneously signed him with the cross and began a long mournful slowly rising and falling chant when they had repeated the invocations of the lords sacrifice they gently removed the emperors purple robe and placed over him a rough woollen mantle they removed the imperial diadem from his head and with scissors clipped away his hair and beard finally they signed the cross over him again and stood away it was a miracle of sorts that the bloated corpse could continue to kneel without assistance and yet as haraldr watched the shorn face of the former emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans now a simple monk about to humble himself before the pantocrator to whom all men must bow he realized that the newly initiated brother michaels eyes glowed with a happiness he had never before seen on the emperor michaels face i am ready to begin my journey michael said raspily tears of profound joy streaming down his waxy stubbled hideously swollen cheeks halldor came to haraldrs side he alone seemed in command of his emotions his cloak and armour were drenched from a renewed downpour you had better come he whispered haraldr followed him outside into the courtyard the woman stood alone in the rain her fur cape beaten down by the pelting cold drops haraldr did not recognize her tortured face until she spoke i must see him said zoe i must see him before the empress collapsed to her knees and pounded the sodden earth i must haraldr lifted zoe to her feet and brought her beneath the shelter of the narthex arcade he nodded at halldor to take care of her while he went back inside the church michael had been moved to a cot and haraldr was certain he had already completed his lifes journey but his head rolled and his gleaming dark eyes opened into the light hetairarch he gasped the pantocrator asked you to give me back my life now he has accepted that life bless you haraldr gripped michaels monstrous dropsied fingers your wife haraldr whispered to him your wife wishes to see you the pain returned to michaels eyes and he shut them as if the light pierced them with awls lord god help me i cannot oh lord he opened his eyes again she must remember me as i was tell her it is not her shame but my own haraldr let go of michaels hand and rose from his knees let him die in peace he decided let her have the beauty of her memories he turned and walked outside haraldr took zoe in his arms and whispered in her ear he says it is not your shame but his own can you understand why he cannot zoe slumped her head fell back and a terrible cry seemed to emerge from her distended neck rather than from her distorted mouth haraldr cupped her head and brought her face next to his try to understand remember the man you loved zoes neck went limp and she collapsed haraldr left her in halldors arms and rushed back into the church joannes knelt at his brothers cot his huge head on michaels chest his entire body heaving with sobs michaels head lay to the side motionless the monk cosmas tzintzuluces turned to haraldr his dark eyes transformed with an ineffable joy brother michael has been accepted into the arms of the pantocrator whispered the monk the rainbow colours of the assembled dignitaries of the imperial court had been replaced by robes of black sackcloth even the vast octagonal dome of the hall of nineteen couches wreathed in golden vines was dulled by a mourning sky that pounded the clerestory windows with cold rain only one man was privileged to wear colour at this ceremony the emperor stretched out on a gilded bier was for the last time attired in the purpleandgold robes of the autocrator the goldandpearl imperial diadem on his head michael had lain in state for three days and in the chill of the hall his features had settled into a pale claret effigy of the man who had once held hegemony over the entire world the orphanotrophus joannes kneeled beside the bier as he had without motion without sustenance for the entire three days the patriarch alexius signed over the body and nodded to the parakoimomenos the parakoimomenos lifted his shrouded face slowly as if the gravity of his task had turned his head into a ponderous granite effigy the rain tapped faintly at the windows far above and the great still hall seemed suddenly colder the parakoimomenoss thundering voice rent the stillness with icy knifing blows arise o king of the world and obey the summons of the king of kings the parakoimomenoss words pealed through the huge dome and returned just as he began again arise o king of the world and obey the summons of the king of kings after the third repetition of the grim summons it seemed as if the dome would split from the shattering force of the resounding commands as the emperor had wished the procession to his final resting place in the church of the anargyroi was a simple one michael was borne from his bier as the christ had been from calvary in the arms of those who loved him and had served him haraldr stood between the entranced orphanotrophus and the steelyeyed grand domestic isaac camytzes the body drained of fluid seemed so light that haraldr was not conscious of a burden the people waited along the mese silent wet a colourless mosaic of tens of thousands of pale stunned faces against the lightconsuming backdrop of their coarse black robes and capes yet as he passed haraldr felt and heard an unmistakable undercurrent a murmuring like a cascade of snow from a distant peak and he realized how dangerous joanness immobilizing grief had become why had joannes refused to allow the caesar to appear in the procession it was evident that the people who had come to bid their emperor farewell were confused even angry and understandably so who would lead them did the orphanotrophus now propose to have himself crowned against all laws of state god and nature cosmas tzintzuiuces stood by the simple porphyry sarcophagus that waited to the left of the church of the anargyrois golden altar the blazing candelabra proclaimed the resurrection the pallbearers lowered the body into the crypt the parakoimomenos stepped forward again and called out enter king of the world the king of kings the lord of lords calls you he paused until the church was still again and even the candies could be heard sputtering beside the altar remove your crown the patriarch alexius stepped forward and removed the goldandpearl diadem from michaels head he placed the helmetlike crown on a silk pillow presented by a priest and accepted a simple purple silk band from another pillow he slipped the purple band around michaels brow and signed three times over the corpses chalky forehead then he stepped back and the marble lid was lowered as soon as the face of the emperor autocrator and basileus of rome had vanished for ever from the world he had once ruled joannes turned and fixed his dark barely discernible gaze on the imperial diadem better stay back boy if they see us together theyll want us to take them to the chalke gate tonight the blue star tugged on haraldrs heavy woollen cloak pulling him back into the narrow refuseglutted alley her towering bearded son stood protectively behind her haraldr moved back but stuck his head around the ragged brick corner of the tenement at the street corner to his left a bonfire sputtered against the cold drizzle a crowd of as many as several hundred anonymous and virtually asexual in their tattered brown tunics had gathered around the blaze but not for warmth the sound was a continuous murmur of discussion punctuated by periodic outbursts they were asking themselves one question who would rule them and they were offering themselves the answer that had brought them into the streets joannes the name was a staccato epithet spat forth in harsh punctuation to the general anxiety occasionally wooden staffs jutted into the air its building boy said the blue star joannes bought himself three days grace with that hospital but if another night goes by without the purpleborn proclaiming her husbands successor these people are going to know that joannes intends to keep the imperial diadem for himself when they realize that one hospital isnt going to keep them from going up on those hills and then it wont be just the studion that will burn haraldr drew his head back and turned to the blue star he had seen at least two dozen streetcorner gatherings like this on his way into the studion he wasnt certain these people would wait until tomorrow night his own internal debate continued why not let loose this collective rage use his grand hetairia to hold the imperial taghmata in check and purge rome of joannes and his dhynatoi accomplices but there were several reasons why not foremost with the traitor mar and his men in exile and the terrible attrition of his own pledgemen in the bulgarian campaign he had one third the strength he had been able to count on the last time he had considered this equation and the last time he had not had an opportunity to see his ally mustered for battle he looked at the pathetic wretches with their staves and stones and realized how many of these innocents would be slaughtered what will you do boy haraldr gave fate a fools reply but to honour the only answer he could if joannes crowns himself emperor the grand hetairia under my command will besiege him in the hagia sophia and demand that he relinquish the imperial diadem i think we will be joined by many factions of the imperial administration and we will eventually be defeated and massacred by the imperial taghmata he silently concluded it is possible he offered with more hope than proof that joanness delay is due to genuine grief i had never believed joannes capable of any love except power and yet i believe he truly loved his brother in some strange way his brother seems to have been the repository of all the love and kindness that had otherwise been driven from joanness breast that love is now buried said the blue star her irony ominous she made a smacking sound with her lips but it is possible he will offer this caesar up to conceal his own ambitions will you swear your loyalty to this caesar yes presuming that the empress will endorse him that too was in doubt zoe herself had told haraldr that she considered the caesar to be too weak to challenge joannes i think it is to the benefit of both rome and the studion to give this caesar an opportunity to oppose his uncle and to serve his purpleborn empress and her people i have followed the caesars rise more closely than many and i see a much more capable man than others credit him haraldr again was struck by the parallel between himself and michael kalaphates how they had both been accused of lacking ambition and how fate had given them both an opportunity to prove otherwise capable perhaps but capable of good or ill boy that was the question haraldr had with no little foreboding just asked himself what was it that day on the ambo in the hagia sophia when their eyes had met if he is capable of good i will serve him until he can serve the people of the studion and then i will return to my people if he is capable only of evil i will consider him another account i must settle before i can leave rome the blue star nodded approvingly if joannes crowns the caesar we will wait and see what he is prepared to render unto the studion but look for yourself boy their patience is growing short the blue star stuck her pudgy face round the corner her breathing fogged the cold misty air she turned back to haraldr and looked up at him her eyes gleaming with the power of the other rome the rome that did not stroll silkfrocked through marble palaces these people have accounts to be settled too boy this is not tolerable shouted michael kalaphates caesar of rome i am led to understand that the burial has already taken place and that my uncle and i have not even been granted the courtesy of viewing the mortal container of our relative and sovereign i dont think you understand the position you find yourself in chamberlain you are inflaming the brow that will soon be illuminated by the imperial diadem the chamberlain bowed smoothly i am to tell you that the orphanotrophus joannes will shortly join you he is on his way he crossed his hands over his breast and withdrew the orphanotrophus will now deign to join us now that he has concluded the affairs of state michaels face was brilliant red his eyes like glass who is the heir here uncle who will soon receive the crown that rules over humankind constantine grasped michaels shoulders in his surprisingly powerful hands nephew nephew master yourself michael seemed jolted by his uncles admonishment and his eyes snapped back into focus as if he had just emerged from one of abelass trances i am sorry uncle i quite forgot myself listen to me nephew said constantine with a firmness and authority that his voice had never had before it was as if the imperial diadem had in fact been passed from the late emperors head to his we havent much time remember this when joannes arrives he is the emperor now if you let that thought leave your head you will find your head leaving your body but what of our secret uncle isnt this the time right now our secret is but an ingot awaiting the goldsmiths hammer we have many laborious steps ahead of us before that lump of metal can be shaped to glorious effect this is the first step in that process of transformation michael looked at his uncle his face as stricken with confusion as that of a schoolboy who understands nothing of what his master has told him but who also knows that the lash will be at his back if he does not commit it to memory yes uncle i trust you you know that i will follow in your steps as obediently as if the christ himself were walking before me he embraced constantine thank you for saving me uncle i will find some way to reward you the chamberlain arrived a moment later the orphanotrophus he announced joannes swept into the room his distorted features inscrutable michael watched in rapt astonishment as constantine dived to his knees before his brother and clutched his legs and smothered his thighs with kisses he took the cue and himself fell to his knees and held out his hands to joannes the orphanotrophuss eyes seemed to devour this adulation it was as if fires were slowly kindling within the dark sockets brother nephew joannes gestured for them to rise rome is now vested in our hands and yet we cannot rule her without the generous endowment of our bereaved purpleborn empress he turned to michael nephew go to her succour her in her grief remind her of the pledges she has made to her adoptive son and pledge yourself to her again with your hand upon the holy relics beg her to sponsor you in your coronation as emperor and ask her to proclaim immediately her sponsorship to her people constantine cleared his throat my esteemed brother am i to understand that there is a threat of rebellion in the streets joannes glared at constantine and did not answer he turned to michael nephew you must console our purpleborn mother before grief overcomes her and the proclamation must be delivered before the people can gather tomorrow yes my master said michael without even a hint of irony he bowed and departed on his errand keleusate the eunuch cloaked in black bowed and withdrew as michael rose to his feet he hardly recognized zoe her face was swathed in a black veil only her eyes and the few rudely shorn strands of blonde hair that fell onto her forehead were visible and the eyes were those of an ancient woman michael had known that she was perhaps old enough to be his mother now her eyes might be those of his grandmother he had never been shocked at the notion of bedding his uncles wife but now he could not imagine how he had slept with this crone my little boy zoe croaked in a voice as weary as her visible soul michael wanted to cringe as she came towards him he watched her blackgloved hands reach out and for a fleeting instant wondered if the hands beneath them had become dry cracked spotted with age and then he could only think better these hands than those that would handle me in the neorion to his enormous relief zoe only maternally stroked the hair at his temples my little boy she said again zoe indicated for michael to sit on the couch opposite hers again he was flooded with relief i know what you have come for my child now her eyes seemed powerful alert even slightly sensual of course you will have my endorsement as our new emperor you are after all my son if not of my loins then of my heart michael steeled himself for the proposal he knew he had to make i know it is monstrously audacious for me to presume and an inexcusable transgression upon the sanctity of your grief but my soul begs me to ask will you take me as your husband zoes laugh coming from behind her veil was gentle and yet also slightly evil i would soon weary of the role of jocasta to your oedipus my son zoe clasped her gloved hands and set them in her lap no i do not want you as my husband but i will endorse your imperial pretensions for a price that carries no carnal obligations what i must have from you in exchange for my endorsement is a guarantee michael nodded ready to offer anything in return for her somewhat unexpected and wholly welcome refusal of his offer you must promise to shield me from even the slightest hint of a threat from joannes remember you will not be protected by the status of husband to the purpleborn remember that i have my own considerable resources in this court if i even suspect an intrigue involving the orphanotrophus i will withdraw my acquiescence in your sovereignty and unleash the fury of my people upon you michael was jolted by his sudden realization of what her refusal of his troth had cost him even if only temporarily damn she was still not one to challenge but it was as constantine had said there were many steps to their goal you have my guarantee and the devotion that even a son could not offer you my mistress my mother very well my little boy now kiss your mothers hand and leave her the empress must compose a proclamation to the people of her city i grieve for her said the purpleborn augusta theodora she seemed more thoughtful than mournful her blue eyes focused on the iceslick marble floor theodora wore a purple silk cape lined with sable the single brazier in her apartment provided little heat except in extreme cold she rarely fired the huge hypocaust furnaces that circulated warm air under the floor i cannot grieve for him not after the pain he caused her he will be judged at the tribunal at which all souls are judged my child alexius patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith waved his beringed lithely powerful fingers as if absolving the dead emperor himself he sat on a silk couch and was swaddled in a huge ermine cloak dotted with gold velour crucifixes i pray that in death the pantocrator who has sat at his side will take him to his bosom he was a good man used to bad ends to what ends will his successor be used father alexius smiled wryly i am pleased to see that your contemplation of the lords mansions has not deterred you from occasionally giving thought to the imperial palace theodoras eyes snapped up from the floor for that moment they seemed every bit as quick and potentially lethal as the patriarchs prowling irises from time to time i remember the cross we have discussed father however i do not think it is time for me to carry that burden to my golgotha nor do i child it might surprise you to know that when i crown this caesar for the second time tomorrow i intend to do so with vastly more enthusiasm than i was able to summon on the previous occasion that you are crowning him is no surprise father said theodora a taunt in her inflection she had become comfortable enough with alexius and had seen his own temporal needs clearly enough that she no longer restrained the sharp tongue with which she dissected almost everyone else your eagerness to do so does surprise me alexiuss thin lips compressed with a virtual smirk of selfsatisfaction as if he not only approved of theodoras impudence but credited himself for it his rich tenor also betrayed his good spirits it will be quite an unusual ceremony i wish you could be there to see it my child but i believe it will hasten the day when you will see the same ceremony from the ambo of the mother church tomorrow joannes will leash an emperor in front of all rome but i do not believe that his creation will suffer that collar blithely the master and his pet will soon be at each others throats the master will of course prevail but his wounds may render him quite vulnerable to an attack from another quarter theodoras eyes were as hard as sapphires and what then father it occurs to me that the beast we had hoped to set upon joannes is now sojourning in italia and it is not likely he will return to rome for some time alexius smiled amiably mar hunrodarson is gone from rome my child but he has not left our heart i still say a prayer each day for his heathen soul the transition of power was completed three days later in the hagia sophia the day was so dark that the bronze lamps and rings of candelabra suspended from the dome had to be lit the lights hovered in the vast space like clusters of stars after michael kalaphates received the imperial diadem from the patriarch alexius and was acclaimed as emperor autocrator and basileus of rome he was escorted from the silversheathed ambo to a throne set on a porphyry platform at the far end of the church the new emperor seemed numbed distant like a victim walking away from some great catastrophe when he reached the throne he motioned to the parakoimomenos who seemed to have aged ten years since the burial of the previous emperor the parakoimomenos nodded at his own staff of eunuchs the great church echoed with a murmur of astonishment as the eunuchs brought forth two portable thrones and set them on either side of the emperors broad canopied throne the emperor gestured and zoe dressed in her widows veiled black seated herself on the lefthand throne i am your servant said michael very clearly and then he took his seat beside the purpleborn empress one dignitary far back among the vestitores muttered aloud when joannes dressed in his monks habit then appeared and sat on the throne to the right of the emperor but the protest was lost amid the rising surge of more carefully whispered asides my master said michael in acknowledgement of joannes his homage spoken clearly enough to be heard over the speculation of his subjects after this curious beginning the ceremony of adoration proceeded in the prescribed fashion one by one the dignitaries of the roman empire prostrated themselves before the new lord of the entire world and then crawled forward to embrace his knees haraldrs place in the adoration as prescribed by protocol was after the disputers keleusate intoned the grand eunuch after haraldr had completed his prostrations haraldr embraced michaels knees and felt nothing more than the cool smooth texture of silk and gold thread nothing to evoke the strange marriage of fates that had joined them in that moment during michaels coronation as caesar autocrator may you live long said haraldr the same prescribed salutation michael would receive from each dignitary present may you be happy replied michael in a mechanical insensate drone haraldr stood and withdrew with his hands over his breast and the next dignitary fell on his face in front of the porphyry platform the ceremony continued until late in the day and thus was the power and glory of imperial rome passed on as it had been for more than a thousand years viii the protostator completed his inspection navigated the underground galleries that led from the hippodrome stables to the spiral staircase and ascended to the emperors box he blinked away the bright spring sunlight and listened for a moment to the anticipatory fervour of the crowd to his right and left the magisters and proconsular patricians along with the ambassadorial delegation from genoa had already taken their seats in the loggias on either side of the imperial box on the flat rooflike terrace behind the imperial box the emperor waited surrounded by varangians of the grand hetairia michael kalaphates wore the imperial diadem on his head the train of his jewelled pallium was drawn up over his left arm and he gripped the sapphireand rubystudded sceptre of his office in his right hand the eagles embroidered on his pallium phosphoresced in the sunlight it seemed as if the wings of gold thread were actually fluttering with motion the protostator pressed his leathery face to the carpet upon which his sovereign stood majesty he said when he rose up we await your light with a slight motion of his hand michael beckoned the protostator to come close the protostator leaned forward until his lips almost touched the pearlanddiamond lappets that covered the emperors ears and streamed down his cheeks like jewelled tears epaphroditis has drawn the first race whispered the protostator he will start in the second position michael nodded and the protostator backed away respectfully michael nodded again and the grand eunuch the same sadeyed man who had served the previous michael came forward and bowed approach the genoese ambassador michael told the grand eunuch tell him that the autocrator of rome offers him a wager i claim epaphroditis representing the blue colours as winner in the first race offer him the team and driver of his choice his choice to be made after fifteen circuits of the race are complete i will put my galley full of syrian silk still under seals in the bucoleon harbour against those six genoese merchant craft that await unloading at the neorion harbour the grand eunuch bowed and shuffled off and michael winked at his protostator he will be quite unable to refuse the opportunity to select a winner after the race is threequarters complete when i have committed myself from the outset the parakoimomenos nodded to the emperor michael moved quickly into the arcaded box his goldarmoured varangians fanning out beside him as he ascended the porphyry steps to his throne the crowd hushed reverently michael made the sign of the cross to the crowd beneath and opposite him then turned to his right and left and repeated the blessing organ music flourished and the crowd erupted into the prescribed chants of greeting the emperor seemed impatient with the adulation and he shifted his weight from one purple boot to the other finally the chants were completed and the music stopped and the vast arena became entirely silent except for the crisp snapping of the ceremonial banners michael handed his sceptre to a waiting eunuch and took the ceremonial mappa offered by the parakoimomenos he gravely lifted this swatch of white silk and watched it flutter against the glorious blue sky then he released it four bronze gates clanked open at the north end of the stadium initiating a rising fury from the crowd in an explosion of gleaming horseflesh gilded fittings and multicoloured caparisons the four teams of four appeared the anxious horses hoofs chewing up the neatly raked sand of the track the drivers dressed in leather skirts with leather corsets strapped over tunics in the colours of their teams leaned over the open backs of their light twowheeled chariots the reins taut in their hands they brought their headflinging teams slowly forward to the triangular bronze startandfinish pylon at the north end of the spina as soon as all four teams were even with the finishing line the riders slackened their reins brought their longhandled leather whips snapping over the necks of their horses and the teams charged off tossing clouds of sand behind them the crowd went into immediate hysterics virtually every man seemed to rise from his seat and wave a towel with the colours of his team on it over his head even the emperor whirled his right arm above his head as if this motion could somehow propel the teams more quickly round the track on the spina an elegantly robed attendant stood by a table on which twenty gilded ostrich eggs had been set in neat rows and as the teams thundered past the finish pylon he removed the first of the eggs as the race progressed the spectators seemed to equal the fury of the foaming horses here and there brief fistfights erupted in the stands on the seventh circuit the red team clipped the south end of the spina and flipped out of control and michael grimaced and balled his fists as epaphroditis and his blue team which was actually three black horses and one dapple on the outside swerved wildly to miss the careening red chariot the red driver somehow survived the tumble and scrambled to the railing on the outside of the track on the tenth circuit a brawl broke out among three dozen people seated high in the southern end of the stadium and batonwielding cursores scrambled through the seats to keep the peace by the fifteenth lap the green team led the white by a length and the blue of epaphroditis was almost the entire length of the spina behind michael looked down at the geneose ambassador seated in the loggia to his right the ambassador a noblelooking man with a high forehead bowed to the emperor then held up his arm and plucked at the loose sleeve of his ceremonial white robe white white you say shrieked michael against both the noise of the crowd and the restraints of protocol the ambassador nodded on lap seventeen the white team overtook the green the green fell back rapidly the second horse seemed to have a troubled gait the blues of epaphroditis flew past into second position still the white led by half the length of the spina on the eighteenth lap epaphroditis made his move bringing his whip savagely over the necks of his horses a cyclone of dust trailed behind as the blues steadily gained on the whites at the end of the eighteenth lap epaphroditis came alongside the whites but could not pass before the turn he dropped back slightly and then came alongside again on the next straight but the whites held him off and by the end of the nineteenth lap the blues had dropped off a length one egg remained on the table and the genoese ambassador looked up and waved at the emperor michael glanced at him and again fixed his sharp dark eyes on the track epaphroditiss blues made another thundering advance on the penultimate straight the whip struck again and again and the white supporters in the crowd jeered epaphroditis was leaving everything on the next to last stretch white would win easily but with a look over his shoulder the white driver saw the blue horses literally snorting at his back and he went to the whip as he rounded the last turn his sudden acceleration forced the white chariot wide and the wheels slid sideways losing traction epaphroditiss team hugged the spina as if attached by rails and suddenly squeezed through the opening provided by the centrifugal motion of the white team epaphroditis summoned the last resources from his team and lashed them on the blues won by half a length six genoese merchantmen shrieked michael he leapt from his throne and descended among the mere mortals to embrace his uncle constantine who now exceeded all other dignitaries in the newly created rank of nobilissimus uncle epaphroditis has won me six genoese merchantmen the emperor gasped with excitement you would have to send out a fleet of dhromons for an entire summer to do as well as i have with a team of four in a single morning six genoese merchantmen epaphroditis will receive one and you two uncle epaphroditis received his laurel crown from the prefect of the city somehow the scarcely animate old prefect had survived another winter then three races ensued in like fashion after the fourth race the crowd quieted expecting the usual interval diversions acrobats trained animals mock combats instead michael signed to the grand eunuch the various starting and service gates clanked open disgorging hundreds of eunuchs who carried enormous baskets of fruits vegetables and cooked meats soon the base of the spina was almost entirely concealed by the foodladen baskets the crowd cheered wildly at another signal from the emperor the cursores stood away from the marble parapet that separated the audience from the track the spectators clambered over the wall traversed the dry moat and poured out onto the track the stands were soon half emptied and the spina was swarmed by a wellordered mob this was a heavily middleclass crowd of tradesmen and lesser merchants and even the labourers in the audience were far from desperate for a meal most had brought their own lunch but were simply enthusiastic over the emperors gesture their chant rose and quickly spread michael michael michael nodded at the grand eunuch to signal the hetairach haraldr leaned over the emperors shoulder i want to go down there hetairarch yelled the emperor i want only you and a centurion to accompany me haraldr looked over at ulfr in silent desperation madness michael was overestimating his newly won popularity it was hardly due to oversight that the emperor who had long ago built this box had not provided any access between it and the crowd below even the later underground passages were secret circuitous and well guarded out of the many there were certain to be malcontents the bogomils who had no reverence whatsoever for the imperial offices were sure to have some adherents in the crowd with only two guards among that mob even a lone assassin could get close enough majesty began haraldr nonsense hetairach my children adore me and i feel fortune smiling upon me today perhaps so thought haraldr as he listened to the chants he shrugged at ulfr and together they guided the emperor down the staircase and through the passageways the marshalling area beneath the stands was antic with acrobats jugglers and buffoons waiting to begin the interval entertainment the emperor paused to poke his hands into the cage of two performing bears while the astonished performers and stadium officials watched he growled at the beasts for a moment then darted over and swiped at a jugglers brightly painted wooden balls he smiled down at an adolescent acrobat in a short tunic and chucked her under the chin follow me out hetairarch the bronze door opened and the emperor strode out into the mob as soon as he was recognized the men around him fell to their faces in the sand michael navigated the prostrate bodies to the spina found a halfempty basket of fruit and began throwing oranges and citrons to the people as they rose to their feet the chant resumed michael michael a starting gate opened and epaphroditis and his blue team wheeled out among the crowd as if by some prearrangement michael waved to the driver and epaphroditis guided his team to the emperors side the emperor removed his heavily jewelled imperial pallium and handed it to haraldr then he pulled his scaramangium over his head to reveal a chariot drivers tunic and leather skirt beneath his robes he swung onto the back of epaphroditiss chariot took the reins waved haraldr and ulfr away and began a slow procession round the track the imperial diadem was still on his head the din of approval exceeded that moment when the bulgar khan had kissed the boots of that other now thoroughly forgotten michael has he gone mad asked ulfr as he watched michael steer the team around the spina haraldr shook his head and shouted his reply in ulfrs ear as the acclaim crescendoed to a numbing roar to this moment he has obviously been anything but that but what he is hearing now may indeed make him mad who is that man joannes held the door to his office antechamber open and pointed down the hall to a portly eunuch swathed in the robe of a secretikoi in the offices of the sacellarius lebunes said joanness own eunuch secretary you asked for his assignment he is studying the thematic tax ledgers of the emperor leo just so i know who is here growled joannes why hadnt he remembered that orphanotrophus the man you sent for is waiting for you the secretary paused waiting for a response that came only in the form of a dark distracted nod the man from amastris joannes seemed almost jolted by his sudden recollection of the appointment yes yes he walked with heavy steps to his office entered and shut the door behind him the young man jerked to his feet when joannes entered he was about twenty with a beard of sparsely woven fine dark hairs and wore the coarse woollen robe of a provincial tradesman his large dark innocent eyes registered alarm and then surprise when joannes stepped forward and clapped his bony shoulders his forehead had a curious bulbous projection almost as if there were a fist inside of his skull pushing out a vein in his temple wriggled with anxiety cousin said joannes in a rumbling effort at amiability please sit down joannes took his own simple chair behind his writing table and studied the entirely unprepossessing young man as if he were laying eyes on the incarnation of the bulgarslayer so you are the grandson of my fathers brother nicetas im sorry we havent been acquainted before do you know that the preoccupations of our empire have prevented me from visiting amastris since before you were born it is a pity to lose touch with ones family so you are a wool carder in amastris and a member in good standing of your local guild joannes paused to allow the young man an opportunity to speak yes sir the young mans voice was fluty and tremulous joannes was satisfied with the silence that followed apparently he observed this rube scarcely had the wits or initiative for other than monosyllabic replies wool carding said joannes wondrously as if he were describing some important office of state instead of the business of combing raw wool to prepare it for spinning an honest profession that affords a man a lifetime of steady earning and rewarding activity unless of course he runs afoul of his local prefect the young mans eyes popped open like a sheeps in the shearing pen joannes drummed the table for a moment his crusty fingernails making a staccato sound like a marching tattoo i should like to free you from that anxiety said joannes at length that is why i asked that you undertake this long journey for me i should like you to be my guest here in the empress city forget the worries of your profession for a while i will put my head to it and arrive at a more suitable employment for a young man of your abilities the young man stared at joannes as if he had just witnessed the archangel descend before his eyes bearing a message from the pantocrator himself yes sir gregory haraldr stood and gestured for the little eunuch to join him and maria at the table i cannot stay hetairarch mistress the duties of the grand interpreter of the varangians are manifold i have come to you in my capacity as chief intelligence secretary in the offices of the hetairarch gregory smiled and then composed himself this was sufficiently important to arrest your dining at least sit while you tell us gregory allowed the serving eunuch to seat him to haraldrs right and he looked for a moment at maria who sat opposite him i do not wish to jeopardize the mistress with this he said dont worry my friend said haraldr i would have to tell her anyway i dont know half of what she does of this palace and its curious machinations he looked at gregory quizzically this doesnt sound like an ordinary intrigue it may be nothing hetairarch but as recent history has shown us even the most insignificant seed can grow untended and eventually attack the great roots of an entire empire gregory smoothed the embroidered tablecloth before him almost as if he were going to write his information on it i have made the acquaintance of a secretikoi in the office of the sacellarius who has been assigned to the records bureau in the magnara basement i need not tell you of the importance of that location this man has become friendly with the orphanotrophus joanness secretary and of course is well placed to monitor the comings and goings in the orphanotrophuss office as it is yesterday he saw a young man a young man whose only distinguishing characteristic seemed to be his utter mediocrity visit the orphanotrophuss offices for a private interview he inquired of joanness secretary and learned that the man was a young relative of joanness from his home in paphlagonia theme my acquaintance also learned that joannes has provided this young man a comfortable lodging outside the city quite ironically these lodgings are the same as those occupied by our emperor during the time when he was merely our caesar haraldr looked at maria and then back to gregory an island going he said in norse island going asked maria in her own increasingly fluent norse i dont know that kenning single combat said haraldr in greek it sounds as if joannes has obtained the shield he needs and from what i have seen our emperor is honing the sword he intends to wield to a fine edge i think it is only a matter of time before they challenge each other gregory stood and bowed that is my inference as well hetairarch i will allow you to digest this information further while i return to my duties and to the collection of more information on this matter after gregory had departed haraldr and maria stared at each other for a long moment finally haraldr sighed i guess we are going to have another argument marias blue eyes ignited of course we are well you do agree with my interpretation of this information dont you maria nodded of course it is obvious michael has not proved to be as malleable as joannes had hoped and now joannes has begun to carve himself a new puppet she signalled for the eunuch to remove her silver plate i dont know why he has even troubled himself with that formality he already fancies himself an emperor with his private guard now and the senate always following behind him like a herd of sheep with golden fleece i think that is good countered haraldr it makes joanness power evident to everyone if he abuses the people they will hold him accountable he can no longer hide behind his monks habit or the orphanotrophuss office and i think he knows that haraldr leaned forward earnestly he is making serious concessions now under joanness auspices the imperial treasury has financed the reconstruction of twenty square blocks of the studion food distribution in the studion is now a regular state programme vastly expanded beyond what i started joannes is even studying the thematic tax ledgers to find cheaters and absconders who are placing an unequal burden on their fellow villagers and the imperial orphanotrophus can also reverse these reforms with several strokes of his pen no once the people have received a lightening of their burden they will be considerably more resistant to having that burden placed back on their shoulders if joannes wants to survive he will have to continue his reforms i think michael is every bit as capable of managing these reforms countered maria look at the imperial court judges he has removed and those he has appointed and what about his demotion of both that idiot strategus and his corrupt chartalarius in opsikion theme haraldr spread his hands with mock incredulity i have always respected michaels abilities when he is motivated to employ them he said you will recall that i was the first to bring those abilities to your attention and at that time you argued that i was wrong about that maria stuck out her tongue both men are capable of ruling rome the issue is which one will rule rome i simply do not believe that michael will be able to challenge joannes sufficiently to rule on his own that would require a courage that is clearly not one of his abilities having been almost killed in battle myself i can see how his experience against the seljuks might have stripped him of his courage it took years for me to recover mine but for whatever reason michael does not have the backbone required to win this sort of combat at best he can rule over an empire with disastrously divided allegiances so you are saying that because michael cannot win you are going to support joannes in this combat i cannot believe that no i do not wish there to be any combat what i would like to do in fact is prevent this combat and preserve michaels lesser but important role in the government of rome once michael has been defeated i will be unable to do that you forget the real issue of who rules rome maria thumped her fist on the table zoe is the government the rest come and go and of the two men who currently rule rome joannes is a far more serious threat to zoe this is why i cannot countenance joanness participation in the imperial administration in any form i certainly have not forgotten zoes welfare and safety protested haraldr that is my entire point the more visibly joannes is identified with the rule of rome the more imperative it is for him to come to a public binding and lasting agreement with zoe i believe i can negotiate such an agreement myself maria put her hand on haraldrs arm be careful you think you have become expert in the roman arts of guile and cunning but you are still merely a novice i think you are too naive and trusting ever truly to fathom the roman mind i suppose that is why i love you what if i can bring about this agreement said haraldr with a somewhat wounded edge to his voice a public pledge by joannes which it would be suicidal for him to deny later i would say that in that case i would be satisfied that my mother was well taken care of maria leaned forward and blasted haraldr with her acute stare but consider this esteemed hetairarch you say you hope to prevent this single combat from taking place what if you cannot are you prepared to prevent joannes from winning yes i have been talking with the new grand domestic camytzes and he is no dhynatoi stooge like dalassena i believe he will defend his emperor against joannes maria conceded the argument with a shrug i think that is the kind of persuasion joannes would understand good now we can start worrying about your throne she got up and put her arm around haraldrs neck and kissed his forehead i think i am ready for that long northern night nobilissimus michael held out his hand to his uncle constantine and with the other gestured towards the outdoor polo field one of his portable thrones had been erected along the east border of the broad green lawn just in front of the salmontinted porticoes of the imperial apartments look look look screamed michael rising to his feet the pitch of his voice steadily ascending in accompaniment glycas is driving a pack of horsemen in short riding tunics either blue or red thundered past in pursuit of a small red wooden ball they came so close to the imperial throne that bits of earth showered the attending senators a bearded man in a red tunic mounted on a nimble fairly small arabian charged out ahead of the pack he raised his mallet like a battle standard as he drew even with the slowing ball whirled the slender wooden shaft and with a cracking report sent a red blur flying between two marble pylons at the north end of the field glycas has scored screamed michael he leapt onto the grass and applauded as glycas galloped past in the other direction majesty said constantine with a certain urgency as if his ceremonial title of nobilissimus had actually imbued him with the qualities it suggested constantine seemed to have lost much of his pudginess and his eyes were tougher and more incisive yes nobilissimus said michael grandly as if he were the deity complimenting himself on one of his own creations which in a sense he was did i tell you uncle that i am conducting a pentathlon on our lords day this week i would compete myself but as you know these affairs of state are inimicable to the preparation required for athletic performance i intend to make a few tosses of the javelin however michael reared his arm back and flung an imaginary spear constantine drew michael away from the body of senators and eunuchs who with discretion inspired by the obvious relationship between emperor and nobilissimus allowed the pair their privacy constantine pulled a rolled document out of his cloak opened it and displayed the purpletinted paper to michael this is your signature is it not majesty he pointed to the scarlet script beneath which a coinlike gold seal dangled from a silk cord yes my signature my seal uncle said michael blithely that is the imperial chrysobull to create a magister that i signed two days ago magisters magpies i say let them flock to my court i have discovered the real power in rome and am not concerned when these dignitaries protest that i have reduced the worth of their august titles by creating too many of like value yes let the magistermagpies flock it is the offices of state not the ceremonial titles that are important and i can assure you uncle that i take those appointments seriously i am not criticizing your performance majesty said constantine aware that his nephew was far more keen than anyone suspected perhaps too keen as it was turning out i am directing your attention not to an error on your part but to a perfidy on the part of an officer of state michael took the document and studied it carefully for a while he shook his head i dont know this particular constantine whatever said michael you are the only constantine who concerns me constantine looked grimly at michael this particular constantine now magister of rome is a distant cousin of yours he is my uncles grandson a month ago he was a wool carder in amastris your other uncle has him ensconced in the same villa in which you were housed as the caesar michaels face had grown progressively whiter now it had the colour of a linen sheet his knees wobbled and constantine had to steady him nephew nephew whispered constantine this is not a defeat it simply means that you have proven yourself too able too popular with the people it is joannes who is frightened of you michael controlled himself sufficiently to speak uncle wwe are not strong enough to act yet i realize that my backing among the tradesmen and lesser merchants is profound but joannes has the allegiance of the senate the dhynatoi and the great merchants and lately he has mollified the rabble of the studion to the extent that they would not rise against him i am between scylla and charybdis so to speak constantine clasped michaels shoulders no you forget that the empress is also your ally and she could check any attempt by joannes to rally the studion against you so we can presume that the rabble will remain neutral in this conflict the great merchants have considerable resources and influence but the small merchants and tradesmen have vastly greater numbers so we are still even the dhynatoi in the senate of course will go with joannes but the rest of the senate may not if we can maintain a small cadre of moderate senators behind us in the beginning i think we can achieve success michaels eyes were glazed and his voice automatic but the colour had returned to his face shall i begin persuading our senators no we havent time for that tell the empress what we are about and then we must begin michael looked at constantine with the expression of a man peering over a very sheer precipice uncle he whispered can we do this we must said constantine hetairarch haraldr joannes swept through the empty entrance hall of his immense town palace you see that i am not quite settled in he pointed to the high coffered ceiling i havent even had the lights installed yet he took haraldrs arm and led him towards the marble staircase i spend so little time with these comforts but i feel i must not neglect the property neglect the property thought haraldr is that why the craftsmen i saw out in the front were reinforcing your gate and why i heard your private guard drilling in the yard apparently the orphanotrophus intends to concede the palace to the emperor and wage his siege from here the secondstorey loggia was flooded with light streaming into the central court the white proconnesian marble pillars had a brilliant golden glow where the direct sunlight struck them joannes pointed to the courtyard below several hundred thracian guardsmen thrust their swords at wicker dummies set in long perfect rows you know what is about hetairarch so i will not trouble you with ingratiating preludes i am going to confront the emperor with his crimes against the people and instruct the senate to propose a successor to him haraldr was in fact stunned by the directness of the appeal he silently complimented joannes on the skill and swiftness of the thrust in rome the emperor is the law countered haraldr how can you move legally against him joannes eyed haraldr with respect you know that in rome the law has many interpretations i believe that the senate and the common folk will find my interpretation satisfies their earnest desire for legal propriety of course i will have to instruct the middle class in these new legal statutes and you would like the grand hetairia to assist you in this instruction joanness face contorted with his hideous grin you are a roman hetairarch name your price you may find it more onerous than you can bear orphanotrophus haraldrs voice was sufficiently grim to shadow joanness face first i want you to understand that this instruction would consist of enforcing civil order not punishing these small merchants and tradesmen for their support of michael secondly i would have a public pledge of your guarantee of the safety happiness and wellbeing of the purpleborn empress zoe finally i want you to understand that i will protect the life if not the office of the emperor michael with my own life i want a preservation of some honour for him as well as a role for him in the future administration of rome he has much to offer his people joanness eyes seemed to retreat to the black depths of his skull i believe you have just refused my offer hetairarch he said with an ominous rumble i hope you will reconsider i would hate to see a life of real account to rome sacrificed for the sake of two who have merely plundered what others have built joannes signalled for the eunuch hovering near the entrance to the loggia to show haraldr out goodbye hetairarch haraldr said joannes remember this in parting my course against the emperor the emperor whom i myself have created and whom i have the power to recast in whatever mould i choose is irrevocable but this failure to concur over a price seals nothing between you and myself i will gladly offer you time and opportunity to renegotiate perhaps i can offer you some flexibility concerning the first and last matters you mentioned as i said you are a man of great account to the glory of rome haraldr bowed and i will consider at greater length the matter of price but remember this orphanotrophus unlike our emperor i am not your creation black it was as if the veil were a dark pane over my eyes as if the blackness of my robes had fouled the entire world zoe laughed bitterly i actually thought that one day i would remove my black to enter my bath and find that my skin had taken the colour like a libyan she pressed her hands to her cheeks as if her touch could ascertain that her skin was still its delicate porcelain white her blond hair shorn in mourning had grown long enough to be braided and brought in little rows across her head i hated the colour because it could never display my grief it was a parasite enjoying the moment of my tragedy without feeling anything in return if i were to wear black again it would make my skin crawl there is nothing dark about the vision i see now mother the emperor michael did not have to invent his flattery remarkable he thought like a flower with the ability to shrivel and die and yet return even more brilliant and succulent the next spring he looked at her flawless skin perhaps there were a few more fine wrinkles about the eyes but the springblue irises with their gorgeous amethyst flare were as beguiling as ever and examined the voluptuous silhouette of her simple purpleandgold scaramangium the dried leaf was gone the flower had bloomed again and desire was the fragrance about it zoe held out her shapely arms and beckoned michael to sit on the couch beside her she curled her knees up around him and stroked his hair did you miss your mothers caresses michael burst into tears and cried for perhaps a quarter of an hour zoe held him and waited until his paroxysm had subsided to whimpering sniffles she kissed his temple and said i am certain you didnt miss your mother that much my little boy what has that man done to you michael gave zoe the particulars punctuated with deep sobs of joanness new protege uncle constantine the nobilissimus i mean says we must challenge joannes now i am utterly rigid with fright mother what is the nobilissimuss plan asked zoe her voice calm and her eyes as placid as a pond she no longer feared death she only feared black next to her skin he intends to provoke him to treason i i think it is quite a dangerous game perhaps not said zoe your uncle the nobilissimus is a very shrewd man and his tactic here is quite astute he simply encourages joannes to manifest the very intentions that joannes is bent on to begin with clever but mother what if he is encouraged too much joannes could have me struck down at any moment he might do it himself he will not as long as the hetairarch is attendant upon you michael sniffled deeply do you think the hetairarch is that loyal he and joannes have come to some sort of understanding due to all the work joannes has done in the studion he has no love for joannes do not presume that his loyalty is limitless but you can be absolutely certain that he will intercept any attack made on you in his presence it is a tauroscythian thing about honour i should think you would already have enough evidence of his reckless devotion to the purple you are right of course securely placed between the hetairarch and the nobilissimus i have nothing to fear and your mother will always be here as well zoe pressed her thighs more tightly against michael now can we imagine just for tonight that you are a big enough boy to be your mothers husband zoes hand slid across the lap of michaels purple scaramangium her slender white fingers marching across the goldthread imperial eagles when her fingers had completed their reconnaissance zoe put bloodred lips to michaels neck yes she whispered hoarsely i can see that you have become quite a big boy the monastery of kauleas was one of the largest of scores of such establishments in constantinople the entire complex took up two city blocks four multistorey wings contained monks cells storerooms refectory infirmary kitchens library and bath these enclosed a large central court in the middle of which was a substantial pale redbrick church topped with several large domes this palace of worldly denial had been built a century and half earlier during a period of fervent religious construction commissioned by a dhynatoi family as their private spiritual retreat the original owners had been forced to sell the monastery more than a century ago shortly after a great famine not because their finances had suffered due to the poor harvest but because they had soon thereafter proved incapable of managing the vastly expanded estates they had patched together by buying up for next to nothing the freeholds of starving peasant farmers the purchasers were another dhynatoi family and they maintained the establishment in great splendour for decades but a succession of increasingly dissolute scions had neglected and gradually plundered the establishment selling off the marble revetments and ivorybound books and gold fixtures and allowing the population of monks which had once numbered in the hundreds to dwindle to less than a dozen the family had finally given up the property three years ago the typicon had been signed over in the neorion as a penitential act the current owner was the orphanotrophus joannes in three years joannes had neither visited the establishment nor allowed anyone else to enter its gates except to have the remaining monks cleared out and new locks installed on all the doors but this evening the venerable monastery of kauleas once again teemed with activity more than a hundred armoured thracian guardsmen bustled about in the weedchoked courtyard assembling the new brotherhood in orderly rows just in front of an arcaded threestorey wing of monks cells the new brotherhood numbered in the hundreds they wore the dyed linen or wool tunics of the citys small merchants and tradesmen and indeed they were grocers butchers shoemakers fish sellers silk weavers soap makers curds vendors pepper grinders silversmiths all of them responsible guildsmen whose greatest indulgences were several glasses of wine one night a week in their local tavern and attendance whenever possible at the races in the hippodrome they were family men who ordinarily would not be expected to abandon their wives and children for a life of contemplation but something was wrong with this group most of the brothers tunics were spotted with blood and some of them were torn all of the brothers kept their feet precisely together and held their hands rigidly behind their backs but often their knees swayed and their heads lolled and they would not straighten up until the thracian guardsmen prodded them with their spears the brothers faces seemed like hideous painted masks with huge bruised eyes on closer inspection none of them had noses only freshly carved slits crusted with dried black blood the rows were finally assembled the one man present who wore actual monastic garb stood in front of these new brothers his novitiates strangely enough joanness deeply socketed eyes glimmering with reflected torchlight were the only distinct features of his huge shadowed face joannes studied his unfortunate novitiates for some time before he addressed them i grew up in amastris on the black sea in circumstances no doubt less auspicious than many of you enjoyed in your childhood certainly no better i was castrated at the age of six and educated by monks here in constantinople joannes was speaking in a curious conversational tone as if these men were his intimates when i was thirteen my tutors obligated me to become a monk like themselves and i spent the next eight years in a monastery much like this though not so grand not nearly so grand when i left the monastery i began work as a secretary in the office of the sacellarius by dint of unrelenting effort i have achieved the position of your orphanotrophus i like to think that my office in the magnara basement where i serve rome is much like the monks cell where as a boy i served god joannes paused and seemed to reflect i will share with you a most curious particular about myself since i left the monastery where i spent my boyhood i have not set foot in a monastic establishment of any kind until this evening until you forced me to take this step joannes shook his head sadly his glimmering eyes fixed on the arcaded tiers of monks cells that rose behind his audience it was in a cell like these you see here though hardly as splendid that i first learned that numbers were my friends there was now something quite strange quite irregular about joanness voice even his choice of words despite the low mournful rumble he seemed to be a small boy offering an exegesis i surrounded myself with these new friends numbers that i chalked on my tablet and the floor of my cell numbers that i conversed with in the refectory as i chewed my bread numbers filled me with delight they explained to me that the burdens of each day the unending sequence of fasts and prayers and sermons and chants had meaning to them and that they were pleased and as i pleased my new friends i pleased myself i knew a sinful joy brothers as my friends and i gratified one another a smile flickered horribly i took my friends with me to the magnara when i went to serve rome and there they explained to me the meaning of rome as they had explained the meaning of my previous service but rome was not as my friends wanted it to be rome was like this place you see here abandoned and neglected as random and disorderly as a brothel so my friends and i set to work to make rome a thing of order and beauty and the harder we worked the more rome became a place of delight to us but there were those who envied the beauty of what we had constructed and these delinquents began to deface the perfection of our edifice this vandalism distracted from the symmetry and grace of our creation so that others could not enjoy the beauty of what we had done so that we ourselves were distracted by their depredations joannes suddenly seemed twice as huge as his arms flew up his great black shroud like the wings of a monstrous bird you are those vandals he shrieked you are those delinquents who have brought the serpent of your chaos into the garden of my rome and your serpents name is michael michael michael the gambler michael the speculator michael the idolator of unclean chance michael who has known the harlot who fouls all rome joanness arms were at his side again and his voice fell to its original curiously familiar rumble i have brought you here brothers so that you may understand what it is my friends and i are building here in rome so that you may know that beauty and become part of its perfection joannes signed to the thracian guards turned and stalked swiftly towards the gate his black frock billowing it was as if he were the one desperate to escape the demon of this place conservat deus imperium vestrum chanted the five whiterobed voukaloi the language of the ancient romans lifting with a clarion resonance into the golden dome of the hall of nineteen couches the voukaloi were eunuchs and after the first few extended notes their smooth pale cheeks puffed out and glowed like lanterns flickering on bona tua semper chanted the last voukalos in the line his solo voice ringing out to challenge the echoes of the chorus victor sis semplar rang out the next multos annos vitae victor facia semper deus praestet michael emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans reclined on his couch at the head of the imperial table to the emperors left was the orphanotrophus his ungainly extended form a sleeping black beast perched on the crimson silkupholstered dining couch to the emperors right reclined the nobilissimus constantine resplendent in the purple pallium and scaramangium of his office next to the orphanotrophus joannes reclined the hetairarch haraldr nordbrikt placed there against the dictates of protocol at the request of the emperor also at the request of the emperor the hetairarch wore a dagger concealed within his scarlet scaramangium the rest of the emperors long narrow table as well as the eponymous nineteen couches arrayed beneath the great dome and in the abutting apses were filled with the dignitaries of the imperial court all attired as prescribed by protocol gold plates lit by the candelabra glittered at every setting the imperial chamberlains moved among the guests pouring the wine into goblets fashioned of gold leaf set between layers of glass bibite domini imperatores in multos annos deus omnipotens praestet chanted the voukaloi in unison may ye lead a happy life my lords chanted the second voukalos in greek deus praestet the first voukalos chanted in counterpoint he inhaled deeply and then as the chamberlains began to water the wine from silver ewers began again in gaudio prandete domini may ye be joyful while ye feast master concluded the second voukalos michael rose and gave the ceremonial toasts and then more chants accompanied the presentation of the delicacies michaels hand shook as he tried to spoon black caviar out of a silver dish the eggs dribbled onto the goldembroidered tablecloth in front of him a eunuch whisked the little black pellets away leaving an oily smear the lesser dignitaries at the far end of the hall quickly grew raucous with the wine but the senators seated at the emperors and nearby tables limited their conversation to nervous whispers at the head of the table the emperor the nobilissimus and the orphanotrophus made no attempt to converse with one another after the serving of the fish course the nobilissimus asked the hetairarch if this particular type of flounder was found in thule haraldr replied that he was not familiar with it though it was hard to compare tastes when the fish was smothered in the omnipresent garos sauce three acrobats performed between the fish and meat courses a burly man who balanced a long pole on his head and two boys who executed handstands and swings atop the pole far up among the dazzling light clusters the orphanotrophus seemed concerned only with ensuring that his goblet was filled as quickly as it was emptied which was quickly indeed haraldr was soon certain despite the fears michael had professed to him earlier in the day that joannes was too drunk to be an effective assassin and that his attack would take the more subtle form he had described at his town palace perhaps the dinner would pass without incident perhaps the differences between the emperor and the orphanotrophus could even be mediated at some point in private and haraldr himself had not given up on coming to some agreement with the orphanotrophus after dinner enormous gold bowls large enough for a man to bathe in filled with figs apples grapes melons and oranges were brought into the hall on trolleys covered with purple cloth one of the trolleys was halted at the centre of the imperial table directly above it three gilded cables with thick gold rings on the ends descended from the ceiling like golden snakes gliding out of the night eunuchs attached the rings to hooks on the sides of the bowl a mechanism in the ceiling lifted the bowl swung it over the heads of the senators and lowered it into place in the centre of the table the rings were removed and the ropes slithered back into the dome the nobilissimus constantine appraised an apple thoughtfully almost as if he could see his reflection in it i note he said his first words since he had spoken to haraldr about the fish that the pretender to the caliphate is enjoying the hospitality of rome yet again constantine nodded at the saracen prince seated at a nearby table one of several such exiled leaders maintained at the imperial court in sumptuous style as potential instruments of diplomacy how long has this noble son of hagar been a guest here in rome constantine looked directly at joannes you would know wouldnt you brother since you have been the principal distributor of the largesse he enjoys joanness ponderous head lifted and seemed to yaw very slightly as he stared back at constantine he said nothing in reply consider the policy majesty said constantine now addressing michael the orphanotrophus aspires to reclaim tripoli from the caliphate by the presence of a gilded camel driver at the court of rome he supports this rather oblique pursuit of our interests with the argument that the imperial taghmata is unavailable to offer more vigorous diplomacy because the so recently humbled bulgars are eternally restive by the time he had completed these words constantine had an astonished audience of hushed senators staring down the table at him senator scylitzes who had paused in his own discourses to sample a fig set the halfeaten piece of fruit down as carefully as if it were a delicate piece of blown glass majesty constantine continued i was rather more impressed by the policy you proposed concerning the governance of bulgaria one that would concurrently address the problem of the reduced strength and effectiveness of the imperial taghmata in other areas of strategic import indeed joanness voice had the same effect that the sound of the dome splitting might have had the hush spread backwards through the room and within a few breaths the entire vast hall was silent even the eunuchs paused at their tasks their glistening white forms rigid as if they had suddenly turned to ice i am curious as to your musings on this subject nephew joanness head extended forward from his supine body like the bobbing head of a serpent and the emperor looks like a rat transfixed by the serpent thought haraldr michael would never have the courage publicly to challenge joannes that was the problem yes yes michael faltered and glanced at constantine whose forehead had begun to bead with perspiration yes michael cleared his throat and the entire assembly of dignitaries seemed to shift on their couches at once it it is my thinking that the tax we now collect or perhaps more often fail to collect in bulgaria is assessed in a manner that is injurious to our defence of that frontier and also deprives us of needed revenues michael seemed to have commanded his tongue but his dark eyes were surrounded by gleaming whites as if he were reading an order calling for his own execution it is customary among the bulgar people to pay their taxes in kind with portions of their crops and herds rather than to render payment directly in silver and gold of which there is an acute shortage among the small farmers upon whom we rely for the preponderance of our revenues the bulgarslayer recognized this and allowed payments in kind in lieu of coin the result being a steady flow of revenue and relatively little discontent over tax exactions among the subjugated people the recent policy has been to abolish payments in kind and force collections in coin which has actually decreased our revenues and inflamed sentiment against rome providing an opportunist like the khan alounsianus the necessary grievance to convince his people to rise against us the net result as i say heaps predicament upon predicament we lose the revenues needed to expand the taghmatic regiments or employ suitable mercenary forces while creating a situation that requires constant attention to our northern borders at the added expense of our interests to the south joannes ruminated for a moment his head tilting gently and then his voice slurred out indeed indeed interrupted constantine on the one hand we have our emperors astute policy and on the other the belch of a drunken monk who should perhaps consider returning to the cloister where he might find the frontiers of his cenobites cell less demanding of his intellect than the farflung polities that govern the fate of the roman empire a magister knocked over his goblet with a dull thud joanness head continued its sotted marionettes bob finally he spoke his words more distorted by drink than haraldr had heard even on that first night at nicephorus argyruss and what does our nephew think of this suggestion michaels eyes literally seemed to retreat from joanness droopylidded stare ii he stammered and stopped his words fluttering from the dead air like birds struck with an arrow constantines flushed brow glistened then he erupted his majesty does not concern himself with appointments on the level of orphanotrophus he is concerned with matters that attend to the eternal glory of the roman empire and maintenance of roman hegemony in a christian world he is quite above the petty intrigues generated by his servants joanness entire body coursed with sudden remarkably supple energy and his huge python head snapped to confront constantine make your accusation brother he thundered all trace of inebriation vanished from his voice constantines smooth face was as red as if he had raced fifteen circuits in the hippodrome his glaring eyes made him look more like joannes than he ever had before he gripped his apple with a whitened fist your secreting of our young cousin to the empress city the dome echoed with the shouts his elevation to magisterial dignity without his presentation at court this reeks of connivance brother constantines shoulders lifted as if he were straining to rise but some fierce contrary discipline kept him seated this reeks of treason joanness face flushed very slowly like a corpse gradually revivifying of course i have committed no treason brother there was a remote edge of hysteria to his calm voice not hysterical fear but hysterical violence the emperor himself signed the chrysobull creating the dignity of magister for his young cousin i invite any of the esteemed dignitaries present to examine the document which is now in the offices of the parakoimomenos and then he was on his feet goblets and platters clattered on the floor as joanness huge black span milled wildly the emperor dived for the floor and clutched madly at the tablecloth trying to shield his body with the stiff brocade haraldr had risen in virtual concert with joannes his quickly produced knife still held close to his forearm in a last hope he would not need it constantine had reflexively cringed from his brothers sudden movement but now he sat upright on his dining couch his face so brilliant and glistening that one expected to see a cloud of steam around him his jowls trembled slightly let us discuss treason brother joanness eventoned menace held the entire hall transfixed haraldr stood almost at attention beside him constantine still sat and the emperor still cowered behind the tablecloth let us discuss how you have already killed one emperor let us discuss how my michael was destroyed by the burden he had to carry every day the burden of his idiot brotherinlaw and his pathetic cringing nephew and most onerous of all his corpulent utterly incompetent brother constantine had he not carried all of you on his back each day he would still be beside me my michael always despised you he despised you for the way you sat on your fat arse in the cart that i pulled all the way from amastris but he never could hate you as i did with every step i cursed every fibre of your bloated being i prayed that you would no longer be useful to me so that i could dump you in the gutter like so much offal i prayed that for so long that i finally stopped praying joannes leaned forward his boots creaked in the moment of silence constantines eyes were liquid with fright and pain his lower lip protruded and twitched joanness next words were almost a whisper and now that god no longer listens i find that my prayers have been answered joannes leapt across the table his motion mirrored in constantines recoiling eyes but haraldr gripped joanness huge shovel pelvis and pulled him back joanness arms flapped frantically but haraldr easily pinned them haraldr embraced the struggling deformed creature until he felt the violence rush out like air from a deflated bladder joannes turned to haraldr his eyes were incredible repulsive they seemed to squirm within their dark pits as if dozens of tiny silvery maggots worked in the skeletal sockets so you are one of them he hissed he stepped away from haraldr and surveyed the virtually motionless utterly silent senators for a long moment finally he turned as if to leave he did not look at constantine but he glanced down at the emperor who now sat staring distantly seemingly without orientation as if he were a man who had suddenly found himself floating high in the air with no clue as to how he had got there then in violation of all prescribed protocol joannes walked away unexcused his arms at his sides from the emperors table his boots rattled like drums on the marble floor constantine looked after joanness disappearing black back he blinked his eyes as if quickly and stoically settling with some great torment when the sound of joanness boots had faded constantine raised his apple to his mouth and took a bite that was audible throughout the silent hall the main storeroom at the kauleas monastery was a long vaulted chamber much of the plaster had peeled away to reveal the fine almost delicate brickwork that had created this massive almost brutal architecture the scored stone floor had been freshly swept the storeroom contained hundreds of large earthenware jars as tall as a mans waist stacked in perfect rows against the long wall the jars were all new the immaculate lightly textured terracotta surfaces so vivid that they seemed to be living tissue like great ripe melons each was sealed with a lead sheet to preserve their contents for eons the orphanotrophus joannes had convened the senate of imperial rome in this storeroom the location was not according to prescribed practice or protocol nor was the manner in which many of the senators had been summoned pulled from their beds in the middle of the night by soldiers of the imperial taghmata now they stood wrapped in their cloaks against the chill of the dank interior and listened to the reason for this extraordinary convocation the light of the tapers threw joanness shadow across the rows of terracotta jars brothers he said his tone as brusque as his greeting an extraordinary treason was revealed this evening evidence gathered by our logothete of the dromus joannes gestured at the rodentfaced logothete who stood with the dhynatoi senators of the attalietes clique has proven beyond doubt that our beloved emperor michael the late and lamented michael may the pantocrator keep his soul was in fact poisoned by his own brother the nobilissimus constantine having murdered our beloved emperor michael the felon constantine has now corrupted the other michael and promises to lure our new emperor into errancies that threaten the foundations of romes thousandyear imperium the dhynatoi growled in an obedient chorus how can we stop them orphanotrophus what will you do joannes nodded gravely at the clearly previously solicited questions it has occurred to me that the agent of our peril is this considerable ambiguity as to who rules rome in their confusion many of the people have come to view as their saviour this false emperor who is only leading them into perdition i intend to make a gesture in which you are all invited to participate the dhynatoi senators rumbled with grateful anticipation i intend to retire to my country home outside galatea in this way i will manifest my refusal to collaborate with the traitors i am inviting all of the ranking dignitaries of our illustrious imperial administration to join me in that gesture of profound outrage the people will quickly perceive the enormous consequence of allowing the treasonous nobilissimus and his puppet emperor to preside over our imperium the emperor will be forced to supplicate our prompt return in order to preserve his own life amid the chaos of our untended city and return we shall on the condition that the emperor acknowledges his criminally negligent congress with romes enemies and resigns his office the shouts of approval from the dhynatoi chorus rang in the vaults when the echoes had faded a single voice emerged where is this evidence of the nobilissimuss treason the speaker was theodore tziporoles the leader of the moderate faction in the senate he was a small balding man with intense perpetually questioning asiatic features the quaestor will deliver the indictment to my home in the morning you are welcome to study it there tziporoles sniffed fearlessly and looked at the soldier standing next to him has this evidence been presented to the command of the imperial taghmata i think that the grand domestic camytzes will want to read this indictment before he commits his forces to the usurpation of his emperor camytzes no longer commands the imperial taghmata he resigned his position as grand domestic a short time ago tziporoles was visibly shaken but he composed his fierce features you realize that you are inviting a bloodbath in the streets of the city the small merchants and tradesmen will oppose even the imperial taghmata in defence of the emperor who has brought them so much prosperity i have spoken to the leaders of this faction said joannes they will not oppose the resignation of their benighted emperor i will let you speak to them joanness eyes again had that curious squirming animation his voice was slightly distorted as if he had a small bone lodged in his throat this is madness said tziporoles he was clearly more apprehensive about staying than making a motion to leave i regretfully decline your invitation orphanotrophus as he turned to go joannes snapped at the soldiers and several of them blocked his exit he turned frantically to face joannes talk to them thundered joannes talk to them they have been persuaded to join us soon they will all join us we stand on the threshold of romes perfection and only a handful of miscreants remain to deface that splendid creation talk to them as the senators watched raptly joannes grabbed a spear from the hands of one of the soldiers in a mighty motion he rammed the butt end into one of the terracotta jars a thick yellowish oil spouted from the rupture joannes continued to shatter the vessel and in a moment something white slithered out a human arm as joannes battered the jar to shards additional limbs slid out like giant albino eels the head tumbled onto the floor and came to rest near tziporoless feet tziporoless face was paler than the noseless visage that looked up at him if you cannot hear this mans petition to reason tziporoles i can offer you a chorus joannes gestured at the rows of jars then he prodded the oilsoaked disembodied head with his spear and looked directly at the stunned senator his eloquence would shame the ancients would it not it was a dawn such as had inspired the immortal bard this aurora was not yellowrobed however but a cool pink flame that flickered above the domes of chrysopolis still tinted blue with night and suffused her glow across the bosporus to wrap the columns of the imperial palace in a mauve mist maria and haraldr stood on the rooftop terrace of their town palace and watched the horizon flare in silence the chill of early spring iced the thick clear air and maria slipped beneath haraldrs cloak and wrapped her arms tightly round him the movement of the wagons horses and litters on the streets below was strangely muffled as if nature held sound in partial abeyance to celebrate the miracle of sunrise the processions moved with the slowness of a dirge the silken backs of uniformed retainers and the armour of the private guards still dulled by the dovecoloured shadows in the streets of constantinople maria inhaled audibly announcing that she was about to shatter the peace of the morning do you think any have remained i doubt it said haraldr he pointed to a large retinue of silkclad eunuchs entering the intersection of the mese and the perama street two blocks to the south and west of haraldrs town palace look that is the standard of tziporoles he is one of the most moderate men in the senate one of the last i would have expected to follow joannes but follow him he had like all the other senators and most of the dignitaries above spathar rank who were marching accompanied by their obligatory retinues out of the city to join joannes at his country palace north of galatea some were headed out of the gates for a long overland passage round the golden horn most were wending their way through the streets to the platea harbour where the masts of their galleys had begun to blossom with signal flags is there hope for the emperor for us asked maria yes i have already sent halldor to seek out the grand domestic camytzes and discuss the situation with him camytzes is an honourable man there is a good chance he will use force if necessary to defend his emperor against joannes and if he does not there is still hope that joannes will consider his display of strength sufficient warning and allow the emperor to resign his office peacefully and if the abdication is not peaceful there was dread in marias voice and haraldr remembered the look in joanness eyes that was why camytzes was so important if the abdication is not peaceful i will fight to protect the emperors life i am sworn to it haraldrs voice was mechanical he was describing a strategy already arrived at there is a good chance we can rescue the emperor and escape with him as reduced as our strength is however i cannot expect the grand hetairia to sit and trade blows with the imperial taghmata before the day is over i will have arranged for you and the empress to be escorted to the bucoleon harbour and taken to your villa that is where we will meet you and then we will sail north the empress will not give up her people to joannes and i cannot leave her to face joannes alone it is what i have sworn not on my sword but in my heart haraldr held maria tightly we should wait until we hear from halldor before we sing the valkyrja song this may all end well they turned to watch the procession again after a moment they were interrupted by haraldrs chamberlain john the eunuch bowed i thought it important sir you have received a parcel from the orphanotrophus joannes haraldr and maria looked at each other in surprise if he is sending me gifts said haraldr he may be more amenable to negotiation today than he seemed to be last night he held marias hand and followed the eunuch down the spiral staircase to the ground floor where is it john in the antechamber if you please sir it is quite a large clock haraldr followed john across the big hall the water clock stood on the floor of the colonnaded chamber a substantial piece of architecture in its own right with brass columns as tall as a mans waist and an intricate templelike facade it seems he does regret his impetuosity said haraldr or perhaps this is merely his way of saying that time is running out for me to accept his offer haraldr sniffed curiously smell that does it run on perfume or water the clock smelled like a garden see if it has a message said maria she pointed to the doors that seemed to open into the miniature temple haraldr stooped and pulled on the ornate little knobs the doors opened get the mistress out of here haraldr shouted to john what is it said maria her voice high and anxious just leave screamed haraldr her face flushed maria allowed john to escort her out of the chamber haraldr reached inside the little temple and removed the perfumedrenched contents the features were intact as he had feared the head had once belonged to the grand domestic isaac camytzes excellency the emperors voice echoed through the heavy gilded coffers of the senate chamber sit still and listen to what others tell you to those who are better men than you you skulker and coward and thing of no account whatever in battle or counsel surely not all of us achaians can be as kings here lordship for many is no good thing let there be one ruler one king to whom the son of deviousdevising kronos gives the sceptre and right of judgement to watch over his people michael looked around at the empty senatorial benches he wore the robes of his office as well as the imperial diadem a rather denotative selection from the bard is it not you skulkers and cowards or should i say my precious children he stepped down from the imperial dais and strolled alongside the benches as if he were still haranguing his imaginary audience yes good sirs in a few hours you will assemble here to learn of the new destiny i have modelled for our empire you will hear how the orphanotrophus joannes who has mocked and reviled the architect of that destiny and has afforded that noble emperor the unprecedented affront of stalking unbidden from his imperial dinner table is no longer permitted to share the rewards of that destiny scurry now from your palaces sirs because the whirlwind of history and the sweet lyres of immortality await you michaels face was as red as the bloodcoloured streaks in the columns of iasian marble that surrounded him come forth rome and greet your father and worship your deity michael breathed heavily and surged his loins so that his growing erection might be stroked by the heavy weight of his imperial robes his head snapped round when he heard footsteps at the end of the chamber nobilissimus he exclaimed i have extracted a passage from the bard that shall place this day in both the annals of the chronologists and the rhetoricians michael set himself in a stance with one leg forward pallium over his left arm right arm gesturing heroically forth much like the great statue of constantine in the forum the stance collapsed when he observed his uncles grim ashgrey countenance what is it uncle they are gone said constantine flatly all of them the entire senate as well as the logothete of the dromus the quaestor and of course the sacellarius have followed my brother into his selfimposed exile they have taken many of their bureaux with them the government has been eviscerated michael dropped slowly to his knees and then collapsed almost gracefully onto his side when he revived a few moments later he looked up at his uncle with glazed eyes for a long while finally he spoke in a scarcely audible whisper uncle what do we do our response is quite basic said constantine his face set like stone we draft a letter to the orphanotrophus begging him to return and rule rome on our behalf michael fell back into his faint and this time the imperial diadem clinked against the marble floor and almost slipped off his head you are certain the empress could not be persuaded maria stood with her arms folded her face pale and her eyes red but her posture resolute she had just returned from an urgent interview with the empress zoe you of all people should understand why she cannot abandon her people to joannes even at the cost of her life haraldr nodded my brother died to preserve the honour of norways kings i do not think his death was meaningless he took maria in his arms again i will remain and fight to protect you and the empress i will release my men from their pledges in that case but their honour will almost certainly compel them to stay with me we will give meat to the eagles in the east and this then is where our bones will stay maria clutched so hard that haraldrs breath was constricted if you fall i will not let them take me i will put the dagger in my own breast you know i am strong enough dont make me think of that said haraldr he caressed her hair and nuzzled her forehead i simply want you to know that i will not die in neorion i have promised myself and i promise you marias hands were like powerful claws this is so abrupt she said suddenly relaxing her voice breaking slightly but then that is how dreams end our dreams have not ended a dream is not truly ended until the dreamer dies and who is to say we do not dream in the valhol or in paradise only the dragon of nidafell can swallow all dreams maria blinked away her tears when this dragon flies i will be content to surrender the memory of us until then wherever my soul is maria broke down for a moment and pressed her wet face to his chest you must know what that memory is to me she threw her arms around his neck and whispered in his ear her cheek blazing against his these last months with you have been my life all of it to hold you in the dark to see the light of morning in your eyes this closeness we have shared it has given life to a dead soul do you remember the empresss tale of daphne how she traded that moment in apollos withering arms for an eternity of virginal repose i would not trade our moment however short it may be for any kind of eternity haraldr held her as desperately as life and let his own tears answer the eloquence of her love and in his heart he prayed to all the gods to deal with him as they would but mercifully to leave him not a single breath in a world without maria what divine efflatus has been brought forth unto your coruscating resplendence by the offices of swiftfooted hermes hence to your olympios of fairgirded columns o zeus the senator and proconsular patrician romanus scylitzes flourished his arm at the blackfrocked orphanotrophus joannes was too pleased with the enormous outpouring of if it was not love then what was it yes love that his constituents had displayed to him to bother swatting away the otherwise unbearable scylitzes joannes had set up his court in the great hall of his country residence a dwelling similar in hellenic majesty to the palace he had so graciously lent to the former caesar soon to be former emperor he reminded himself his throne was a massive ivoryandgold dining chair the concentric rings of dignitaries surrounding the throne were the same who yesterday had attended the emperor however one of the dignitaries who might ordinarily have attended him was missing having learned from his woeful experience with the caesar joannes had banished the new magister constantine to a position of responsibility in the stables once this constantines docility had been irrefutably established he would be permitted to kick the horse dung from his boots and don the imperial buskins the orphanotrophus contemptuously ripped the gold seal from the purpletinted document our emperors hand seems unsteady said joannes to the logothete of the dromus as he began to read the crimson script touching sentiments indeed said joannes when he had finished his quick scan the boy has begged for his life joannes mused for a moment the heavy reptilian lids of his eyes slipped shut scylitzes stood by anxiously the attendant arcs of dignitaries were utterly silent the nobilissimus constantine of course will never achieve perfection we will strive mightily on his behalf we will labour over him unceasingly and yet he will never become an object of our pleasure we shall be forced to discard him but the boy might be the culmination of my arts the vehicle through which fair calliope will articulate the concentric harmonies of the roman universe the boy will stand before the heavenly tribunal and proclaim in a voice that shall silence the cherubim that the thousand years of mankinds perfection are at hand and their name is rome and then our boy emperor shall gratefully offer his soul to that millennium joanness eyes had been closed throughout this vision he opened them and looked over at the logothete and showed his repulsive teeth the boy emperor is sending a galley to transport me back to my palace the thousand years begin o son of kronos spouted scylitzes o olympian who has with the unparagoned industry of an arm both cogent and omnipotent hurled forth the lightning of his imperium unto the egregious usurper shut up scylitzes growled the logothete of the dromus his feral eyes sparking orphanotrophus joannes nodded for the logothete to speak permit me to caution you this galley the emperor has so humbly dispatched may have a ulysses at the tiller i would suggest you order him to send a vessel under the command of an officer trusted by you we have already requested the droungarios of the imperial fleet to remain in neorion harbour should we have need of him since we clearly do not need to be concerned about a military challenge i think a more immediate utility of the droungarios would be to command this craft along with a crew of his choosing it would be a gesture of appropriate significance the imperial galley under the command of your officers and we would have no treachery to fear well noted logothete said joannes his thoughts already on the empress city the blackfrocked monk rose and turned his back on his glittering aristocratic supplicants please arrange the details with my secretary to be forwarded with my acceptance of our emperors gracious gesture and now i must prepare myself to return to the inevitable and unrelenting duties of state the assembled dignitaries erupted into spontaneous applause accept the condition constantine stared up at the soaring dome of the chrysotriklinos but uncle this was our last opportunity we had three welltrained men among the crew any one of whom accept it you are a sportsman are you not michael nodded numbly accept that the wager has been increased now i have ordered the gates closed early this evening there is no point in maintaining the charade of government compose your acceptance to the orphanotrophuss gracious conditions and then dismiss your secretaries and go to your baths you must try to find some comfort and rest this evening i am going to try to raise our own stake in this matter uncle continue to trust me nephew constantine patted michaels arm and stepped quickly away from the throne rumour stalked the streets of the great city on a cool windless night haraldr could hear the low murmuring anxiety that drifted in the still air and he awakened often to its fevered wordless voices for a long while he listened to marias troubled fitful breathing and wondered if she dreamed tonight and what fate she knew towards dawn he was awakened by a rattling at the window it was too insistent to be a bird he kissed marias shoulders and got up and opened the shutters for a moment the face at the glass startled him he peered into the gloom and recognized the white streak in the black hair an associate of the blue stars son with hand signals he directed the little man to come round to the front gate he threw on a silk cloak and silently padded downstairs the little man scurried through the big oaken doors glancing up at them anxiously as if he had never entered a house in this fashion he wore a black hooded cloak like a monks haraldr nordbrikt he whispered quickly the blue star is aware that you might be experiencing some difficulties she says she intends to help you but she is having difficulty convincing the people of the studion that joannes is their enemy or at least that it is worth dying to oppose him but she offers you what resources she can muster she says she owes you this much the little man nodded vigorously as if to second that judgement haraldr had already considered the issue even united her people would not be able to tip the balance against the imperial taghmata my varangians are far too reduced in strength i see no purpose in sending innocents to the sacrifice in a lost cause when the only result would be to focus the wrath of joannes on the studion and he may decide that with his other enemies in the city it is prudent to continue his programmes there but tell my comrade the blue star that her offer alone is worth a thousand men at my side and tell her that should i soon find myself at the feet of the pantocrator i will say a prayer for her each day the messenger nodded grimly and offered haraldr his hands as he gripped the little mans forearms haraldr was struck that he felt far more sincerity and honesty in the parting clasp of this petty thief than he had in the lavish greetings of the men who ruled rome one hundred marines of the imperial fleet stood to attention along the flat stone surface of the jetty armoured from head to toe in steel mailcoats helms and embossed greaves they were a wall of silver in the morning sun behind them the brilliantly enamelled scarletandwhite superstructure of the imperial trireme rose above the massive black hull the droungarios of the imperial fleet attired in gold ceremonial armour and attended by four komes of the imperial fleet waited to welcome the orphanotrophus joannes descended the marble steps to the jetty his enormous black form a curious magnet for the sparkling dignitaries who trailed behind him like rapt children the officers fell to their knees and the marines bristled a line of spears in acclamation orphanotrophus the shouts rolled across the bosporus a warning to the city that now awaited its conqueror orphanotrophus come forth champion of christ come forth victorious lord of rome joanness misshapen fingers urged the supplicant droungarios to his feet well executed droungarios rumbled joannes as he surveyed the fearsome marines are you confident that the imperial taghmata understands my instructions they await your personal signal orphanotrophus very well let us embark and reclaim our city from the usurper and his barbaroi accomplices hetairarch halldor stepped forward his mail byrnnie chinging as he walked the barricades are set halldor pointed with the polished steel blade of his broadaxe noting in turn each of four entrances to the main hall of the imperial gynaeceum the tall bronze doors visible behind the columns of dark red carian marble that supported the buildings main dome were bolstered with heavy ceremonial dining couches twenty varangians clustered at each door talking quietly and adjusting their armour or inspecting their weapons the sound of axes being finehoned shrilled through the hall the valkyrja song thought haraldr but there was a beauty to that music when he thought how unhesitatingly his pledgemen had vowed to remain at his side in spite of the emperors craven capitulation to joannes they were fighting for him now and for their own honour they would not be known as the varangians who had been driven from miklagardr like whipped dogs the decurion stefhir hrafnrson ran over from the north end of the hall where the bronze gate was still slightly ajar hetairarch he snapped as he handed haraldr a rolled document the new grand domestic haraldr told halldor as he broke the lead seal haraldr read the text quickly and looked at halldor ducas is the new grand domestic you remember him of course a dhynatoi stooge in the tradition of dalassena his men will not fight well for him but being good soldiers they will fight ducas writes well he calls upon the men of the grand hetairia to surrender and end this day before it begins haraldrs pause was punctuated by the shriek of a whetstone across hunland steel decurion he told hrafnrson have a reply drafted tell the grand domestic to prepare himself for the longest day of his life haraldr dismissed his officers strode to the west end of the hall and climbed two sets of marble staircases to the roof of the gynaeceum ulfr stood on the terrace that ringed a large colonnaded cupola used by the empress and her ladies to view the races in the hippodrome the enormous empty bleached bulk of the stadium extended beneath them to the north the sun was three hours above the horizon and the surrounding domes of the palace complex seemed coated with quicksilver no sails or painted hulls marred the skyblue bosporus the docks had been rife with rumours of some sort of naval engagement between supporters of the emperor and the imperial fleet elements of which were visible as neat rows of miniature dhromons in the distant neorion harbour the single dark shaft of neorion tower stood against the brilliant red and white of the ships like the sole remaining column of a temple raised in some distant time by an evil god haraldr thanked the pantocrator for allowing him to love a woman whose courage would not allow her to enter the black steel doors of neorion may the christ forgive him but he would plunge the dagger in that beloved breast himself before he abandoned her to that place ulfr scanned the northern horizon i expect joannes soon he told haraldr without looking away from the sea if there is to be fighting he will want it to start promptly im certain he wants to make his triumphal entry before dark haraldr laughed derisively the orphanotrophus will wait in bucoleon harbour for many days before he makes that entry and he will have to climb over the corpses of his imperial taghmata when he does the defences you and halldor have prepared are excellent ulfr looked around as someone emerged from the staircase gregory said haraldr he had tried to think of some excuse for getting the brave little interpreter to some place of safety but had decided that gregory would perceive any such effort as an insult you have come to soar with the norse eagles i am afraid you will want to see if i actually can fly from this perch when you hear what i have to say hetairarch said gregory with none of his customary levity first i have discovered the signal that joannes will give the taghmata to begin their attack the imperial trireme will hoist a black flag to the centre mast before it docks in bucoleon harbour the colour is apt said haraldr that is important intelligence grand interpreter why did you think i would that was merely the flower on the dung heap hetairarch the piece of intelligence that you will find most foul is this the nobilissimus has not been seen this morning he was last seen during the night past in the inns near the pisan quarter looking for a ship damn haraldr smashed his axe against his shield and the thunder boomed off into the sky i knew from the moment i laid eyes on that that i knew he was a craven praisetongued charcoalchewing damn haraldr stood fuming at the sea for a moment as if he hoped he could spot the fleeing nobilissimus and cut him down with a prodigious toss of his axe does the emperor know this gregory shook his head since we are discussing cowards said ulfr where is our emperor he is in the empresss chambers said haraldr the purpleborn and maria are trying to steady him haraldr again pounded his shield with his axe and glared at ulfr get our emperor up here centurion if you must carry him over your back ill tell him myself about his uncles defection and then i am going to make him stay here and watch his fate sail towards him the emperor followed ulfr up the stairs a quarter of an hour later michael wore a purple scaramangium but no other insignia of his office his face was flushed but his dark eyes were blank as if his soul had fled leaving only its shell to confront fate majesty said haraldr trying to conceal the disgust he felt i am concerned about the nobilissimus michaels eyes darted from side to side he is working on something said the emperor his words coming in rapid bursts he has a plan suddenly michael fell to his knees hetairarch he shrieked his hands clasped before his hysterical face he has left me michael clutched haraldrs legs i am lost hetairarch hetairarch swear to me you will not let me dies swear to me he rubbed his nose against haraldrs boots if there is mercy in you swear it to me haraldr could only feel pity he remembered how jarl rognvald had both literally and spiritually lifted him up after stiklestad majesty majesty said haraldr as he lifted the sobbing emperor to his feet you had courage once i saw the proof of that courage pounded into your armour that day near antioch today you will find that courage again michael made a worthy effort to draw himself together you are right of course hetairarch he looked out to sea resolutely i hope this outburst will not prejudice your loyalty you and your men are all i have majesty said haraldr i swear by all that is sacred to me that as long as i remain in rome i will defend your life with my own thank you hetairarch michaels eyes teared and he looked down at his purple boots ulfr motioned to get haraldrs attention and pointed to the neck of the bosporus to the north haraldr left the emperor and walked round the cupola to get a better look the masts were clearly visible on the horizon joannes and his senators whispered ulfr i think i can make out the imperial trireme ulfr stopped as both he and haraldr saw the activity along the porticolined avenue that ran between the hall of nineteen couches and the sigma the principal northsouth axis of the palace complex preceded by goldarmoured officers mounted on white horses the units of the imperial taghmata were moving into position the next hour was excruciating the taghmatic units surrounded the gynaeceum while joanness flotilla moved steadily south the senators galleys steered into the golden horn to make their anchorage at platea harbour while the imperial trireme bearing joannes sailed conspicuously alone around the tip of byzantium heading well past the city so that the populace would have time to watch as the imposing seagoing fortress turned back to the north and came head in to the bucoleon harbour somehow michael was able to watch it all without another breakdown and haraldr was touched by his composure it was no easy thing for a man to march with his head up into battle after he had already soiled his breeches in front of his comrades the imperial trireme trailed white wake and the three rows of oars dipped and rose inexorably from a distance the armoured marines looked like granulated silver spilled on the deck haraldr watched as the swiftmoving craft plunged like an elaborate spearhead directly towards the bucoleon quays just below them to the south then something at the periphery of his vision distracted him another wake streaked the finely silvered water a ship had emerged from the harbour of contoscali a very small ushaped bay about five bowshots west of the bucoleon what is it asked ulfr a khelandia of the pamphyloi class imperial fleet said haraldr the pamphyloi were half the size of dhromons but still lethally armed and faster and more manoeuvrable the single tier of oars fluttered in rapid cadence and the narrowbeamed vessel moved quickly on an intercept course with the imperial trireme as haraldr judged it the two craft would make contact just a bowshot beyond the bucoleon breakwater a curious rendezvous for an escort vessel said ulfr pointing to where the wakes would converge haraldr looked at ulfr and shook his head it was obviously a desperate rendezvous for a nobilissimus intent on begging for his life michael pointed at the racing khelandia with a limp finger and quaking arm uncle is on that ship isnt he he said in a voice so low that had there been wind his words would have been lost signal him to return to his anchorage shouted the droungarios of the imperial fleet he stood at the stern of the imperial trireme high above the hissing sea atop a cottagesize sterncastle that resembled a small palace in its ornate gold fittings the droungarios was a slight man no doubt he had been tough and wiry in his youth but now that he was well past seventy shrivelled and stooped his authority was in his rough winepickled voice and insignia of rank rather than his physical presence his command soon produced a sequence of flags along the yardarm of the triremes central mast hes not responding shouted one of the droungarioss attendant komes shortly after the flags had been raised the orphanotrophus joannes appeared at the droungarioss side and leaned against the gilded railing let him come on joannes said his face struggling with a grin the droungarios looked at him in surprise see that man he said pointing to a purpleclad figure at the bow of the khelandia now only two stades distant those are the robes of the nobilissimus my brother has come to negotiate the terms of his nephews abdication the ships slowed as they reached hailing distance and the komes at the bow of the khelandia asked permission to come alongside ship port oars commanded the droungarios the two craft swung around and crews threw rope bumpers over the sides the khelandia thudded alongside the trireme and crewmen on the deck scrambled to secure mooring ropes the droungarios looked down at the komes in command of the khelandia the komes was a short man with a chest so massively powerful that his silver breastplate looked like an enormous kettle he had a short dark beard a sunblackened face and flinthard grey eyes what is that mans name the droungarios whispered to his aide the droungarios had more than two hundred komes each in command of anywhere from one to four vessels beneath him he vaguely recalled having given this man a reward for some role he had played in a battle off italia moschus droungarios john moschus the hero of taranto find out what he is about the droungarios shook his head hero taranto moschus walked to the stern of his vessel and shouted up at the droungarios i would like to come aboard sir and negotiate for the safe transfer of the nobilissimus to your flagship i believe it is in the interest of the imperial navy you presume what is in the interest of the imperial navy komes shouted the droungarios angrily this socalled hero would soon be pulling an oar on an ousiai let us play this out countermanded joannes it amused him to think that constantine was already concerned about his immediate safety in neorion he would wish that he had met with a quick death out here the droungarios followed by his aides scuttled down the stairs to the deck to avoid having to deal with a potentially insubordinate officer in front of the allconquering orphanotrophus joannes it wouldnt do to have a man like that perceive weakness in his commanders komes moschus the droungarios shouted his face livid come aboard and explain your treason moschus scrambled up the rope ladder and climbed over the heavy giltandred railing of the imperial triremes main deck he strode right up to the droungarios and in a lightningquick movement was behind him one powerful arm pinned the old mans neck and the other pressed a knife to his nose one movement and this blade will be in his brain shouted moschus to the four stunned aides order your marines to hold their places at the same time two dozen marines clambered out of hatches on the deck of the khelandia some of them brandished liquidfire grenades what did he offer you the bulgingeyed droungarios asked raspily i am to be the droungarios of the imperial fleet said moschus i will give you my estates near ancyra fifty villages croaked the droungarios i am a sailor growled moschus suddenly he seemed truly enraged you might remember that i saved your fleet and your command at taranto you gave me five pieces of gold i am still waiting for the command of dhromons you promised me that day moschus jerked the old man off his feet we are finished negotiating my men will burn this ship if you do not deliver the orphanotrophus to me joanness voice exploded from the lofty sterncastle droungarios order your marines to kill him the droungarioss throat gurgled as he quickly decided that the orphanotrophus was not a man he was willing to die for he had enlisted in this cause to aggrandise his land holdings not sacrifice himself to some transient tyrant will the nobilissimus grant me a pardon he said raspily rolling his ancient eyes back at moschus nobilissimus shouted moschus will you pardon the droungarios if he yields up his passenger yes shouted constantine from the deck of the khelandia he was surrounded by moschuss marines order your marines screamed joannes he came down the ladder with his arms akimbo like a huge vulture descending to earth his face was so dark with anger that it seemed like something viewed in the shadows at night he waved his black wings at the marines i order you the droungarios of the imperial fleet commands these men not the orphanotrophus shouted moschus the marines remained motionless i will destroy every man on this deck joannes stood near the main mast and his voice carried without any apparent effort at projection as if it were a pocket of cold foul air that slowly seeped over the deck the mysterious power of the blackfrocked orphanotrophus to bring fear among men brought silence like a sudden night the hulls thumped together twice constantines chest burned and his breath strangled in his throat kill him or you will all die in neorion the signal flags lifted in a faint breeze and the ranks of the marines seemed to waver their armour shimmering like a mirage the gulls wheeled and cawed overhead neorion constantines voice was a steady calm tenor the orphanotrophus will kill us all in the neorion with remarkable agility constantine scrambled up the rope ladder to the deck of the imperial trireme his voice rang out from the higher platform the orphanotrophus says he has the power to kill us all constantine walked over to joannes and set himself a fathom away from his brother they were the same man viewed in a strange distorting mirror the one eunuch blackfrocked his face carved by some demon into grotesque hollows his immense limbs and swollen joints projecting at angles like the legs of a monstrous insect the other purplerobed his beardless features haggard from a night of desperate solicitations and arrangements his still fleshy chin set hard with purpose his heavy chest heaving gently joanness eyes fired from deep within their recessed sockets you are prolonging your death brother he will kill us all in the neorion repeated constantine so then mighty orphanotrophus kill me now constantines robes swished and he stepped forward with his right foot and raised his thick fleshy hands in a pugilists stance take me now allpowerful orphanotrophus i have no weapon brother constantines face burned with anger and he gritted his teeth against the pain in his chest joannes seemed to rise up off his feet his entire form swelling like a preening bird of prey he lurched forward and constantine cringed reflexively and almost in the same instant constantines arm shot out his balled fist smacked into joanness brutish nose with a crack and a deep thud joannes slowly brought a huge paw to his gushing nose and dabbed incredulously he studied the rich red slick on his spatulate fingertips the man who had drained the blood of thousands in neorion seemed astonished to find that the same mortal stuff flowed in his veins he leaned over and numbly watched the spurting blood dribble onto the white enamel deck then he crouched slowly almost as if he were trying to capture a butterfly he knelt dipped a forefinger in his spattered blood and began to draw perfect concentric circles on the deck pausing only to dip his finger again and again as if it were the quill of a pen the wind came up and gusted joanness black frock flapped round his jutting limbs it was as if only a wooden armature remained where moments before there had been a mans body he continued to make perfect circles with his own blood none of them could ever see how long it would have lasted his voice was a rasping strangled whisper except michael michael would have made me complete they took him now they are going to take me my friends and you will have no one left joannes smeared his circles with an angry motion of his vast square palm and turned to constantine his sockets were alive with that strange silvery movement the dance of thousands of tiny wraiths he crawled on his knees and put his arms around constantines legs and embraced them like a desperate child he nuzzled his monstrous head against constantines thigh i am so tired someone help me i am so tired constantine reached into his cloak i have here an imperial chrysobull charging this man with treason he said quietly as if afraid to wake the child at his feet arrest the orphanotrophus he held up the goldsealed purple document and marines moved forward to execute his command joannes did not resist when the marines peeled his arms from his brothers legs and shackled him his eyes were completely alive now seemingly separate organisms constantine turned to moschus droungarios moschus in the name of michael emperor autocrator and basileus of rome i order you to transport your prisoner to his place of permanent exile at the monastery of monobate moschus nodded you are certain he asked matteroffactly we could with no difficulty drop him overboard on the way constantines eyes were dark wicked as if the evil that had fled joanness defeated soul had found this new home no this is the one punishment he fears more than death he went mad in the monastery when he was a boy they had to send him home for a time he was only fourteen years old the entire drama had been clearly visible from the roof of the gynaeceum michael had said nothing and registered no emotion even when it had appeared that constantine had clearly defected to joannes now as the two ships moved apart and dipped their oars back into the water michael only breathed steadily and shallowly almost like a man in a brief doze his dark eyes watched as moschuss khelandia moved away quickly to the south the still black figure of joannes stood like a charred statue at the stern the purple robes of the nobilissimus coruscated in the sun as he stood in the bow of the imperial trireme the huge ship almost immediately veered left and prepared to dock constantine looked up at the palace and waved though it wasnt certain he knew where his nephew actually was michael waved back then the emperor lifted his head to the sun and quickly brought his hand up to shield his dazzled eyes ix you are impressed with this the droungarios of the capatanate of italia mar hunrodarson gestured in passing at the mosaics he governed the province from a basilica in bari an ancient structure from the time of the emperor justinian with heavy arches and a flat coffered roof mar signed his eunuchs to bring his guest wine and seated him on a couch at the east end of the hall where a large blue carpet had been spread over the marble floor the wealth you see here in italia said mar as he sat in his chair is the shit of the imperial eagle you will see well enough the truth of that when you get to grikia mar beckoned to the prostitute as she came forward in a rustling of rosecoloured silk her tough blue eyes registered shock when she saw the face of the man she had been paid to entertain but she quickly sat next to him and placed her slender arm on his huge sloping shoulder the guest placed his brutish hand round her waist the sunbaked skin was crisscrossed with dozens of scars and most of his forefinger was missing the reason i summoned you is this continued mar the great king of grikia has died and i have just learned that the brother who was his marshal has been defeated mar used terms he knew his guest would understand the great king who has been named the successor once promised the high seat to me i am certain that when i remind him of his promise he will gladly yield to me if he will not the chief kristr wizard of the griks will help me evict him then why do you need me and mine the voice from the bearish chest was incongruously gentle i told you that i knew where you could find the prince who did not die at stiklestad yes haraldr sigurdarson that is why i have come he is in grikia yes he is an accomplice of this great king who has cheated me i expected him to be my ally in my worthy cause but he is also a serpenttongue and i am certain now that he will oppose me how many men will you need a great many i believe the army of grikia will oppose me they do not want to be ruled by a fairhair however i also know that a son of the great prince of rus now has a grudge against the griks one of his comrades was slain in a brawl in the great city this rus prince is ambitious as it is and this gives him an excuse to attack but of course you know the rus without norsemen to lead them they are women king sven will allow me ten times three hundred men will that be enough to lead these rus mar thought for a moment men like you you know there are not many like us but these are welltested men many fought for svens father knut at stiklestad yes that will be enough i am going to send my marshal thorvald with you he will arrange your counsel with the rus prince i will instruct thorvald as to the time for you to strike you must be very careful to follow what he says so that you will arrive at a time when the patrols cannot detect you until you are on the threshold of miklagardr and then everything you see here in italia you shall have for yourself a thousand times if i can kill haraldr sigurdarson i will already have more than this king sven has added to king knuts bounty will i be allowed to kill haraldr sigurdarson mar looked into the fiery dark insane eyes of his guest yes you have already killed the king of norway once have you not you will not find his little brother nearly as formidable a warrior but then i forget you already know that the yachts deck swayed in a scarcely perceptible motion the lights of the city blazed off the starboard railing a eunuch walked forward from the sterncastle his white silk like some phosphorescent sea creature you will miss it said haraldr marias hands gripped the railing tightly of course i will it will probably make me melancholy you will find me unendurable i will find you seductive said haraldr recalling an earlier conversation maria put her hand to his face but her melancholy seemed genuine she turned to him suddenly no i could not leave quickly enough i am serious my darling i have a foreboding you have not dreamed again no this is i do not like the emperor i dont understand he has proved himself just and capable beyond my imagining consider he has not executed a single man for the treason against him and has imprisoned but a few his reforms have so encouraged the people that he cannot enter the city on even a secret visit without them spontaneously flocking to throw flowers and carpets on the streets before him believe me i have seen this and it is not a case of the cursores rousting people out of their homes he is truly loved and most importantly he is deeply devoted to the empress anyone can see his love for her haraldr shrugged i believe he is somewhat deficient in the area of military preparation but his first challenge will bring out the warrior in him you yourself saw him fight once yes but i also saw him cringe once that morning when joannes sailed into the harbour ever since then he has looked at me as if he fears i will reveal his secret shame i know that he harbours guilt about that day i see it in his eyes as well but i have also in my life suffered from that guilt and i understand how it can rend a mans soul he will outgrow it i dont trust him haraldr realized he had pursued his argument to outpace some of the same doubts but then there were few men in rome one could not doubt in some fashion most of the men i have talked to at court feel that michael may be the most able emperor since the bulgarslayer he is clearly dedicated to the empire above all else he dismissed his own father the droungarios stephan kalaphates as commander in sicily and the man he appointed in his fathers stead maniakes has dramatically improved the situation he is zoes lover again i am almost certain so he obviously has her interests at heart and while rome enjoys this good fortune norway now suffers under the boot of king knuts son sven it is norway not rome that i am now concerned about i am aware of that haraldr looked south to open water as if the city that was clearly his rival offended his sight he had forgotten that a woman could love her too this is your fashion of refusing me is it not i understand if you are frightened of the journey north i am frightened myself and certainly i fear for you but you must refuse me in your own words from your own breast you are an enormous pig princeking haraldr maria pounded the railing with her fists i said i wanted to leave as quickly as it can be arranged and leave your mother with this man you cannot trust she is not my mother pig head tears glimmered on marias lashes leave her to her anger thought haraldr the scar from a deep wound takes many years to heal haraldr stepped away having learned that intimacies only fanned the flames at these times very well maria i am going to ask to see the empress tomorrow i am going to discuss with her in terms of greatest candour her dealings with michael suggest the possibility that he may pose some threat to her and discuss any fears or even intimations she may have but if she assures me that she has no reservations concerning the emperor and i believe she is in a far better position to divine his intentions than you or i then i am going to the emperor and make arrangements for my leavetaking it is not necessary for me to say that my heart cannot leave without you but it is necessary for me to tell you that i am going to leave and i will leave with my heart torn from my breast if that is how it must be maria did not answer and her blue eyes blazed back at the city you are certain i cannot interest you in breakfast alexius patriarch of the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith gestured towards the silver double doors of his private dining chamber no father replied the emperor michael i am more in need of spiritual nourishment might we walk together in the mother church alexiuss dark eyes sparkled indeed we might majesty i completed the morning mass only an hour ago and yet i already long for her and unlike physical nourishment which when consumed in excess can encumber the flesh with corpulence and corruption each spiritual repast lightens our burden and cleanses our souls alexius escorted michael through the various antechambers and sitting rooms of his personal apartments through the patriarchal offices across the carpeted causeway to the secondfloor gallery of the hagia sophia and then down the stairs at the southeast corner of the enormous cathedral they walked out into the nave in the morning light the central dome shimmered as if it would break loose and float into the heavens polyphonies drifted gently through the lightfilled ether the white robes of the chanting priests could be glimpsed behind the twostorey latticed screens of green thessalian marble that shielded the altar the two most powerful men in the world were a strange and marvellous sight as they strolled side by side both of them swathed from chin to ankle in layers of metallic silk the patriarch predominantly in white with embroideries of gold crosses the emperor in vivid claret purple sprinkled with golden eagles in the golden light of the mother church they seemed more akin to the glittering mosaic deities floating high above them than to human figures alexius took michaels arm our lord transformed his word into the light of the world yet here in our mother church i often feel that the primordial light is transmuted back in the word does that sound strange to your majesty michaels face twitched curiously first the lips and then the eyebrows that fascinates me father do you refer to the hosannas and holy sacraments with which our church is even now redolent that certainly majesty but also the word of our lord without the intervening medium of human voices when i am here i often have private intimate conversation with the pantocrator michael skipped forward a step as if seized by some irrepressible impulse father is is it possible that the pantocrator would speak to me in that fashion but most certainly you are his viceregent on earth i would be disturbed to know that our lord had not communicated his wishes to you he has communicated his wishes father he spoke to me for the first time on the ambo when you crowned me caesar now we converse frequently even in my own chambers alexius squeezed michaels arm in a gesture of encouragement and what are the pantocrators wishes majesty michaels eyebrows twitched quite noticeably he has asked me to go forth and multiply alexiuss eyes paced rapidly indeed is it our empress he has asked you to wed so that you may bring forth this fruit michael tilted his face slightly upward as if basking in the light from the dome no that lovely blossom has not borne fruit all these years and it most certainly will not now you are correct in that assumption majesty while our empress has preserved the exquisite bloom of her youth she has passed the age of fertility however majesty you must know that while you are the adopted son of the empress you are in the eyes of her people her consort you might compromise that relationship if you were to take a bride but if my bride were also purpleborn it was as if alexius could scarcely restrain his eyes from leaping out of his head i am afraid the augusta theodora is no more likely to bear fruit than is her sister majesty i have heard an interesting rumour father that the purpleborn eudocia gave birth to a daughter in a convent somewhere it is presumed that the child died but what if the child had been adopted and lived somewhere unaware of her noble macedonian lineage she would be of childbearing age now alexius hoped his pounding breast would not give him away i have heard those rumours too and think there is some truth to them at least where the birth is concerned but we cannot presume that the child was born alive or if it was is still alive and if that imperial progeny were alive how can we presume that it is of the female gender but if eudocias child could be found and if it were a woman in good health would you object to this marriage father alexius commanded his arm not to tremble the lineage of the child would be suspect majesty she would not have been born in the porphyry chamber of the imperial palace so she would not be a true purpleborn and of course the child was born outside the sacrament of marriage but if the patriarch of the one true faith knowing of the legitimacy of the macedonian blood in those veins regardless of the circumstances of birth were to assure his people that the necessary conditions for purpleborn status had been met the lineage would no longer be suspect alexiuss shoulders arched from the burden of selfcontrol but i could not give my people those assurances of my own volition i would have to wait and receive the pantocrators instructions on such a vital matter but of course this is all speculation and most likely will remain so michael seemed to listen to someone else for a moment yes quite father let me ask you to speculate on another subject let us presume that when the christ lived on earth as a man you mean when the holy spirit took on the form of the christ you must not become careless and lapse into the latin error by denying the procession of the holy spirit from the father through the son if you do so you deny christ the pantocrator his divinity and you know what a scourge that heresy has become michael nodded impatiently when the holy spirit occupied the body of the christ he had an earthly father joseph now this joseph was a virtuous man but let us assume for the purpose of speculation that joseph was in fact an evil man let us assume that he mocked the christ as did caiaphas that he scourged him as did the soldiers of pilate let us assume that he brought shame to the holy family let us assume that he fouled the mother of god with his lust and corrupted her virtue alexius raised both wiry eyebrows do not let speculation lead you into blasphemy majesty you must remember that the fallen archangel can often speak to us in the guise of the pantocrator and convince the unwary that satans beguilements are the words of the christ michaels entire body went rigid and his eyes darted for a moment then he almost convulsively relaxed alexius could feel the tremor but let us assume that these crimes did take place who would be the agent of retribution in this case would it be the holy spirit in the form of the father or of the son christ the pantocrator would offer this corrupt joseph the opportunity to repent and earn forgiveness and then this corrupt joseph would be judged at the heavenly tribunal alongside all souls and held accountable for any sins of which he had not been cleansed and at that tribunal the father and the son and the holy spirit will all three preside michael pondered this information for a moment i must return to the duties with which christ the pantocrator has charged me father but i feel a remarkable spiritual satiation after your wise and loving counsel indeed i felt that even as you spoke the christ was whispering in my ear the patriarch alexius greeted the augusta theodora by signing the cross on her forehead she had been got out of bed and now wore a plain purple robe her lustreless brown hair was set in a single braid it is time my child said alexius theodora calmly showed alexius to a couch and signalled her eunuch to offer him wine what has happened father i had an extraordinary conversation with our emperor this morning i am certain that madness is the will of divine providence and is given us either to scourge us or to allow us to enter into a state where we can more closely know god yet i also think madness is sometimes passed in the blood from generation to generation of the same family the emperors uncles were both mad though in one case it was a demonic possession while the other was a fury of true repentance but this emperor is quite the maddest of all and the most adept at concealing his madness behind the masks of reason intellect and dissimulation quite extraordinary he has embraced the most profound heresies even the bishop of rome would consider our emperor a heretic the emperor insisted in the mother church that joseph might have attempted carnal congress with the mother of god but you did not awaken me in the middle of the night to tell me of this heresy did you father no child today our emperor revealed to me that the child born to your sister eudocia on porte was a daughter theodora leaned forward so abruptly that it seemed she was going to leap at alexius he knows alexius smiled thinly i think he does he pretended to know only the rumours of the birth but he posited that the child was a daughter and now you have confirmed it theodora flushed with anger and embarrassment alexius was maddeningly clever perhaps he was only playing the same guessing game that you are father perhaps we had better hope that he is it is clear that he intends to marry the last macedonian and bring forth his own dynasty something his equally mad relatives were unable to do theodora was so pale her face seemed tinted with blue yes my child i think that you will soon have to shoulder your cross and while i do not think it is time for your climb to golgotha to begin i think it is time that we prepare for your entry into jerusalem the dhromon of the thematic fleet of sicily approached the harbour boom in the moonless night the captain ordered the oars shipped and the huge vessel drifted sideways and thudded against the log bumpers the prisoner chained and gagged a black sack over his head was loaded into a skiff along with an escort of six thematic marines the small boat was lowered on the other side of the boom with four of the marines at the oars the skiff moved away towards neorion harbour it came alongside a small dock just inside the boom the dhromons of the imperial fleet were dark silhouettes off to the right of the littleused stone jetty four khazar guards waiting on the quay communicated the correct password and hoisted the passive body up onto the dock the prisoner still attired in the nowfouled silk tunic of his rank resisted briefly when the khazar guards slipped a large leather bag over his entire body and carried him off on their shoulders the four khazars carried their package quickly through the streets that angled among the military warehouses of the neorion district twice the escort was confronted then passed along by sentries the khazars came around the back of neorion tower and halted before the black steel gates their pass was accepted and they moved their prisoner up the dank reeking stairs to the interrogation rooms on the tenth level the prisoner was tied face up on a wheellike wooden rack and the khazar guards left the prisoner with the interrogators two smoothfaced pechenegs who workedsilently over their instruments at an adjacent table honing blades and setting out leather straps the emperor michael arrived a quarter of an hour later he wore the scaramangium pallium and diadem of his rank when the pecheneg interrogators had finished their prostrations the emperor signalled for them to leave the huge steel doors slid and clanked the prisoner breathed in even shallow wheezes michael walked round the wheel for a moment as he did he placed his hands in front of his chest and touched the tips of his fingers together again and again in light rapid movements he closed his eyes and became very still and his entire head and torso inclined forward very slowly as if he were a wax sculptors model gradually slumping in a fierce heat then his eyes popped open and his dark irises struck out at the bloodstained floor as if the shafts of pure malevolence they projected were all that prevented his collapse he stared for a long moment and then his hand shot out and jerked the sack from the prisoners head the prisoners eyes blinked in the lamplight father whispered the emperor it is time for you to repent stephan kalaphates recently recalled droungarios of the theme of sicily was a small paunchy man his belly distended over the rack quivered like an aspic he was tightly gagged but his dark eyes writhing head and gurgling throat conveyed the terror outrage and astonishment of his strangled words michael prodded his fathers bound hand with trembling fingers look father your hands are still dirty stephan stopped writhing and merely glared at his son in mute fury i remember how you used to take me down to the shipyards as if to see you smear pitch on the sides of boats was some great marvel like watching the emperor in procession i hated the pitch i could not get the stink of it off no matter how i washed those men and you stank of it those men and you showed me the stinking vat of hot pitch and said i would burn in it because i touched myself and then you tarred it you tarred it michaels face was livid and he grabbed his crotch violently because i did that for doing that i do it all the time father and god has not punished me i touch it all the time father i touch it in gods presence i place the pantocrators hand on it michael leered over his father like a drunken man and stephans head jerked up and down cracking against the hard wooden wheel mother touched it too mother cleansed me mother still touches it and i still touch her michael ran his hands down his stiff jewelstudded pallium his fingertips grazing the raised gems as if they were womens nipples i am a splendid emperor am i not father my people love me they do not call me as they do you the pygmy playing heracles or the ass costumed as a droungarios they call me their father their beloved father the light of their world michael stared into the oil lamps on the grim stone wall behind the rack he cocked his head once to each side the pantocrator and i are together inside a light do you know that we have talked about our fathers not the holy spirit who begat us but our worldly fathers his father was a tradesman a good carpenter who loved his son and never fouled his mother i told him how you had scourged and mocked me and what you had done to my mother and he told me what i should do so that you might repent and be cleansed so that you will no longer stink of pitch the emperor exhaled deeply and closed his eyes stephans head resumed its grotesque protest pounding the wheel with sickening thuds and hideous thwarted cries shut up father michael blinked his eyes in furious concentration he turned away from the struggling figure on the rack i know he isnt the only unclean father he said to someone else i know that the other father tried to trick me he tried to get me to tell him our secret he thought he was so clever he doesnt want me to have my new mother michael leaned his head back and issued a strange barking laugh he tried to tell me that you lied to me he tried to tell me that you are satan the strange laugh again he is satan they are all satan they dont want me to have my new mother they are all going to have to be cleansed michael smiled as he listened to the echoes in the chamber of death when he could no longer hear them he tapped on the door to signal the interrogators the steel doors opened and the two pechenegs entered michael nodded at them and they removed the appropriate instruments from the table walked to the rack and ripped stephans robe from the hem to the chest leaving his spasming legs and pulsing flaccid abdomen fully exposed i am going to see mother michael said i am going to tell her that you will never foul her again michael turned and left the interrogation chamber before the pecheneg eunuchs began the incision around his fathers scrotum keleusate haraldr rose and faced the throne beneath the golden vault of the chrysotriklinos the grand eunuch indicated that he could approach the emperor and speak the nobilissimus constantine sat impassively in a simple chair just to the right of the dais also in attendance were the usual whiterobed secretaries interpreters and the emperors new astrologers majesty hetairarch majesty may i preface my request by remarking that rome now enjoys a stability and unity that i have not seen before in my time here i say without resort to flattery that no sovereign in my experience has ever enjoyed the love of his people to the extent that you do i say with all honesty as one who has been privileged to know you in times of both adverse and beneficent fortune that i feel that the entire city has supplanted me in my office as hetairarch in that as i walk the streets behind you i know that any one of romes citizens would lay down his life to protect your own as readily as could myself seeing that there is so little danger to your person and that no foreign powers currently menace us i believe that the time is now appropriate for me to take my leave of rome it is not without regret that i ask for leave but i am bound by loyalties to my own family and people in thule and now i believe that they are in greater need of me than is your majesty i humbly beg your permission to resign my office and those offices held by the men of the grand hetairia and be granted my leave as a devoted friend of the roman empire michaels eyes were redrimmed no doubt from his always lengthy sessions in the chrysotriklinos and haraldr worried that his speech had been too long but he had learned that the emperor was quite susceptible to wellintended cajolery and had reasoned that a show of respect would hasten him along michaels chest sagged somewhat and haraldr was now certain that the emperor would implore him with desperate words to counter some new threat well hetairarch no sovereign no matter how well loved can afford to lose a servant and comrade in arms as dedicated as yourself but then no sovereign worthy of that love could deny one who has dedicated so much to him you have my leave my blessing my gratitude rome will mourn your departure of course if i do not presume can you tell me if you plan to take our beloved empresss mistress of the robes with you yes maria will become my wife in thule a strange flicker crossed michaels face a brief passing shadow he does not like her thought haraldr or perhaps he is secretly smitten with her does our empress know this hetairarch majesty i beg you to allow the lady maria and myself to plead our case to her directly we do not intend to leave without her permission either very well said michael my only reservations concerned her majestys wishes in this matter when that is settled between you i will do everything i can to facilitate a prompt and safe return to your people michael was about to make the sign of the cross when he remembered something counsel with me for a moment longer hetairarch indeed as you say i can confidently bask in the light of my peoples love but who knows what external agents might wish to send clouds my way i will need to replace your varangians and i am loath to summon your predecessor mar hunrodarson back from italia he is doing a far better job there than he did in protecting my late uncle may the pantocrator keep his soul i have however recently purchased a contingent of pecheneg eunuchs already educated in the greek language trained at arms and even now performing well at various odd tasks for me what is your estimate of their value as a temporary guard until i can obtain the services of loyal varangians majesty i believe that your perceptions of mar hunrodarson are characteristically acute haraldr did not add that he would be returning to norway via italia and that mar hunrodarson would soon be unavailable for any sort of service as for the worth of pechenegs i have fought against them and have always felt that were they instructed in bathing reading and military discipline they would be the scourge of the earth they are certainly fearless of death these men should serve you well michael nodded and made the sign of the cross as haraldr departed with his hands over his breast michael and constantine immediately found each others eyes call me husband zoe laughed and rubbed the slick sweetsmelling emollient over her bare white leg her scarlet silk robe was slit to the waist she had spread the fabric out behind her like a peacocks tail and thus sat barebottomed on her silk sheets that is not the game i want to play tonight precious one she leaned forward and hissed through her gleaming white teeth i want to play bitch and hound michael blinked earnestly i really mean you must call me husband husband zoe leaned her head back and snorted regally my first husband was impotent my second could only make love to me when we were adulterers upon my first and you wish me to call you that zoe puffed her lips into a crimson pout i want you to stay my little boy michael thrust his hand between zoes bare succulent thighs it is quite important that you call me husband his eyes glimmered brightly in the oil light zoe removed his hand you have not asked me for that precious a husband does not ask the wife of a fishmonger does not expect to be asked i am the purpleborn and you are my child you will ask me i am the emperor and the beloved of my city and you are my darling as well but you must ask before you can open your mothers pinkfleshed reliquary my people would bid me have you whenever i wish your people give you only what your mother is willing to give you you must not delude yourself that your people love you simply for yourself you are loved because i have made you my child michael could not speak for some time and there was a moment when his face hardened until it seemed as if his skin was a porcelain that might shatter from the force of his grinding jawbones i am not asking for your troth again as i did after your husbands death he finally said in a curious quavering tone that caused zoes blue eyes to widen i simply want you to pretend that i am your husband from now on in your bed he thrust his hand between her thighs again and moved it to her crotch in here zoe gripped his hand but he would not move it you are becoming quite your mothers little man she said slowly i am not a little man michael screamed his face almost instantly livid he stared at zoe with murder in his eyes before he collapsed into sobs she held him for a long while and let him smear his running nose over her silksheathed breasts husband said zoe at length her voice firm and inviting i am sorry that i did not recognize your dominion i want you to rip my robe away and savage me with your manhood she spread her bare legs wide and michael lifted his head to show her his burning eyes the people danced twisting and swaying and whirling in mad circles inside their frantic ring the two kings cast the lots of fate one was tall and golden the other blackbearded and cringing the people began to chant as they danced and the song they sang was death over and over and over again they called down death until their faces darkened with the wings overhead and then they became the birds fat obsidian bellies glistening as they whirred in a cawing cyclone around the two kings the raven appeared in the hand of the golden king and the black king looked up at it his eyes filled with unspeakable terror the eyes of the raven glowed orange like burning embers and the golden king brought the raven down into the face of the black king haraldr maria bolted upright her breasts heaving and her eyes burning into the dawn what did you dream his arms were already around her i was awake i watched your eyes maria shook her head numbly i dreamed she paused and recalled the vision to herself i dreamed that you killed the emperor i have no intention of doing that he kissed her forehead maria described the entire vision however and he listened intently when she had finished he said i know that many of the details of your dreams are accurate but the prophecies of life and death are not my experience against the bulgars proved that your dreams are warnings not the decisions of fate it seems more likely that they have the power to reverse fates perhaps but perhaps the emperor means to provoke you somehow into striking him as they did with joannes i dont want you to dine with him this evening haraldrs gut knotted for a moment he considered the matter i dont think the circumstances will be as they were in your dream you say there were many people present an enormous crowd but this will not be an official banquet it is only the emperor the nobilissimus and myself in the imperial apartments haraldr squeezed maria tightly if the eunuchs start dancing in circles i will leave maria did not see the humour no this was outside a procession you must not i will no longer follow him in procession i have resigned my office my men are already lodged in st mamas quarter preparing our ships the new pecheneg guard led him through the city yesterday there is no chance of that maria exhaled futilely her fears exhausted you are apprehensive and i understand and i think you and zoe are going to miss each other more than you have imagined haraldr paused has she said something to you since she gave us her permission to leave maria stared raptly ahead no she said in an entranced voice she is happier than ever with michael she has hinted that she can think of him as a husband and you wish to wait for their wedding no i believe she is only amusing herself maria dipped her head as if letting the vision go i dont know she said it is as if as you say in your tongue i can hear the valkyrja singing the church of st mary chalkoprateia was located just outside the walls of the imperial palace complex north of the huge bronze chalke gate and virtually within bowshot of the hagia sophia it was one of the oldest churches in constantinople an austere romanstyle basilica with a flat coffered roof and a single large apse it might have looked like a large warehouse save for the brilliant frescoes and mosaics covering the interior walls the result of an extensive restoration more than a hundred and fifty years previously the visitors six in all seemed to have dressed in concert with the architecture their rough woollen cloaks concealed the rich silk and gold vestments beneath they entered the vaulted narthex at the front of the church were greeted by four of the resident priests who wore their vestments openly and were quickly escorted to a door at the north end of the narthex a colonnaded walkway led to the priests apartments a cluster of brick buildings of much later construction shafts of sun lanced through the columns and illuminated the visitors jewelled silk slippers just visible beneath the hems of their brown cloaks the visitors entered a square marbleframed portal and were shown down a short hallway the room at the end of the hall was large and set into a curving apse at the end of the building the walls were bufftinted plaster set with tall arched windows the shutters remained closed two goldframed icons glimmered on a small cupboard the bed was covered in blue silk the resident priests and four of the six visitors made the sign of the cross and left the room the carved wooden door closed behind them the augusta theodora lowered her woollen hood and looked around the room i am certain that pilate did not lodge our lord so well on the eve of his excruciation she said her blue eyes were girlish mischievous you may be kept waiting longer than was our lord said the patriarch alexius he continued to wear his hood his beard looked like spun silver against the coarse wool but when i need you it will be important for you to be close to the mother church though of course it would be far too dangerous for you to spend that length of time within the palace precincts someone would talk how will you proceed father i believe that if necessary i can bring down our emperor with the patent evidence of his heresies but i believe that his madness will soon provide his own undoing we will wait at least until mar hunrodarson arrives theodora betrayed her surprise oh yes my child i informed him that my need for him was imminent shortly after our orphanotrophus joannes enrolled in one of the monastic establishments he had so energetically advanced against the interests of the one true faith if mar hunrodarson has kept to my schedule he will have entered the sea of marmara already he will wait for instructions off arcadiopolis and then if necessary he and the tauroscythians will extirpate the unwanted growth from the imperial palace you may find mar hunrodarson an even more luxuriant and far more resilient growth father he is ambitious but not a fool he knows that he cannot rule without your sanction let him be the man at your side you will need neither to crown him nor to bed him i believe his robust thinking will strengthen the secular arms of our empire while i carry forth the standards of spiritual rome alexius tipped his head in a wry gesture and we could turn the people against him whenever we wished it is a pity you cannot lead the secular arms of our empire father in your own fashion you are a very robust thinker alexius responded to the sarcasm with a fond smile you know my child my thinking on this matter could be considerably more vigorous if i knew the identity of your sister eudocias child no trace of amusement remained on theodoras face no father i am willing to become your sacrifice but i do not want that for the child that is one matter on which my sister and i agree perhaps when she is older but she is theodora broke off unwilling to give up any more information very well my child i was only considering the girls own safety assuming the emperor knows i do not think he does alexius nodded cryptically i must go then if matters develop as i expect i must prepare the mother church to withstand a siege hetairarch haraldr this is where i find myself unable to accommodate myself to the risk of war the emperor nodded that he wished his goblet refilled and the chamberlain inclined over him for a moment i can race a team in the hippodrome and wager on them according to their fitness the experience of their driver the condition of the track if i lose i can train the team more vigorously hire a better driver or perhaps sell two of the horses and replace them with others but in war if my team loses i have lost the capital i need to continue in the sport so to speak i can hire new generals of course but i cannot sell dead soldiers for live soldiers and my people suffer the loss not only those who die but also those who grieve for them so i consider the odds in war to be generally unacceptable but you have moved boldly in appointing maniakes to command in italia said haraldr he was enjoying the wine the unexpected informality of the dinner and the chance to deal with the emperors only critical shortcoming his reluctance to assume field command of the imperial taghmata maniakess success in sicily have already rewarded your wager ah hetairarch said michael raising his finger in the manner of a rhetorician in sicily i bet the man i knew that maniakes could win for me and for my people but had i been there to decide on each days movements of our forces i would have been quite beside myself let me bet on my generals yes but do not ask me to wager on the actual battle michael took a deep drink and the red wine spilled onto his dark beard now you hetairarch haraldr are also a man upon whom i would wager to bring me victory in the field how do you do it haraldr paused and also took a deep draught he looked over at constantine who was so drunk it appeared he might collapse into his roast pig i allow only the best men at my back and then make certain that i am always at the front to lead them i do not command my men to do anything i am not prepared to do myself i am certain that my men are drilled in every tactic that i might wish to employ and i remember that in battle the memory grows weak so i make certain that my tactics are simple and direct to begin with but at the moment when fate hinges i am not unlike yourself majesty i trust in luck indeed michael spilled his goblet as he lurched forward in excitement tell me what you mean i had always considered you a kindred sportsman of sorts but i thought you entirely grim in battle what do you mean michael nodded for the chamberlain to refill haraldrs cup this is a different wine hetairarch he offered as the eunuch poured from the silver ewer from dyracchium if you do not like it pour it out haraldr drank deeply he didnt like the taste of dyracchium vintage but he was enjoying himself too much to complain majesty he said conscious of a slight slurring of his words we norsemen believe in a god called odin but you do not have to consider him a god if it offends your christian piety you could consider him a talisman like a splinter of the true cross or even a personification like fortune but we believe that odin sends his favour to certain men in battle and withholds that favour from others if he sends his valkyrja these being his angels of death to pluck a man from the battle then nothing that man can do can arrest his fate we have a saying no man lives to evening whom the fates condemn at morning does this odin enjoy any sports besides war asked michael ebulliently haraldr jerked his head up what had the emperor asked him had he been asleep his head snapped up again and a surge of alarm brought his wits back for a moment how could he be this drunk he had not consumed enough wine to have already summoned the herons of forgetfulness he felt the drowsiness in his arms and legs and his terrified heart pounded life back into his limbs he lurched to his feet and his spastic arms sent his cups and dishes clattering his spilled wine spread a broadening red stain over the whiteandgold tablecloth his feet seemed stuck in mud but he staggered towards michael and reached with arms that felt like huge logs you have poisoned he gasped suffocating then the room whirled and he fell forward onto the table with a tremendous crash michael and constantine stood up they looked over haraldrs twitching torso like hunters examining a slaughtered beast a long golden lock of haraldrs hair rested in the garos sauce on the emperors plate michael lifted the sodden strand of hair from the golden dish with the tips of his ringers and looked over at his suddenly alert uncle it appears he said that when this odin decided to bring our friend here to a timely end he also divined to ruin my roast pig do you smell it halldor stood on the st mamas quarter wharf and stared towards the great city the setting sun flared off the soaring round towers of the main land wall i am gagging from the stench ulfr looked back at the three light galleys tied up on the wharf varangians poured over the ships attaching rigging finishing out the oar ports checking caulk and loading kegs of provisions even if he was with maria he would have come out here to check on this no norseman takes the sea that lightly i dont like the whole business said halldor the way those pechenegs were waiting to move into the numera before our mattresses were cold it was as if the emperor were only too eager to have us out of the palace where did haraldr go last night did you ask maria i sent a man to haraldrs house erling i told him not to come back until he found her he hasnt come back halldor shifted on his feet we need to arrive at a plan unfortunately we dont know what to plan for or against lets consider the two possibilities if haraldr is in trouble we need to find him rescue him and prepare to depart immediately the other possibility is that haraldr has met with some treachery that has placed him beyond our help halldor looked at ulfr and astonished his friend with his tearing eyes in that case i intend to join him in the valhol but before the valkyrja wrap their cold limbs around me i will reduce the palaces of rome to a pile of cinders i will join you if it comes to that so will they ulfr pointed to the varangians but if he still needs our help we must find him look gregory mounted on a horse vastly oversize for him galloped along the wharf the hoofbeats pounded against the shouting of the workers comrades he yelled he swung off the horse expertly i have information he took a moment to catch his breath haraldr went to the emperors apartments last night none of my informants saw him leave halldor and ulfr exchanged ominous looks was there anything else yes said gregory the emperor has been consulting with his astrologers all day i have become acquainted with the chamberlain who attends one of these scientists and he overheard this gentleman working on his astronomical calculations with his assistants the emperor has asked them if the stars will be auspicious for a man who takes a very great risk for what day are they calculating gregory asked ulfr tomorrow as i said that whole city reeks right now said halldor i suggest we march in there and demand that the emperor tell us where we can find haraldr and then we should march right out again and leave rome before the emperor takes this great risk of his what if the emperor does want us out of the city and haraldr out of the way as it would look right now asked ulfr he pointed to the massive towers of the land wall those walls arent going to tumble down because all three hundred and sixty of us demand to see the emperor and even if we do get in we can hardly hope to attack the entire imperial taghmata particularly when they are the ones who will be fortified behind the palace walls halldor nodded impassively of course he seemed almost embarrassed by his impulsiveness he looked out over the harbour for a while this is what we do we begin to go into the city in small groups not all of us will make it through before they close the gates at sunset the rest can come through during the morning and how do we deal with the taghmata said ulfr allies said halldor he looked grimly at the towers of the great wall only the crenellated tips were still glowing our varangians will rendezvous in the streets around the devils walking stick inn during the morning and by then i expect to have asked for and received the help of a lady a lady asked gregory halldor nodded a very formidable lady i dont wish to be exhausted by your preliminaries concerning the ruling planets and the relative position of the planets in the zodiacal signs and aspects and limits michael leaned forward in his throne and glared at the trio of astrologers i simply want the answer to the question i put to you this morning cyril the spokesman for the group was an elderly man with a grey beard and blackandsilver widows peak he wore a white pallium with his white silk scaramangium and carried the trail of the pallium very elegantly as if he were posing for a statue majesty he intoned with the rolling speech of an educated hellene i must warn you that the positions of the stars for the period of time you have mandated to us portend only blood and sorrow might i recommend that you put away the idea of this venture or at least postpone your enterprise until the planetary aspects are more favourable michael tilted his head back and issued a loud hacking laugh that clattered around the dome high above him he turned to constantine these frauds could not portend the falling of a stone to earth once it has been dropped he reappraised the apprehensivelooking astrologers and shrieked science your only science is mendacity i will show you science get out the astrologers quickly scuttled back from the throne hands over breasts your exquisite knowledge is a childs babbling to the eloquence of my daring venture he shouted after them damn your science to hell he looked at constantine and stood up i am going to attend to that matter this very moment uncle he gestured at the grand eunuch to assemble his pecheneg guard another eunuch responded to michaels nod by bringing him a small sheaf of documents surrounded by his guard the emperor left his apartments and climbed the terraces to the hippodrome the imperial entourage skirted the pale satiny flank of the enormous structure paused at the entrance to the gynaeceum and were quickly admitted michael ascended the stairs with a small escort at the door to the empresss antechambers he told the new captain of his pecheneg guard a roman officer to wait outside he shooed away the eunuchs with fluttering whisking motions and walked in unannounced zoe was working over her perfumes and unguents when she looked up and saw michael she signed at her two ladiesinwaiting who were grinding with mortars at a long table jammed with glass clay and silver containers the women bowed and hurried out you are early she said smoothing her unornamented blonde hair back her nipples were vague dark spots beneath her thin silk scaramangium but then you have been very eager lately michael looked at the paraphernalia on the tables are you working on your poisons bitch zoes hands froze on the stone container she was sealing she did not look up i have quite forgotten that art my child she said softly then she slowly lifted her head and hard blue eyes it is vulgar of you to mention it she snapped what i started with romanus i have been punished for what i tried to help you do to joannes you have now been rewarded for if you are going to be vulgar leave me child so you admit that you poisoned an emperor and my uncle the orphanotrophus shrieked michael he swiped his arm across the nearest table and the vials and beakers and ewers went flying with a tremendous crash i have the proof here he waved the documents i have proof you tried to poison my uncle the nobilissimus you poisoned my uncle the emperor michaels screams rasped painfully and his face was gorged with blood you have tried to poison me bitch you are not well child zoes calm betrayed a hint of fear perhaps i have gone too far in indulging your newfound virility you have been charged with treason answer the charges bitch you are mad if you do not leave and return to apologize to me tomorrow i may ask my people to consider a new consort for me a mature man who might serve as my husband and emperor michael flipped the long table onto its side and screamed incoherently above the racket of breaking vessels he walked forward and seized zoes arms and shook her furiously you treasonous bitch you cannot take my people away from me they love me they no longer love you i am their only love the only one you are about to discover how easily that love is lost when i am not beside you to permit it michael let go of zoe and walked around the wreckage of the perfume factory kicking at metal bowls and crunching broken glass when he spoke he was more composed we are going to find out if they love you or if they love me his voice became very mild as if he were afraid of offending someone in the room i am sending you away you are going to become a nun at the convent on principio zoe emitted a mocking chiming laugh and you will play the naughty priest and visit me in my cell michaels voice was chillingly earnest i am through with our games i am sending you away zoe laughed again do you think i will simply order my yacht to transport me to principio i have a ship waiting for you i will decline your hospitality you will accept or i will kill your sisters child zoes eyes widened and she wavered as if his words were a hammer that had struck her on the forehead michael nodded his eyes black and cold she is my prisoner her betrothed will not allow you to he is dead zoe crossed herself and her skin seemed utterly bloodless even her lips became a pale lilac swear to me you will not harm her she whispered michael nodded does she know no zoes answer was scarcely audible good that will make it easier what do you intend to do to her asked zoe desperately i promised you i would not harm her michael smiled now it is time for you to repent your treason mother your ship is waiting of course i remember you boy halldor the varangian the ladies on our streets still speak of you the blue star had received halldor in her neatly swept tworoom cottage her ancient husband sat beside her and his sightless milky eyes seemed to search for halldors presence halldor proceeded to tell the silverhaired woman about his suspicions concerning haraldrs disappearance the blue stars massive bosom surged as she pondered the matter for a moment i never liked that boy emperor no matter what our friend haraldr thought of him he turned the heads of the tradesmen and their ilk but we in the studion have learned to distrust promises made in the hippodrome hes a clever schemer to have bested the orphanotrophus capable of anything i think that one is the blue star stroked her husbands parchmentlike forehead when will all your men be in the city tomorrow morning answered halldor thats good enough well need to move carefully without the tradesmen behind us we cant expect to stand up right in front of the imperial taghmata and announce ourselves the tradesmen have most of the weapons halldor didnt like the sound of this i fear we are running out of time we in the studion love your haraldr as much as you do boy but hes either alive or dead now and your fears or mine wont change that i can have an answer for you by tomorrows meridian thats as soon as you could do anything and by then i will have a hostage against his life a hostage yes his uncle the nobilissimus has a palace in the city halldor shook his head wearily and a considerable private guard and the imperial taghmata only a quarter of an hour away from his summons even my varangians could not storm the place in that time the very confrontation we both agree would be suicidal would ensue the blue star girded her imposing breadth with her arms her meaty hands and forearms still had the firmness of the athlete she once was the taghmata will be powerless against the army i am sending against them now you get some rest boy you do not prostrate yourself before your emperor michael had removed the imperial diadem but otherwise wore the full robes of his office his eyes swept round the ornate antechamber as if looking for witnesses to this affront you do not have the graciousness of an emperor marias eyes hurled fire at michael why should i show you respect in return i presume it is you who have confined me here these hours i have asked about my betrothed and about my mother zoe and have received only the snarling contempt of these castrated nomads you now employ michael looked at maria with a lightly cocked head and the bemused expression of a man contemplating a great vision you are the most beautiful woman in the world i lie awake on my imperial couch and think what it would be like to see your white breasts and legs and hips in front of me i touch myself and think of your touch i think of you and that golden brute of yours and i imagine how graceful you must be to absorb his thrusts there are also other men who say they have slept with you they say your skin is like molten silver so hot and smooth you quite burn them up they say you make a torch of the heart maria listened entirely impassively i am pleased to think i amuse your majesty during the moments he is unattended michaels face reddened you will attend me his lips moved wordlessly for a moment then he screamed you will attend me bitch you will take me inside and marry your raging fire to my golden light and call me husband husband husband husband maria smiled there is only one man i will ever call husband and he is not the little king of rome michael bounded forward and stood a step away from maria he looked at her with demonic dark eyes and a hideous grimace that bared his teeth and left his purple lips and livid cheeks trembling then you call a corpse husband bitch he screamed so loud that it seemed he would vomit his throat up i have killed him i have poisoned him michaels grimace became gleeful and he danced in little circles in front of maria his legs and arms jerking up like a marionettes maria fought against the horrible stillness the huge cold hand of fate that grasped her heart and brutally crushed it no he is not dead i would know i would know anywhere in the world and yet her heart felt the real pain the icy grip no she mastered her voice you are a liar michael let his hands drop indeed you yourself have expressed concern about him and your mother yes where is your mother i wish to ask her michael clapped his hands that is my gift to you my little bride i have sent her away you are my mmother now he lifted her hands gently you will sleep with me every night and call me husband he dropped her hands and erupted into his dance you will be my whore my unrepentant magdalen he stopped and looked breathlessly at maria do you know that he knew the magdalen its not written in the holy scriptures but he did he has told me about her her hot skin a whore like you maria stared at michael for a moment i want to feel your lance now husband she whispered unlace me michaels jaw dropped unlace me did they not tell you that in the heat of lust i abandon all reason she turned her back to expose the ties of her scaramangium how can i burn your heart out unless you can press it to my naked flaming breast michael reached out with trembling fingers and began to fumble at the fine silk loops kiss my neck whispered maria michael hesitated for a long moment as if he actually believed her skin were on fire finally he leaned closer maria reached inside her loose sleeve then she whirled and kneed michael in the crotch and threw her entire weight against him and brought them both down she came to rest on top of michael and thrust the point of her dagger into his neck he howled with pain and his blood trickled onto the opussectile floor he isnt dead she screamed in michaels face he isnt dead where is he tell me where he is the guards battered the door and she could see the motion of their entry and she thrust the dagger more deeply into michaels rigid corded neck he is in neorion screamed michael at the same moment the pecheneg guards tackled maria and sent her sprawling dont kill her bellowed the emperor he staggered to his feet his hand on his wounded neck blood ran out from beneath his palm and trickled off the golden eagles on his shoulders you must never kill my wife my queen he told the guards numbly she is our mother he took a step back from maria she knelt her braids uncoiled glaring at michael and his four guards i did not lie to you my love said michael the fairhair brute who tried to abduct you from my arms is now in neorion but he will never be able to see you touch you speak to you or force his filthy manhood upon you again maria collapsed to the floor and her quenched eyes rolled into her head only a sliver of blue iris remained visible the enormous statue of constantine the great stood over the forum vainly awaiting the first rays on its bronze head the day would likely remain cloudy threatening rain good thought the new prefect of the city stephanus anastasius as he entered the vast columnringed oval he noticed with satisfaction that the crowd was sparse in anticipation of the weather the pharmacological vendors their wooden boxes full of vials and jars already had queues as people who had become ill during the night were wont to come here early the shopkeepers in the arcades had begun to arrange their displays bright piece goods flashed here and there behind the columns the indigent scholars sat beside their books waiting for pupils or more likely a good argument with which to while away their day fortunately none of the usual rabblerousers were about they would generally begin their harangues later in the morning two venetian sailors in short tunics walked round the great column staring up and gawking the prefect spurred his white horse to a quick canter across the paved forum he reined to a halt beneath the statue his horse was dwarfed by the massive pyramidal stone base the seven porphyry drums lifted the colossal bronze figure of the longdead emperor far overhead the prefect dismounted and quickly unrolled his purpletinted text a group of labourers heading for the docks pointed and hurried over two meat vendors in stained tunics left an apothecarys queue and walked across the plaza the prefect looked around at the timeless audience the statues that stood atop the arcade roof all around the forum they were always listening he thought he decided he must begin children of rome your emperor autocrator and basileus greets you he asks that you acknowledge a new triumph which the pantocrator has enabled him to achieve a treacherous endeavour to deny the authority of the pantocrator and usurp his viceregent indeed cleave from his eternal body his hand on earth has been crushed by the diligence of your father and his beloved children the two traitors have been identified yet with christlike forbearance they have been spared a punishment in kind for the crimes they intended to visit upon your father instead they have been mercifully relieved of their offices and invited to repent at the lords bosom the names of the two traitors are alexius patriarch of constantinople and the empress and augusta zoe the four labourers looked at one another in disbelief one of the meat vendors flushed deeply the prefect quickly mounted thanked the heavenly father for having created the swiftfooted horse and galloped out of the forum heading east towards the palace gates michael sat on his throne in the senate chamber his purple boots jittered slightly on the goldembroidered stool his fingers tapped against the gilded armrests did scylitzes ever close his mouth the emperor realized with immense satisfaction however that he could no longer hear scylitzess words only see his lips move michael continued his private conversation with the pantocrator the senators sat in tiers on either side of their majesty magisters in their whiteandgold tunics proconsular patricians with the purple porphyry diptychs of their dignity propped in their laps patricians displaying their inscribed ivory tablets the white heat of the dhynatoi nodded in senescent delight as scylitzess intricate encomiums climaxed a morning of slavish approbation for their masters bold stroke they had lived to see the last legacy of the bulgarslayer trodden into the dust both purpleborn whores cast out in one daring venture zoe in exile and the patriarch alexius the only man who could bring theodora back into the imperial palace now besieged in the mother church would soon be forced to give up his office his church and his ambitions for his client who could deny concluded scylitzes with palliumpumping grandiloquence that this paragon of infinite virtue this treasury of unsurpassed merit this avatar of boundless magnanimity now leaves the chronologies of the great emperors the constantines and justinians to emblazon the earth far below his soaring majesty and now ensconces the manifestations of his everendeavouring imperium in the exalted vaults of the firmament to set his splendid throne among the deities michael nodded indicating that he had received the senates blessing with pleasure and that the senators should now come forward to kiss his knees as the procession of supplicants went on to the shuffling of slippers and the rustling of silk michael and the pantocrator discussed their mothers you came to your mother your maria in the form of the holy spirit remarked the emperor and so it was that you begat yourself by your own mother i will visit my mother my maria with my holy essence and beget myself again and again through the centuries that rome will rule the earth until we call down the final judgement and then together you and i will sit side by side again in our golden throne in new jerusalem and i shall know your mother and you shall know mine and together we shall beget eternity from their loins michael noticed that the senators were leaving en masse their hands crossed over their breasts he nodded them out of the vast doors at the end of the chamber when he was finally alone with his eunuchs his seraphim and cherubim he rose from his throne descended from the dais and danced in little circles on the floor mar hunrodarson was awakened two hours after sunrise by his second in command gris knutson who had replaced thorvald ostenson while ostenson conducted crucial business in rus mar arose and slipped the ceremonial tunic of droungarios over his head bianca maria the twelveyearold virgin with whom mar had chastely spent many of the nights of his exile in italia stirred in the bed and looked up at him with wondering dark eyes the trip from italia had held many astonishments for her and yesterday afternoon she had stood atop this villa just off the via ignatium and seen the distant but clearly distinguishable wall of the great city droungarios said knutson extending a rolled and sealed document i thought you should read this right away it bears the seal of the patriarch alexius knutson bowed and turned to leave no turmarch commanded mar you need to hear this soon you will have many more responsibilities than simply dealing with queries from a priest of rome mar opened the seal and read quickly he looked up at knutson this is most interesting turmarch the patriarch alexius has been deposed and the empress zoe has been banished the patriarch is besieged in the hagia sophia he says his client theodora is secured somewhere in the city the wily old fox does not say where he begs us to relieve him and then he will lead us to the new empress isnt that entirely to our purpose asked knutson his grey danish eyes thoughtful with the empress zoe banished theodora would have no rivals except the emperor knutson blinked away his confusion i thought the emperor was well you know all the nights we have joked about what we would do with an emperor in the interrogation chambers of the numera yes turmarch but that was before little michael had displayed this unusual ability to rid us of our problems consider that under the patronage of theodora we will always be subject to the coercion of her purpleborn status but with michael as our patron we will have only to overcome the legacy of a parvenue we might even be hailed as liberators when we usurp him mar crushed alexiuss missive in his huge fist turmarch convey a message to his imperial majesty tell him i have returned from italia on a mission of necessary secrecy and utmost urgency i will be arriving at bucoleon harbour this evening to discuss matters of vital importance to the future of rome knutson snapped out of the room bianca maria sat up a silken white night robe draped her bony shoulders and barely pubescent breasts will i see the city tonight she asked in a high clear voice like the ringing of the finest glass mar gently touched the straight dark hair that cloaked her slender neck yes little candle he said softly tonight you will see the great palace of the roman emperor constantine slammed the wooden shutter and pressed his hands to his ears even their noise is an assault he shouted to demetrius metanoites the young roman commander of his pecheneg guard metanoites opened the shutter again to see for himself and the intensity of the shrieking drone rose perceptibly he shook his head in amazement two storeys below him the street was awash with women and children all of them wailing as if the last trumpet had blown their brilliant beardless faces flushed with rage were like a field of rose blossoms amid the dull colours of their tunics the wooden shafts of various tools rose above them here and there but the principal weapons of this army other than noise were stones with every heartbeat another missile pelted the front of constantines town palace not a single pane of glass remained intact and now the raging wailing maenads had begun pounding away at the walls with large rocks we are going to have to summon the taghmata shouted metanoites they wont slaughter these innocents then we must break out my pechenegs have no such reservations about killing the women and children of rome we still could not get through you have seen how many they are metanoites pulled his wiry black beard for a moment we will send the pechenegs out of the front gate and we will leave through the rear entrance we will need to change into simple tunics a quarter of an hour later constantine unbolted the front gate and sent two dozen pechenegs swords unsheathed into the street the screams rose to a hideous din constantine saw a flash of enamelbrilliant crimson before he turned away he and metanoites raced through the main hall and kitchens and slammed against the rear door they surprised several women who were setting refuse afire in the alley the smoke provided good cover and after a short dash to the street they were able to merge unnoticed with the crowd it took half an hour to work through the mob and reach the mese the broad avenue was frantic with merchants and tradesmen and even some barebacked porters up from the docks most were running towards the palace and many carried bows and spears a portly man in a plain woollen tunic puffed along with a rusty sword in his ruddy fist women were also about on the mese one dashed past clutching a linen veil to her face where is our mother our beauty our noble empress she moaned the arcades of the shops along the lower mese were shuttered a crowd blocked the entire milion square near the end of the mese spear shafts rising above the milling woolandlinencloaked figures were now common where is our mother every ragerouged face seemed to be screaming metanoites stumbled over a middleaged woman dressed in widows black who had slumped to her knees she beat her breast with her withered fists oh theotokos oh theotokos deliver our mother she wailed the mother of rome boomed a male voice the bulgarslayers niece and him from nowhere metanoites led constantine through the mob shoving bodies aside with fierce determination constantine could only thank the pantocrator that his rough servants tunic had spared him the deadly recognition of the mob at the entrance to the augustaion constantine looked to his left the enormous bronze equestrian figure of justinian charged above a lake of wailing faces that filled the entire square and spilled over to the porches of the hagia sophia heavenly father he shouted to metanoites the entire city has come out the giant imperial eagles embossed on the chalke gate loomed ahead constantine and metanoites struggled with terrified urgency through clusters of wellarmed tradesmen arguing about how to assault the palace close to the gate the crush was so oppressive that constantine was lifted off his feet from time to time his chest ached and at one point it seemed that the pressure of the crowd would suffocate him somehow metanoites got him close enough that he could have spat on the huge bronze doors but that was as close as they could get metanoites was also blocked by the surging mass and he looked back at constantine desperately i know one of the guards shouted constantine to a beefyfaced man next to him let me up there and i will get him to open the gate the beefyfaced man shouted to someone next to him and soon a group of five or six pushed constantine towards the small mansized door set within the colossal gates the security grate set at eye level had been battered away constantine removed his seal ring and dropped it through the opening a face flickered at the grate let me in screamed constantine let us in bellowed the tradesmen who had pushed constantine forward let us at the swine who have taken our mother suddenly the small door cracked open and arms thrust out and yanked constantine inside metanoites tried to follow but he was not recognized by the khazars their swords ripped open his belly the beefyfaced man also charged his neck was hacked to the bone and he slumped blood gushing the door slammed shut constantines chest burned like the fires of hell and his head whirled he was alive he wished he had gold to give the khazars he promised them gifts as they returned his ring he requested an escort to the chrysotriklinos as he headed past the hall of nineteen couches constantine was shocked to observe business as usual in the palace precinct the silkclad eunuchs and bureaucrats glided along the colonnaded avenue only once did constantine see two officials lowerlevel secretaries to the sacellarius stop and discuss the furious din beyond the walls a sound as clearly audible as an approaching cyclone michael sat on his throne beneath the gold dome of the chrysotriklinos listening to a report on the virtually defunct taxcollection apparatus in theodosiopolis theme his eyebrows shot up when he saw constantine approach in his soiled servants tunic michael nodded at his eunuchs and the vast chamber was quickly cleared except for the grand eunuch and the pecheneg guards in their gilded breastplates and plumed helmets whatever are you doing uncle asked michael as if he were merely concerned about some prank i am so disappointed that you could not attend my presentation to the senate they were quite taken with it majesty i have scarcely escaped with my life from my own house the captain of my guard is dead the entire city is up in arms michael fanned his hand languidly then i shall announce an event in the hippodrome and put an end to it constantine approached the throne nephew he whispered would you please walk outside with me michaels face contorted with boyish displeasure but he nodded for his guard to surround him and followed constantine out to the porch of the chrysotriklinos the vast dirge from the city came like a gale from the west it was perceptibly louder than when constantine had gone inside only moments before michael listened for a moment then studied his purple boots for a long while apparently carrying on some inner conversation he looked up and smiled how incredible he said effusively his dark eyes glowing the pantocrator has already sent the means of our deliverance from this rabble constantine looked at his nephew with concern yes uncle it is true the former hetairarch mar hunrodarson has returned to save us the interior of the hippodrome was already in twilight halldor was the first into the vast empty stadium and his boots crunched in the neatly graded sand he and ulfr walked to the spina and stood beneath the bronze pylons at the south end of the stadium behind him followed the blue star a short plump figure firmly mounted on a donkey the varangians came next and clustered about the south end of the spina and then the army of the city began to enter rank after rank after rank marched through the gates they wore coarse wool and burlap tunics some were in beggars rags some in fine greek wool the men with spears entered first then men with swords hoes rakes scythes hatchets bows butchers knives and the women came in their own contingents armed with stones and clubs the track was quickly covered with these unlikely soldiers and then even the seats began to fill up halldor pointed to the imperial box high up on the east side of the stadium it was an enormous oblong structure that projected vertiginously over the tiers of seats below its weight supported by thick marble columns the emperors seating pavilion resembled the portico of an ancient greek temple and this was flanked on both sides by balustraded balconies where dignitaries were usually seated directly behind the imperial seating pavilion was a long flat terrace that bridged over to the adjoining triclinium in the palace complex the entire ponderous marble platform allowed no direct access from the seats below unless one could shimmy up the marble pilings and even if one could armoured units of the imperial hyknatoi already waited on the balconies those balconies are where the battle will be won or lost he explained to the blue star they are an excellent platform for the defenders but if we can take them they will be the platform for our attack on the entire palace this is clearly our best opportunity to breach the palace defences elsewhere the walls are sheer but here the seats give us a natural incline it is never wise to attack up a hill if it can be avoided but attacking up a hill is better than attacking straight up the sheer face of a mountain the blue star nodded this is very different from what we expected last night isnt it boy halldor looked around at the stillfilling stadium very different but that is the nature of conflict it always presents us with the unexpected it is as if god sprinkled the earth with stars said bianca maria she stood at the railing as mars dhromon glided past the city to the south what are the fires for mar looked at the conflagrations along the citys affluent spine from the vantage of the marmara coast the huge tongues of flames seemed painted in eerie brightly enamelled miniature against the darkness the palaces of the dhynatoi were coming down there is some trouble in the city tonight precious said mar but it will be over tomorrow and then you will be able to see everything the massive galley turned larboard to head into the bucoleon harbour the lights of the palace burned with their usual brilliance that is where the emperor lives said bianca maria with rapt selfconfidence yes remember what i told you about the proper way to greet him khazar guards waited at the jetty when the dhromon docked only mar gris knutson and bianca maria disembarked they were escorted up the statuelined terraces around the soaring apses of the imperial baths and then into the chrysotriklinos the trio performed the prescribed prostrations and then stood before the emperor michael what a lovely child said michael what is your name he leaned towards mars adolescent companion bianca maria majesty well hetairarch if i may reinstate you with your former title said michael quickly your return is so provident that i quite believe you are moved by the holy spirit i am moved by a desire to preserve the office of emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans said mar michael shifted uneasily in his throne mar had said office not person well hetairarch i am grateful to hear that your former respect for the imperial dignity has not been compromised by your tenure in the provinces however much has happened to alter the value of the imperial diadem since you and i last speculated on its worth my uncle the nobilissimus constantine and i placed a considerable investment at risk and have been duly rewarded but you would not know of that because due to your misbegotten fortunes in the bulgarian campaign you have been away from the vital centre of our empire you have done well in aggrandizing your investment majesty but i fear that the value of your commodity has once again plummeted it seems to me that the vital centre of rome is now the hippodrome where the varangians who so recently served as your guard are preparing to lead an assault by the wretches of the studion and their new allies the tradesmen and merchants only the dhynatoi and the taghmata stand with you now and i question how vigorously the men of the taghmata will enlist in the slaughter of the women of rome who have risen against you as vehemently as their husbands fathers and sons michael seemed to regard the threat as a minor negotiating point he smiled at bianca maria i have developed a special relationship with the pantocrator hunrodarson he will not permit me to surrender the troth that links us michael bowed his head for a while what what he whispered then his voice seemed to buzz very low like an insistent insect so it would be the threeinone as it was in your mind in the beginning because in the light all souls will hear the word the buzz trailed off michael lifted his head and clapped his hands three times he has no objection to a trinity here is how we will have it you shall be basileus lord of the entire world i shall be autocrator lord of the universe and he shall rule for us in heaven until we come to share his throne indeed kiss my hand come forward and kiss my hand basileus lord of the world mars pale eyebrows twitched as he came forward ascended the golden dais and knelt at the purple boots of the new lord of the universe are you ready to lead our seraphim against the thricedamned rabble basileus whispered michael i will send for my men and be in position to slaughter every living soul in the hippodrome by first dawn autocrator mar rose warily afraid that the slightest tremor on his part might bring the fantastic wondrous edifice of michaels madness tumbling down he backed away with his arms crossed took bianca marias warm little hand and prepared to take his leave basileus i forgot to mention that your friend nordbrikt will be unavailable to oppose you you can visit him this evening if you have time in the neorion im quite afraid you will not find him with his usual vigour however he is changed mars spirit ebbed slightly he had so often dreamed of being the architect of haraldr sigurdarsons demise perhaps even himself cleaving norways skull and seeing the last instant of terror in his eyes he bowed to michael perhaps i will console nordbrikt later autocrator i have told bianca maria that the emperor of rome has a golden lion that roars and she wants very much to see it tonight get out you gelded swine maria plucked the dish from the hands of the appalled chamberlain and hurled it at the pecheneg guard who had escorted him into her antechamber as the guard cowered from the hurtling silver disk spraying garos sauce she bounced a goblet off his breastplate get out she screamed at the chamberlain she kicked him in the seat of his white robe and shoved him out of the door on the heels of his retreating pecheneg escort maria returned to her bedchamber leaned against the ponderous sleeping couch and grunted as she slid it across the smooth marble floor she hiked up her scaramangium and knelt beside the knife that had been concealed beneath the bed still on her knees she ran the point of the knife along the fine seam between two sections of marble flooring she popped up the slab of purple docimian marble it was no thicker than an ivory bookcover and slide it aside she lifted several more of these thin revetments before she finally exposed the underlying fathomwide masonry flooring tile she had been working on all day she knocked out the few remaining chinks of mortar and arduously pried up the limestone slab which was as thick as a bound psalter once she had a handhold she was able to slide the slab out of the way she reached into the hypocaust heating duct and felt the oak slats of the ceiling below she took a deep breath and slid into the duct she could not lift her head enough to see even in front of her she wriggled along in the dark choking on the fine layer of dust she wondered vaguely what it would be like to become stuck and die like this finally her outstretched hands grasped dead air the heating closet she thought with relief she squirmed along until most of her torso projected into the dark cubicle she could feel the opposite wall almost against her nose and she panicked no matter how she contorted herself she would not have enough room to manoeuvre her legs out of the duct she reached down and felt the round bronze lid of the furnace just below her she prayed that it was not sealed she pulled with desperate fingers and got the lid loose then slid it off it clattered to the floor of the closet she realized she might have alerted the guards and she put her arms out and dropped headfirst into the bronze belly of the furnace there was not even a layer of ashes at the bottom she thanked the theotokos that this terrible day was at least not a cold one and that the empresss servants were made to keep the furnaces clean she was still stuck like a circus buffoon head first in a barrel she lowered herself onto her elbows and pushed at the furnaces fire door it opened with a metallic scraping sound she extended her arm and felt the wooden door of the surrounding closet she prayed that it would not be locked she pushed it was how long would it take to cut out the lock she would have to right herself and somehow get the furnace out of the way was that possible she thumped the door in frustration the door flew open and light burst like flame through the fire door a face loomed a demon waiting at the gates of hell a ghost a spectre of the damned symeon mistress whispered the ancient eunuch let me help you he gave her his fragile yet surprisingly powerful hands and pulled like a serpent in dirty red silk maria slid head first into the storage room adjacent to the heating closet symeon you are truly the angel of my deliverance is it true about our mother yes symeon seemed concerned but not desperate they have shorn her and sent her away but i expect her return shortly the city has risen to defend her now symeon was troubled mistress your tauroscythian has been taken to neorion i am afraid his execution has already taken place that cannot be it cannot be it simply no she told herself his light has not gone out no maria looked around the storeroom zoe had stockpiled hundreds of jars of her skin emollients and beauty unguents and face paints symeon whispered maria i have to make myself presentable and i am going to need your help symeon nodded with timeless grace haraldr moved his fingers the pain shot through his arms he moved his toes it was a start the poison had left his entire body without feeling he had no idea how long he had been unconscious when he had first awakened he had not been able to see or hear he still could not see but he could hear now though he wished he could not and so he knew where he was neorion his eyes felt as if daggers were piercing them but he could not move his arms to touch his bloody sockets he could not feel his arms actually but his fingers had moved he still had a tongue though but so dry and swollen that he could hardly breathe let me live odin let me live to destroy rome like blind samson i will pull down the pillars maria had warned him god the father if only he could touch her he would live on the memories of her vision and her living touch it was as if the halls were trumpets that amplified every noise every scream the neorion was a vast conch and the scream that started at the top would wind its way down and enter the ears and shatter inside the head so that the screamer died in ones brain clawing for life in a strangers skull things crawled out of the sludge and onto his legs and chest and he could not pick them off they bit him often were they also chewing his shoulders he prayed they would kill that man the fire exploded in his face and when they jerked him to his feet he thought they had ripped his arms off he tried to see them and butt with his head but they kept the flame in his face and he could smell his hair burn demons this was the hell of satan demons ripping his arms off he slammed into the wall trying to crush the creature beside him they screamed in their demon tongue pechenegs haraldr slammed again and again against the wall and they beat him about the head and the flames seared his face and dozens of arms grappled around him he knew now that he was not blind he could see them screaming then a flash and he could see nothing when he awoke he wondered if knives had been stuck in his neck and shoulders he could see the interrogation chamber clearly as if pain were a glass that distorted his thoughts but placed his vision in sharp focus four smoothfaced pecheneg guards stood by while the two pecheneg interrogators prepared their instruments he cursed the gods who had lured him to this ignoble death and did not ask for their help then he remembered the wretch from the studion he had seen butchered in this very room and he felt the mans soul still lingering offering him courage the shorter of the two pechenegs a man with brown chancre scars on his face and wideset black eyes picked up a steel brazier full of glowing coals and held it beneath haraldrs face the heat seared his nostrils and baked his forehead haraldr tried to swat the fire away and he realized that he was hanging off the ground suspended by his bound hands his arms were pulled up behind his back in an excruciating posture he jerked his feet up but they were held fast by chains and his ankles burned he glared futilely at the instruments of darkness two irons the width of a womans little finger rested in the coals the brands were whiteorange at the sharpened tips the second taller pecheneg put on thick leather smiths gloves and rotated one of the irons embers flew up into haraldrs face in some corner of his mind he observed the senseless humour of that the last thing a man who is about to be blinded sees is flying sparks no visions of golden cities no final sunset the door slid open and the pechenegs turned a fifth guard brought in a fowl on a spit and a basket of fruit the two interrogators set the brazier at haraldrs feet and descended on the food with the rest they placed the plucked bird on their table and sliced the nearly raw meat with the blades of their trade one of them turned and made some joke about haraldr in his guttural tongue the rest began to eat noisily that is not enough the commander of the neorions pecheneg garrison was a tall ugly asian probably of mixed saracen blood his broad nostrils were in grotesque opposition to the sinister verticality of his long hooked nose and dour drooping chin he pointed to the three gold solidi the elderly priest had placed on the table this prisoner is was an important man wealthy wealthy friends you can pay more for the privilege of providing him spiritual succour and i have to collect for both of you a double toll so to speak he grinned exposing rotten front teeth and pointed to the blackswaddled and veiled nun a stooped crone with some kind of skin disease her wrinkled eyes were almost crusted shut the priest who wore the goldembroidered shawl of a deacon of the mother church emptied his purse with frail trembling hands three more solidi spilled onto the table the garrison commander grinned again very well but you dont have much time they have already gone to work on him the priest and nun crossed themselves quickly a single pecheneg led the priest and nun up the dismal mysteriously cold endless flights the wolfshaped oil lamps seemed to struggle against the damp and darkness the flames pitiful and stunted at the tenth landing the pecheneg knocked on the steel door the security grate slid and finally the door screeched open and offered up the reek of death the priest and the nun were admitted to an antechamber a short distance down the icy hall the black steel double doors of the interrogation chamber faced them the five pecheneg guards played a game on the floor with knucklebones the priest gave each pecheneg a copper nomismata two of them got up and slid the immense double doors open the two interrogators were sharpening their blades again having dulled them on their dinner haraldr lolled his head towards the new arrivals a priest his eyes teared with gratitude the pantocrator would also be with him in the end haraldr thought he had never seen anything more beautiful than the golden crosses embroidered on the priests shawl the priest moved excruciatingly slowly he gave coins to each of the interrogators and brandished his jewelled cross at them they bowed and retreated as part of their indoctrination they had been shown the hagia sophia and subsequently they had no wish to offend any of the wizards who could bring the sun inside at night and bridge the sky with molten gold the old crone came forward too her veiled crusted hideous face lowered to spare her the sight of haraldrs bloodied head and filthy almost naked body the priest chanted and knelt at haraldrs feet haraldr could not understand why the priest was tugging on one of the thick hide ankle collars looped through chains that restrained his legs he looked absently to his feet the priest now furiously chanting clutched a dagger in his withered corpselike hands he was sawing away at the collars haraldr looked up in horror at the two pechenegs they busied themselves shining their new coins then held them up to the oil lamps and played with the reflections who was this unlikely saviour if he could just get his legs loose before the pechenegs lost interest in their newfound wealth the old crone was looking at him she had forced her crusted eyes open holy father just to see them again even if he died now they were two sapphires with fires behind them he mouthed her name in spite of his swollen tongue marias shoulders heaved and her eyes teared but she steadied herself she looked over at the pechenegs and came around haraldrs back the priest had cut one of the collars loose haraldrs wrists were bound but not chained and maria hacked at the ropes one of the pechenegs was distracted from his coin focused his black eyes for a moment and barked at his companion they stepped forward not yet alarmed and peered curiously at the priest haraldr whipped his free leg up and cracked the short pecheneg on the side of the head with his foot the man fell like a drunk the second interrogator ran for the steel doors and maria dashed after him and plunged her knife in his back the pechenegs arms shot out sideways and he turned and looked at her in amazement he shouted as he fell haraldr pulled desperately and the bonds at his wrist loosened as the doors slid open one of the guards looked in maria stabbed at him but her knife clattered off his breastplate haraldr pitched forward on his face as his wrist came loose the priest who had been working all the time on the second ankle collar crumpled beneath him the muscles in haraldrs shoulders seemed to rip as he pulled his arms free but he had the strength of odin now he rolled to his feet and whacked the guard with his stillnumb arm and sent him sprawling the priest struggled to his feet and haraldr realized he was zoes eunuch symeon haraldrs head roared with the howling winds of the spirit world another guard peered into the interrogation chamber and haraldr slammed the steel doors shut on his head the pechenegs face seemed to blow up with blood and his nose and eyes spurted haraldr let the limp body slump inside removed the sword from the belt threw the doors open and faced the remaining four men the guard in the hall had joined the three pechenegs haraldr was not even conscious of how he killed them but the strange sword sang to him in the same melody as his own haraldr came back into the interrogation chamber and methodically slit the throats of the men he had left unconscious he looked at maria who had retrieved her bloody knife and with some removed consciousness contemplated the terrible spectacle of their reunion then he embraced her father i am glad i did not die before this moment he told her oh mother of god she gasped cathartically she broke down at last and tried to rub the blood off his face haraldr turned gratefully to the determinedlooking eunuch symeon and wondered how courage had ever come to be associated with a mans testicles symeon you and maria must go down now before someone discovers this maria looked up at him and sobbed how will you escape i cannot go down with you said haraldr there will be too many guards they still think you are a priest and a nun they know i am not supposed to be leaving he looked around the room studying the ropes and various paraphernalia of torture i have to go up he let go of maria and began gathering supplies as he worked maria and symeon told him of the incredible events that had ensued in his absence the banishment of zoe and the charges against the patriarch the rising of the city the encampment of his varangians and a citizen army in the hippodrome when haraldr had assembled his gear he bagged it in one of the pechenegs tunics then he led maria and symeon back into the stairwell go now he whispered maria hesitated she threw her arms around him and clung fiercely we are taunting destiny with these farewells she whispered harshly fate will not always give you back to me it cannot be that generous haraldr took her arms from him and looked into her blazing eyes the gods serve those who obey their summons you have proved that by giving me back my life his voice rose in the dismal shaft go go she turned looked back at him again and then symeon gently urged her down the stairs she was gone before the gods whispered that he might never see her again haraldr ascended the last flight as he had expected the stairwell ended at a steel trapdoor he crushed the padlock with the steel mallet he had found in the interrogation chamber he climbed out onto the roof the wind whistled and he immediately saw the conflagrations along the spine of the city he paused for a moment rapt with the spectacle the palaces of the dhynatoi were crumbling into gutted hulks to the south thousands of torchlights moved in and around the hippodrome haraldr looked over the low parapet that ringed the roof the pavement was twelve storeys below the intervening walls of neorion were sheer grey rock articulated with only a single band of small windows on the lowest level haraldr used the mallet to drive a steel spike one of the brands intended for his eyes into the stone he looped a length of rope over the spike and fastened the other end under his arms he slung his gear over his back and crawled over the wall odin christ he prayed he let go of the parapet and allowed the rope to take all his weight iron and stone screeched faintly like an insect dying driving spikes as needed and reusing his short lengths of rope haraldr rappelled to within a dozen ells of the pavement before his spikes ran out he jumped the rest of the way landing hard he heard shouts from the road to the west khazars about a dozen he did not wait to satisfy their curiosity to his left was a small wooded area that ran south towards the church of st irene the cool fragrance of the trees engulfed him he heard shouts and realized that the khazars had followed he thrashed through several rows of shrubs and saw the huge brightly lit apse windows at the eastern end of st irene he crossed the lawn that bordered the church off to his left the windows of the neighbouring hagia sophia glowed like golden studs set into the night shouts came from the walled courtyard on the south side of the church he looked back khazars had followed him across the lawn he heard more of them coming around the apse from the north they seemed to be everywhere haraldr leapt to the ledge beneath the towering apse windows he kicked out glass panes and wooden lattice and jumped he landed in the midst of a group of exclaiming fervently praying priests they had been seated as was customary in tiers just behind the altar haraldr clutched the robe of the first priest he could get his hands on where is your underground he bellowed at the dazed cleric the entire palace complex was linked by a network of subterranean passageways if it is sanctuary began a whitehaired old priest show me the passage shouted haraldr a young priest rushed forward and pulled him to a small door set into the wall behind the altar they ducked into the dark storeroom as the khazars climbed through the shattered window the priest threw open a wooden hatch set into the floor bless you father shouted haraldr as he descended the steps into the darkness haraldr navigated the abrupt turns of the dampsmelling passageway he had to duck his head to keep from hitting it on the low ceiling after a while he could see the slight illumination of his pursuers torches the passage forked which way he was uncertain now if he was pointed south or east or west one fork led to the hagia sophia he reasoned the priests there no doubt still led by their besieged patriarch would surely conceal him and show him a way out into the city fate instructed him and he took the left fork the passageway lowered and he had to crouch he could hear the khazars shout to one another he scuttled along desperately through the claustrophobic tunnel and on and on he realized that the mother church was not this far from st irene but he was beyond turning back he remembered the culdesac in the bulgarslayers galleries and wondered when he would encounter a similar dead end and have to turn and face the khazars the floor became slick and he could smell the water not just seepage but oppressive cold dank a wetness that thickened the air like a wind off an icy lake the passageway ended beneath an arcade flares a good bowshot away rippled in golden rivulets across an onyxblack underground lake illuminating the hundreds of columns and brick vaults of the cisterna basilica haraldr gasped with involuntary wonder he had heard of the great sunken palace but had never before seen it he could not appreciate the beauty of the intricately carved floral capitals that thrust up the honeycomb of groined vaults the cistern seemed only like a vast stone forest rising from a stygian swamp haraldr sheathed his blade in his burlap loincloth and lowered himself into the icy water the submersion of his chest left him gasping for breath he stroked furiously a third of the way across he heard the shouts roll through the vaults and looked back to see the khazar torches in the arcade from which he had embarked as he approached the far end of the cistern he paused and treaded water while he studied the guards on the small landing ahead of him khazars four of them they were obviously standing guard over an entry point from the city a rowingboat was tied up at one end of the wooden landing haraldr hoped that the khazars would be foolish enough to paddle out after him but the khazars simply unsheathed their swords and waited for the inevitable finish of his swim haraldr paddled to within fifty ells of the landing he continued to tread water and taunted the khazars in greek they responded with curses in their own language one of them sheathed his sword swung his bow off his back pulled an arrow from his quiver and took aim haraldr ducked under the water and swam forward when he came up for air he was only twenty ells away another khazar aimed at him and he took two quick breaths and ducked under again the two other khazars quickly sheathed their swords strung their bows and joined in the sport all four of them crowded towards the edge of the landing and began wagering on who would hit the big white fish first they studied the surface intently arrows drawn nothing then the water splashed right in front of them and one of the guards pitched forward into the inky void immediately disappeared and a moment later bobbed up his neck tilted unnaturally the astonished bowmen shouted and fired aimlessly into the dark water more thrashing at the end of the landing they turned haraldr was already on the dock he decapitated the nearest khazar and with a single swat sent another sprawling into the water the third khazar dropped his bow and went to his knees on his own accord you know who i am haraldr said in greek the trembling khazar nodded i let you live he pointed to the boat go back to your unit and tell them that haraldr nordbrikt and his varangians will come against them soon and there will be no mercy for those who oppose us but there will be amnesty for all who refuse to take arms against us and the empress of rome the khazar dipped his head to the wooden slats then still crouched and looking back at haraldr like a frightened cur he crawled to the boat tumbled in and paddled back towards the palace i am inspired uncle said michael flourishing his gemencrusted pallium his dark eyes flashed beneath the blazing candelabra of the chrysotriklinos i am not a fool the employment of hunrodarson is merely expedient i have no more intention of making him basileus than i do of placing a dead fish on our glorious throne do you think the pantocrator would continue to sanction me if i were that foolish no mar hunrodarson will serve his purpose and then join his former accomplice haraldr nordbrikt in the neorion michaels lips quivered and his teeth flashed momentarily i rather fancy that little girl he has abducted she is so pristine i quite see her as my mistress my virgin magdalen white mary is what her name means constantines forehead prickled and his stomach roiled how had his nephew fooled him for so long or perhaps why had he for so long dismissed his nephews obvious symptoms as mere impetuosity or youthful caprice but he should have known he should have been alarmed he should have slowed things down but michael could be so brilliant so able was it a family curse or was it in the nature of the imperial office to drive men mad perhaps the man supplied the madness but the office supplied the form of that madness the endless enactment of the pantocrators life in the ritual at court with each journey through the city a restaging of christs triumphal entry into jerusalem with each state banquet a repetition of the symbolism of the last supper the implication by the very breadth of the imperial throne that the pantocrator himself sat next to the emperor little wonder that michael had come to believe he knew the pantocrator intimately it was perhaps a tribute to michaels qualities that he did not yet believe he was the pantocrator perhaps it was christian rome itself that suffered from the delusion and michael was only afflicted with the contagion of that hubris or perhaps it was true that satan himself did dispense the keys to the kingdoms of the world majesty said constantine delicately i fear that the pantocrator is testing us with yet another travail in this enterprise of ours i am informed that both the tauroscythian haraldr nordbrikt and the woman maria have escaped from their respective confinements michaels eyes widened for a moment he tilted his head slightly listening my mistake was in choosing a magdalen who was both sullied and unrepentant that is why my white mary has now been sent to me his gaze was distant as if he looked off towards the vast shimmering golden domes of new jerusalem my mother must be a virgin i know that now nephew snapped constantine in desperation if haraldr nordbrikt has escaped to lead the citizen rabble the consequences could be grave you yourself have said never to bet against a man who has won so many times that it seems he cannot possibly win again haraldr nordbrikt has cheated destiny so often i am most reluctant to wager against him now mar hunrodarson is also a man favoured by fortune i rather think that the good fortunes of both brutes will quite cancel each other constantine nodded grateful that the pantocrators companion still enjoyed moments of lucidity still nephew even if the tauroscythians neutralize each other we are confronted with the unabated wrath of the rabble constantine steeled himself and offered the only counsel that a man of reason and ability could in a situation like this majesty i think we should call the empress back from the convent at principio we merely need have her read a proclamation to the citizen rabble and then maintain her under house arrest as your predecessor did i am certain she will be amenable they say she was entirely undone with the prospect of leaving her city when she was taken aboard ship michael paused and waved his hand airily oh that uncle yes quite i have already dispatched four of my fastest galleys of the ousiai class towards principio with extra complements of rowers and relays waiting for the return voyage the empress will be here shortly before cockcrow and after the tauroscythians have successfully eliminated each other in the mornings combat i will produce her to quiet the rabble constantine bowed majesty he whispered with relief i believe you are indeed inspired so i will place my linen weavers and bakers and grocers here said john a thickarmed shorthaired leather cutter who had emerged as the leader of the guildsmen he knelt and pointed at the rough map halldor had sketched in the sand of the hippodrome track halldor forced himself to concentrate as he had all evening he was certain now that haraldr was dead and his implacable shell was beginning to crack but he had to hold himself together until tomorrow until the day of vengeance he prodded the indicated place in the sand with the point of his sword yes tell them that the diversionary attack at the chalke gate is of crucial importance and if they can force the gate all the better our success here depends on the vigour of their assault there halldor turned to the blue stars son who leaned over the scrawls in the sand and studied them so intently that it seemed his jutting beard would erase the plan nicetas said halldor your associates will be the first to strike just before dawn at the bucoleon gates that is the last quarter from which they expect an attack you will probably achieve initial success and then meet strong resistance remember that holding your ground is just as important to us as an advance halldor looked at the blue star who stood with her arms folded and a keen steely look in her eyes as if she heard the echoes of her earlier triumphs on this track your attack is the most important madame especially since we know that mar hunrodarsons varangians are coming against us tomorrow i am certain that they will defend the imperial box it is imperative that the imperial taghmata is not permitted to come down into the stadium and encircle my varangians while we assault the imperial box tomorrow the high and mighty will reap the whirlwind of the studion said the blue star there are accounts to be settled halldor dismissed his curious assortment of officers and looked up to the imperial box mar will have the advantage of high ground and numbers he told ulfr when odin sends me a valkyrja i hope she is tight and wicked the web of man is now being woven said ulfr sombrely the valkyrja will cross it with their bloodred weft he looked at the stars only faintly visible through the pall from the fires and torches we have an account to settle as well i hope odin will spare me long enough for that yes said halldor his voice breaking for the first time in ulfrs memory we will never see our comrade again in the middle realm but tomorrow we will see him in the valhol if there is joy in this it is that i will drain odins mead trenches with haraldr tomorrow halldors voice firmed again and bring him a thousand souls as a gesture of my love and respect ulfr manfully grimaced to stop his tears and pointed down the track where a contingent of guildsmen were practising their spear assault we will bring many souls with us your idea of forming units according to profession was a good one these guildsmen are already becoming an adequate army and what the folk of the studion lack in tactics they will make up for in ferocity and courage and i have never seen varangians so thirsty for the eagles brew it is as if every man has odins rage halldor nodded to the groups of varangians many already in full armour they would sleep tonight with their helmets as pillows as they worked over their blades or assembled siege ladders halldor turned and observed a varangian in a ridiculously undersize rough wool tunic stagger through the ranks of the drilling guildsmen all eager except this sot said halldor with mild derision he must have found the only inn open in the city tomorrow he will think that someone is pounding his helm with a broadaxe before he even sees mars men halldor squinted into the flickering light provided by hundreds of torches who is that erlend ulfr lurched forward as if drawn by a stunning vision he stopped after a few steps and an incoherent sound came from his throat then he dashed towards the stumblebum varangian and almost knocked him down with a frantic embrace he sobbed like a woman the drunken varangian pulled ulfr to his feet and virtually carried him over to halldor halldor grinned broadly in spite of his effort not to haraldr he said his impassive voice betrayed by the tears in his eyes i thought that was you you look like something a gull has dropped no wonder the blackbitch valkyrja sent you back to us the quiet seemed supernatural a thick soundless ether that lay over the great city disturbed only by an occasional haunting animal sound a distant cockcrow or dogs bark quickly muted by the grey predawn haze it was as if the human inhabitants of the city obeyed a single collective fear that in speaking or moving they would set in motion the terrible day that lay ahead in the imperial gynaeceum michael emperor autocrator and basileus of rome clutched the hands of the empress zoe a communion as silent as the city he could not confront her haggard blackrimmed eyes and shorn hair and so his bare head slumped in apology the darkness of zoes bedchamber hid his tearcoursed face finally zoe separated her fingers from his she reached out and stroked his dark curls i forgive you my little boy she whispered and with those words the huge engines of destiny began the new day mar hunrodarson stood on the catwalk atop the roof of the imperial box a living titan among the immortal statues that ringed the highest level of the hippodrome mars varangians were a dull grey shield wall surrounding the imperial box archers and javelin throwers of the imperial taghmata also a wall of faint pewter in their steel breastplates and helmets had crept over the highest tiers on the north side of the imperial box and waited for the slaughter that would fill the scores of rows of empty seats below on the track directly beneath them the ragtag army of the studion had assembled they wore almost uniform brown tunics and were armed with wicker shields and an assortment of clubs tools spears and knives the women among them could be identified by the coarse linen veils that concealed their hair haraldrs varangians stood in full armoured formation in front of the stadiums central spina wooden siege ladders threaded their ranks haraldr knew that the question between himself and mar would be settled before this day was ended and yet the imminence of death did not concern him where was maria had she and symeon been caught and was she even now undergoing the tortures she had spared him that excruciating doubt made him consider the certain death or reentering the palace alone and yet what if she was safe now only unable to come to him how would his death then reward her courage destiny commanded the day he realized whoever would leave the middle realm before this day was over the fates had already condemned the clearly audible chorus of shouts from the vicinity of the bucoleon ripped the batting of silence off the vast stadium a chant rose from the ranks of the studion army michael michael upside down well hang you from a column and crown your arse high above mars varangians answered with the chilling pounding of axes on shields haraldr strode through the ranks of his men and stepped up onto the stadium seats to face them varangians what you hear is the breastbeating of the men who cowered in their own slime while our comrades died in the fight against the bulgars for our comrades who now wassail in the valhol let us bring them those he thrust his hand upwards towards the imperial box to bow before their courage tonight the varangians erupted into shouts of haraldr haraldr and began a drumbeat on their own shields an arrow clattered on the stone at haraldrs feet he turned and defied the archers waiting for the signal that the diversion at the chalke gate had begun another arrow clattered haraldr watched the backdrop of brightening sky behind the archers at the top of the stadium a moment later the dragonshaped red kite wriggled up into the lightly pinked sky even before haraldr turned to give the command to his own forces he could see that archers of the imperial taghmata were being taken off the stadium wall to counter what seemed to be the much more imminent threat of the wellarmed guildsmen at the chalke gate haraldr signalled the blue star to begin her assault then he pointed his sword upward vengeance ducked beneath his shield his men grunting at his back haraldr quickly climbed the tiers of seats the ends of the siege ladders jutted out ahead of him set the ladders he shouted as he neared the top of the stadium javelins thudded against shields and sparked against the stone benches mars men hurled down obscenities along with their spears haraldr looked at the red bawling faces on the balcony above and marked the men who would precede him to the valhol the five heavy wooden ladders rose almost in unison and then tilted towards the marble balustrade of the imperial box as soon as the ends of the ladders made contact haraldrs men leapt on the lower rungs their weight resisting attempts to throw the ladders off the boldest began the climb mars men waited swords poised redrimmed eyes glaring teeth bared some of them beckoned with bearish pawing motions they had every reason to expect a slaughter haraldrs men advanced in curious echelons each climbing file led by a man with a spear followed by an archer both virtually useless in the close combat in which they would engage at the top the spears prodded forward and mars men swiped at them playfully one of them actually captured a shaft jerked it violently and sent the man who had wielded it plunging to the steps almost as if by that signal haraldrs archers rose and fired mars men had been too distracted by their game to guard their faces with their shields virtually every shot struck home and the entire rank at the balustrade toppled or flailed wildly at the feathered shafts sprouting from jaws and eyes the momentary advantage was quickly seized haraldr and his men spilled over the marble balustrade and hammered back the surprisingly thin second line of defence as he clambered over the corpses haraldr wondered with profound apprehension why mar had posted so few men at the most critical point of defence he pushed mars token resistance back towards the terrace behind the imperial seating pavilion he wheeled to his right looked down the long narrow terrace and saw what mar had held in reserve mars men barred the narrow platform five men wide almost a hundred men deep a plug of seemingly solid steel the infrangible steel seal to the imperial palace for the moment the two varangian forces hesitated and the metal music stilled haraldr looked into the fierce blue eyes of mars men and for a moment wished he could offer them something less bitter than the ferric draught of blood and steel but the bulgar war had settled that he studied the man with a thin blond moustache opposite him he had seen him in the palace but did not know his name with a lightningquick motion he raised his sword and brought it down the mans clavicle collapsed his mouth contorted and he pitched to his knees time ended the sun rose and iced steel byrnnies and helms and blades but no man could register the length of its silvery ascent the fighting was unrelenting in its brutality a confrontation of seasoned warriors who had determined to abandon all the artifices of their trade and exchange blows of pure desperate hate there were no battle cries no false courage only the endless harsh chorale of steel on steel and the regular sickening thuds of swords and axes into flesh the only thing that separated their motions from the deft mechanistic slaughter of a butcher was their voiceless rage at first haraldr halldor ulfr and hord stefnirson took the snout of a slender boar exchanging places at the front every few moments a relay passing on the terrible hammer of thor gradually they expanded their front to the entire width of the terrace haraldrs arms still ached from his ordeal in neorion and he noticed that halldor and hord fired by vengeance for his brother joli were his champions now pushing forward where even he could not go and over the course of what might have been an hour what for many was eternity halldor and hord prevailed it seemed as if mar was now losing four men for every one of haraldrs soon the resistance perceptibly sagged and the bloody stalemate quickened to a steady shuffling advance haraldr glanced off to his left and could see the ringed silver domes of the chrysotriklinos glitter in the morning sun and he realised that if he could live another few hours he could settle with the man enthroned beneath those domes but first he had to settle with the man who waited ahead and the gods were telling him that even they feared that moment mars men fell back suddenly and the din of conflict abruptly subsided a voice barked from behind the bloodied disastrously thinned ranks of mars varangians haraldr sigurdarson we must deal halldor simply charged forward to finish the fight and haraldr had to pull him back i am haraldr sigurdarson said haraldr halldors jaw slackened and he stared in shock the varangian ranks on both sides became absolutely silent the vague shouting from the fighting in the stadium only added to the sense that they all stood in an eerie soundless vortex haraldr walked forward to confront mar hunrodarson there is no reason for our men to continue to settle the quarrel between us prince of norway mars byrnnie glistened with fresh unmarred lacquer his eyes were like diamonds and his nostrils flared you knew this time would come he said with a sneer i have always despised you you are weak and stupid haraldr now understood mars strategy he had sacrificed his best men and his honour to exhaust haraldr and save himself for their reckoning halldor shouldered past haraldr and pounded mar in the chest with his flat hand i will settle with you hunrodarson i am not afraid of your vaunted arm coward mar simply grinned at the provocation it seems that your prince haraldr is the coward he has been poisoned and bound and beaten in neorion shouted halldor so that everyone would hear and he has fought this morning slime crawler there is no shame in my appearing as his champion halldor shoved mar again i do not need odins favour to meet you hunrodarson mar shook his head and laughed he will want to fight me when he learns that i fucked his woman haraldrs head snapped and the blood drained from his face you dont believe me said mar let me describe the bite i took from her soft breast she begged me little prince ask her how she begged me mar pointed to haraldr and snorted derisively he wants to make his woman queen of norway but she is just my whore haraldr refused to lower his eyes if he could see maria again he would forgive her a thousand men but he could not forgive himself if he yielded to mars challenge were he only haraldr nordbrikt yes but haraldr sigurdarson king of norway could not turn away from this any more than olaf could have walked away from stiklestad and for the first time in all his years of dreaming and yearning he knew what it was to be a king always to be in front always to be the first to accept the consequence of decision especially when he blundered even when the men who served him blundered a king had to be the one man in the world who could say to his people i hold myself accountable for my honour and for yours always not merely when it is easy to do so you are a small man mar said haraldr softly the weapons i choose are one sword one shield no replacements halldor turned to haraldr no we dont need to do this you have already won let us begin again until we have slaughtered them to a man haraldr shook his head i must do this i fear running again more than any death i owe the men who have been brave enough to follow haraldr nordbrikt at least this much ulfr stepped forward and nodded at halldor halldor would not yield haraldr seized halldors shoulders and looked between him and ulfr the last time you seconded me i fought for the right to lead five hundred men today i must fight for the right to lead norway halldor finally stepped away his eyes wet then he turned and addressed all the varangians with a flat implacable statement the tale that haraldr sigurdarson was a coward is a lie mar unsheathed his magnificent engraved blade and examined it in the sun then he slammed his sword against his shield and haraldr turned to meet him haraldr knew he would be able to make but one savage assault with all his remaining strength he closed with no preliminaries and pounded mars shield to kindling amid a gale of cheers mar countered deftly and moments later haraldr tossed aside the useless rattling frame of his own shield the energysapping screeching quarrel of blade on blade quickly drained his exhausted shoulders and yet mar still could not overpower him haraldr had expected no reprieve from odin but he thanked the oneeyed god for today withholding his favour from the craven mar haraldr allowed mar to drive him in a continuous circling retreat he hoped to tire him finally haraldr broke and turned and leapt to the ellwide wooden catwalk that ran along the ridge of the peaked roof of the imperial seating pavilion he walked steadily backwards to the very end of the precarious walkway the tiled roof sloped away to the stone seats fifty ells below mar looked down and hesitated then he advanced carefully haraldr swayed and looked over his shoulder at the drop he was certain he was losing his balance and he deliberately lunged forward so that he would not topple backward to his death his chest slapped to the catwalk and he clutched for his life he realized he had lost both his nerve and his sword haraldrs sword distantly rang against the steps mar walked steadily forward to the accompaniment of a gentle evil laugh he came close enough to sever the neck so neatly presented on this lofty scaffold norway said mar this is a fitting end to you nose to the ground he lifted his sword odin spits on you little coward haraldrs arm swiped out and caught mars boot and mars blade whirred past his face mar lifted a leg and milled his arms in a desperate effort to adjust his balance he pitched sideways and haraldr was able to raise himself to a crouch he had time to nod knowingly to the astonished blue eyes before mar fell on his back onto the tiles and began sliding to the cornice of the roof now mars sword chinged against the stone below his legs were already over the cornice before he was able to turn onto his stomach his momentum continued to pull him down his icy eyes glimmered as his head disappeared his huge hands clutched for the cornice his hands did not disappear mar clung to the lip of the cornice like a strange human banner arms outstretched his entire body suspended in the void haraldr knelt on the catwalk and waited he glanced to the north and saw that the blue stars army had captured the highest tiers of the stadium the seats beneath held an audience of corpses down on the track the guildsmen in neat ranks spear shafts held high began entering to reinforce the push into the palace they shouted their improvised oaths for a while and then grew silent as they turned their attention to the curious drama high above them haraldr could hear his own steady exhalations eventually every head in the stadium was directed to the roof of the imperial seating pavilion and still mars hands did not move from the cornice the sound was like no human sound the last dragon its black entrails ripped out so that the corpses it had devoured could bellow their dying rage mars hands flexed and his knuckles surged haraldr watched as the head no longer mars but the wolfs the dragons his complexion as dark as a dead mans blood rose slowly above the cornice mars mighty arms propelled his entire torso above the roofline he swung his leg over the cornice the demon had climbed back from the abyss and the favour of odin was on his face haraldr was beyond terror mars eyes had turned red as if washed in blood haraldr was drawn to them with dreadful fascination lured as he had been by abelas mar was a destiny that could not be killed jump growled mar in the spitting voice of the beast jump before i tear out your throat with my teeth jump mar crawled slowly up the perilous tiled incline as if now even gravity was subject to his rage he was almost able to reach out and grab the catwalk when he began to slip back again no no bellowed halldor he watched in horror as haraldr extended his hand to mar fighting broke out as mars men blocked halldor and ulfr from reaching the catwalk mars grip was like a thunderbolt and haraldr knew that odin had sent mar back to settle the question he could not live or die without answering he pulled mar up to the catwalk they both rose from their crouch mar stood an ell away and his breath was as foul as the slime of a carrion eater his entire face twitched as if hundreds of strings had been attached to his skin by some demonic puppet master his trembling hands reached for haraldrs neck at the coldest infinite core of his being haraldr acknowledged the bargain he had long ago made with fate he lunged for mar clutched his arms around his byrnnied girth and lifted him off his feet mars hands clamped haraldrs throat and his windpipe collapsed and he knew that he would not breathe again in the middle realm until he and mar had settled what lay between them deep in the spirit world for an immeasurable heartbeat there was a profoundstillness as the two berserks flesh met on a plane where flesh did not exist haraldr was in the darkness entirely he could not even see the black flame blasting him to numbness he only knew that he at last held the dragon in his arms could feel the huge scaled beast throttling the last surge of life from his desperate pumping neck embrace that death the voice whispered the varangians watched in awe as the two giant berserks danced death their faces purple their eyes blooded with odins insane favour mars head arched back with the mad force of his grip and haraldrs knees sagged and then a crack a hideous muffled mortal crack the sound of will and bone breaking in concert mars face instantly blanched and his hands fell from haraldrs neck his head lolled and he went limp his back had been snapped like a twig haraldr felt the dragon burst into pure light he held that light for a moment as if embracing a dead comrade and then flung mar out into the void he watched the body fall away like some fading vision in a dream mar hit the stone seats far below with a wet melonsplitting sound haraldr walked off the catwalk the faces of halldor and ulfr were as chalky and wondering as mars dying visage who is in command now shouted haraldr to mars men gris knutson came forward his eyes frightened vacant haraldr jerked knutson up by the collar of his byrnnie knutsons feet barely grazed the pavement and his legs fluttered like a hanged mans this is over growled haraldr his voice still from the spirit world disarm your survivors and take them north on the next tide and tell the northlands that the king of norway is coming home and that he will sate the ravens with his vengeance haraldr parted the silent reverent ranks of his varangians and descended the siege ladders to the stadium mars body lay on the steps beneath the imperial box his fingers twitched and blood gushed from his mouth and pooled behind his head his eyes were almost icewhite a uniform colour to the delicate pale blue of his skin he still lived haraldr bent and whispered you did not die a coward in the valhol tonight tell the kings of norway the name of the champion who sent you as a sacrifice to them haraldr touched mars forehead gently almost as if consoling a child it was you who had my pledgeman asbjorn ingvarson killed wasnt it mars gory head tilted slightly forward yes haraldr took his hand away then we have settled between us the blood gurgled in mars throat almost as if he were laughing his words were whispered through pale red froth i left you a legacy king haraldr his purpled lips moved without speaking and his feet twitched haraldr stood descended to the track and left mar hunrodarson to die alone his last words if any heard only by the ears of immortal stone father the augusta theodora rushed forward and kissed the patriarch alexiuss jewelled hands father she stood speechless blood visibly pumping into her pale cheeks unable to ask all the desperate questions that had been running through her mind alexius made the sign of the cross at her forehead and then uncharacteristically gently stroked her braided brown hair he had never looked more defeated in his rough woollen cloak his face virtually the colour of penitential ashes his pacing eyes now exhausted wounded gravely he looked like the survivor of a shipwreck my child he said quietly we may never see another day like this father i was not even certain you were still that you were safe after what we heard yesterday alexius stared at the beige plaster walls of theodoras temporary refuge in the church of st mary chalkoprateia the mother church has withstood the assault of the mad heretic michael the siege of the hagia sophia was lifted half an hour ago when the forces that had imprisoned me were called away to counter a greater threat alexius shook his head wearily i confess that the effluence of love and support for your sister has been a revelation to me she has raised all rome against the demon theodora wrapped her arms tightly around her torso as if she were on the verge of doubling over with pain father is she alexius smiled as thinly as a dying man mocking himself your sister is safe i have been told that the mad heretic brought her back to the palace this morning no doubt to save his own skin from the wrath of her people theodora seemed to breathe in the news of her sisters deliverance her torso straightened and her small pained face became fierce and punitive father you must know now that i cannot do it i have suffered the agonies of the damned just knowing that my sister might be father last night father i do not know if my sister still loves me but nothing in my heart can make me betray her now if our lord had wanted me to make that sacrifice he would not have put so much love for her in the hearts of her people or in my heart alexius was too weak to resist his black eyes lay still of course my child i am returning you to your home immediately i too believe our lord has asked us to consider another means of defending our spiritual empire alexius paused and touched his fine silver beard as if to ascertain that he still possessed corporeal form mar hunrodarson betrayed us that does not surprise me i had reasoned that in such an event we could still deal with him but he turned against his fellow varangians now i am told that he has been defeated in a great battle that took place in the hippodrome this morning he broke his sword and ours in the defence of a usurper who never could have been legitimized i can only assume that hunrodarson believed that he could place his own barbaroi feet in the imperial buskins i knew that the emperor was mad i had no idea that hunrodarson shared his affliction alexius again stroked theodoras hair my secular sword no longer exists and your sisters sword the love of her people is a vastly more formidable blade than i had ever imagined you have made your sacrifice for myself and for our lord my child now you may return to the mansion your lord intended for you theodora nodded if i may father i would like to stay here until all this is resolved my sister again the weak moribund smile certainly child alexius broke off but did not turn to the insistent pounding on the door finally theodora crossed the room and cracked open the heavy wooden door the priest burst into the room his woollen hood flung back glimmering slices of his white silk vestments visible under his dull brown cloak his face was brilliant with exertion father this could not wait he handed alexius a small parchment alexius received the missive with indifference his long elegant fingers fumbled with the parchment his eyes were so dull as he read that it seemed he was only staring at some design and then almost miraculously he returned to life but not even lazarus had returned so quickly or vehemently his face a moment earlier as grey and coarse as weathered stone became flesh again his eyes flickered awakening rested eager he clutched the parchment in a powerful fist perhaps our lord has merely divined to test our faith father theodora was clearly frightened by the patriarchs resurrection the eyes offered no mercy my child the situation has changed you must now prepare yourself for your climb to golgotha theodora flinched but did not retreat father i will not the crown of thorns i must wear is my love for my sister and i will never remove that crown no matter how painful it has become theodoras lips set grimly and her eyes were like bits of lapis lazuli father i will not do it i will not do it she squared her broad shoulders as if preparing for a physical confrontation do you think you can chain me and drag me screaming to the ambo and place the imperial diadem upon my writhing head alexius was stunned into silent acquiescence perhaps his ordeal had left him irreparably weakened perhaps he had always known that his protege would someday challenge his strength he looked away from theodora and walked slowly to the simple oaken cupboard a pair of goldframed icons had been set on the top shelf both depicted the virgin one was an intricate cloisonne a surface of vivid colours and fine gold striations the other a faded encaustic many centuries old alexius looked between the two images for a long while his palms pressed together and fingers touching the tip of his powerful humped nose finally he turned my child would you be agreeable to sharing your sisters holy burden if you will not i fear that both your sister and the roman empire will soon be lost what has happened father i am not yet certain that is why i must know what you are prepared for me to offer in your name yes i will share the throne with her if it is necessary to save her and to save rome alexius made the sign of the cross three times and without another word strode urgently from the room the future of rome had been drawn in the sands of the hippodrome haraldr stood over the hastily sketched campaign map at his side were the cocommanders of the citizen army of rome john the leather cutter and the blue star john had a bloody gash over his forehead but his eyes blazed with triumph his guildsmen had taken the chalke gate with the help of some khazar defectors john pointed to the small square that indicated the numera where michaels pecheneg guard was quartered i have left my bakers and grocers to harass the pechenegs when should i give them the signal for the afternoon attack haraldr looked around the stadium ulfr and halldor and the rest of his varangians now stood where mars men had that morning on the commanding vantage of the imperial box ready for the final massive assault on the imperial palace the blue star had removed her wounded from the stadium steps and the ranks of the guildsmen and the army of the studion had reassembled on the track they were already going over the chants they would sing when they had the usurper michael before them in chains he realized that there was no reason to wait and in an awful way he wanted to wait because he knew in his soul that when he entered the palace he would find the answer to the question that now pierced his being and if fate had answered him with marias death her life for his then fate would have killed them both haraldr ulfrs voice boomed down from the imperial box he waved behind ulfr were the luminous white robes of the palace chamberlains the eunuchs rapidly filled the imperial box and stood at attention as they might on a race day the army on the track below looked up and erupted with speculation had the emperor michael come to capitulate a few moments later the solitary blackshrouded figure appeared against the wall of the whiterobed eunuchs in the imperial box her head was veiled in a black nuns hood her eyes black holes her face aged decades in days only the voice proved that this ancient woman was zoe the purpleborn empress and augusta of the romans my children proclaimed zoe her words brought an absolute silence to the huge throng beneath her i am well i have not been harmed my son your emperor and father and i have quarrelled between us as a mother and her son are wont to do he has taken actions in his anger that he has now repented of i am satisfied of his sincere contrition he has promised that he will respect the dignity of your purpleborn mother as long as he wears the imperial diadem he has sworn to do penance to the people of the city with distributions of food entertainments remission of certain taxes and a lifting of the prefects profit ceiling for the guilds i have taken your father michael to my bosom and forgiven him now i beseech my children to show him their forgiveness for love of me zoe stepped back and made the sign of the cross over her people the first reaction was applause from some of the guildsmen particularly the small merchants who would most benefit from the lifting of the profit ceiling someone in the studion ranks shouted that is not our mother she is an impostor that is no impostor said the blue star her eyes stricken she has been coerced there are knives at her back a more dangerous coercion i fear said haraldr a coercion of the heart i think she wants to avoid further bloodshed said john if she is willing to guarantee these reforms we have no further quarrel with the emperor he was good to us before all this and now that he has brought our mother back john shrugged you would abandon her to them while you go back to your salted fish and vlach cheese snapped the blue star she whipped her powerful arm and pointed at the terrible litter on the seats behind her at least a thousand lay dead we did not die here so that the tyrant could imprison our mother in his palace and appease the guildsmen with more races in the hippodrome where so many have now died you have not seen the dead at the chalke gate woman johns swarthy face darkened if this bloodshed is no longer necessary it must end if your cutthroats desire more blood let them prey on their own cutpurses and whores the two factions slowly gathered around their leaders and began their own chorus to this argument we were not whores when we slew men shouted a woman standing behind the blue star rabble cursed the guildsmen sluts and thieves haraldr watched the two sides converge from the ends of the track it was as if they were two roiling cloud masses about to collide as a thunderous storm ulfr halldor he shouted to the stadium roof bring the men down he turned to mediate but could not make himself heard the factions shrieked at one another and scuffling broke out haraldr broke up one fight only to have another and then another flare up around him he prayed his men could get down here before the first death a combined assault on the palace was impossible now but a civil war in the city was not unlikely fists cracked into faces haraldr saw bright blood again and it sickened him more than all the days carnage he fought desperately to keep men apart a guildsman fell howling clutching his stomach and then the shrieks of conflict subsided slowly and men and women paused still clutching their adversaries cloaks the fallen guildsman moaned haraldr looked over the heads of the crowd towards the bronze starting gates at the north end of the stadium the army of the studion was parting to allow the army of yet another roman empire pass among it mounted on his donkey in emulation of christ flanked by scores of his priests in whiteandgold vestments himself a jewelled icon in the billowing robes of his office the patriarch alexius rode among his flock the donkey blinked his gentle gaze a pointed contrast to the equally dark and feral but far more deadly eyes of his master alexius was assisted from the saddle by his deacons he studied haraldr john and the blue star silently for a moment he spoke first to haraldr is it true that mar hunrodarson is dead haraldr nodded alexius turned away and faced his flock your mother has borne the cares of her people for many years now his voice thundered and echoed through the stadium now she is weary of her travails she is too exhausted to revoke the sanction she has granted to her treacherous son the ranks of the studion murmured assent and yet she is not the only purpleborn daughter who can offer alexius paused meaningfully and his voice roared or revoke that sanction the purpleborn augusta theodora daughter of the autocrator constantine and niece of the autocrator basil called the bulgarslayer also carries the blood of macedon in her veins she is willing to sacrifice the life she cherishes that of contemplation to share with her sister the burden of caring for her children would you deny yourselves a love this generous the folk of studion erupted into spontaneous acclaim theodora theodora purpleborn mother john and his guildsman lieutenants considered the matter at greater length their informal caucus reflected on the succession of men zoe had brought to the throne of imperial rome they decided that a prosperity hostage to zoes whims was a false security theodora would stabilize the throne john brought his arms up and began to lead the guildsmen in a chant theodora theodora haraldr shouted to the patriarch father what of michael alexius looked at haraldr with his glaring panther eyes then pulled haraldrs shoulders down so that he could speak in his ear by the sanction of the purpleborn zoe my hand placed the imperial diadem on his head under command of the purpleborn theodora that diadem will now be plucked from his skull haraldr nodded and listened to the chants for the tyrant michael it was finished and yet for him it had only begun where was maria that porcine sot michael crumpled the message and glared at his uncle this is gratitude his voice was highpitched and whiny i have provided these luxuryloving monks with typica so generous that they are all but a licence to plunder and not one of them will come to my assistance during a period of transient difficulty i tell you uncle when my throne is again secure there shall be a wholesale redrafting of these typica and i can assure you that many of these fatted monks will be as lean as desert goats when i am through with them michael fanned away a silkrobed chamberlain with an impatient hand reject the offer we will remain here and weather this outburst constantine mopped his brow with a delicate linen handkerchief majesty i do not think it wise for us to remain in the palace mar hunrodarson is dead haraldr nordbrikt is even now negotiating the surrender of the scholae and excubitores of the imperial taghmata and the augusta theodora is already in the hagia sophia michael stared sourly at his purple boots that driedup old thing uncle you cannot think she will depose me zoe will have her out of the palace before the day is over there is no love between those sisters the patriarch alexius seems bent on preserving his clients privileges this time michael leered over at his uncle the patriarch alexius is a satanic apostate you know that dont you the pantocrator will never receive him he is adamantly opposed to it the emperor straightened i still have the loyalty of the numeri and hyknatoi units of the imperial taghmata i will have them throw the unclean alexius out of our holy mansion he quite disgraces it and the bitch with him majesty constantine paused and accepted the dispatch from a chamberlain he read it quickly his face drawing taut with shock nephew he finally whispered the varangian haraldr nordbrikt has received the surrender of all units of the imperial taghmata michael shot up from his throne and kicked away the gilded stool at his feet nordbrikt nordbrikt it was his whore who tempted me to begin with nordbrikt michael stood glaring his chest surged wildly tell my pechenegs to destroy haraldr nordbrikt he screamed with neckcording rage nephew said constantine haraldr nordbrikt also requested the surrender of your pecheneg guard when they refused his varangians slaughtered them to the last man constantine walked forward and clasped michaels arms we must accept the offer of sanctuary michael was suddenly calm again introspective hearing other voices yes quite we must save our lives and await the collapse of this absurd coalition against us whom did you say had the charity to receive us the blessed brothers of the holy studite monastery majesty the lowering sun bored through the windows high above and projected great tunnels of light directly across the vast darkening interior of the hagia sophia the subdeacons and doorkeepers moved about on the arcades and soaring ambulatories beginning the lengthy ritual of lighting the bronze and silver candelabra lamps and polycandelons the augusta theodora clad in the purple robes of state was seated on a throne beneath the semidome at the west end of the nave the bejewelled diadem of the imperial augusta seemed like a piece of ornate architecture perched atop her small head the improvised court that knelt one by one in obeisance before her was unlike any rome had seen before the dignitaries were present in their robes of state and emblems of rank but the new empress was also attended by the people of the city guild members merchants the humble poor of the studion and women had been admitted to the floor of the great church as only befitted an empire that was now ruled by two sisters haraldr was one of the first presented to the new empress as alexius had wisely proscribed formal protocol during this acutely delicate time of transition after the ritual prostrations he knelt at theodoras feet and was offered her hand to kiss i know of you she told him in a flat faintly wry voice unlike her sister who had a face for pure pleasure set off by painravaged eyes theodora had melancholy features countered with flashing almost girlish eyes you want to take my maria away from me haraldr was weary hungry and he hoped that his plunging spirit did not register on his face where was maria all day he had sent runners out to comb the palace and each had returned with the same report no one had seen her even heard of her whereabouts and even if she was safe somewhere would he now need this empresss permission to take her to norway theodora laughed i will let her go she said but haraldr was not certain if she was sincere or merely placating him to another end theodora became serious again and haraldr identified the fear communicated by her small pinched mouth this seat is not the most comfortable she told him it is broad enough but not stable one expects to fall off at any moment haraldr nodded i need a man to steady it for me a strong and loyal man i know you have the firstmentioned quality maria says you are also the second she looked at him gently i am not asking you to stay by me for long my sister will marry again soon i hope to a man who can govern justly and then i will return to a more modest yet more secure perch haraldr was taken by her directness and apparent guilelessness though who could tell with these romans majesty he said i am more than willing to discuss a temporary service to your person and office but my strength is twined with another as you know and i do not even know her fate now can you help me theodoras wincing eyes convinced haraldr that his concern was shared i am looking for her as well but i am also looking for my sister i believe there may be the same solution to both riddles those two know places in this palace that have been forgotten for centuries theodora looked about uneasily at the representatives of her unlikely coalition i think maria is trying to mediate for me i pray she is because the success of this enterprise is still in grave doubt haraldr bowed overcome with mere hope but the idea of maria having gone to zoe if michael still held zoe under his sway was chilling as well fate had made this day too long he looked up at his new mother majesty i will serve you until such time as you feel this enterprise is no longer in doubt haraldr withdrew and was immediately accosted by a member of alexiuss staff the father wishes to see you said the priest an aggressivelooking young man who might have been a military officer except for his redandwhite vestments he led haraldr to the secondstorey gallery and then across the sumptuously carpeted walkway to the patriarchal offices in spite of his oppressive melancholy haraldr could not help but marvel at the richness of the arcades beneath which even ordinary officials worked and today they seemed to be working extraordinarily feverishly the walls sparkled with jewelled gilded and enamelled icons writing tables were surfaced in ivory veneer mosaics covered the spandrels of the arches after passing through a series of antechambers and sitting rooms as splendid as any in the emperors apartments haraldr was admitted to the most elegant dining chamber in new rome the vaulted room was octagonal with a gold dome three storeys above the floor the walls were carved with elaborate arched niches filled with white marble reliefs representing various saints alexius sat alone at the end of a table covered with a redandgold cloth he had removed his towering diadem but wore his usual encrustation of jewels and gold thread the patriarch gestured for haraldr to sit in a gilded backless chair opposite his own i know you like fish he said haraldr had no idea how alexius presumed to know this may i offer you some haraldr was famished and he nodded though alexius made him sufficiently uneasy to curb his appetite under ordinary circumstances almost immediately a servant set a silver plate embossed with a large chirho the monogram of the christ a second servant served the fish from a large golden platter and yet a third ladled the garos sauce from a silver pitcher haraldr had to restrain himself from shoving the entire fish into his mouth and swallowing it like a bear you are a christian asked alexius haraldr nodded and what is your church like in this norway haraldrs accelerating pulse registered the warning he needed to sharpen his wits for this exchange it is a christian church father but its bishops hew to the authority of the see of old rome and practise the latin creed do they not father you must understand that the christian faith is only a few decades old in my country and that i left home when i was too young to know that the christian faith had several factions alexiuss wiry eyebrows lowered there are no factions my son there is only the church the one true oecumenical orthodox and catholic faith and the schismatics who would deny the divinity of the christ alexius took a bite of fish and chewed it carefully then patted his elegant lips with his embroidered napkin an interesting rumour has emerged from the tumult of this day it is said that you are in fact the king of this land of norway haraldr dropped his fork in his plate father i have pledged my loyalty to the augusta as i have to all who have worn the imperial diadem at least all who have proved themselves worthy of that office alexius raised his hand my son i do not accuse you of treason you could have taken rome this morning had you that ambition yes there is always a great deal of concern about an invasion from the north and there are the prophecies as well i am sure you are quite weary of hearing them those are not my concerns i am only troubled by fairhaired christians who might embrace the latin creed and be led to eternal perdition by the pontiff of old rome alexius ruminated on another bite offish before continuing i would like to propose this to you the truth of your lineage is certain to become common knowledge indeed has already circulated fairly widely i will pledge to you that i will make certain that no consequence of any sort arises from these revelations you in turn must promise to me that when you return to rule your norway you will permit my priests to bring the one true faith among your people haraldr fought his numbness trying to tell himself that fate had offered another boon for the mere price of passage for a few priests he now had an immensely powerful ally who actually had an interest in seeing to his prompt return to norway but was this another mocking mask that destiny wore what would he return to without maria father he forced himself to reply i do not see how my people could but benefit from this instruction excellent said the patriarch he pushed his plate away and a servant immediately removed it we have girded ourselves for the eternal struggle now let us consider a conflict of a more immediate and temporal nature apprehension churned haraldrs hasty meal he realized that this man like fate made no easy bargains our position is currently very tenuous our factions are held together by the hope that the purpleborn sisters will rule jointly unfortunately zoe has not appeared before her people with an endorsement of her sister i fear that she may even have fled with michael and will attempt to rally her people to his cause i have the same fear father i now know where the tyrant has fled although i do not as yet know if zoe is with him or whether she has assisted his escape the emperor and his uncle are petitioning the monks of the holy studite monastery to accept them into their keeping i need not tell you that our emperors sudden piety will last only until he can arrive at some new scheme for seducing zoe to his purpose haraldr saw the awful dimensions of this bargain taking shape he remembered his strange covenant with michael on the ambo at the hagia sophia he forced himself to challenge alexiuss pacing eyes so if the tyrant is to be killed better that the deed be done by a man who has the support of the people yet represents no particular faction a varangian alexius did not humour haraldr with a smile i want you to perform an execution not of death however we are a christian nation blinding should be sufficient to render michaels vision harmless yes said haraldr i should like him to enjoy the fate he intended for me but have you considered that i might also have reason to kill him the matter of your betrothed i think he has been too busy with other worries to have harmed her and if he has as i say it would be better for our christian nation not to be tainted with the blood of the pantocrators viceregent on earth and of course the boys death might unduly prejudice zoe against our cause though the empress has displayed a remarkable capacity to embrace life again after the deaths of her previous lovers alexius paused and then uncaged his menacing black eyes let me offer you this king haraldr if i may call you that it is not unknown for the sentence of blinding to wound a man so severely that he dies shortly afterwards sometimes within the very hour but in that case the sentence of death would have been pronounced and executed by the heavenly tribunal and not by this corrupt flesh here below the first shadows of twilight painted the mese a melancholy purple tint clouds in neat cobbled formations crept across the sky from the north cold gusts stinging with dust ripped along the filthy side streets and swirled to meet the horsemen head on as they turned southeast towards the golden gate haraldr had taken only halldor and ulfr on this ugly journey whether one believed that kings were descended from gods or were simply endowed on earth with the sanction of god the killing of a king was a challenge to the gods the horsemen passed four men and a woman running south their coarse tunics were whipped by the wind the citizens cheered the varangians as they galloped past michael michael upside down they shouted their words fading behind the flying horses at least you offer him mercy halldor shouted into the wind the citizens want to chain him upside down to a column and take him apart piece by piece let us hope they have not already shouted haraldr we confront the gods in this let us not profane them as well the avenue quarterturned to the east and the three varangians rode between ageing but clean tenements people stood on the balconies and cheered as they passed it was almost as if they were waiting for the emperor in procession and perhaps they were the groups on the street increased in size as the varangians approached the sigma a marginal district on the borders of the festering studion wellkept tenements rose next to gutted wooden shells some of the shuttered shops and inns had signs with bright new paint while other arcades gaped dark and empty and drew packs of dogs vegetable gardens grew in the cleared lots the rushing crowds had new verses to their ditty recounting their successful assault of the palace one group still carried their spears and hollered haraldr haraldr emperor slayer near the west end of the sigma the mese ran directly through a broad poorly kept park noxious grit howling up from the studion filled the air with a dull sandy haze and obscured the spring verdancy of the vast lawn haraldr called for halldor and ulfr to slow he lowered his head to blink away the scouring grit when he had cleared his eyes he squinted obliquely into the wind an enormous crowd was spilling into the park from the west end the vanguard of this throng their individual features blurred by the haze danced in rough circles and chanted raucous ditties the crowd surged forward and soon surrounded the three varangians they cheered the norsemen furiously and sang a fractured verse about haraldr sending the hated mar off as a messenger pigeon to his emperor but that this bird had failed to take wing the prostitutes who had fought in the morning had painted their faces again and came forward and kissed the varangians legs and offered them a lifetime of gratis pleasures the cutpurses and petty thieves had exchanged their spears for wine bags and sang and hopped about with flushed faces and winestained teeth and chins a chorus of preening thugs battled forward for an impromptu performance michael stuck it in zoe he stuck it in us now well stick it in his mouth they shouted with appropriately obscene gestures haraldr wished the blue star was not back at the hagia sophia her people had become a mob now as intoxicated with their power as michael had been with his haraldr pushed on towards the vortex of the celebration he was relieved to find that the centre of this storm was relatively calm more responsible men wearing the threadbare but clean linen tunics of the labourers who worked honestly to rise above the squalor of the studion moved along with controlled malice in their eyes they paused when they saw haraldr as if awaiting his authority in whatever matter they were about and stood respectfully away from his horse a young man in an official silk robe got through and anxiously confronted the varangians haraldr recognized him michael psellus a young hellenistic scholar and imperial secretary who had not had a hand in michaels crimes sir called up psellus the mob has driven them from the holy studite monastery they mean to rip their very limbs apart psellus unlike such presumptuous hellenes as senator scylitzes was a man of true learning but panic had clearly overcome his usually carefully considered attic eloquence the varangians dismounted where is the emperor psellus asked haraldr the labourers stepped aside as psellus preceded the varangians into their midst masses of men women and children continued to flood into the park and already the crowd was so enormous that the distant outer perimeter was masked in choking ochre dust haraldr was rendered numb by the apparitions at the very epicentre of the whirlwind he recognized constantine though the nobilissimus had exchanged his purple robes for the sackcloth of a monk constantine looked defiantly at haraldr his carehollowed countenance so much like his brother joanness that haraldr was momentarily startled into thinking that some monstrous transmutation had taken place there was nothing left of the emperor autocrator and basileus of the romans the boy who stood next to constantine was beardless his dark curls shorn like a novitiates michaels head bowed his shoulders trembled and he whimpered like a wounded dog his entire body seemed drawn in as if fear had eaten away his internal organs they have petitioned to take the vows said psellus can you appeal to the crowd to spare them and allow them to return to their sanctuary haraldr looked at the young scholar and realized that for all his classical erudition there were things that psellus could learn from even the sotted derelicts of the studion and how long would michael and constantine wait to discard these monastic robes and take up their former purple when this danger has passed psellus collected himself and nodded of course it is simply that to see the power of our glorious empire degraded in this way moves me to compassion and such spectacles can only inflame a lust for rebellion among the people what are your orders haraldr showed psellus the order signed by theodora commanding him to blind both michael and constantine i think that sentence will assuage their lust said psellus i also think you had better show that order to them psellus gestured to the crowding labourers haraldr nodded his estimate of pselluss wisdom rapidly rising he passed the order among the labourers as the purpletinted document circulated they began to voice agreement yes that is just theodora is right in this michaels head lifted i will carry my cross haraldr looked into the eyes he had been sent to destroy he suffered these scourges as well he wants me to carry my cross as he did what what michaels words were barely distinguishable above the clamour of the mob he is completely mad thought haraldr will he even remember maria majesty said haraldr evenly afraid that a stern tone might precipitate a hysteria from which no answers would be forthcoming where is maria michael stared into the void only he occupied with my marys he cocked his head they dont like her even the magdalen repented no i have rather decided that white mary will be my mother haraldr was chilled almost beyond hope the nature of the sentence theodora had pronounced sizzled through the crowd like liquid fire evidently few in the outer circles approved of the new empresss leniency michael michael upside down came the thundering chants death to the tyrant skin him crown his arse michael clutched haraldr with clawlike hands nordbrikt what can the bitches offer you that i cannot his eyes were suddenly brilliant and aware together we will conquer the earth from the pillars of heracles to the gates of dionysus they will call you the macedonian after alexander you will have a hundred tributary kingdoms and a thousand marys you have proved yourself worthy i have tested you nordbrikt and you alone are the man who can bring these victories to rome rule with me nordbrikt you the autocrator i the caesar my father in heaven sanctions it haraldr clutched michaels shoulders and the emperor recoiled with pain and fear where is maria michael collapsed to his knees oh father he wailed oh father he pounded the earth father you have forsaken me oh holy spirit smite my foes michael tore at the sparse clumps of grass and tossed handfuls of dust and chaff in the air my father why have you forsaken me he wailed hysterically his shorn boys face livid with distress his eyes luminous with tears that left dusty tracks on his face he sobbed and then shrieked i cannot forgive them and neither could you dont lie to me dont lie to me you always lied didnt you you are satan you are satan you tricked me the crowd surged inward and the vortex compressed constantine was pushed into haraldr oh lord have mercy on us sinners constantine sobbed the crowd hurled oaths wildly skin them cut their throats death to the tyrant death death haraldr remembered marias description of her dream in every chilling detail she had the gift and yet fate did not always obey her death to the tyrant shouted the mob again and again the sun had set and there was a final coppery tint in the thickening swirling dust you must act shouted psellus in a moment the mob will have its way that lust must never be consummated or all rome will perish in its heat halldor held up the sharpened spikes and looked grimly at haraldr psellus is right you must act now if you wish to spare them constantine clutched haraldrs arm his grip firm and his face now resolute you he commanded haraldr please order these people to stand back i will show you how a man of ability bears his calamity haraldr pushed the labourers away and cleared a space for constantine to lie down constantine sat on the scoured dusty turf haraldr signalled to halldor and ulfr to lay him down flat and hold his arms and legs securely if he moved about he might be wounded even more severely constantine looked up at haraldr his eyes spitting their final rage look you if you see me so much as budge then you may nail me down haraldr motioned halldor and ulfr away and constantine reclined with trembling determination haraldr begged the forgiveness of the gods as he straddled him kneeling constantine convulsed then became still he made no appeal for mercy the emperor beside him bellowed incoherently like a sacrificial calf pounded his fists together and then began to strike himself in the face haraldr worked quickly he pressed the right eyeball to one side of the socket jabbed it firmly with the sharpened spike and the sight flowed out in a glutinous serum he took the left eye and stood up constantine rose with him and psellus helped hold the blind man up i do not fear the darkness said constantine to that darkness please spare me nordbrikt satan lied to me he said he was the pantocrator i let them live he wanted me to kill them but i let them live michael spat as he screamed satan has fouled me the true pantocrator will have to cleanse me michael threw his arms around haraldrs knees and clung to him trembling with spastic fury father the pantocrator must cleanse me i must live to be cleansed my mothers must cleanse me mother oh mother oh mother oh holy father let me live so that i may be cleansed michaels pleas only inflamed the surging lust of the crowd and haraldr forced him to the ground in the tiny space cleared by halldor and ulfr he pressed heavily on michaels chest compressing his lungs so that he could no longer cry out michaels legs and arms continued to twitch madly haraldr lowered his face to the already unseeing eyes i will let you live he said if you will tell me where maria is reason flew over michaels face like the shadow of a passing bird oh holy father let me live he said raspily i do not need my sight to repent in the pure light of your being he blinked again and his dark eyes saw for the last time i did not harm her she is with zoe michael strained forward and focused on haraldr this was arranged for us was it not in the mother church that day haraldr nodded yes i too felt it michaels head fell back and he awaited fate some day a king will show you mercy he whispered haraldr brought the spike down twice swiftly but carefully to destroy the ravens reflection in the dying sight of michael kalaphates haraldr helped michael to his feet and constantine reached out for his nephew the former rulers of rome were guided to each others arms and they embraced in a darkness they alone could share the noise of the crowd receded outwards from the vortex fading like the denouement of some vast orchestration the wind was audible again a harsh scouring sound as it buried the twilight in a shroud of dust silently the great crush of people fell away recoiling more with fear than satiation from the evidence of destinys implacable hand they retreated through the shadowed borders of the park and left michael and constantine to the soughing empty night yet no sooner had the crowd vanished than a new chant began a haunting ascent from the surrounding city rising to confront the swirling wind theodora theodora children children pleaded alexius the weight of all of you will collapse your mother church as many of your brothers and sisters as this sacred roof can shelter have been admitted let them be your eyes and the purpleborn daughters of the pantocrator will appear to you soon to bless you for your forbearance the crowd let loose a thunderous acclamation and halted its menacing surge against the west facade of the hagia sophia haraldr looked out from beneath the arches of the narthex he stood just behind the patriarch the area encompassing the porch portico and garden in front of the church was a blackandgold tapestry of flaming tapers the gradually diminishing pinpoints of light filled the augustaion and ascended the mese towards the forum of constantine the entire city had come to welcome its mothers alexius turned to haraldr and asked him to precede him through the mob that had squeezed into the narthex the faces that blocked the way were a cross section of the great city dirtyhaired labourers a puffyfaced silkgarbed merchant scented bureaucrats even a beggar crawling with lice these heads lowered deferentially and the bodies tried to move respectfully back but the crowd was so dense that they could scarcely move and haraldr had to bull through with the patriarch tucked in behind him the immense circular candelabra floated with galactic splendour beneath the lightwreathed dome glowing stringcourses of candles and oil lamps ran along every cornice and ledge the floor was a solid mass of people and the towering secondlevel arcades were filled with entire populations the carved balustrades of the narrow walkways above the arcades seemed on the verge of giving way beneath the weight of the people squeezed behind them the slender stone ledges in front of the railings were perches for hundreds who clung precariously to the intricate grills the people had even found their way to the catwalk that encircled the base of the hemispherical central dome and hung in even more perilous positions more than a dozen storeys above the heads of their fellow citizens it was only a matter of time before someone plunged into the crowd theodora flanked by her chamberlains stood on the silver roof of the ambo directly beneath the central dome she was attired in the same purpleandgold robes and ponderous diadem she had worn throughout the afternoon haraldr pushed through the crowd and after an arduous journey delivered alexius to the marble staircase of the ambo alexius motioned for haraldr to come up the steps behind him theodoras lips puckered with fatigue and fear she looked gratefully at alexius and then haraldr as they stepped onto the roof beside her alexius stood next to her and motioned to haraldr to stand directly behind the empress so close that he could have embraced her the glittering pearlanddiamond lappets that coursed over theodoras ears trembled slightly reflecting the agitation of their wearer i must acclaim you said alexius they are growing impatient no said theodora her voice slightly tremulous wait another half hour i know she will come alexius looked out at the sea of expectant faces i will delay for a half hour he said then i must and pray that our holy fathers sanction can overcome your sisters enmity he steeped back from theodora and pulled haraldr aside you have been through the city and dealt with the factions what is your assessment the poor folk will accept theodora alone the guild and trade factions expect to acclaim both empresses said haraldr grimly if they are not both presented here tonight the factions will turn on one another the guildsmen are already rumbling their threats haraldr pointed to the varangians who ringed the base of the ambo i am certain my men can escort the empress safely to your apartments but we will have to stain our swords with the blood of this mornings comrades and profane the floors of this holy place and by tomorrow morning there will be a fullscale civil war in the streets of the city even my men and the taghmata will not be able to quell the violence rome will be destroyed alexius blanched slightly but his eyes did not flinch from haraldrs forecast yes he nodded gravely you are quite astute you will be an able king his eyes slowly swept the huge church i will wait as long as i can then i must acclaim her better that we please half of these than no one at all the half hour passed beneath the blazing lights where is zoe shouted a guildsman near the ambo the cry was taken up briefly zoe zoe the poor folk countered with theodora theodora give us our empress a fight broke out just beneath the ambo and halldors shoulders cleaved the crowd as he waded in to separate the combatants at the back of the church another scuffle erupted and began to spread soon there was a twentyperson brawl just in front of the narthex the shouting became general and many of the people on the catwalks and arcades leaned over and shook their fists we are losing the moment god has given us said alexius he stepped forward children of god the patriarchs voice ran through the domes he made the sign of the cross and the crowd quieted where is zoe shouted someone defiantly the shoving near the narthex resumed a roar came from within the narthex haraldr realized that the violence was probably much more ferocious outside the church now the mob outside was forcing its way in he sickened at the thought of killing these people the pressure of the crowd outside surged against those inside and they began to fall to the marble floor in successive waves haraldr shouted to halldor to ready a boar to carry theodora to safety the roaring from outside continued forget the acclamation we only have time to save her shouted haraldr to alexius haraldr took theodoras bony elbow and urged her towards the steps no theodora shook her arm loose and stood stiffly her head erect they will have to carry me from this place haraldr looked desperately at alexius the cost of the empresss safety was rising with every oath the crowd uttered alexius shook his head helplessly haraldr turned towards the narthex the crowd had quieted and those who had fallen remained prone without struggling to rise the imperial diadem and purpleandgold robes glittered beneath the massive pediment of the churchs main door the empress and augusta zoe stepped through the prostrate forms of her subjects with the grace of a dancer behind zoe walked the mistress of the robes in a celestial whiteandgold scaramangium marias blue eyes were visible even across half the vast nave her pearlwreathed head never dipped to observe her feet despite the awkward path she always looked directly at the ambo theodoras slender shoulders heaved once and she gasped with relief and joy alexius made the sign of the cross and his terrible eyes enjoyed an instant of triumph before they focused on the unseen foe he was now girded to meet zoe ascended the stairs of the ambo in a silence so absolute that haraldr could hear the click of her pearled hem against the marble steps her face was heavily masked with paint and powder but her reddened shrouded eyes betrayed both the terror of the last few days and the emotion of the moment her gaze swept quickly past her sister and alexius as she mounted the ambo and turned to her people maria looked steadily at haraldr as she came to the top of the steps and there was much as passion in her glistening eyes and faintly twitching lips as he had ever known when he had held her naked in his arms then she turned bowed to theodora and the patriarch and stood between the two sisters zoe looked down on her stillprostrate subjects augusta theodora she said without looking at her sister i offer you the equal share of my office and my throne not equal augusta zoe said theodora her face brilliant with emotion you have precedence i acknowledge that and you are free to marry if you wish and place an emperor above us both i owe you that much zoes breast surged and she blinked rapidly her sensual lips trembled naked with emotion i have missed you she whispered theodora turned to zoe with abrupt artless sincerity for a moment it seemed her precarious crown would topple tears moistened her dry red cheeks sister she whispered zoe turned sister she said her eyes welling they confronted each other for a moment and then stepped forward and embraced maria came to haraldrs side the last time he had seen her she had been disguised as a hideous crone now he had never seen her more beautiful her eyes more supernaturally radiant she grazed his sleeve with her finger he thought his knees would buckle with the intoxication of that mere contact i love you she whispered as the sisters continued to exchange caresses and their own intimacies i could not send word to you symeon and i hid all night we were able to get zoe away from michael and have spent the rest of the day persuading her we knew that everything depended on it it did whispered haraldr it seems that today you and i with considerable help have given rome a new fate yes i wonder if that is the destiny we have so often felt in each others arms perhaps the only destiny i am concerned with now is the one that places you in my arms tonight tears beaded marias fine dark lashes and she touched haraldrs sleeve again rise up rome alexiuss voice resounded through the domes and the crowd seemed to stand as one rise up and welcome the light of the world rise up and welcome the purpleborn majesties the empress and augusta zoe and the empress and augusta theodora long life to zoe and theodora thundered the crowd over and over again an acclamation of such pounding resonance that haraldr actually looked up to make certain that the groaning walls still supported the immense domes alexius made the sign of the cross and held his hands over the heads of the empresses to symbolize that they had both received the crown from the hands of the pantocrator the chants continued for some time after a while theodora beckoned maria embraced her and bade her stay at her side the three women looked from one to the other their faces jubilant haraldr studied the three faces with his own joy there seemed to be a magic about them not just the beauty of two of the women or the spectacle of the imperial raiment but something much more familiar the charmed way their pearllike teeth flashed as they smiled and whispered close to each others ears the sense that something more profound than even fate had brought them together he remembered how maria had said that zoe and theodora were both her mothers that thought prompted a strange shift in his vision almost as if he had removed a distorting glass from his eyes suddenly he could see something he had not noticed before because he had never thought to notice it he had long since forgotten how much alike maria and zoe had appeared to him the first time he had seen them together and yet now with zoes very different sister present he was struck by the subtle similarities between all three of them a certain line to the mouth the structure of the bones around the eyes they were as much alike as a daughter and haraldr felt a cold finger trace up his back and he realized that destiny had not yet finished its game with him marias parents he was now certain had not merely been friends of zoe and theodora one of them most likely marias mother had shared the same purple blood x duck halldor gestured to the imperial chamberlain the varangians are eating the duck he explained to the desperatelooking eunuch he pointed to the other end of the long table the senators are dining on pork the harried chamberlain hissed a flurry of new directions to the servants the suckling pig that the servants had tried to serve halldor was hurriedly transported directly in front of the everregenerate senator and proconsular patrician romanus scylitzes large grilled ducks were placed on silver platters in front of halldor ulfr and hord stefnirson halldor politely told the hovering eunuch that the varangians would carve their own meat the tablecloth fluttered in the strong dry september wind the weight of the imperial eagles embroidered in gold thread kept the fabric from being whipped away in the occasional gusts the sun was brilliant and the sky as clear as blue porcelain where is haraldr asked ulfr nodding to the empty place setting next to halldor he is working on another petition said halldor ulfr rolled his eyes i hope this one works in another month it will be too late to start out we will have to wait until next spring and by then we may be too fat to move senator scylitzes stood and began a celebration of the demideified achillean virtues of the new emperor constantine monomachus whom zoe had taken as her husband only two months after the deposition of michael kalaphates according to court gossip constantine monomachus had been one of zoes lovers during her first marriage to the emperor romanus the monomach as he was known was virtually everything the imperial court valued in an emperor he was handsome graceful in his movements charming and adept in his speech and an able military commander but the august imperial dignitaries had quickly discovered one particularly egregious flaw in their new emperor the monomach preferred coarse companions innkeepers merchants and professional loungers many of whom he had promoted to senatorial rank immediately after receiving the diadem and sceptre of his office and many of whom were now seated at the end of table utterly ignoring scylitzess endless discourse as they played with their food knives and a wooden court ball that they casually lobbed across the table in curious concert to the rhythm of scylitzess sentences does that man ever shut up asked hord in disbelief senator scylitzes has received a suitable reward for his remarkable adaptability said halldor he succeeded in rescuing his fortune from the mob in which he was more fortunate than many of his dhynatoi comrades but scylitzes who once would not have deigned to walk on the same side of the street as an honest merchant must now acknowledge as his colleagues some of the foremost rascals of the lower mese notice how they appreciate the senators attic eloquence a group of masons walked by pallets of thin clay bricks loaded on their backs does the emperor usually go to these lengths to inspect a building project asked hord halldor laughed the table at which they sat had been set up in a large open yard behind a fairly modest town house just northeast of the forum of constantine the busy masons were laying a foundation for a considerable annex to the house an expansion twice as big as the original structure for this particular building he does said halldor the emperor is particularly interested in inspecting some equipment in the existing house hord understood who is she her name is sclerena she is the niece of the emperors first wife they have a touchingly intimate relationship hord shook his head so he goes to all this trouble telling us that he is inspecting this highly important construction project and sets this table and serves us whatever we wish so we wont grumble while he ploughs his niece and he has only been married for three months the chamberlain appeared at the head of the table and cleared his throat sirs mistress sclerena sends you a small token of her esteem for her emperors guardsmen and senators a dozen young women in diaphanous white tunics pranced into the yard and began a sensuous whirling dance this sclerena is apparently a very clumsy builder said halldor i am beginning to think that this construction here will require frequent inspection and supervision hord and ulfr laughed and joined the newly minted senators in pounding a rhythm on the table some of the dancers had already begun to leap onto the table when haraldr appeared and stood at his place setting he was dressed in the robe of the hetairarch the office he had agreed to assume temporarily for zoes new husband beside haraldr resting on the tabletop at the level of his hip was a pudgy apparently disembodied head the head made a few ridiculous faces and then sprang onto the table propelled by the suddenly revealed squat body of a dwarf the dwarf sprinted the length of the table pausing along the way to swat the rumps of two dancers he halted dramatically in front of scylitzes and made motions as if drawing out his own tongue he turned his rear end to the senator and made loud farting sounds then sped off as if propelled by his feigned flatulence he lay beneath the legs of one of the dancers and stuck his tongue out obscenely finally the dwarf leapt off the table and ran into sclerenas house who was that asked a stunned ulfr that is theodocranus the dwarf said haraldr he was a famous buffoon in adrianopolis and promises to succeed here as well halldor looked down at the senators who were still in hysterics over the diminutive clown and were already emulating a few of his more vulgar gestures with the dancers i believe he already has said halldor wryly this theodocranus the dwarf is likely to be our next senator how do you know him he doesnt seem like one of marias friends he is my petitioner haradlr folded his arms and smiled smugly what ulfr groaned now we will be forced to stay here but in the numera prison instead of the numera barracks so you think said haraldr confidently i believe the emperor will find theodocranus a man of exceptional eloquence this statement was greeted with incredulous head shaking and haraldr sat down to share his insight i have observed that the emperor hates dealing with anyone who reveals any kind of serious intent if a minister comes to him with a wellconceived plan to drive the seljuks out of taron theme the monomach will scowl and throw that minister out before he can finish the introduction to his discourse but send a onelegged comic in there to stutter the latest banter from the marketplace and the monomach is all ears i believe theodocranus will get the monomachs attention in a way that i never could haraldr watched the dancers for a while hoping that theodocranus was having a successful interview after a quarter hour of waiting the imperial chamberlain approached hetairarch his majesty would like to see you haraldr was escorted into the modest hall of the house then to a dressing chamber where the monomach stood in his purple scaramangium and smoothed his luxuriant silver hair theodocranus stood on a chair placed directly in front of the emperor and held up a bronze mirror for his sovereign he had just begun a ribald jest about the emperors notorious sexual appetite the emperor visited the imperial stables prattled theodocranus in his warbling voice he saw that one of his prize stallions couldnt hump the mare he had been penned to stud the emperor asked the stallion what was wrong and the stallion said i am afraid of losing it in there the emperor pulled his out to show the stallion and said ive put this in many a mare of my own and look it is still here the stallions eyes grew wide when he saw how the pantocrator had endowed the monomach and he said to the emperor well if mine was that big i certainly wouldnt be worried about losing it either theodocranus clapped his stubby hands and haraldr winced the monomach clutched his stomach in a paroxysm of mirth finally tumbling to the floor in comic rapture haraldr waited until his majesty had recovered his breath however the emperor seemed in no hurry to get to his feet again finally haraldr said majesty has theodocranus mentioned to you the matter the monomach held up a powerful squarish hand yes yes hetairarch my dear little friend here has presented the matter with a delicacy and subtlety you would do well to emulate and therefore i have agreed to consider the matter haraldr waited while the emperor wiped the tears from his eyes his majesty remained on his haunches oh well quite said the monomach suddenly remembering what he had just said i am amenable to the matter if your mother zoe is you know how devoted i am to her happiness yes i fear you are becoming too soberminded here hetairarch perhaps you do need a winter in thule to help you appreciate the delights of the imperial court the emperor held out his arms to theodocranus who bounded into the imperial embrace like a small cuddly child the monomach covered the dwarfs squat face with friendly kisses now my little friend the emperor chortled with renewed enthusiasm tell what i did when a dozen naked whores awakened me in the middle of the night marias hand felt like a dry warm cloud in his she led him up the gently rolling slope towards the back porch of her villa along the narrow path grapevines grew in neat perpendicular rows and she paused and stooped to examine a cluster of dark heavy grapes polished like agates by the bright lateafternoon sun maria plucked one and popped it in her mouth i will drink from this vine again she said i know i will she clutched haraldr and gave him a kiss wet and sweet with the juice of the grape when we visit from norway haraldr held her and stroked her thick silky black braids he had not even brought her argyruss uncharacteristic offer of a good price for her villa he knew that she would need this place as a symbol and a hope when she was so far from home we have not been given leave yet he told her we may yet drink this harvest this winter she tilted her chin up against his chest her eyes were more perfectly azure than the sky i am not melancholy about leaving she said defensively you do not need to lift my spirits with such doubts zoe has already given her permission once and i am ready to sail i would like to give you a child before i am an old woman haraldr kissed her forehead and shared that vision they held each other tightly and rocked in the breeze after a while maria turned her chin up again i can hear your troubles pounding away in your chest king haraldr are you thinking about the lifetime of cares i will bring you i am worrying about beginning that lifetime i am he squinted into the sun i am worried about the length of that lifetime maria pulled loose and took his hand again and led him to the steps on the sunny southern porch which afforded them a panorama of the glittersprinkled cities to the southwest and the vineyards and cypress groves to the east she sat beside him and looped her arm in his tell me what concerns you she said leave nothing out haraldr watched a dhromon slide past on the bosporus banks of oars dipping leisurely the redandblack hull and deadly golden spouts vivid his sigh was his preface zoe is not the same zoe so much has happened to her i know things are different with her and i have not been able to i dont know i have forgiven you for sleeping with her which is the least i can offer since you have forgiven me mar but i cannot i knew she was opposed to you and i thought i understood but for her to then take you to her bed when she knew that i still loved you and she knew that you still loved me i cannot forgive i know it is wrong and i know i will one day understand but it is hard for me now maria found his hand and twined her fingers in his it is of no consequence you will obtain her leave and if you do not i will i persuaded her to embrace her sister and they are still as thick as thieves particularly now that the insatiable monomach has found a new amusement i can certainly persuade her to release me maria kissed haraldrs temple so i am confident that we will soon begin our lifetime why do you worry that our time together will be brief she asked the question matteroffactly almost gaily haraldr hung his head and looked at his boots i have made the eastjourney i grant you that our return will not be as dangerous as our coming since the pecheneg horde will not expect us and our ships will be light and few enough that we can more easily avoid the cataracts but it is still an enormously dangerous journey maria jabbed haraldr in the ribs i am worried about encountering your little love the princess elisevett when we arrive safely in kiev she is probably not so little any more she might try to poison me and you might be smitten by her again that was a boys love well hers was not a girls trick you still dont believe that she was really a virgin when i was fifteen i could play the false virgin very well myself i dont think she was playing i can see you are still smitten with her so that is what i am worried about what else the grin fled from haraldrs face the sun seemed strangely cold as if the white fire had turned to ice my enemies in norway are very powerful i have to overcome them before our lifetime can begin look what you have overcome here in rome said maria with highpitched incredulity you are a legend here here throughout the world these men will flee when they hear your name and dont tell me that these foes wont be daunted simply because they are norsemen mar and his men were norsemen the most feared in the world maria threw her hands up in exasperation that is here norway is where i lost i lost my strength i am afraid i will lose it again even olaf could not defeat these men maria nodded slowly knowingly olaf she said softly she paused for a moment considering her words haraldr have you ever considered that perhaps you might be a greater man than olaf that perhaps olaf however brave and heroic he was might have had neither your wits nor your strength that perhaps olaf blundered at stiklestad and lost everything and that you had no part in it except to be a brave boy trying to be a man you did not lose that battle or your throne your brother olaf did perhaps that is what troubles me that i will be a greater king than olaf and yet someday will also blunder more gravely and cost many people everything perhaps cost your sons their lives at least you admit that we will probably survive long enough to have sons haraldr smiled ruefully i have never told you this that night at zoes when abelas performed he called me a merchant of destiny i feel the power of my fate to command the collective fate and it has begun to frighten me i felt your fate the first time i looked into your eyes do you remember at nicephorus argyruss palace that look we exchanged at the table it chilled me and excited me at once that was when i decided i had to make love to you for a moment maria sounded like the old maria wild and spooky i thought you would bring me a new allengulfing darkness a more excruciating prison in which i could conceal my soul instead your destiny brought me to the light your star is a bright and joyful one that is what your destiny brings haraldr stood up still unsatisfied unable to resist her persuasion while he sat next to her he could not face her eyes what if i were killed trying to reclaim my throne you would be alone in a strange and distant place i cannot bear to think of it i would marry halldor maria laughed out loud haraldr turned a look of relief on his face i would want you to he said eagerly i am serious to think of you alone i would come back from the dead to prevent that if i were to die at the hands of your pechenegs or to be flung into the dnieper who would you marry elisevett haraldrs face immediately furrowed with pain i would marry no one i would mourn you for the rest of my life i would wither and die i would suffer every time i looked at a woman so i would be condemned to an eternity of looking down from paradise and knowing the unhappiness in your breast marias lips twitched with amusement haraldr shook his head as if that terrible fate were virtually imminent how could i ever replace you he asked plaintively it would profane your memory i would never let someone else displace you from my soul maria shot to her feet her eyes on fire she grabbed haraldrs arm and turned him to face her do you think anyone could ever remove you from my soul she shouted angrily even after a lifetime even after a thousand men had had me she shook her fist at him how can you imply that one woman could take me from your breast i will always be inside you even if i never touch you again i will touch everyone you touch for the rest of your life tears ran down haraldrs cheeks i did not mean that i only mean that it would be unbearably painful to live a lifetime with someone else when i would always remember that our time was so short maria brushed at his tears with her lithe white fingers and put her arms around him time she murmured there is no time there are only the moments when we are together that is all the time there ever was and ever will be how can you measure that much time that night maria dreamed it all the ravens and the fire and the king beyond the creek and the beardless king vanquishing the bearded king when she awoke however she remembered only the last it was still dark and she slid next to haraldr and pressed her naked flesh so tightly to his that he finally roused from his own dreams darling she whispered still partially entranced by drowsiness i remembered the name of the beardless king it is william she kissed him on his shoulders and neck but it will happen after we are both dead and we will be together then in the purest golden light haraldr was fully awake he smelled her hair and whispered in her soft warm ear i know he said i dreamed that we were always together and that the light you have lit in my soul was never quenched their lips almost touched and they paused and felt each others warm moist breath i have never loved you more than i love you at this instant said haraldr symeon raised a hoary eyebrow hetairarch he said in his imperturbably decorous voice if you do not have a handkerchief might i offer you one or several haraldr looked at symeon with curiosity decided that the old chamberlain was anything but senile and accepted three of the soft embroidered linen handkerchiefs from symeons translucent hands without further preliminaries symeon nodded at the doorkeepers and they slid open the bronze doors to zoes apartments haraldr immediately understood symeons strange consideration the antechamber was like a dry steam bath there was even a mist of intensely pungent smoke in the air as if every form of incense known to the orient were being burned the large adjoining reception chamber was the obvious generator of this atmosphere half a dozen servants worked at three large tables tending rows of smoking braziers heating flasks grinding herbs and sealing bottles the heat from the braziers would have brought a camel to its knees zoe was once again in the business of perfume and unguent manufacture which according to maria was her habit when she was neglected in love haraldr had already had to mop his drenched face twice before zoe appeared she was as miraculous as ever her skin like smooth marble moist but not wet from the heat she wore a red scaramangium cut from silk so sheer that no contour of her body was left to the imagination and the contours were as beguiling as ever but the eyes were different more opaque set at an angle slightly oblique to him as she addressed him hetairarch no i dont like that for you king haraldr is much more suited such a secret to conceal from your mother had you told me during our dalliance who knows what madness might have possessed me she led him into her bedchamber the arcade facing the sea was shuttered despite the beautiful latesummer day haraldr was glad to have the heat as an excuse to mop his brow again she had not spoken of their affair since that single conversation after his return from the bulgar war then he realized he should be relieved zoe never leapt at what she really wanted like a true roman tactician she always leapt at something less important first he decided to humour her diversion yes majesty many opportunities were probably lost that night zoe laughed my queen to your king we should have been very wicked together could you have loved me yes i believe i have expressed my love for you in different ways since then could you make love to me again majesty i am in love with maria you will never marry maria zoes eyes were glacial majesty do you know what my skin feels like in this heat with magical grace zoe slipped her scaramangium over her head and stood as naked as eve her vast white bosom set off by erect lilac nipples was as astonishing as ever her pubic triangle was flossed with gold she cupped her breasts in her hands and approached haraldr think what these would feel like hot and wet on your thighs she pinched her nipples and ran the tip of her tongue over her crimson lips perhaps you could kill my husband and add emperor to your titles haraldr stepped back and looked up majesty i have come humbly and respectfully to beg your leave i have served you and your empire with as much loyalty and devotion zoe sat on the end of her sleeping couch and spread her legs so that the pink lips between them were visible in every detail you will make love to me before you leave rome she growled it is the duty you pay on exiting rome haraldr laughed majesty i can think of scarcely anything more appealing at this moment i would have my pleasure tell maria what i did and why and she would forgive me but my enjoyment would damage what she holds in her heart for you and i would never subject her to that hurt so i will exit without paying you your customs exaction zoes legs lolled obscenely you wont exit without my permission these walls can keep an invader out but i dont believe they could keep a simple beggar in i will leave with or without your blessing then you will leave without maria i will let maria decide that zoe leaned forward and leered with a bladesharp gaze you had better think before you challenge me on this king haraldr the last king to challenge me to a contest of love lost dearly maria loves you i grant that but i would stake my life on her love for me zoe laughed wildly setting her great breasts in frantic motion you think you hold her with your love she shrieked i hold her with a love so powerful she will never deny it haraldr allowed zoes fierce laughter to subside i know she is of your blood zoes head snapped and her eyes were like adders you dont know what you know king haraldr she said with teethgritting malice you have my permission to leave rome maria does not haraldr made his decision majesty he said as he crossed his arms over his breast might i humbly suggest that you open your shutters i believe that the cool sea air would have a most salutary effect on your demeanour halldor stuck his fingernail into the pitch its still pliable he said slapping the hard wooden strakes of the ousiaiclass galley they build these hulls so stiff that they hardly need to caulk them of course they wouldnt last a week in the western sea a hull needs flexibility to handle the big waves halldor straightened up and looked out over the other two ousiai tied up at the st mamas quarter docks no a summer in the water hasnt hurt these hulls but theyll need to be retarred in the spring of course that wont be our worry i wish we werent leaving like fugitives in the night said ulfr after all we have done for rome we should have a fleet of dhromons leading us out of the harbour instead of having to worry about them chasing us through the bosporus ulfr turned to haraldr i hope your plan for getting over the harbour boom works these stiff hulls will make it work said haraldr just make certain that no one straps any gear down particularly the chests of gold anyway i will be down here tomorrow night to rehearse the drill with the men we wont have time for mistakes if we are drilling at night said halldor how are we going to provision the ships during the day without arousing suspicion i made a deal with argyrus when i sold him my estates and tax privileges said haraldr his men are going to load the ships and tell any of the prefects meddlers that the vessels are being outfitted for one of argyruss ventures we even had papers forged so argyrus has turned out to be a true comrade after all said ulfr i would trust him with my back said haraldr of course i would keep my purse attached to my belt in front we wont be out of the bosporus before he has doubled his money on the resale of my properties but i am certain he will keep his mouth shut until we are away the three norsemen looked towards the sprawling ring of lights around the golden horn and the great massed clusters of galatea and constantinople i wonder if we will ever see this heaven bound to earth again said ulfr softly nidaros will seem like a sleeping closet said haraldr but it will be your land and your people said halldor it will be your people as well you and ulfr will no longer be guardsmen to a king you will be marshal and counsellor to the king of norway i look forward to fighting for norway said halldor i also look forward to a tall silkthatched northern woman the hair on her thighs so pale that it is almost transparent legs like a colt the kind that likes to drain a mead horn at your side and keep you up all night ulfr gazed off at the lights of the city and haraldr pulled halldor aside he kicked at the wooden planks of the wharf for a moment halldor he said secretively are you attracted to maria for once halldor seemed startled i have no intention of cuckolding you if thats what you mean but i would worship that woman halldor sounded rapt she would chain me with desire my career would be finished but as i say no no that is excellent now i want you to make me a promise halldor nodded unconditionally i do not believe that anything can stop us from wresting the throne of norway from king sven with my money and our pledgemen ultimately nothing will prevent that conquest not even my death if i were by some chance killed trying to regain my throne i want you and ulfr to carry on and rule in my stead rule jointly or one take the north and one the south as was done in my fathers time whatever that is between you two of course said halldor but i dont think haraldr jabbed his finger in halldors chest here is the important pledge i want you to promise that if i die you will marry maria and love her for me i will promise but i dont really just make your pledge halldor shrugged i hope circumstances will never compel me to keep this pledge but if they do i will not find it difficult i pledge it on my honour as a norseman haraldr surprised halldor with an embrace thank you my friend now i have been freed to go north i had no idea i actually possessed so little said maria growing up in the palace i simply assumed that all of those things were mine now i see that all i have are these two chests full of robes and jewellery she watched somewhat anxiously as argyruss porters hefted the two large wooden caskets and carried them out into the courtyard haraldr locked his arms around her waist in six months you will own norway in eighteen months you will hold a prince of norway to your breast maria turned and placed her hands flat on his chest are you certain you will still desire me when you once again behold the fairhaired maidens of thule when my breasts and stomach sag with childbirth certainly who else will love me when i grow fat from the labours of the ale halls the king of norway is expected to drain the mead trench with his court men almost every night olaf looked like a pregnant cow they even called him olaf the fat that is what you will have to sleep with maria slipped her hands into haraldrs belt and bit at his chest pulling up the silk robe in her teeth each night after you have laboured with your subjects you will labour so hard in my bed that you will look like a starving crane i have survived so far without significant diminution of my stature though i have noticed that my byrnnie is not as tight as it once was the bronze water clock in the corner of the room rang the hour maria pushed haraldr away and her forehead puckered i have to do it she said you understand why do you imagine that i wouldnt i am tremendously relieved this will solve every problem i am certain that because of our past relationship and her present predicament i incited zoe with you it will be entirely different she and theodora will probably even want to sail with us as far as her villa we will have a joyous farewell with every expectation of an equally joyous return i just want to make certain that if she refuses you will still be willing to join in our dramatic escape which i dont think will be dramatic at all gregory says that the patrols on the bosporus have been reduced to almost nil while many of the ships are being refitted ive seen them hoisted to the docks in neorion harbour myself maria smiled slyly i was a wild girl when you met me have you forgotten some of my escapades love has not made me altogether docile and as you say this will probably be the least dangerous portion of our journey she smoothed her robe and pursed her lips i just want to make her understand i want her to see that in her own erratic way she has helped me find the happiness that i now have in my life and to ask her to share my joy i dont want you to be tortured by guilt if you must leave against her wishes i will feel guilt but i will not let it torture me she did not feel guilt when she abandoned me for the love of her men i see that now she has always been selfish in love which is why the sum of her loves is so paltry just as the sum of my loves was so meagre before you came to me haraldr looked at marias marvellous blue eyes for a moment my darling have you ever considered that there is a blood relation between you and their imperial majesties i believe that there is and that zoe may try to use this bond to hold you here marias gullwing eyebrows lifted i cant believe you dont know that she said with girlish astonishment did i never tell you my mother was their cousin a very distant cousin the relationship is never acknowledged because the scandal that engulfed my parents might impeach the imperial dignity that tenuous blood tie is nothing next to the bonds of the heart she rushed up and clutched him tightly feel my heart and yours she said breathlessly as her chest fluttered away against his they are the same little daughter said zoe he told me you would come now i must share him with you the little ivory statue of the christ was almost entirely concealed by zoes delicate hands but the tiny white head ringed with a golden halo peeked above her thumbs zoe looked at maria like a child about to share a secret this little image is extraordinary daughter you will understand when it speaks to us maria followed zoe into her sweltering bedchamber hoping that the little christ would turn out to be another harmless caprice the brilliant candelabra added to the infernal atmosphere in the shuttered room zoe motioned for maria to crawl up on the bed beside her she hiked up the hem of her tight scaramangium and sat crosslegged the ivory figure still cradled in her hands this is extraordinary daughter now be very quiet zoe bent over and brought the little head to her bloodred lips my pale beauty she whispered my precious eternal being creature of light my darling my love my sweetest embrace talk to us zoe paused and kissed the tiny head my little daughter is about to embark on a journey my blessed beauty tell us if this future is a propitious one for her zoe rocked back and forth slightly still cupping the figure and intermittently kissing its golden halo after a long while she opened her hands carefully and studied the figure now revealed in its entire miniature exactitude only the change on her own face was extraordinary her eyes seemed to retreat into her sockets and her cheeks appeared to contract it was as if she were very slowly becoming a corpse she wrapped the figure in her tremulous hands and then pounded it to her chest oh holy beauty she screamed oh divine spirit oh first and purest light i will save her from that fate if i must chain her here in this room oh why my beauty have you revealed this terrible vision if not to permit her rescue blessed are you blessed are you zoe turned to maria tears bright on her pale cheeks maria put her arms around zoe and clasped her head to her shoulder oh mother i will miss you desperately too if i thought that some prophecy could ease our pain at this parting i would have procured every soothsayer and palmist from the shadows of the hippodrome and brought them here i already take with me my own forebodings please allow me to challenge my fears with your blessing on my journey zoe struggled free from marias embrace the statue is extraordinary she said as if explaining to an intractable child i did not mean that he would literally speak if this journey of yours had divine sanction he would have glowed with the fiery radiance of the candles of the heavenly seraphim i cannot believe you question this you whom i have seen more than once discard an otherwise blameless lover because of some presentiment offered you by a withered palmist i still believe in fate mother but not the selfish fate i once worshipped i have embraced the fate that is my life and will not let him go even if it means your death zoes voice had the timbre of grim reason again my child those men are savages i know they are as charming as chained and perfumed leopards when they are paraded before us but in their own frozen habitats they revert to their animal state you will end up caged with a menagerie of their doxies you will perish from the brutal life i say this because i love you i know you do mother but i do not see how you could have known these men as you have and think that maria paused and her eyes flared mother i know that you and haraldr were lovers and that he never lied to you but that you lied to him zoe turned with a nervous feline motion i loved him and lied to him because it was in the interest of my state and my people to lie to him to use the brute for the purpose for which he was intended to further the power and glory of rome zoe leapt up from the sleeping couch and began to pace holy mother child this man of yours is the pretender to the throne of some iceberg that is likely to sail off the ends of the earth we have almost as many wouldbe caliphs and castout princes of his ilk at our court as we have senescent magisters in the senate some of them are little more than clowns this clown saved your life and mine more than once he saved your empire and your people from the pathetic madman you took into your bed haraldr is the only one of your lovers who was not a danger to your people zoe stopped and her grimacing lips relented i admit my errors but it is easy for you to criticize my conduct when you have enjoyed the luxuries of my court and none of the responsibilities luxuries i might add that you will be fortunate to enjoy as memories in christforsaken thule yes luxuries such as having a man three times my age cajole himself into my bed and then break my heart such luxuries as my mad passions that you found so gay and charming such luxuries as a dark frozen heart that every glowing candelabra and gilded mosaic in this palace could not pierce with a splinter of light my heart will be a thousand thousand times as brilliant on the bleakest coldest winter night in norway as it ever was in the splendour of this palace zoe crept back onto the bed beside maria and put her arm around her shoulders marias breasts heaved with sobs and tears flooded her eyes little daughter zoe whispered i wish i had told you the truth when i first held your little head to my breast we are not meant to be happy here only to serve our people if i could offer you any caution derived from my bitter experience it is that when we follow our hearts instead of our true destiny we end up punishing both ourselves and those we must serve you yes said maria wiping at her tears perhaps that has been your lot but i have my life to live i have a separate destiny now it is to be with him it is not to be with him dont you understand he is not your destiny maria pressed her eyes with her palms and straightened her back mother i will leave with him whether or not you bless and permit it this is our farewell please let my heart go without the weight of your censure zoe let go of marias shoulder this is a farewell only to the innocence i have so long sought for you her voice was hollow and haunted i realize now i have spared you nothing by not telling you maria turned to zoe and could not stifle her shocked gasp it was as if in the few moments of marias tears zoe had become an old woman her face more sunken and drained of life than when she had imagined the prophecy of her statue it was as simple as the seduction of a whore said halldor heres how it worked theodocranus went along with the rest to sclerenas house as you know theodocranus is permitted to enter the emperors presence at any time he wishes now without prostrations or even good afternoon majesty so instead of waiting the requisite five courses while the monomach sated his own appetites theodocranus left the banquet table and bounded into the emperors presence while his majesty was presenting himself all of it to sclerena apparently the monomachs virtuous niece is as skilled as some of the sword swallowers we find in the forum which is what theodocranus told the emperor who proceeded to laugh like a goat without interrupting sclerena whom i presume was also tickled though perhaps not by mirth in the midst of this good cheer theodocranus blurted out majesty the grand hetairia is required to inspect the outer perimeter of the great land wall this evening may i order the komes of the walls to permit their exit later this afternoon the emperor who at this point seemed on the verge of plucking delicate sclerenas hair out by the roots shouted his assent in a voice so commanding that the state messengers were already conveying his order to the komes of the walls before theodocranus had even left the room ulfr shook his head incredible but it did indeed work is everyone checked off ulfr nodded towards the hundreds of varangians milling on the dock and climbing through the opendecked hulls of the three light galleys they moved in darkness haraldr had ordered that no torches be lit on the docks every last man said halldor except the four from hedeby who are staying to command a private guard haraldr released them from their pledges most of the rest are eager a few are nursing aching breasts i am still burning for the wife well that is all behind me norway there probably isnt a woman there who has even heard of me ulfr laughed have you forgotten that in the north adultery is not so casually regarded as it is here you dont want to become known as a husband killer i know i will probably have to wed some precious silky little virgin and make discreet calls on widows i am certain you will find a bride lovely enough to keep you in your own hall for at least a month ulfr stamped his feet on the dock as if expecting an icy north wind haraldr should be here soon to tell us one way or another yes said halldor but i dont think we will have to steal out of here in the night haraldr is confident that maria will obtain the empresss leave we will be able to sail leisurely out of the harbour in the morning with a suitable escort as well ulfr walked over to the nearest galley and kicked the hull with a resounding thump good because i dont agree with the two of you on your plan for getting past the harbour boom these hulls arent as sturdy as you think marias eyes were engorged with tears she fell into theodoras arms and cried for a long while finally theodora placed her long slender fingers beneath marias chin and gently tilted her head up she told you maria nodded and sobbed is it true it is true whispered theodora maria lifted her head up to the light and her eyes seemed to be glazed with ice why did you wait and why did you tell me now we loved you we wanted it to be different for you both of us you must believe that and now we truly thought your haraldr was just another plaything we thought we were indulging another of your wild romances i think until this very evening we did not believe that you really intended to marry him and leave rome that was our folly but would it have been fair to you or to him to let you leave without knowing yes you knew how much i loved him there is a greater love we are bidden to it is far less comforting and far more painful than the love of a man but it is a greater love no i will not live your lives maria we are not like other people our lives are given us by the pantocrator they are his to dispose of my soul is mine to dispose of and it is going to norway theodora cupped marias chin wait decide nothing for now you have not had time to consider what all this means if after reflection in the light of what you now know you still love this man in the way you think you do now we will think of something customs can be changed you might i dont know he could certainly stay as your lover maria put her hands to her ears and screamed no his dreams are in norway to keep him here would destroy the light that is my life no i am going with him i am going now he is my destiny zoe appeared in the doorway of theodoras chamber her face weary the faded mother of the beautiful woman who had greeted maria an hour earlier maria she snapped it is impossible your legacy is too great go to your haraldr and tell him that he has my leave to depart our city and empire tomorrow morning with all the gold he and his band can carry but you will never leave rome maria ran from the room her face distorted and lanternred i am going with him she said sobbing zoe turned and called after her maria i will not permit you to leave and if he tries to assist in your flight i will have him destroyed haraldr listened to the water clock ring the third hour of the night he was grateful that norway did not have such sophisticated mechanical devices the relentless timekeepers were the clarions of anxiety why had she not returned he never should have let her go zoe like every person condemned to that diabolic purple cloth had gone mad haraldr paced a moment and then decided to make one last sweep through the house to ensure that he had left nothing of value value everything that could possibly matter would soon be on three ships the future of norway and nothing zoe could do could stop it to the flickering light of his taper haraldr descended the marble staircase for the last time if he felt any nostalgia on leaving this oversize empty shell it was only because of the nights he and maria had held each other there he stopped in the large entrance hall and thought of the first time he would make love to maria as his wife and queen odin your skalds will spend the next ten centuries singing of her beauty he was startled by the noise you are welcome to the water clock he wanted to tell the thief he poked the taper in the direction of the rustling darling he cried out his joy visceral i thought you were some his voice fell off as the light revealed her agony he rushed to her and held her she sobbed for a painfully long while the unforgiving clock racheted in accompaniment i am so sorry he finally told her oh i did not want this darling darling he said trying to lift her stubborn leaden chin i will have my men return to the numera and we will wait for another day we will both go and talk to her i wont let you leave your home like this maria looked up the colour of her eyes was a shimmering blue fjord in the darkness of a shadowed gorge i have made my farewells she said fiercely i want nothing more in this life than to sail with you to norway tonight who is at the blachernae gate asked halldor erling said ulfr i think i will ride up there and wait for another hour then im afraid our inspection of the walls will have to be concluded ill ride into the city after that and find out what happened to haraldr hopefully he has been detained because he and maria are celebrating a successful petition to the empress im worried about leaving too late in the evening even the monomach is going to be suspicious if he finds that his entire guard has been gone half the night halldor had saddled his horse when he heard horseshoes clatter on the pavement near the dock he reached for his purse he intended to pay off the cursore then he noticed that the horse was transport for both a man and a woman ulfr he shouted haraldr haraldr dismounted swept maria into his arms and carried her onto the dock she was pale and holloweyed halldor looked at her with concern it appears that zoe did not give her consent he said to haraldr he looked off towards the distant mouth of the golden horn a vague aperture between the hills of light haraldr he said firmly i propose that we return to our barracks i am certain that suspicion has already been aroused by our absence and now maria looks ill let us wait we can go tomorrow or in a week put me down said maria to haraldr as annoyed as if she had been abducted i am not sick i am she breathed deeply and arranged her robe nervously then looked searchingly at the three men her head held high there is something i must tell all of you before you take me on your ship she turned to haraldr and put her hand on his arm i was going to wait to tell you until we had seen the last lights of the city disappear but on the ride through the city i thought about what i myself have said about selfish love and now i realize that i am guilty of that she looked again between halldor and ulfr and her lips quivered you are all in grave danger if you take me with you tonight maria clutched haraldrs arm tightly she faltered and blinked away new tears i have just learned that my mother was the purpleborn eudocia daughter of the emperor constantine niece of basil the bulgarslayer and sister of their majesties zoe and theodora i i am the last macedonian heir to the throne of imperial rome the night was infinite in its vast hush the whispered conversations of the varangians on the docks created a cathedrallike murmur a hull groaned slightly finally haraldr very slowly took marias face in his hands oh my love the pain in his voice was for both of them oh my love he repeated numbly he stared at the city for a long moment and then returned to her with tears in his eyes i i will understand if you must remain with your people i of all here i should understand what you feel now your obligation but if you still if your fate and mine can still be joined he trailed off hopelessly and shook his head in shock and bewilderment a man confronted by a catastrophe for which he had no solution finally he could only take her in his arms i it doesnt matter i cannot ask these men to take that risk i will stay here with you no that is not what i want she said her voice soft and high and her eyes like starlight i want to go with you more than ever to forge a new fate with your people we could never have a life here now an augusta could never marry a she looked down at her feet and then into the eyes of the norseman barbaros she inhaled deeply zoe will do everything she can to keep me here she has returned in her emptiness to her oldest passion the house of macedon she has already warned me that she will kill you to preserve that legacy it is as if her dead uncle the bulgarslayer has ruled her heart all these years and she only now realizes the terrible implications of that overweening love maria sobbed quickly and regained control all of you may be destroyed because of me that is a risk i am willing to undertake said halldor for once i have no words to add to halldors ulfr nodded may i put the question before your pledgemen halldor asked haraldr looked at maria before nodding assent halldor hurried down to the end of the dock and stopped at each ship in turn he left the crew of the first ship to a low fevered buzz of activity the second and third vessels followed halldors hurried inquiries with their own murmured choruses men leapt into motion pulling oars up from the hold and scrambling to loosen mooring lines halldor came running back he looked directly at maria they are all willing to risk whatever norways queen is willing to risk tears streamed down marias cheeks halldor turned to haraldr but we must leave immediately the ships were pushed slowly past the dock and then oars dipped and turned the prows east the first full surge of all sixty oars buckled haraldrs knees momentarily then seemed to free the enormous weight on his chest he could not conceivably assimilate the full import of what maria had told him but his heart thrummed with the stunning testament of her love he paced the catwalk between the rowing benches making certain that the chests and gear bags were arranged as he had intended the first of many obstacles lay directly ahead in the night but now there was only a single destination in his mind and in his heart the wind rustled in his ears as the brilliant city floated past in the night he looked at maria seated at the stern wrapped in her fur cape gazing at the brilliant lights of blachernae the ancillary palace at the northwest corner of the city where the great land wall and seawall met he would never miss these lights as long as he had her blue fires to dazzle him he had given much to rome but now rome had given him her greatest treasure the wharves blazed with the tapers of the porters who customarily worked long into the night haraldr took the tiller from ulfr and talked to maria together they recited the names of the towering broad gates in the seawall as they glided past basilica phanarii petrion st theodosia ispigas and platea with its huge complex of wharves warehouses and endless rows of merchant and pleasure craft the high round hulls of venetian merchantmen were dark silhouettes at droungariou viglae gate on the north shore of the golden horn the city of galatea glimmered with a brilliance that would have made it the wonder of the world were it not for the great city little more than two bowshots across the water the splendid spine of the city was strung with necklaces of light already the great palaces of the dhynatoi had been rebuilt and filled with new riches the lights of the imperial palace and the ring of glowing golden windows round the dome of hagia sophia winked into view from the hills to the southeast at the perama gate haraldr gave the tiller back to ulfr and told him to steer to left centre of the channel haraldr joined halldor in the prow of the galley not good at all shouted halldor he pointed at neorion harbour a lattice of lights cradled in the slightly hooked end of the peninsula most of the small patrol craft were still on lifts but haraldr could distinctly see the hundreds of tapers milling around the dhromons like luminous ants our passage has been reported i presume they know what they are after they havent left anchorage yet shouted haraldr well outrun them easily if we make it over the boom halldor looked out on the black water the bosporus glazed by the luminous backdrop of chrysopolis on the asian shore opened up ahead they were almost directly opposite the neorion docks one of the dhromons blew its air horn the frightening bellow almost certainly signalled the departure of the huge fireship there shouted halldor he pointed to the northeast near the point where the galatea coastline veered north i can see it already the boom was an ebony sketch on the water haraldr called out to ulfr to come larboard a quarter to meet the angled chain headon the other ships made the same turn and came abreast the massive log floats of the harbour boom became distinct threedimensional forms each float was several ells high and thirty ells long the sections were joined by iron links as thick as a mans arm haraldr walked back to the stern and took the tiller from ulfr the log barrier was three bowshots away he picked his spot on the periphery of his vision he could see the lights of a dhromon as it left the docks another horn bellowed across the water begin the drill he shouted the rowing cadence immediately increased and the ship lunged forward varangians deep in the hold began sliding the heaviest chests towards the stern along greased planks set especially for the purpose the bow began to plane up and the railing at the stern dipped towards the waves as they closed on the boom the cadence went higher more chests were moved and the angle of the bow increased the log barrier suddenly looked like a wall fifty ells shouted haraldr the rowers took fast deep strokes and the men in the hold braced themselves haraldr and ulfr steadied the tiller with both arms maria ducked her head water whooshed along the hull wood screeched against wood the planing bow slid over the log float as if cresting a wave then decelerated with a tremendous shudder the stern began to settle and the entire hull teetered on the fulcrum of the log float the bow ten ells clear of the water men leapt onto the floats and began to secure heavy ropes between the mast and the boom oarsmen joined the frantic bailing at the stern haraldr was already up to his calves in water he realized they were losing their first battle of the long journey back he shouted for the men in the hold to go ahead with the drill the chests were now pushed frantically forward along the greased planks as the weight of the cargo was shifted the hull protested with a deep almost animate keen the stern began to lift the ship slowly levelled until for an instant it was perfectly balanced on top of the log fulcrum timbers screeched and the ropes that kept the hull from yawing over hummed with the strain as the ship tilted first to one side and then the other and then the descent began after a moment the bow slapped reassuringly into the water on the other side of the boom the bow oars dipped and wood shrieked as the ship began to slip off the boom they were free in the bosporus you are luckier than odin crowed ulfr we ulfrs joy vanished in the thunderclap that came from the left every head turned only fifty ells away the second ship was poised at the critical balance point atop the log within a heartbeat the ship fractured in two as if it had been dropped against the log barrier from some great height cut the lines and make ready to pick them up shouted haraldr his ship scraped free from the boom and he looked to his right to see how the third galley had fared it too had dipped its bow and was sliding off the boom still farther to the right the lights of the dhromons moved on the water the rescue was orderly haraldr praised the gods that norsemen did not panic when plunged into a dark sea most of the varangians had evacuated their gear bags and clung calmly to the shattered hull of their galley the surviving galleys divided the crew of the wreck the extra men were quickly distributed on the benches the next time there will be fire on the water thought haraldr and none of us will be so calm haraldr looked south apparently the harbour boom had been partially towed away at the constantinople end and the dhromons were coming through along the coastline he turned to ulfr this was my fault i should have known that at least one of the keels would fail and fitted an extra ship now our two ousiai are so heavily loaded that we no longer have the advantage of speed he paused and counted the dhromons as they passed the boom and began to turn to the north eight before we lost that galley this pursuit was not a contest for us but we are in a race now it is strange how an entire life must suddenly become a memory maria looked off the stern and wrapped her fur cape up to her chin a night wind had come up from the north and the galley pitched rhythmically through the rising seas the lights of the city were now a golden haze on the southern horizon the lanterns on the masts of the dhromons were distinct stars against this luminous band gently lifting and falling with the motion of the waves haraldr snugged marias cape around her shoulders and held her he was unable to banish entirely the great city to his own memories if i had known the choice i was forcing on you it is still hard to believe he paused for a long while i will go back with you i would not be some helpless consort perhaps i could never be crowned but then joannes did not need a crown i would rule you would rule a dying empire and in your own fashion you would become a joannes you did not grow up next to the heart of rome i did and i know that rome is dying and everyone close to that heart is corrupted and dies in emptiness and darkness no matter how long their span and how glorious the honours heaped upon them by the sycophants at court their souls are stolen when they ascend that golden throne and at that moment they die alone and empty but you would have the love of your people these people i would somehow reach out to from the prison of the imperial palace these people who would perish in a civil war if my true identity were even known those who want to restore the macedonian line would fight to seat me on the throne so that my young loins could bring forth the next macedonian and those factions whose interests lay elsewhere would raise their swords on protests of my illegitimacy maria turned to haraldr it is so strange zoe and theodora knew what i am telling you now and yet in their secret hearts i guess they always dreamed that i could follow them the shadow of their uncle the bulgarslayer is still over rome and because rome cannot escape a dead mans legacy rome will soon join him in death haraldr wrapped his arms more tightly around maria and nuzzled her ear as king of norway i will find no better counsel than in my own marriage bed i too have smelled that fetor of death in the studion among the corpses of a thematic army ill prepared and even more poorly led and most strongly within that glittering circle at court that splendid scented illusion that masks a power that has decayed at its very core the foundations of rome are crumbling but its caretakers have chosen to regild the exterior rather than shore up the columns that actually support the edifice haraldr looked out at the wavering constellation of the pursuing dhromons the lights were now strung out in single file the great beast is dying from within but its teeth are still deadly will we outpace them we have pulled away slightly this north wind holds them back more than it does us because their hulls are higher but the dhromons can slip in behind one another and the crews at the back can save their energy until it is their turn to challenge the wind see that is how they have formed up as i said the teeth are still sharp and i must take my spell at the oars he kissed her and let her go i wish i could row said maria haraldr looked up at the sky the stars were fading beneath a rapidly thickening haze and the scent of an approaching storm was on the wind he pointed to a bucket well you have already proved yourself a good bailer he said i think you will have an opportunity to practise your skill again before the night is over khelandia said halldor flatly and there are ten dhromons instead of eight i cant see them said ulfr i cant see ulfr stopped and squinted at the line of lights trailing behind them except for an occasional light or two on the shoreline the rest of the horizon was black and featureless the great city was a memory even the stars had vanished entirely i can skita where did they come from they had been hanging back and running without lanterns very clever put bells on the oxen and let us exhaust ourselves racing against them then silently bring up the horses halldor turned and studied the bowing backs of the varangians and shook his head they are at their limit right now he looked back at maria still vigilant at the stern her fur cape bound tightly around her have haraldr spelled he told ulfr we are going to have to decide what to do when they catch us haraldr came to the stern sweat beaded on his forehead he listened to halldor squinted past the dhromons and his ruddy complexion faded as he verified the observation he looked quickly at maria and she smiled at him he beckoned her with his hand she will want to know he said softly maria looked up at the three norsemen her eyes the only bright surface on the entire galley haraldr pointed to the south they have sent out more ships than we thought khelandia the fastest fireships i think they are waiting for some sign of our weakening before they unleash them haraldr looked quickly over his shoulder at the swaying oarsmen and that will be soon marias lips parted silently and she inhaled quickly before she spoke this race is ended then her voice was resolute she looked at haraldr you have a dinghy set me in it and give me a lantern i am the prize not your lives when they have collected me they will turn back haraldr immediately shook his head and maria grabbed his arms listen to me she commanded this is not the end i will find some way to come to you rome will never hold me again but what prison would i escape from if you were not free to welcome me this is the only way now for your people for us haraldr stared into her steady blue eyes her unimpeachable logic ripping at his heart he shook his head again what other way is there protested maria very well said haraldr we will lower the dinghy but i will be the captain of that vessel no zoe might who knows what she might she has gone mad i am not afraid of zoe said haraldr and i do not intend to see zoe i intend to bribe the droungarios in command of those dhromons you should know by now that even all your chests of gold cannot purchase the fate of a purpleborn it suddenly occurs to me that the droungarios almost unquestionably does not know why his empress so desperately demands your return you yourself spoke of the threat to zoes own status if a more fecund macedonian were to become available i dont think zoe is yet as mad as you think maria looked at haraldr with sparkling astonishment then her white teeth flashed and she reached up and touched his face why do i sometimes forget my darling that you are a very wise man she drew her arms around him you wont even have to offer him a chestful of gold a mistress of the robes particularly a discredited wanton like myself is probably only worth a bag of silver the hulls of the varangian galleys vanished behind the dark waves spray whistled along with the wind and soon drenched the passengers in the wildly pitching dinghy marias teeth chattered and haraldr used one oar to steady the dinghy and the other to hold her darling i must tell you something this wager may be lost there is a chance that i am wrong about zoe maria spoke firmly in spite of her quaking body feel this she guided his hand to the lining of her cape the hard blade of a knife lay beneath the soft fur if they threaten to take you i will use this you know i will no i will get in the water somehow halldor and ulfr will come back to look for me i will live and you must not die a wave picked the dinghy up and dropped it with bowelnumbing suddenness what i must say is what i did not have a chance to say the other times we have taken such risks there is so much that can happen now if this does not work we could it could be a long time before we hold each other again years i could die in the north before he shook his drenched head as if in flinging away the drops of seawater he could cast off that destiny fate is suspended that is all i know and i may not have this reprieve again he turned to her with blue lightning in his eyes wherever you are i will find you again i will hold back the last dragon for all eternity if i must to hold you again i promise that i will keep that promise beyond my own grave i will find you and hold you again this will not be our last embrace they held each other unspeaking until the lights of the dhromons came over them like terrible stars in a dark universe the droungarios john moschus stuck his powerful hands into the ivory casket and pulled up fistfuls of gold the solidi fell back into the pile the sound a dull clink in the shrieking wind he fixed his cold grey eyes on haraldr its a hundred times more than i could expect to leave this office with he said but my life is ships it would be death for me to live on some estate in armenikoi after i am relieved of my command you could buy your own ships pursue saracen brigands sail when you please and fight when you please instead of waiting on the docks until your emperor decides to frighten some naked children on the beaches of kherson the dhromon lifted in the mounting sea look at this is this an effective sortie for thirty fireships to bring back her majestys mistress of the robes next you will be asked to send twenty dhromons to libya to capture a black man to fan the empresss face besides she doesnt make the ultimate decisions the monomach knows you are an able commander haraldr reached in his cloak produced a large leather purse full of gold coins and set it on top of the gleaming contents of the casket here give this to a dwarf named theodocranus tell him that you want the emperor to preserve your command moschus rubbed his scratchy black beard ive heard of this dwarf he said as he shook his head i dont know he shook his head again look said haraldr my men will come back for me a lot of your men and my men will die for what for a glorified serving girl if i did not love her so much with the head that doesnt think i probably would just give her back to you and shrug it off but i burn every time i think of her why dont you keep the money and let me keep the mistress moschus looked at maria and then at haraldr i think you might misunderstand i have orders to let you go maybe you should try to forget her look at her said haraldr could you forget her shes not a woman shes a demon she possesses the soul you know what they say about her moschus laughed marias eyes never flinched ive heard about her as well he cocked his head at haraldr youre certain that it isnt the emperor who really wants her back i mean he lifted his wiry eyebrows suggestively and threw his hands up shes faithful to me i keep her locked up moschus dug his hands into the gold again and then stood up he stamped the deck damn women thats the beauty and the curse of the sea no women damn he looked at haraldr i need to think about this halldor your eyes are intoxicated with their earlier success ulfr winced into the screaming north wind and flying spray hord stefnirson leaned over his shoulder they silently studied the sea for a long while odin hord jerked erect as if he had been struck by an arrow odin no who ulfr looked at hord and shook his head as if to say dont tell me you are as mad as halldor is halldor shook his head back at ulfr youre not talking about that squall line said ulfr still peering at the sea that ulfr went rigid holy mother of christ holy holy mother of christ that is no squall line that is he turned and looked at halldor that is the fleet yes i think about three hundred ships said halldor not at all enjoying his triumph now let us see he said grimly who can be the first to discover whether they are merchantmen or warships maria pressed her chin to haraldrs chest if he does not accept i will threaten to kill myself i will his mission could hardly be considered successful then he will accept whispered haraldr the fact that a man like moschus says he must think about it convinces me that he has already accepted he knows that he could do exactly as ordered and still be dismissed because of some imperial caprice rome does not reward loyalty sufficiently well to be accorded loyalty the only thing i am worried about now is this storm that is coming a mere hurricane said maria with a wry smile the call from the lookout high above blasted through the wind haraldr turned to the mast and saw moschus pulling himself up the rope ladder moschus hung about halfway up the enormous mast and looked into the night his body yawed as the wind whipped at the ropes then he jerked abruptly with alarm or astonishment or both he shouted down the deck haraldr heard part of the command but it was too late the imperial marines spears lowered were already encircling maria and him haraldr thought of leaping the railing at his back but instantly knew he was defeated he could not leave maria to an unknown fate moschus came back down the rope ladder like a huge thickbodied spider clambering through its web his face was livid he shouldered through the arc of his marines if you think you can coerce me think again varangian he shouted clenching his powerful fists i dont understand your game but while i have been hesitant to quarrel with you over this woman i will be more than eager to accept a challenge from your fleet you cannot see them yet but i ordered another three dozen dhromons and support vessels to follow behind this group simply as an exercise i will crush you haraldr looked at moschus in astonishment droungarios my fleet as you put it was reduced by a third when one ship foundered on the boom and why would i ask that fleet to challenge you now you were about to accept my offer were you not i was snapped moschus until i discovered this treachery by my count it would take a hundred wrecks to reduce your fleet by a third do you plan an invasion perhaps the empress had good purpose in putting my fleet in your pursuit and i better fortune by ordering my strength to sea haraldr looked to the north his two galleys had approached to within less than a bowshot of the dhromon which surprised him but not as much as the fact that that was all he saw i left with two ships he said in bewilderment i dont know why they are coming up but i can assure you they do not intend to attack without my signal moschus stepped forward and seized haraldrs arm very well you climb up there and if you can still maintain there are only two ships i will turn over my baton to you haraldr was only a third of the way up the swaying rope ladder when he looked out and gasped the dark hulls virtually spanned the width of the bosporus and disappeared back into a lowering mist haraldr hoped that what he saw was only a small wrinkle in the fabric of fate he shouted down to moschus those are rus ships haraldr studied the ships for a few more moments before he climbed back to the deck the imperial marines surrounded him again he faced moschus i swear to you i have no collusion in this but those are the hulls of rus merchantmen which can also be used as warships growled moschus its late in the year for a trade flotilla dont you think perhaps they have been delayed by the pechenegs said haraldr i am certain their business is peaceful droungarios haraldrs galley had come within fifty ells of the larboard and halldor hailed from the stern droungarios permission to come alongside moschus barked orders and the lionshaped bronze spout at the stern of the dhromon swivelled to address the varangian galley then he gave halldor his permission the ships drifted to within ten ells and pitched alongside each other in the heavy chop haraldr shouted halldor the fleet is rus commanded by vladimir prince of kiev haraldr sighed with relief elisevetts brother vladimir had been a puny idler the last time haraldr had seen him he couldnt attack a nest of mice droungarios shouted halldor the leader of the rus fleet wants to negotiate with the commander of the imperial fleet i know this vladimir said haraldr believe me he is without hostile capability moschus shook his head this is all too neatly contrived he scratched his beard here is what i will offer you in good faith you go and bring this vladimir to me as my hostage and i will not attack his fleet pending inquiries to the prefect and the logothete of the dromus in the meanwhile i will keep the mistress of the robes in my custody haraldr looked at maria it was clear she liked this compromise less than he did and he wondered if she was at last losing her courage he would not blame her how many times could they dance on the needle of fate he nodded to her that they must play this out maria rushed to him and clutched him with stunning power no she gasped you cannot go out there she shuddered violently hold me she pleaded hold me i am so cold i am so cold her teeth chattered and she grimaced so that she could speak you must not go out there i will never see you again she began to cry and her entire body trembled haraldr could not fathom her premonition it was only vladimir this would be settled in an hour he rocked her and stroked her hair i must he said the sooner i begin the sooner i will be back for you he forced her chin up darling remember my promise if satan himself is out there i will still come back for you haraldrs galleys pulled north through the pitching rows of rus ships according to the sliteyed little rus functionary halldor had taken aboard prince vladimir was tucked safely in the middle of his enormous fleet haraldr wondered how the hapless scamp had ever got this far with so many ships still intact the functionary pointed to a fat river ship identical to the dozens around it haraldr told ulfr to stay aboard and take command if anything happened though he was confident nothing untoward was about he strapped on his sword and laughed i would tell you to wear your byrnnie halldor but when you see this prince of rus you will be so frightened that you will leap into the sea and i dont want you to sink haraldr rowed the rus functionary and halldor across in the functionarys dinghy he helped the other two over the railing of the fat merchantman and then swung himself over for some strange reason the ship smelled like rus though he couldnt say exactly what scent produced that effect he looked up raindrops hurtled out of the darkness vladimir waited by the mast he wore a bronze breastplate and was surrounded by several wispybearded heavily armoured rus boyer whelps no more impressive than himself vladimir observed haraldr had his fathers unimpressive height and extensive girth his mothers fair skin and his sisters delicate hands his blotchy adolescent face had at last been overgrown by thin blond whiskers in addition to his armoured retainers vladimir also employed several hulking norse bodyguards who lounged in the darkness at the stern of the vessel so said vladimir with a smirk and a nonchalant flip of his head haraldr nordbrikt sigurdarson the coward of stiklestad running errands for the greeks i see how is your mother vladimir asked haraldr genially he had nothing to prove to this pathetic lot she misses your cockhound brother haraldr struggled for control and is elisevett well she is still sitting on her little twat and waiting for you to come back and marry her even when she heard that you are the famous coward you must have fucked the wits out of her haraldr stepped forward and jammed his fingers under the lower lip of vladimirs breastplate and lifted him off the ground with one hand your sister was very dear to me if you speak about her again in such a fashion i will make you swim back to kiev to apologize to her now i can help you gain entry to byzantium if you promise to watch your manners he set vladimir down slowly the droungarios of the imperial fleet i didnt come to beg my way in interrupted vladimir apparently undeterred by his humiliation i came to ask the city to surrender halldor burst into laughter haraldr was less amused you little fool have some of your norse bodyguards blown you up with dreams of conquest or is this a selfinvented folly whatever the source i suggest you reconsider there are enough fireships waiting for you out there in the night to turn the bosporus into a river of flame another voice responded from the darkness and there are enough norsemen here to bring down the walls of the great city the shrouded norseman came forward along the catwalk and drew back the hood that concealed his steel helm haraldr immediately recognized him thorvald ostenson said haraldr greeting the former centurion of the grand hetairia i should have known that the hand of mar hunrodarson was in this haraldr recalled mars cryptic words upon dying ostenson bowed we have three thousand norsemen and five thousand rus this morning mar will attack the walls from within the city and open the gates for us apparently he has spared you to flee from our triumph so go and leave the pillage of rome to true warriors halldor looked at haraldr with a rare expression of uncontainable mirth he laughed again and looked at ostenson the last time i saw your mar hunrodarson he was trying to imitate a pigeon taking wing unsuccessfully ostenson drew his sword you crowshit eater ill take you back to mar and let you share your jest with him halldor stepped forward and sent ostenson plunging into the hold with a single shove ill wait to jest with your mar when the valkyrja take me to him boylover halldor called down to ostenson your mar is drinking with odin tonight liar shouted ostenson he struggled to his feet and his head emerged above the catwalk no man could have vanquished odins champion halldor pointed to haraldr this man did he hugged him to death broke his back with one squeeze this time the laughter a soft quiet chuckle came from the vicinity of the cowed young rus nobles haraldr wondered which of these hapless whelps could possibly find their situation amusing then he saw the second norseman the bearlike giant wore a hide cape he came round in front of vladimir and his retainers haraldr knew the face at once and felt the sudden lightness and liquid knees of terror the hackedaway eyebrows the whitestreaked beard the horrible truncated nose and huge sucking nostrils i am thorir called the hound said the berserk in his curious quiet voice the haraldr sigurdarson i remember soiled his breeches when i killed his brother he was then a coward he is now a coward and a liar mar hunrodarson is one of us haraldr and halldor stood transfixed by the fearsome hound ostenson seized the opportunity and pulled halldors legs out from under him pitching him into the hold he cracked halldor on the head with a loaded bucket and stunned him and drew his knife to finish him off haraldr jumped down into the hold and grabbed ostensons arm with both hands and snapped it the crack was like an old dry tree trunk snapping he dragged the astonished ostenson to the catwalk and clamped his hands on either side of his face and picked him up ostenson he demanded were you privy to mars plan to abandon the middle hetairia to the bulgars if you were not i give you this chance to beg for your life ostensons face reddened and he glared with defiance haraldr roared from the blackest pit of the spirit world and snapped ostensons neck instantly he seized the suddenly limp body and almost unseeing from inside some redhued haze flung the huge fresh corpse into the mast the vehemence of the throw was so great that the sturdy wooden trunk fractured with yet another crack and began to tilt towards starboard the mast cracked again came down with a huge boom and fell over the starboard side of the boat ostensons mangled body lay beneath a web of toppled rigging the utterly dumbfounded rus nobles leapt for the sanctuary of the hold haraldr turned to the hound with a bloodred glow in his eyes he whipped his sword out of his scabbard with a terrifying screech and stepped forward within reach of the hounds own murderous blade i am one of you as well he said in a fierce rapt voice but i am not a cowardly berserk who needed two of his comrades to kill norways king i am haraldr sigurdarson king of norway he remembered as clearly as yesterday the hounds own words at stiklestad when we begin i will kill you the hounds brutal jaw was as slack as an old dotards his huge sloping shoulders sagged his eyes were burnedout coals he slumped to his knees like a figure of melting wax haraldr looked down on him with pitiless eyes you have told the world for years how you slew a king in single combat and then fouled a princes breeches half of that is true i was a coward then but you were a coward then and you are a coward now and you will die a coward haraldr brought his blade screaming down on the thick brutish neck the head jerked and then slumped to the chest held by a flap of flesh the neck gushed bright blood and the body of thorir the hound pitched into the hold prince vladimir screeched in terror haraldr yanked the rus prince back up on the catwalk you need to agree to the droungarioss conditions immediately the fireships will not wait for ever on your answer vladimir stood mute his lips beginning to twitch he burst into tears it is too late shrieked the rus prince tears streaming down his cheeks this negotiation was only to deceive the greeks the attack has already begun haraldr ran to the bow the front echelons of the rus fleet were advancing through the whitecapped sea a wall of thick hulls descending on the dhromons the wind hurled scudding black clouds after them and sheets of rain ripped by at a sharp angle haraldr could only stare in rigid agony the advance echelon was already within range the night turned to fire it is impossible shouted halldor we cannot sail through it as soon as the fire touches the pitch on our hull we will become a floating torch halldor and ulfr and hord wrestled haraldr until he stopped resisting the burning sea lit their faces an eerie orange and brought sweat to their foreheads the scene before them was unimaginable the fiery lakes of damnation raised to the surface of the earth the entire bosporus as far as one could see was a sheet of flame and upon this floating pyre scores of ships had become towering windwhipped flares here and there the flares exploded in immense orange fireballs that illuminated the glowering low clouds it was as if enormous blackshrouded lanterns had been suspended over the sea the rain descending in sheets did nothing to quench these flames get the dinghy from the other ship haraldr said its hull is not caulked im going with you said ulfr and i said halldor no i want you two to stay and lead my men and rule norway this i alone must do bring the boat up haraldr pleaded halldor maria was on the droungarioss dhromon she will be safe wait at least until the fire burns away a ship exploded and the light and sound flashed over the water no one is safe out there haraldr nodded numbly at the fire storm we now see the limitation of liquid fire in a general engagement when the entire sea is set on fire it burns indiscriminately the ship that just exploded was a dhromon halidor and ulfr could offer no rebuttal as the dinghy was quickly ferried over from the second galley they knew that they would honour haraldr sigurdarson more by living to conquer norway in his name than by leaping into his funeral pyre with him haraldr stripped off his cloak and wrapped a hide cape around his short wool tunic he unstrapped his sword and inserted his dagger in his belt he turned to halldor and ulfr i promised her i would come back for her i wish i could make you the same promise he paused thinking of an old verse this is how the skalds said ragnarok would be the sun grows dark earth sinks beneath the sea the stars fall from the skies flames rage and fire leaps until heaven itself is seared to ashes he looked steadily at his two friends i know i could live for three score more years and never have better men for my comrades in the valhol i will tell them to await the two best men who ever lived rule well ulfr rushed forward sobbing and embraced haraldr he had no words for this finally haraldr had to prise him away halldor grim and implacable wrapped his huge arms around haraldr we his voice choked we love you comrade haraldr leapt over the railing and into the dinghy the heat at haraldrs back was so intense he thought even his wet hide cape would burst into flame but there were passages through the blazing waves twisting treacherous evanescent currents of orangetinted water and he could see moschuss dhromon ringed by fiery patches but still intact the bow spout still spitting flame haraldr rowed furiously between crests crowned with fire he turned to adjust his course an orange burst greeted him and he smelled his singed hair burning globs rolled off his hide cape and sizzled on the hull of the dinghy he passed a blackened floating corpse the mans arms were seized up as if he were trying to claw his way out of hell finally haraldr reached a large clear path and closed to within a hundred ells of moschuss dhromon he could see marines operating the missile throwers on the deck and repulsing rus boarders at the stern a blackened hand swiped in front of him and he had a terrible glimpse of desperate white eyes against a greasy wave he put his back to the oars a firepeaked wave rose up before him and then fell away to reveal a giant beast from hell another dhromon its pitchsmeared hull completely engulfed in flames came hurtling out of the enraged sea it was a wall of fire descending on him haraldr threw aside his cape and leapt he swam under water for perhaps fifty ells he saw no flames above him he surfaced to an immense crash and felt the shock even in the water the burning dhromon had collided with moschuss flagship bow to bow a blinding explosion flung shattered glowing timbers into the air haraldr went under again when he surfaced embers still drifted to the sea around him both bows were now rapidly descending beneath the waves moschuss ship listed to the larboard and the fire spread along the hull the stern was still free of flames and haraldr stroked wildly for it fire began to leap along the pitchslathered strakes but the tacky surface gave haraldrs slippery feet purchase he scrambled across the slope of the vast tilting hull he reached the railing and saw marines trying to walk upright on the steeply inclined deck the bow was an inferno dead marines lay on the deck in blackened armour the ornate cabin at the stern was still intact and haraldr scrambled for it ascending the increasingly sloping deck the gilded door had been flung open and he ducked into the chartstrewn office of the droungarios maria he screamed an officer in a gold breastplate appeared a small lacquer casket under his arm where is the woman bellowed haraldr he grabbed the officers arms and shook him the casket tumbled to the deck and gold coins scattered the officer shook his head numbly and haraldr released him and stepped back through the door the slender but powerful arms seized him from behind god you are alive gasped maria as haraldr turned to wrap her in his arms holy mother you are alive i promised i would hold you again even in the shadow of the dragon he held her as if this embrace would last them for eternity and because his eyes were closed he could only feel not see the line of flame bursting through the deck of the dhromon in the instant before the ship exploded halldor rolled over the floating blackened corpse and studied the charred lump that had once been a head unable to identify it he pushed the corpse away with a staff fitted with an improvised grapple on the end the body was quickly rejoined by dozens of nipping fish who can tell he said wearily to ulfr you cannot even tell a woman from a man much less a rus from a roman he straightened and looked out over a calmed sea littered with countless fragments of flickering wreckage and a few stillblazing hulks should we wait until dawn asked ulfr it is only an hour halldor shook his head we probably would have no better chance of finding them in the light of day and who could sleep halldor hooked another floating corpse a legless form with curled foetal arms the hands were merely crusted bones he pushed it away after the most cursory examination this is no way for men to die said halldor bitterly to a flame that has no courage or loyalty that kills friend and foe alike that does not even allow a man the dignity of seeing the face that has sent his soul on if this flame were set loose upon the earth it would mean the end of all that is noble in the world and it would shame the very gods at the moment of their death when the gods destroy rome i pray that they will also bring about the end of this fire of doom there will always be another rome said ulfr sadly good men not the gods must banish this fire from the world ulfr looked out over the strange flameflecked calmness of the sea the wind had pushed the clouds to the south and stars were becoming visible on the northern horizon his head snapped forward and he pointed there is one who lives halldor ordered the ship to manoeuvre for the rescue there are two of them shouted ulfr one living one dead said halldor that is devotion to a comrade a norseman shouted ulfr as the forms drifted closer one of the fools who started this hes still got his boy lover under his arm halldor froze with a sickening collision of recognition exultation and horror not a boy but a dead woman a woman with her hair singed to a matted cap but the man lived get this boat over there you mindless swine halldor screamed to the crew in general he pounded ulfr on the chest haraldr haraldr haraldr is alive haraldr cradled marias body with his left arm her head to a sky bluing with the first hints of dawn he stroked weakly with his right arm so slowly that he only succeeded in remaining afloat his cheeks were bleeding and much of his hair had been singed away ulfr and halldor leaned over the top frame to receive him haraldr spat water and his white teeth grimaced like a demons help maria he said halldor gently lifted the body only tatters of clothing around her torso had not been burned away and parts of her legs and arms were covered with blackened flesh that stuck to halldors hands he gritted his teeth and prayed for the gods to curse any man who took this fire in his hands ever again he laid her gently on the decking by the tiller and found a linen rain cape to cover her he could not bear to pull the shroud over her head even as seared as her face was there was still the beauty of her features an exquisite marble darkened with soot haraldrs woollen tunic was intact and his head and hands seemed to have suffered the worst burns the skin was raw but not badly charred ulfr lifted him over the top frame and he found his feet on the deck he slumped with his hands on his knees and looked up with white stunned eyes as ulfr steadied him i lost her he said sobbing if only i could have held her tighter she was ripped out of my arms and i lost her he fell to his knees beside marias body oh god save her give her back to me he turned to halldor and ulfr she is alive he said frantically she talked to me in the water she forgave me oh merciful god allfather ulfr knelt beside haraldr haraldr no one survives such wounds let maria have her death haraldr calmed himself she is alive he reached over and grasped her hand oblivious to the sticky serum that coated the skin darling dont go reason struck him like a thunderbolt and he remembered how she had stilled in his arms at least an hour ago she was he turned to ulfr and whispered she is gone i know that if i could only talk to her again just once if only i could say one thing it it would be my eternity she is watching you from paradise said halldor she knows i swear to you she knows your heart at this moment almost perfunctorily halldor bent over and felt the pulse at marias neck he knelt his finger still to the artery he looked up expressionless there is life but the thread that holds it is gossamer maria was wrapped in blankets and eilif a varangian who had learned some roman and saracen healing arts put a greasy salve on the worst burns and gently prodded marias abdomen she stirred and groaned slightly eilif looked at haraldr still clutching marias hand and then at halldor and shook his head sadly he whispered to halldor shes broken inside as well she will be gone soon theres nothing more i can do halldor motioned everyone away haraldr maintained his desperate vigil trying to will her back his soul was cold to the core and yet somewhere a light flickered he struggled for that light as he had when it had meant his own life the tips of her fingers twitched slightly and then the life came back slowly her hand no longer simply rested in his but knew his touch she pressed his fingers as weakly as an infant her head rocked and her eyes fluttered beneath her scorched lids and then the miracle the thing he had willed and prayed for a glimmering like sapphires hidden among ashes he squeezed her hand gently and leaned over her my darling my lifetime dont look at me she whispered hoarsely i am a cinder haraldr struggled to control himself his entire life was here in these blessed few moments to be lived with dignity or squandered in futile tears you were never more beautiful to me than when you played the old crone in neorion he whispered fighting his tears with all his force until now now i see the soul without any artifice and it is more dazzling than any sight i have ever seen marias body shuddered and her breath came in short uneven gasps her eyes closed but she fought her way back darling she whispered you must know this that day we wondered if death could tell us if our souls had been true to us or had only worn masks she fought again for breath i know now that my soul has never lied to me or to you her throat rattled and her head rolled from side to side but her eyes became lucid again cold tears burned haraldrs raw face i believe more than anything in the truth of your soul to you and to me your soul will always be in my soul you will touch whomever i touch for the rest of my life the gates of resolve shattered and he broke down oh my love i would give anything if god would exchange our fates oh god i did not mean to kill you stop this she hissed tilting her head up with an enormous will you were my miracle my resurrection listen to me i have seen what follows the fiery end of the world it is not the darkness i lived in before you came inside me death is not dark there is the light there is only light you promised me darling now i promise you i will come to you and hold you again even after the last black dragon flies i promise you i will hold you in the light there is only light and only love marias head fell back from the great effort of speech haraldr felt the strength ebb from her hand but he would not let her go in the darkness he spent the long hour to the dawn in a lifetime of memories smelling her dark hair and feeling her white skin and hearing her crystal laugh just as the sun brought pink life over the deathfouled bosporus marias head turned to him she did not open her eyes but her lips moved several times somehow she formed the words the king beyond the creek her head rolled back a short while later she whispered love and a smile flickered over her face the sun rose above the green banks of asia and glittered the water a brilliant shaft slanted over the railing and struck marias crusted face her eyes opened and haraldr clutched her hand tightly and leaned over her the colour of her irises was like some rare and impossibly lovely blue gold then maria simply closed her eyes and haraldr felt her soul leave her body and enter his epilogue northumbria england september the trumpets sounded and the ducks flocked skywards from the calm surface of the river ouse as if by this command the eggblue mists began to lift the norsemen began to leap over the sides of their dragonships and assemble on the damp grassy flats beside the river there were enough of them to populate an entire city the clearing air had the dry fragrance of a lingering summer that would not yield to fall the day would be hot the king of norway waited on the bank his diamondsharp blue eyes sweeping over the long rows of lean swoopingprowed norse dragons the most powerful invasion force the world had yet seen awaited his bidding his army gathered in a vast cordon his court men crowding next to him eager for the honour their banners limp in the quiescent air proudly set the warriors fanned out in a vast cordon that blanketed the treedotted slopes to the north the king waited for their jubilant banter to fall to a reverent hush comrades bellowed the king northmen men of ireland men of scotland men of flanders men of england he waited for the answer alvardr haraldr hradskyndir haraldr hrodaudiger haraldr haraldr hardraada haraldr hardraada the gale of norse acclaim was mixed with the oaths of the other tongues ducks raced overhead their startled protests unheard a golden sliver of sun shimmered on the horizon brave comrades the kings seamed face blazed with the force of his words five days ago we showed england the iron fist of our allied might the corpses of the fyrd of northumbria built a bridge for you across the river humber the army exploded in another chorus of triumph and king haraldr waited until the echoes vanished today we go to stamford bridge to accept the victory we won at fulford gate we come to accept all of england north of the ouse again the chorus of triumph but today we must show england the open hand of our just intentions we have come to rule not to pillage we have come to govern not to slaughter the army cheered with lessened enthusiasm haraldr looked around at the sea of bloodeager faces that could have inundated him in an instant if they did not at this moment worship him he caught the sparkling blue eyes of eystein orre the ferocious already legendary orcock his fiercest commander the man who had annihilated the english rear and centre in the overwhelming victory at fulford gate the man who reminded haraldr of the untroubled glories of his own youth the man who would be husband to the kings firstborn his most beloved his daughter maria eystein dipped his shaggy blond head in understanding if necessary he would second his king in this haraldr turned to the other young man whose martial spirit he did not have to rely on but without whose understanding he could not endure his son and heir olaf did not need to nod his approval this had been the precociously wise princes counsel the previous night haraldr sought the love in his sons lucid blue eyes and considered the legacy norways king was now forging for his people a mighty northern empire at last on the verge of unification eystein orre with the sword to preserve it quiet olaf with the wisdom to govern it and of course maria eystein and olaf would be their own men and that was all norway would need but in his daughter maria the king himself would live on haraldr waited for the halfhearted cheers to erode into the inevitable murmur of relatively polite grumbling then he signalled for his stewards to unlace the leather thongs that tightly cinched his byrnnie the stewards lifted his byrnnie away from him like foundry workers removing a plaster caste from a statue the king emerged in a glasssmooth blue silk tunic and his army buzzed with astonishment warriors i do not need armour to accept hostages and appoint governors so i leave behind my emma the woman who has been truest to me in battle besides the day will be hot and this ladys tight embrace would boil me like a fat goose in a kettle the king stroked his thickening middle to illustrate the reason for the tight fit the army followed with a vast exhalation of laughter eystein orre stepped out of his byrnnie and the fashion of the day was established as the norsemen stripped off their body armour they retained their helms spears and swords as they would on a journey to a market or church the english pretender earl tostig sought haraldrs ear my lord he said his ruddy forehead scowling i do not advise this i have ruled over northumbria myself and if the english are the most untrustworthy of folk the northumbrians are the most untrustworthy of englishmen haraldr studied tostigs perpetually tormented face he often wondered what fate had encouraged him to care for this difficult man whom he had disliked so much at first tostigs offer to sponsor a conquest of england against tostigs own brother king harold godwinnson had seemed preposterous as well as treacherous at first and yet as tostigs case had unfolded as haraldr had learned how he had been favoured for the succession by old king edward only to be undone by his rivals at court haraldr had pitied him and when he saw the mans remarkable unwavering love for his wife judith the sister of the duke of flanders he had begun to like him if only haraldrs love for his queen elisevett had been as constant and finally it had been ulfr who had convinced king haraldr that tostig was a man who would be true to him ulfr god in heaven if only ulfr could be here what fate had taken dear ulfr on the eve of the triumph he had so long laboured for even during the times when his king had lost hope it is a risk i must take haraldr told his english ally i learned that bitter lesson in denmark to rule without the affection of a people is to wage endless war crush the army yes but the people are won with fairness and mercy however i do not entirely discount the risk you remind me of haraldr recalled the portents that had pursued his great fleet like screeching gulls throughout the long voyage from norway someone had dreamed of ravens perched on the stern of each ship another man had seen a wolf precede the english armies a norseman in his bloody jaws haraldr himself had spoken to his dead brother olaf in a dream and had received a foreboding of danger but then perhaps that was merely his own fear of conquering where olaf had never dared all great ventures spawned great anxieties so far the ravens had fed only on english corpses still when fate cautioned only a fool laughed how ancient were the scars of that truth on his weary heart haraldr beckoned to olaf and eystein orre my eaglets he said in greeting to their unlined ready faces i go to accept a surrender which is a duty appropriate to a man who has been bowed by five decades i want to leave behind my strength however i will take most of the allies and half our norsemen with me that should be sufficient to impress the english but i want my best norse fighters to remain here and guard the ships without which we are all lost eystein you will command them in my absence and of course olaf you must also stay i go to grasp the future but without my brave and able eaglets to nurture it that future will be as good as stillborn eystein and olaf gave their assent and haraldr sigurdarson king of norway the greatest warrior of his age made the announcement to his army overhead in the warming sky a line of ducks soared south in a sharp dark vee the last butterflies of the season still frolicked over the verdant banks of the river derwent stamford bridge the crossroads leading to the city of york was less than a rowingspell away across the gentle green land haraldr walked with his new marshal styrkar and the earl tostig the unarmoured army behind them was almost ten thousand men a loose lazy formation that frequently lost many of its constituents to the beckoning meadows and cooling river you know this william the bastard do you not haraldr asked tostig yes duke william of normandy is married to my wifes niece do you believe that his invasion fleet has already sailed they have been gathered at the mouth of the dive for some time the weather delays or perhaps williams caution but should they land the normans and their allies will only be a factor after we defeat my brother my brother is no fool he will turn to meet the greater threat with his strength undiminished duke william is an able huntsman you are haraldr hardraada my brother harold will face you first but will your brother come north to confront us or wait in defence of london if he is as skilled as his reputation suggests he will wait and allow us to extend ourselves he is unpredictable and moves rapidly but if he comes north we will have at least a week to prepare for him haraldr nodded whether he comes north or not i must rely on the goodwill of the people of northumbria to guard my back that is why no armour can help us win the battle i am waging today the king suddenly increased his stride and walked out ahead of tostig the royal marshal styrkar held tostig back the king wishes to take his own counsel whispered styrkar i understand him said tostig i entertain my own demons when my wife is with me they are kept at bay i presume his daughter does the same for him the pretty daughter the changeable one maria styrkar laughed we say that our king and his daughter maria are so close that there is but one life between the two of them you can see the way their eyes go to each other at the table they know what the other is thinking he will begin a sentence she will finish it they will both laugh when no one else does it is shame that he cannot be as close to her mother queen elisevett is a fine woman tostigs scowl seemed to deepen why did he take a second wife styrkar shrugged to bear him sons after elisevett bore him the two princesses she could no longer conceive haraldr said that he had known two women condemned to offer their love on the altar of state and he would not permit that for his daughters so he got the bishop to accede he has great influence over the church as you have seen and wed the eventual mother of his sons without a divorce from elisevett yes i have met her tora a noble woman elisevett still has precedence you saw how he allowed her and of course maria to sail with us as far as the orkneys while tora had to bid him farewell in nidaros he loves elisevett the best of his wives styrkar grinned and she loves him the best of her husbands but it would take an irish scribe to trace the jealousies that separate them they say he has always loved a greek woman that was before i knew him it may be one of those tales invented by the skalds the king walked ahead for a long while alone as if drawn to stamford bridge by the suncoloured butterflies darting before him rather than the imperative of the impatient armies at his back the day was his vindication his resurrection there had been so many times through these long years when he had wondered why fate had taken maria and spared him the constant quarrels with fractious jarls the long bitter inconclusive war in denmark the guilt he felt about elisevett circumstances that never would have come about if he were only a man and not a king so many times he had thought of halldor and his friends strange renunciation and he wondered if halldor had been perhaps the wisest of them all it was halldor who had never really recovered from that night so long ago who had always been haunted by the burned and broken body of the one woman he had never made love to halldor had helped haraldr regain his throne and then he had gone back to iceland to live quietly on a farm haraldr wondered if halldor had received news of ulfrs death yet the road of life so many turns and yet now that road had levelled into a glorious autumn today would at last consummate what he had so long ago dreamed of with her for her this would have been marias empire she who had left behind her own imperial legacy to join him in what had then been only a promise what for her had meant only death he wondered if she approved of him now he knew there had been many times over these years when she had not that too was one of lifes strange paths the route her spirit had taken through his life sometimes he could reach out and touch her at other times he could not even remember her voice he could never see her in her entirety but often he could recall distinctly the parts of her the incandescent irises the gullwing eyebrows the soft white inside of her thigh he thought of the maria who had taken her place in his life she was as distinct as his hand before him not only the young woman she was now but the infant the child the adolescent every phase of her life even the first maria never could have been that close to have been created by him to become a woman as he watched in wonder and yet his daughter maria could never share with him the supreme intimacy that the other maria had shared with him perhaps he often thought the two marias the daughter and the lover were different aspects of the same soul that through him his first maria had so deeply touched her namesake that she lived again to restore that joy to his breast there were times when the two marias were that much alike or so he remembered and yet times when they did not seem alike at all there were even moments albeit fleeting when he thought of elisevett as the first and greatest love of his life in the world as it was not as it had seemed to be so long ago beside the bosporus what more could a man ask from a wife except to know that from time to time he loved her above all else and tora who had given him sons and love how could she be denied her claim to his heart perhaps they were all aspects of the same soul of the great love that only youth can know just as an old mans shattered dreams are all fragments of the single pure incandescent purpose he had imagined as a young man the dream seemed pure and whole again today but he would give it away to the young men who could truly believe in it but the love was not the same as the dream the dream had faded and crumbled and had now been restored but the love had never faded it was only in many different places now she had been the source of the light and as best he could he had shared it with many let them raid the cattle haraldr said to styrkar his voice edged with annoyance i will pay for whatever they plunder but if they begin to molest the peasants i will send my housekarls down after them haraldr watched the norse warriors wade the reedchoked shallows of the languid derwent then scatter over the broad very gradually sloping meadows on the west side of the river several bowshots to the north where the little river narrowed and the banks steepened stood stamford bridge a simple structure of wooden trestles and rotting planking the king and his retinue stood on a grassy flat about thirty ells above the dull silver water the sun was at its zenith the heat oppressive haraldr wished the wind would come up and evaporate the sweat from his soggy silk tunic what is that asked styrkar he pointed to a thick haze visible at the western horizon just above a ridge line about eight or nine bowshots distant haraldr shaded his eyes with his palm i imagine it is the people of the countryside come out to see us he said they will find we are no different from them haraldr turned and watched his housekarls wager on spear tosses he remembered that he had played the same game with olafs housekarls on the magic innocent day before stiklestad had sent his destiny gyring i will never have more courage than i did the day before stiklestad thought haraldr no man who has seen battle can ever be as brave as one who has not and yet i can be proud that in every one of my fights while i was always afraid i never turned my back of course i have never met the ultimate test of courage either as so many of my foes have as maria and ulfr and olaf and jarl rognvald and so many of my comrades have each of them showed the valour i have yet to prove and the woman had been the bravest i hope the next battle is my last he told styrkar his voice musing distracted his marshal lifted his fine golden eyebrows in surprise when we go south to meet king harold godwinnson clarified haraldr when he is defeated that will be the end of my wars of conquest you and eystein orre can settle with my remaining enemies i wish to govern i have fought my entire life and i have seen too many terrible battles i will soon have grandchildren you showed no reluctance to fight five days ago said styrkar the fashion in which you drew the english vanguard on holding back your strength and then crushed them at the centre and rear i learned a lesson that day i learned that lesson from a greek his name was it is impossible i could have forgotten i can see his face before me i will remember it before the day is over he was a friend of mine haraldr frowned nicon blymmedes domestic of the imperial excubitores he was transferred to italia i should have liked to have known what happened to him if he lives he has heard of you said styrkar intending no flattery styrkar looked west again are those our men that far off he asked haraldr looked towards the ridge and saw through a rising haze of dust the glint of sun off steel those are not our men he said bring tostig to me a few moments later tostig came to haraldrs side a broad front of armoured men had begun to spill down from the ridge a descending wall of iceofbattle tostig stared out and then turned to haraldr his eyes sharp with frustration and rage english he said you have perhaps risked too much today haraldr studied the rapidly moving vanguard fast cavalry thousands of them that was why there was so much dust the fyrd of northumbria could not have that many horses left he observed to tostig his own logic chilling him tostig and haraldr watched in silence for a long while as the horsemen followed by a solid mass of infantry came spilling down the ridge in glittering rows the banners in the vanguard were like gold lanterns flickering in the dusty pall across the river the cattle raiders abandoned their few trophies and began to form for a valiant defence of the river haraldr did not order them called back he would need the time their lives would buy the wind at last blew almost as if the huge vault of heaven had been stirred by the massive movement across the river derwent haraldr felt the chill against his back the goldembroidered english banners lifted styrkar pointed to the tiny figures in the distance two goldthreaded scintillae rising above the steelsilvered english vanguard there said tostig softly incredulity reducing his voice almost to a whisper the dragon of wessex and the fighting man of harold godwinnson the banners of the king of england somehow my brother has attached wings to his army and flown it north the wings of the dragon said haraldr as he watched the huge army come down to the river like a silver avalanche we must withdraw to the ships said tostig our armour and our reinforcements no said haraldr their horse would overtake us easily and cut down our backs i will dispatch couriers to the ships to summon eystein and then we will stand and fight the reedstubbled shallows were coppery with blood the norse cattle raiders had fought valiantly but the english van had forded the river and now waited just out of bowshot on the banks below the flats on the east side of the river their ranks were disciplined and murmuring quiet a sound far more frightening than the pointless bravado of a rabble the english ambassadors a group of about twenty richly armoured officers rode forward on their horses at their head was a mediumsized redbearded man who wore a golden helm and carried a redenamelled shield embossed with a gilded hawk the man announced himself as a representative of the english king haraldr ordered his spearbristled shieldwall to open and admit them haraldr dispatched tostig as his ambassador he watched from thirty ells away as tostig conversed with the kings representative who remained sitting proudly in his saddle it was obvious that the dialogue was as stiff and formal as the emissarys postures after a curt exchange the horsemen bowed and rode back through the shieldwall tostig returned to haraldr he offers me a third of his kingdom if i will abandon you said tostig indeed and what is offered norways king he offers you seven feet of english earth haraldr laughed well spoken do you wish to accept his parlay too little and too late i will take what is offered the king of norway haraldr nodded ulfr had not been wrong who was the man you spoke with he was a fine sight so tall in his stirrups for a little man tostig dropped his dark grey eyes that was the king harold godwinnson haraldrs rage flared momentarily had he known he might have sacrificed his honour to save his men but kinship was the strangest of all bonds he had seen that time and again in his life i understand why you would not give him up said haraldr after his anger had subsided i am grateful you did not give me up haraldr laughed again seven feet of english earth a man once told me that a king would one day show me mercy but then that particular man was a craven liar haraldr turned to styrkar we have not accepted terms tell the men their king has composed some verse for them haraldr was announced and for a moment he stood silently at the centre of the immense square shieldfort he wondered if odin had merely fooled him with the verses that had seemed so fully formed minutes ago he had become too much a christian odin had been the boys god and then the wind rustled from the spirit world and he found the words the ring of spear points around him seemed ineffably beautiful like a garden of silver blossoms in battlestorm no refuge we seek behind our hollowed shields as once i was bade by the highborn maiden high to hold my head when the valkyrja flock to the clash of swords and skulls when he was finished with the words he could hear only the wind whistling in his ears hold them back styrkar the grotesque carpet of fallen englishmen sprawled over the slope beneath the norse shieldwall the shadows of the dead had lengthened in the descending sun and begun to take on eerie life as if they were dark little demons fleeing the flesh the english cavalry had not sortied against the invincible norse defences for a quarter of an hour now a quarter of an hour in which the frenzy of the norsemen had built with the violent suddenness of a summer storm and now came the thunder of axes on shields the footsteps of an army of titans unbidden by the norse commanders the spontaneous rage of men who had fought well all afternoon as defenders and now lusted for their own attack hold them back haraldr shouted again but he was already too late the shieldwall bulged into a broad snout and then the bright cloaks and gleaming steel blades and helms swept down the rise nothing could be done to stop the mass suicide the wall that the overwhelming english force had been unable to dent had now been broken by the very will that had kept it intact all afternoon the din below was deafening as english cavalry and infantry rallied along their broad front on the river even styrkar and tostig had disappeared into the raging fray as the norse charged to the river the entire english formation seemed to contract an enormous organism preparing to engulf and ingest the norse salient quickly the massed norse attack was isolated into desperate pockets of survival haraldr had fostered the cult of bravery among his men and now their deaths were their terrible homage to him haraldr stood on the plateau above the trickling coppery derwent and realized that there was only one way to save norways legacy follow the doomed attack with an assault of such devastating force that the shieldwall could reform haraldr turned and faced the weaponbristled ring of his housekarls four score strong the bravest men in the north no words were necessary their proud eyes glowed with the fury of their calling he wondered for a moment if he was still equal to such youthful passion and then he mastered his fear with the reflex of a lifetime too many had gone before him were waiting for him for death to daunt his breast now the norse boar plunged down the embankment at its deadly snout the king of norway the goldthreaded banner called landravager snapping in the breeze above him and as the norse housekarls ripped aside the english ranks the golden dragon above the head of the king of norway moved inexorably towards the golden dragon of wessex flying above englands king but haraldr sigurdarson was only vaguely conscious of this collision of destinies he knew only the cold black wind of the spirit world he did not know how long he remained in the underworld only that his quest in the darkness was much longer than ever before and he emerged to a silent world viewed through a strange glass that scattered images of banners and bright cloaks and thrusting diamondtipped spears like the tesserae of a shattered mosaic yet presented the tiniest details in the sharpest focus the white halo on the edge of a swinging sword the sparks leaping like tiny fireflies as a javelin pierced a steel byrnnie finally haraldr saw the golden dragon of wessex just beyond the cobbled ford a hundred ells south of stamford bridge he could almost distinguish the separate threads of the embroidery the king beyond the creek and destinys conundrum would he die this time to serve the fate he had cheated once or had he always been fated to conquer this way the king beyond the creek odin chose for him with a scream that literally brought the rank of english infantry before him to their knees the norse king charged forward leaving even the precarious sanctuary at the snout of the boar behind the mounted guard of the english king fell back from the single scything axe of haraldr sigurdarson transfixed by the inevitability of his blade haraldr charged them mindless of the corpses he stepped over and felt the water cold in his boots for an instant he met the eyes of harold godwinnson before the english king was crowded back by his retreating guard destinys merchant began to ford the shallow derwent to victory after three steps haraldr focused on another fragmented epiphany across the river the thick rough fingers whitened against the bowstring and haraldr glanced up at the english archers eyes and saw the redblack gleam of the raven the arrow was still for a moment and he could see the trueness of the shaft and the black steel barb at its head then the arrow blurred and flew across the river haraldr heard the instant thrumming skirl just before the barb struck him in the neck the contact felt like nothing more than a hard blow from the hand in a wrestling match haraldr braced himself awaiting the adversaries who even now would not come against him his housekarls closed behind him then he felt the warmth over his collarbone and was surprised to find that he had fallen to his knees his guard swept past him and now every sound of the battle came to him the music of steel the shattering of wood and the cracking of bones the curses and grunts of men and the highpitched terror of horses he could no longer stay on his knees and fell back but something caught his head and held him up he did not recognize the face looming above him until the skald thjodolf spoke he could not make sense of the words but somehow knew the voice over the shouts of his housekarls he was conscious he knew that thjodolf and some of his housekarls had pulled him to the east bank of the narrow river he thought he would live until he tried to breathe and felt the blood in his windpipe tostig was beside him accept your brothers terms gasped haraldr as i have save yourself and my men they will not accept that nor will i i will drink with you tonight haraldr hardraada haraldr could not answer and he closed his eyes and accepted the beauty of his death in the arms of a skald and a brave man his housekarls still fierce around him the gods loved him still he saw the beautiful vivid images of the life that lingered in deaths shadow eight years old in a dark cool forest his fingers against the grainy surface of a rune stone olaf bringing him a toy ship elisevett as a girl her downy cheek maria her eyes like blue lanterns in the night daughter maria making a face at him as he sat in counsel on his high seat even his father sygurd syr more clearly than he had ever seen him so much beauty the deaths forgotten only life and then the cold hands closed around his neck and the shadows deepened and the rustle of the huge wings announced the darkening sky fear ran cold through his dying limbs he girded his will to face the final test of being to meet the last dragon he could not even draw a final desperate breath as he fell away from life into the dark well of oblivion there was no dragon he realized at the end nor had there ever been one in reality the last dragon had no shape or form but was merely a blackness so complete and devastating that to give it any shape however terrifying was to endow it with a mercy that did not exist in the last endless night of the world here at last was the cold dark core of being and creation and here at last was true fear the fear that only the dead could know from this horrifying vastness haraldr cried out in unspeakable craven agony unheard in the emptiness crying out for himself and those he had loved for all mankind who would some day know this terrible loneliness had he known death as the living never can he would have cursed the day he was born to serve fate darkness would always win the final victory in the unforgiving pall a light flickered a pinpoint in the limitless void he watched in wonder as the single star grew suddenly expanding like a golden dome beneath an obsidian sky the dome came over him and she came towards him out of the light a creature of light and he knew at once the liquid gold of her walk and the blue gold of her eyes for a moment he was surprised that she was his other maria as well but then he understood she reached out and took him in her weightless arms of pure light as she had promised so long ago on the bosporus and in the last moment before his reason became infinite haraldr knew the truth of all she had told him in the end beyond the dragon there is only light and only love afterword the english king harold godwinnson did extend haraldr sigurdarson a certain posthumous mercy he permitted haraldrs son olaf to bring his fathers body back to norway king haraldr was laid to rest in the royal cathedral that he had built in nidaros the maria kirke but the kings beloved daughter maria was not waiting among the mourners history has recorded that she died suddenly and inexplicably on the exact day and hour of her fathers death king olaf haraldrson ruled norway for several decades of such unprecedented peace and stability that the son of the worlds greatest warrior became known as olaf the quiet so it was that stamford bridge marked the end of the era of norse conquest in europe the viking age was over but even in death haraldr sigurdarson served as destinys instrument immediately following the dearly purchased victory over the unarmoured norsemen king harold godwinnson of england was forced to march his severely mauled army south to meet the norman invasion force under duke william the bastard on october near the town of hastings the two forces met to determine the fate of england despite their reduced strength the english were on the verge of victory when a premature pursuit of the beaten foe brought them the same fate the norsemen had suffered at stamford bridge duke william by far the least of the three men who contested for england in the autumn of became almost by default william the conqueror the normans were able to exploit the wealth of england to dominate europe for the next century and a half as well as lead the crusades to the holy land by the time this norman century had ended the shape of the modern world had begun to evolve if haraldr sigurdarson had not removed his mail coat on the morning of september the politics and culture of that world even the language we speak would most likely be very different today fate reckoned with the byzantine empire just five years after the death of haraldr sigurdarson on august at manzikert in eastern asia minor the poorly maintained armies of imperial rome were routed by the seljuk turks and the emperor romanus iv was taken prisoner the loss of the empires breadbasket was a mortal blow followed by an extended agonizing death the city of constantinople fell to venetian treachery in but a pathetic vestige of the empire was restored in finally in with the city virtually depopulated and most of its glories fallen into ruin the ottoman turks succeeded in breaching the walls and deposing the last roman emperor today the towering walls have crumbled and there are but scattered fragments of the imperial palace only the fragile magnificence of the hagia sophia stripped of the symbols of the pantocrator who once anointed the rulers of the entire world beneath its golden dome remains as testament to the enduring glory and invincible might of byzantium
