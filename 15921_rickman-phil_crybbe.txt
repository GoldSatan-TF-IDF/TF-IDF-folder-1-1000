crybbe phil rickman prologue in crybbe night did not fall night rose it welled out of the bitter brown earth caged in brambles in the neglected wood beyond the churchyard swarming up the trees until they turned black and began to absorb the sky collecting the shadows of graves the night seeped out of the churchyard and across the vicarage lawn where murray beech stood knowing he was the wrong vicar for this parish but not knowing there couldnt be a right one murray with a certain distaste was wondering how you went about an exorcism in the centre of the town patches of night gathered like damp about the roots of timberframed buildings theyd been turned into shops now and offices and flats but they still shambled around the square like sad old drunks puddles of night stained the boots of jack preece plodding across the cobbles to toll the curfew bell from the parish church as he did every night and would go on doing until as being a farmer he expected arthritis got him and young jonathon took over when jack went to ring the old bell he walked alone nobody else on the streets the town holding its breath even the sagging old buildings seeming to tense their timbers nobody went into the cock nobody came out same with the lamb down the street tradition there was a passageway a few yards from the steps of the cock the pubs upper storey bellying out above it this was another of the places where the night was born and the only place from which in the minutes before the curfew you could sometimes hear distinct sounds moans and squeals and panting silly young buggers to prevent this kind of thing there used to be an iron gate across the passageway with a lock but when they turned the building at the bottom of the passage into a radio studio they took the gate off this was a matter of some concern to the town council of which jack preece was a member his father jimmy preece was the mayor and negotiations were in hand with offas dyke radio and the marches development board to get the gate replaced why same reason as old percy weale had given back in the sixteenth century for the institution of the curfew to safeguard the moral welfare of the town what other reason could there be minnie seagrove sixty three a widow had no doubts at all where the night began it began in that thing they called the tump she could see it from the big front window of her bungalow on the ludlow road nobody else could see it better not that she wanted to ugly great lumps like this were ten a penny in the north and the midlands where mrs seagrove had lived only in those areas they were known as industrial spoilheaps and were gradually removed in landscaping and reclamation schemes however this thing this tump wouldnt be going anywhere it was protected it was an ancient monument supposed to have been a prehistoric burial mound originally and then in the middle ages there might have been a castle on top although there were no stones there any more mrs seagrove didnt see the point in preserving just a big unpleasant hump with a few trees on top it was obviously not natural and if it was left to her the council would be hiring gomer parry with his bulldozers and his diggers to get rid of it because that might also get rid of the black thing that ran down from the mound in the twilight and scared the life out of minnie seagrove all right shed say to herself i know i know i could simply draw the curtains switch on the telly and forget all about it after all i never noticed it not once when frank was alive but then there didnt seem to be so many power cuts when frank was alive how it came about she was watching telly one night coming up to news at ten and the power went off and so she automatically went across to the window to see if the lights were on across the river in the town and that was when she first saw it horrible really horrible it was well it was like the night itself bounding down from the tump and rushing off hungry into the fields but why cant you just stop looking why cant you stay well away from that window when its going dark i dont know thats the really frightening thing i dont know yes i do its because i can feel when its there no matter what im doing whats on telly or the radio or what im reading ever since i first dashed to the window during that power cut ive always known when its on its way down from the mound without even going to the window i know when its there and the reason i look the reason i have to look even though it scares me half to death is that i have to know i have to be sure that it isnt coming this way crybbe a small onetime market town within sight of offas dyke the earthwork raised in the dark ages to separate england from wales a town like a dozen others on either side of the border less distinctive than most except that here the night rose part one some persons have supernormal powers not of a magitien but of a peculiar and scientific qualitie dr john dee letter to lord burghley chapter i sometime and please god make it soon they were going to have to sell this place and on evenings like this when the sky sagged and the bricks of the houses across the street were the colour of dried blood fay would consider how theyd have to bait the trap on a fresh page of the spiralbound notepad she wrote for sale bijou cottage in small historic town amid spectacular welsh border scenery close to all amenities yet with lovely open views to rear across pastoral countryside towards offas dyke reasonably priced at what you couldnt make it too cheap or theyd be suspicious and with good reason shed suggest to her dad that they place the ad in the sunday times or the observer under rural property these were the columns guaranteed to penetrate the london suburbs where the dreamers lived they probably wouldnt have heard of crybbe but it did sound appealing didnt it cosy and tucked away or alternatively rather mysterious if that was what you were looking for fay found herself glancing at the bookshelves full of illusions she saw the misty green spine of walking the welsh marches the enigmatic old straight track by alfred watkins and the worst offender j m powyss the old golden land which suggested that the border country was full of secret doorways through which you could penetrate ancient mysteries and lots of pictures taken through lenses coated with vaseline and wishful thinking she would really hate doing this to somebody selling the house and perpetuating the myth but not as much as shed hate having to stay here and you couldnt let your conscience run away with your life could you anyway there were some people like say the newsomes who rather deserved what this town was doing to them off to the pub the canon called merrily from the hall fay can you hear me i said im off to the boozer ok dad spot of social intercourse youll be lucky fay watched him stride past the window towards the town square the old devil still looked deceptively fit for someone who ever so slowly was going mad he would put on a wonderful performance for the prospective purchasers always assuming they caught him on one of his better days that santa claus beard and the matching twinkle theyd love him more importantly theyd trust him the poor sods but before she could unleash this ample bundle of ecclesiastical charm on the punters there was just one minor difficulty to overcome the canon didnt appear to want to leave crybbe ever this was the central problem in fays life this was what kept her awake at night christ how could he he didnt tramp the hills wasnt much interested in peregrine falcons or otters or bogorchids how for gods sake could he bear to go on living in this nohope town now that the woman whod brought him here had been dead for nearly a year other recent settlers kept saying what a little haven it was convincing themselves a handful of retired people most of them rather younger than the canon drifted into the town every year the kind who told themselves they needed to be closer to nature but nature for them amounted to a nice view they came here not to die but to fade out to sit amid soft greenery until they grew frail and lighter than air and the wind blew them away like dandelion seeds what happened in reality was that an ambulance eventually took them off rattling along the narrow lanes to hereford general twentyfive miles away taking too long to get there because all the roads were b roads clogged with tractors and trailerloads of sheep whose milky eyes showed that they had no illusions at all about fading into a green heaven dont do it dad fay said just to create a new sound three minutes walk from the socalled town centre and all you could hear was the clock on the mantelpiece and the wheezing of the fridge dont leave your mind in bloody crybbe the canon seemed perversely to revel in the misery of the town to relish the shifty suspicious stares he encountered in the post office and all the drinks the locals didnt buy him in the pub his mind was congealing like a fried egg on a cold morning the specialists had confirmed it and at first fay had refused to believe them although once you knew the signs were pretty obvious decay was infectious it spread like yellow fungus in a tree stump fay realized she herself had somehow passed that age when you could no longer fool yourself that you were looking younger than you felt especially here the city well that was like part of your makeup it hid all the signs whereas the country spelled it out for you every year it withered only the country came up green again and you didnt fay took a deep breath this was not like her at all on the table in front of her lay a small flat square box containing fifteen minutes worth of tape shed recorded that morning on the box was written in pencil henry kettle dowser later fay would create from the tape about six minutes of radio to do this she would draw the curtains switch on the anglepoise lamp and the revox editing machine and forget she was in crybbe it was what kept her sane she wondered what kind of reaction shed get if she told it like it was to the perusers of the property columns fay picked up the pencil and wrote on the pad for sale faded terraced house in godforsaken backwater somewhere in damp no mans land long disowned by both wales and england fully modernized in depressingly close to bunch of rundown shops selling nothing in particular backing on to infertile hill country full of dour farming types and pompous retired bank managers from luton no serious offer ignored in fact she added wed tear your bloody hand off chapter ii close up she was like a dark crooked finger pushing out of the earth beckoning him into the brambles when he looked back from the entrance to the field shed shrivelled into something more sinister a bent and twisted old woman a crippled crone or maybe just the broken stump of a fence post maybe only that she hadnt been visible from here at all until earlier that day mr kettle had put on his thick gloves and pulled away the brambles then pruned the hedge around her so that she stood naked not even a covering of moss now hed brought goff to see his discovery and he should have felt a bit proud but he didnt all the time hed been cutting away the undergrowth something had been pulling at him saying leave it be henry youre doing no good here but this was his job and this stone was what showed hed earned his money it made a nonsense of the whole business if he didnt reveal the only real evidence that proved the line was there falling sure as a shadow across the field dead straight between two youngish oak trees and see that gate the metal gate aye but hes likely replaced generations of wooden ones mr kettle said his voice rolling easy now like the hills around them even without the final proof hed have been confident of this one wonderful feeling it was when you looked up and everything in the landscape every hill and every tree every hedge every gateway suddenly smiled at you and nodded and said you were right you done it again boy like shaking hands with god happening again so suddenly like this everything dovetailing it had taken his mind off the doubts and hed been asking himself how can there be anything wrong when it all falls together so neatly he indicated the gate again probly the cattle chose the spot you following me because theyd always go out that way out of the field right youre learning though it was still warmish mr kettle wore a heavy tweed suit he carried what once had been a medical bag of scuffed black leather softened with age the tools of the trade in there the forked twigs and the wire rods and the pendulums but the tools werent important they just made the clients feel better about paying good money to a walking old wives tale like him max goff had a white suit a panama hat and the remains of an aussie accent for a long time mr kettle had found it hard to take him seriously all the daft stuff he came out with about wells of sacred power and arteries of healing energy and such the new age he kept on about that mr kettle had heard it all before twenty years ago they were knocking on his door in their indian kaftans and headbands following him out to stone circles like mitchells fold up in shropshire where theyd sit smoking long bendy cigarettes and having visions in between pawing each other now it was a man in a white suit with a big powerful motor car but it was the same old thing many many times hed explained to people that what he did was basically about science wonderful yes even after all these years the thrill was there all right but it was a natural thing nothing psychic about dowsing what sun thered been had all but gone now leaving a mournful old sky with clouds like a battleflag torn into muddy bloodstiffened strips it hadnt been a good spring and it wouldnt be a good summer now look up from the gate said mr kettle yeah that church steeple you mean no no before that side of that bit of a hedge oh that thing the old girl was about a hundred yards down the field separated from the hedge now blackened against the light no more than three feet tall but she was there that was the point in the right place yes mr kettle said that thing it was no good he didnt like her even if shed proved him right he didnt like the feeling coming off her the smell that you could smell from a good distance although not really is it a tree stump and then hey youre kidding it cant be the little eyes suddenly sparking hed be ruthless and probably devious in his business this feller but he had this enthusiastic innocence about him that you couldnt altogether dislike jeez goff said i thought theyd all gone why dont you go over and have a look at er mr kettle put down his bag and sat on it under the hedge and patted the grass so that arnold his dog would sit down too and they both sat and watched this bulky bearded bloke making his ungainly way across the tufted meadow impatient stumbling because hed thought theyd all gone the old stones of crybbe mr kettle too had believed theyd all gone until this morning when theyd finally let him into the field for the first time and hed located the line and walked slowly along it letting it talk to him a low murmur and then the tone had altered strengthened calling out to him the way they did im here henry the only standing stone left standing within a mile of crybbe or vibrations to that effect as megaliths went she wasnt impressive but she hadnt lost her voice not a voice he liked though he felt it was high and keening and travelled on a thin dry wind but it proved he hadnt lost his capacity to receive the faculty still there then arnold every time i goes out i reckon it isnt bound to work any more he scratched the dogs head but its still there boy the only conclusion mr kettle could reach about why this stone had survived was that there mustve been a wood here and the thing had been buried in brambles and if theyd noticed her at all they like goff might have thought it was just an old tree stump he could see the figure in the white suit bending over the stone and then walking all around contemplating the thing from different angles as if hoping shed speak to him which of course she wouldnt because if goff had possessed the faculty thered have been no reason to send for henry kettle an odd customer this goff and no mistake most of the people who consulted dowsers that is actually paid them had good practical reasons usually farmers looking for a water supply for their stock or occasionally people whod lost something and now and then those afflicted by rheumatics or worse because theyd got a bad spring under the house why am i still thinking hes trouble then arnie the dog considered the question looked serious well hell he didnt want to think that not at all became this goff was the first person whod ever paid him to go leyhunting mr kettle hed said coming straight to the point which mr kettle liked ive been advised that this used to be quite a centre for prehistoric remains and i wanna know basically what happened to them can you find out where they used to be the old stones the burial mounds and im told you can kind of detect leylines too yeah well mr kettle had said carefully i know what you mean it do sometimes seem they fall into straight lines the old monuments no need to be coy with me mr kettle im not afraid to call a leyline a leyline now this had at first been a joy taking the old chap back nigh on seventy years he remembered a memory like a faded sepia photo being on a hazy hilltop with his father and other members of the straight track club mr watkins pointing out the little bump on the horizon and showing how the line progressed to it from mound to stone to steeple the others nodding impressed the picture frozen there mr watkins arm outstretched bit of a smile under his stiff beard now remarkably and loathe as mr kettle had been at first to admit it this goff had stumbled on something mr watkins would no question have given his right arm to know about so it had proved unexpectedly exciting this survey this leyhunt bit of an eyeopener to say the least until one morning knowing there had to have been a stone in a particular place in big meadow and then digging about and finding part of it buried nearby mr kettle had got a feeling that something about this was not regular in most areas old stones were lost gradually over centuries plucked out at random when exasperation at the damage done to a plough or a harrow had finally overcome the farmers inbred superstition but at crybbe he was sure it had been systematic like a purge mr kettles excitement was dampened then by a bad feeling that just wouldnt go away when he dug up the stone he thought he could smell it something faintly putrid as if hed unearthed a dead sheep and as a man who lived by his feelings he wondered if he ought to say something about the purge on the stones about the history of the court john dee black michael and the hangings and about the legends which travelled parallel to history and sometimes if you could decode them told you far more about what had really happened than the fusty old documents in the county archives mr kettle who kept his own records was getting more and more interested in crybbe wishing though that he didnt have to be wishing he could ignore it detecting a problem here a serious longterm problem and wishing he could turn his back on it but as the problem was likely to remain long after hed gone hed taken steps to pass on his fears with a feller like this max goff blundering about the place there should always be somebody who knew about these things somebody trustworthy to keep an eye open he supposed he ought to warn goff but the thought of something sinister would probably only make the place more appealing and anyway you cant tell these new age types anything can you arnold mr kettle was scratching the dogs head again no you cant boy ten minutes later goff was back puffing the flush in his cheeks making his closemown beard seem even redder excitement coming off him like steam mr kettle let me get this right according to your calculations this is line b right thats correct and by following this line as you dowsed it we suddenly come across what could be the only remaining stone in the alignment is it exactly where you figured itd be well mr kettle got to his feet and picked up his bag max goff eyed it got the rods in there can we dowse the line some more maybe find another stone no we bloody cant mr kettle thought you might as well ask how about if we grabs hold of this electric cable to see if hes live he saw to his dismay that goff was looking at him in some kind of awe hed found a new guru it was not a role mr kettle fancied getting late he said i ought to be away dont like driving in the dark these days when can you come again look mr kettle said im an old man i likes my fireside and my books and besides you got it all now you know where they all are or used to be this goff was a man whose success in business had convinced him that if you knew a source knowledge and experience could be bought like what would this feller buy cocaine mr kettle who still read two newspapers every day knew a bit about max goff and the kind of world he came from maybe your role in this is only just beginning goff said how about i send a car for you next time money was no object for this bugger made his first million by the time he was twentyseven mr kettle had read by starting his own record company epidemic it was called and it had spread like one now it was international magazines and book publishing well mr kettle said isnt much more as i can tell you anyway youve got the maps nothing more to be found even if you excavates i reckon hmmm goff was making a show of being unconvinced as they followed what mr kettle now thought of wrote of in his journal but never spoke of as the dark road the thoroughfare of the dead returning at dusk back into crybbe a town which had loitered since the middle ages and probably before in the area where england hardened into wales on the very border chapter iii it was the seventh bell they always rang for the curfew almost rang itself these days seventeen years jack had been doing it didnt need to think much about it any more went regular as his own heartbeat the bell clanged above him jack let the rope slide back through his hands seventythree his hands closed again around the rope seventyfour he hadnt been counting at any point during the ringing jack could tell you what number he was on his arms knew his stomach knew one hundred times every night starting at ten oclock newcomers to the town theyd asked him dont you find it spooky going up there through that graveyard up all those narrow stone steps with the church all dark and the bellropes just hanging there dont think about it jack would say and it was true he didnt there were eight bells in the tower and that was reckoned to be a good peal for this part of the country for weddings sometimes in the old days theyd all be going even fairly recently though not any more it had been known for some snooty bride from off to bring in a handful of bellringers from her own parish for the big day this had only been permitted for weddings sometimes on sundays never and not christmas not even easter and also every few years some bearded clown in a sports jacket would pass through and then the church or the town council would gel a letter from the secretary of some group of nutters that travelled the country ringing other peoples bells the town council would say no occasionally this was the worst problem thered be somebody like colonel croston whod moved in from hereford where he was reckoned to have been in the sas he liked to keep fit jogged around the place and rang bells as a hobby hed been a pain in the neck at first had colonel croston no bellringers apart from you jack thats appalling look you leave this one to me jack preece remembered the colonel putting up posters inviting all ablebodied folk to come to the church one friday night and learn the ropes give me six months guarantee ill knock them into shape jack had gone along himself because he didnt like the thought of youngsters running up and down the stone steps and swinging on his ropes when the two of them had been waiting around for nearly an hour he let the despondent colonel take him for a drink doesnt deserve these bells jack this town aye aye jack had said noncommittally and had permitted colonel croston to buy him a large brandy he hadnt bothered to tell the colonel that even he only knew how to ring the curfew using the seventh bell well no point in buggering with the others see was there no point in making a show they could have pulled the other bells down and flogged them off for scrap far as jack preece was concerned anyhow what theyd done now to save a lot of bother and pestering was to take down all the ropes except of course the one that rang the seventh bell some nights jack would be real knackered after a days dipping or shearing or lambing hed stagger up them steps hurting all over his body dying for a pint and aching for his bed some nights hed grab hold of that rope just to stop himself falling over still the hundred would be done and done on time and it was on nights like this that jack felt sometimes he was helped felt the belfry was kind of aglow and other hands were pulling on the rope beside his own spooky well he didnt think about it where was the point in that they walked slowly into the town over a river bridge with old brick walls which badly needed pointing the river flat and sullen below past a pub the cock with flaky paintwork and walls that had once been whitewashed but now looked grey and unwashed a dark smoky secretive little town there was still an afterglow on the fields but the town was already embracing the night mr kettle had never been to paris or new york but if tonight he was to be flown into either of them he suspected he wouldnt feel any more of a stranger than he did entering crybbe a town hed lived within twenty miles of all his life this town it wasnt remote exactly not difficult to reach yet it was isolated outsiders never had reason to pass through it on the way to anywhere because no matter where you wanted to reach there was always a better way to get there than via crybbe three roads intersected here but they were b roads two starting in wales one leading eventually to hereford the other to ludlow and the other well buggered if he knew where that one went max goff almost glowing in his white suit was striding into the dimness of the town like dr livingstone or somebody with a pocketful of beads for the natives theyd take the beads the people here they wouldnt thank him but theyd take the beads henry kettle didnt claim to understand the people of crybbe they werent hostile and they werent friendly they kept their heads down that was all you could say about them a local historian had once told him this was how towns and villages on the border always used to be if there was any crossborder conflict between the english and the welsh they never took sides openly until it was clear which was going to win also towns of no importance were less likely to be attacked and burned so keeping their heads down had got to be a way of life tourists must turn up sometimes by accident probably mr kettle reckoned most of them wouldnt even bother to park sure the buildings were ancient enough but they werent painted and polished up like the timberframe villages on the hereford blackandwhite trail nothing here that said visit me with any enthusiasm because there was no sense of pride from the church tower above the cobbled square a lone bell was clanging dolefully into the musty dusk it was the only sound there was whats that goff demanded only the curfew goff stopped on the cobbles his smile a great gash hey really this is a real curfew like in the old days no mr kettle said not really thats to say people are no longer required to be off the streets by nightfall just tradition nowadays the preece family it is performs the duty one of em goes up the belfry god knows how many steps every night summer and winter ninethirty or is it ten he looked up at the church clock but it was too dark to make out where its hands were pointing he was sure there used to be a light on that clock hundred times it rings anyway might only be a tradition but theres still nobody on the streets max goff observed is there thats cause theyre all in the pubs said mr kettle no what it is theres some old trust fund arranges for the bell to be rung the preeces get grazing rights on a few acres of land in return for keeping up the custom passed down father to son for four hundredodd years being farmers they always has plenty sons they stood in the square until the ringing stopped crazy goff said shaking his big head in delight crayzee this is the first night ive spent here yknowive always stayed in hereford its magic mr kettle hey we still on the line i suppose we must be aye see the little marker by there a stone no more than a foot high not much more than a bump in the cobbles goff squatted next to it and held his palms over it as though he expected it to be hot or to light up or something the dog arnold watched his head on one side as if puzzled by a human being who went down on all fours to sniff the places where dogs had pissed two middleaged women walked across the square talking in low voices they stopped talking as they walked past goff but didnt look at him nor mr kettle nor each other then they went rigid because suddenly arnolds head was back and he was howling jeez goff sprang up the two women turned and mr kettle felt he was getting a very dark warning look the womens faces shadowed almost to black arnold with some difficulty beginning to think he must have a bad spring under his own house the way his rheumatism had been playing up lately mr kettle got down on his knees and pulled the dog to him sorry ladies the women didnt speak stood there a moment then turned and walked away quickly as the howling subsided because mr kettle had a hand clamped around arnolds jaws daft bugger arnold whyd it do that goff asked without much interest i wish i knew mr goff mr kettle wanted some time to think about this because for a long time hed thought it was just a drab little town full of uninspired interbred old families and misfits from off and now he thought its more than that more than inbreeding and apathy he unclamped the dogs jaws and arnold gave him a reproachful glance and then shook his head there were lights in some town houses now they lit the rooms behind the curtains but not the square not even a little folk in this town had never thrown their light around ok goff said feet planted firmly on the cobbles legs splayed quite relaxed wasnt getting it was he wasnt feeling the resistance didnt realize he was among the descendants of the people whod pulled up the stones mr kettle was getting to his feet one hand against the wall like his old bones the brick seemed infirm the people here they cared nothing for their heritage and their ancestors had torn up the stones goff was just a big white blob in the dim square mr kettle walked to where their cars were parked in a little bay behind the church overhung with yew trees his own car was a dusty vw estate goff had a ferrari come to dinner ok goff said when ive moved into the court youre going through with it then try and stop me can i say something henry kettle had been thinking about this for the past fifteen minutes or so he didnt much like goff but he was a kindly old chap who wanted at least to put out a steadying hand of course mr kettle stood uneasily in the semidark these places he began and sucked in his lips trying to concentrate trying to get it right i suppose what im trying to say is places like this they how can i put it they invites a kind of obsession he fell silent watching the buildings in the square hunching together as the night took over a harsh laugh came out of goff is that it he asked rudely mr kettle unlocked his car door and opened it for arnold yes he said halfsurprised because hed thought he was going to say more yes i suppose that is it he couldnt see the dog anywhere arnie he called out sharply hed had this problem before the dog slinking silent away clearly not at ease whimpering sometimes he hadnt gone far this time though mr kettle found him pressed into the churchyard wall ears down flat panting with anxiety all right arn were leaving now mr kettle said patting him his coat felt lank and plastered down as if he was the first dog ever to sweat this was it with a dowsers dog hed pick up on the things his master was after and being a dog and closer to these matters anyway his response would be stronger slipping his hand under arnolds collar mr kettle led him back to the car and saw goff standing there quite still in his white suit and his panama hat like an outofseason snowman mr kettle goff took a steep breath perhaps i ought explain this place i mean look around its remote halfforgotten rundown for centuries its people lived from the land right but now agricultures in decline it doesnt provide extra jobs any more and theres nothing here to replace it this towns in deep shit mr kettle mr kettle couldnt argue with that he didnt say anything watched max goff spread his hands messiahstyle and yet in prehistory this was obviously a sacred place goff said we have this network of megalithic sites a dozen or so standing stones suggestions of a circle or a henge and the tump of course strong indications that this was a major focus of the earth force a centre of terrestrial energy yeah do you see any signs of that energy now people pulled the stones out mr kettle said precisely and what happened they lost touch with it lost touch with what with the life force mr kettle listen give me your opinion on this whaddaya think would happen if max goff walked right up to mr kettle in the illlit square and looked down at him lowering his voice as if he were about to offer him a tip for the stock market mr kettle felt most uneasy he was getting the deadsheep smell whadda you think would happen goff whispered if we were to put the stones back well mr kettle thought that depends depends on the true nature of leys about which we know nothing only speculate endlessly depends whether theyre forgotten arteries of what you new age fellers like to call the life force or whether theyre something else like paths of the dead but all he said was i dont know mr goff i wouldnt like to say chapter iv how old was the box then warren preece reckoned it was at least as old as the panelling in the farmhouse hall which was estimated to be just about the oldest part of the house so that made it sixteenth century or so he was into something here all right and the great thing the really fucking great thing about this was that no other bastard knew about it lived in this house all his life but hed never had cause to poke about in the chimney before well you wouldnt would you until that morning when his old man had shouted put that bloody guitar down warren and get off your arse and hold this torch boy piss off warren had spat under his breath but hed done it knowing what a bastard the old man could be when a job wasnt going right then standing in the fireplace shining the torch up the chimney the old man on a stepladder struggling to pull the crumbling brick out a bloody great lump of old cement had fallen away and broken up and some of the dust had gone in warrens eye you clumsy bastard dad warren fell back dropping the torch ramming a knuckle into his weeping eye hearing masonry crumbling where hed staggered and kicked out if he made it to college without being registered disabled through living in this brokendown pile of historic crap itd be a real achievement come on warren dont mess about i need that light im f hang on dad i cant flaming see hunched in the fireplace scraping at his gritty watery eye and it was then while picking up the torch flashing it on and off to make sure the bulb hadnt broken when hed dropped it that warren found this little tunnel it was no more than a deepish recess in the side wall of the fireplace about eighteen inches off the ground which would have put it on a level with the top of the dog grate when theyd had one must have been where hed kicked back with his heel hacking off a cob of sixteenthcentury gunge warren shone the light into the recess and saw what looked like carving put a hand inside felt about hey this was warren what you bloody doing down there boy quickly he shoved bits of brick into the opening ramming them tight with the heel of his trainer then shone the torch back up the chimney for the old man pretty damn fast in fact for the rest of the day hed been a very willing labourer you stay there dad ill get it want me to mix the cement down here and pass it up dad cuppa tea dad anything so the old mand get the job done and bugger off out of the way the old man had been surprised and pleased grinning through a faceful of soot patting warren on the shoulder we done a good job there boy he wont set on fire again that ole chimney fancy a pint hed never said that before well not to warren most nights sometimes with jonathon he just went off to the cock without a word so warren too was surprised and almost pleased but wasnt going for no pint with the old man tonight no way told tessa id be round dad sorry the old man looked quite relieved warren had watched him tramping off up the track eager to wash the dust out of his throat so eager he hadnt bothered to clean up the mess in the hearth and so hadnt noticed anything he shouldnt stupid git warren got himself a can of black label from the fridge and went back to the fireplace to pull out them old bricks hed got the box out was squatting on the hearth dusting off when he heard jonathons car hed tucked the box under his arm bloody heavy it was too and got it out through the back door and round the back of the barn where hed hidden it in the bottom of an old waterbutt and gone up to his room and waited for jonathon to piss off the way he saw it you didnt seal up an oak box like this and stash it away in a secret compartment in the chimney unless there was something pretty damn valuable inside and as hed discovered just about anything a bit old was valuable these days warren had a mate a guy who got rid of stuff no questions asked he could be looking at big money here on the box alone it was in good nick this box sealed up warm and dry for centuries warren looked at the box and saw a new amplifier for the band he looked harder and saw this secondhand stratocaster guitar felt the strat hanging low round his hip its neck slippy with sweat the curfew bell was tolling in the distance his dad had sunk a swift pint and plodded off up the tower to do his night duty silly old bugger why do you keep on doing that dad dont pay do it and no bugger takes any notice part from setting their watches tradition boy your grandad did it for over thirty year and when i gets too rheumaticky to climb them steps jonathonll do it right son jonathon nodding he was always son whereas warren was the boy said something that did what it said was that jonathon the eldest son was going to get the farm well ok if jonathon wanted to wallow in shit shag sheep all his life well fair enough warren didnt give a toss about going to college in hereford either except that was where the other guys in the band lived but crybbe he could hardly believe this was where max goff was going to be max goff of epidemic records hed seen him been watching him for days somehow max goff had to hear the band because this band was real good he could feel it this band fucking cooked the box was in one of the sheds on the old workbench now hed rigged up an old lambing light to work by realizing this was going to be a delicate operation didnt want to damage the box see because it could be worth a couple of hundred on its own now he had a few tools set out on the bench hammer screwdriver chisel stanley knife precision stuff this warren grinned ok if it came to it he would have to damage it because he hadnt got all bloody night but better to go in from underneath than cut the lid which had a bit of a carving on it nothing fancy like nothing clever just some rough symbols looked like theyd been done with a stanley knife a sixteenth century stanley knife warren had to laugh round about then crybbe had another power cut although warren preece working in the shed with a lambing light wasnt affected at all but fay morrison was furious shed always preferred to do her editing at night especially in the days when she was producing complete programmes thered just be her and the tapemachine under a desklamp and then when the tape was cut together she would switch off the lamp and sit back perhaps with a coffee and play it through in the cosy darkness only a red pilotlight and the soft green glow of the levelmeters the gentle swish of the leader tape gliding past the heads magic this was what made radio so much more satisfying than television the intimacy of moments like this and the fact that you could do all the creative work on your own only going into studio for the final mix fay really missed all that hadnt imagined shed miss it so much tonight shed waited until her father had wandered off to the pub for his nightly whisky and his barsupper and then shed gone into her office which used to be grace legges sittingroom and still was really in the daytime but at night you could switch off the gplan furnishing and the fifties fireplace and the front room of number bell street crybbe became more tolerable with only a secondhand revox visible in the circle light from the anglepoise fay had a package to edit for offas dyke radio only a sixminute piece to be slotted into somebody elses afternoon chatanddisc show on what was arguably the worst local shoestring station in the country but it was still radio wasnt it after a fashion and this morning doing her contribution for a series on yawn yawn people with unusual hobbies fay had actually got interested in something for a start he was ever such a nice old chap most of the people around here far from being quaint rural characters were about as appealing as dried parsnip and hed actually been happy to talk to her which was a first until shed come here fay had encountered very few people who didnt want to be on the radio no cameras no lights and no need to change your shirt or have your hair done but in this area people would make excuses oh im too busy call again sometime or simply refuse i dont want be on the wireless as if by collecting their voices on tape you were going to take their souls away yes it was that primitive sometimes or so she felt but the waterdiviner or dowser had been different and fay had been fascinated to learn how it was done nothing apparently to do with the hazel twig as such simply a faculty you developed through practice nothing as airyfairy as intuition and it definitely was not psychic he kept emphasizing that scrutinizing her a bit warily as she stood there in her tshirt and jeans wishing shed brought a sweater and a windmuff for the microphone it had been bit breezy in that field even if tomorrow was midsummer day do you think i could do it henry shed asked on tape you always asked this question sounding as if it had just occurred to you there would then follow an amusing couple of minutes of your attempting to do whatever it was and of course failing dismally you could have a try hed said playing along and shed taken the forked twig in both hands hold it quite firmly so it doesnt slip but dont grip it too hard and above all relax ok shed heard herself say through the speaker and that was when the power went off bloody hell fay stormed to the window to see if the other houses in the street were off which they were it was the fourth power cut in a month i dont believe it ok you could imagine that on some distant rock in the hebrides even today there would be quite a few times when the power got waylaid on its way from the mainland but this was close to the epicentre of britain there were high mountains and they were not in the middle of an electric storm she couldnt remember if it was south wales electricity or midlands electricity but neither could be up to much if they were unable to maintain supplies to a whole town ok a very small town for longer than a fortnight without a break hereward newsome who ran the art gallery in town had complained to his mp and tried to get up a petition about it but hed given that up in disgust after collecting precisely fifteen signatures all from newcomers including fay and her dad of course the newsomes problem did appear to be somewhat more serious not only were they having to suffer the power cuts but they were affected by other surges in supply which hereward swore were almost doubling their electricity bills he was getting into a terrible state about it actually fay was a bit dubious about the huge bills being caused by a fault in the system she grinned into the darkness it was probably jocastas vibrator on overdrive there was a bump and the sound of two empty spools clattering to the floor pushkin is that you graces cats got everywhere fay decided she didnt like this room very much in the absolute dark she felt along the wall for the taperecorder plug removed it and went to bed living in crybbe would drive anybody to a vibrator warren should have known sixteenthcentury lock not as if it was chubbs finest was it stanley knife into the groove sliding it around a bit thats all it took then the screwdriver pushed into the gap hit just once with the palm of his hand it didnt exactly fly open the box well it wouldnt would it being as how it had turned out to be leadlined fucking lead no wonder it was so heavy good job he didnt tried to cut into it through the bottom course that lead lining was a bit of a disappointment warren had been hoping the box weighed so much because was full of gold coins or something of that order lead even antique lead was worth bugger all he was pretty sure of that funny smell well not that funny old it smelled old and musty he moved the lambing light closer poked a finger in cloth it was some sort of old fabric greyish better be a bit careful here bloody old thing might disintegrate on the other hand he couldnt afford to waste any time his old man who wasnt much of a drinker might even be on his way back from the church he might of course have called back round the pub for one with jonathon and his mates if warren was in the pub with his mates and the old man came in hed turn his stool round pretend he hadnt seen him but jonathon would call him over buy him a pint that was the kind of smarmy git jonathon was but most likely hed come home getting a few early nights in before haymaking time and dipping and all that rural shit and as he came up the track hed see the light in the shed warren pulled the lamp down away from the shed window he couldnt see much through the glass with its thick covering of cobwebs full of dust and dead insects except that it was very nearly dark and there was a mist he was feeling cold now wanting to get it over with and go back to the house it was going to be no big deal anyway old papers probably some longdead buggers last will and testament he prodded the cloth stuff with the end of the stanley knife and then dug the blade in a bit and used the knife to pull the fabric out of the box in one lump what was underneath the cloth was whiteish and yellowish like brittle old paper or parchment crumpled up he gave it a prod and the stanley knife dropped out of warrens fingers fingers that had gone suddenly numb aaaa warren caught his breath voice gone into a choke the knife fell into the box and made this horrible little chinking noise chapter v mr kettle raised a hand to goff as he drove away he was thinking well somebody had to buy the place better this rich flash bugger surely than a family man with a cosy wife and perhaps a daughter or two with horses for the stables and things to lose good things peace of mind balance of mind he left the town on the ludlow road which would take him past the court it wouldnt be goffs only home well hed move in and stride around for a while barking orders to battalions of workmen changing this and restoring that in the hope it would give the house some personality a bit of atmosphere and then hed get tired of the struggle and go back to london and the court would become a weekend home then an everyotherweekend home then a holiday home then just an investment then hed sell it and the process would begin all over again dead ahead of him at this point the court crouched like an animal behind the tump the tump was a mound which at some stage may or may not have had a castle on top trees sprouted from it now and brambles choked the slopes the tump was a field away from the road about two hundred yards and there was a wall around it arnold whined once and crept into the back seat where he lay down behind the wall the tump loomed black against the dull smoky dregs of the dusk all the more visible because there were no lights anywhere nothing had there been a power cut it had always been obvious to mr kettle that whether or not the tump had once had a castle on it before that long long before that it had been a burial place of some importance hed been up there but found no sign of it having been excavated which was not that unusual mounds like this were ten a penny in the marches the business of the stones that was unusual what would happen if he put them back the same stones where you could find them substitutes where theyd vanished entirely well probably nothing nothing would happen that was what mr kettle told himself as he drove in the direction of the tump along a road which vaguely followed the ley hed marked on the ordnance survey map as line b the mound of course was on the line he was relieved when the road swung away from the ley and the shadow of the tump moved over from the windscreen to the side window now why was that why was he relieved he slowed for the final bend before the town sign and glanced in the mirror seeing in the dimness the dogs intelligent eyes wide bright and anxious he dont know really what hes takin on arn mr kettle said his voice softening as it always did when he and the dog were alone he put out his left hand to switch on the headlights towns ended very abruptly in these parts full street lighting and then in the blink of an eye you were into the countryside where different rules applied but tonight there were no lights it was all one people said sometimes that the court must be haunted whatever that meant atmospherics usually the couple of times hed been in there it had been cold and gloomy and had this miserable uncared for kind of feeling in mr kettles experience socalled haunted houses were not normally like that they could be quite bright and cheerful in the daytime except for those cold bits there were always cold bits but what was wrong with the court was more fundamental it was a dead spot nothing psychic though you understand just nothing thrived there indeed he couldnt figure out why it hadnt been abandoned and left to rot centuries ago long before it had become a listed building deemed to be of historic interest arnold sprang up on the back seat and growled and whats up with you now the dog had his front paws on the back of mr kettles seat his furry head against his masters cheek lips curled back showing his teeth white and feral in the gloom mr kettle tried to follow arnies gaze thinking maybe the dog had caught sight of a badger ambling out of the hedge but all he could see was the yellow of the headlights thrown back at him he rubbed at the windscreen bugger me arn that mists come down quick tonight boy but there was nothing moving in the mist no noise no lights no badgers not even tree shapes only the tump he was up in the highest field now but at the bottom end by the wood the lambing light at his feet the grass wet and cold the sweat on him mingling with the mist the spade handle clammy with it he didnt care hed never felt like this before warren scraped the earth into the hole and pulled the turf back over it slamming it down with the spade jumping on it getting it tight so nobody would know not that anybody came here only the sheep and the old man once or twice a year beneath the turf and the soil and the clay was the old box buried good and deep with the stanley knife still inside it it seemed right somehow to leave the knife in the box or it seemed not right to put his hand in the box and take the knife out not with the other hand in there where did that come from the dog snarled the tump was offcentre in the mist but it shouldnt have been there at all because hed passed it he must have couple of minutes ago at least now just you sit down you daft dog and then he looked up at the tump and said suddenly softly youre not right are you at that moment arnold was thrown to the floor as without warning the car lurched off to the right the steering wheel spinning away so fiercely it burned the palms of mr kettles hands when he tried to hold it oh no you dont you bugger addressing through his teeth neither the dog nor the car for he should have been halfexpecting this bloody old fool wrenching at the wheel as the black mound rose up full in the windscreen from behind his seat the dogs growl built to a yelp of terror i know im sorry cursing the part of him which responded to nonsense like this mad as hell at his bloody old slowing body which no longer seemed to have the strength to loose it out arnold cringed on the floor next to the back seat shivering and panting then mr kettle felt the bumps and heard the clumps under the car and knew what must have happened were in the bloody field common land unfenced flat and welldrained enough where it met the road to offer no obstacles to car wheels no obstacles at all until you got to the humps and ridges and then the wall they said the wall which almost encircled the mound had been built centuries ago of stones taken from the old castle foundations it was not high maybe five feet but it was a very thick wall and as strong and resistant as ever itd been hed never thought about this before but why would they build a wall around it behind the wall the tump bulged and glowered and mr kettles faculty started leaping and bounding the way his body hadnt managed to in thirty years the wild senses were rising up leaving the body hobbling behind and the old car trundling across the field going its own sweet way and something in henry kettle something he used to be able to control locking into the tumps wavelength with a long almost grateful shudder as if it was going home going back rolling down silly young devil mr watkins chiding him when he rolled over and over down from clifford castle coming to rest at the feet of the stern old man one day youll learn respect for these places boy mr watkins face in shadow under his hat one day youll learn but he hadnt hadnt been able to connect with it at all when he was up there with goff looking round seeing where the tump stood in relation to the stones had it now though too bloody much of it filling him up like when theyd sent him to the hospital for the enema colonic cleanout whatever theyd called it pumping this fluid through his backside and he could feel it going right up into his insides terrible cold something here that was cold and old and dark and was no home to be going to oh christ arnold said mr kettle oh christ knowing it for the first time why they must have built a wall around it knowing a lot of things about the stones and the leys and why mr watkins had not knowing all this as the car went over a ridge in the field maybe one of the old ramparts when it had been a castle and began to go downhill and faster i can deal with this dont you worry course he could nothing psychic here understand that stamping down on the brake frantic now but the car going even faster ripping through the field like a tank a muffled bumpclank bumpclank then the rending of metal and the car ploughing on like a wounded animal roaring and farting in the windscreen the trees on the tump were crowding out of the mist a tangle of black and writhing branches spewing like entrails from a slashed gut the centremost trees suddenly flung apart as if blown by a sudden gale as if the wind was bursting out and over the mound like a fountain of air and he could see it he could see the wind and as it rushed down it took the form nothing psychic nothing psychic nothing of a huge black thing a dog hound bounding down the mound and leaping at the car an amber hunger smoking in eyes that outshone the headlights because youre bloody evil arnold screaming from behind not barking not whimpering but making the most piteously distressed and upsetting noise hed ever been forced to hear all the time thinking the words themselves forming in his head and echoing there ive seen it it was there ive seen black michaels hound and when the illusion of the wind and the thing it carried had gone he saw the headlight beams were full of stone nothing to be done bloody old fool be thought sadly and suddenly it seemed he had all the time there was to ponder the situation and realize he hadnt touched the brake pedal not once the car having automatic transmission only two pedals what had happened was his foot had plunged down hard time and time again on the other one the accelerator well he did try to pull the stupid foot off but his knee had locked and he saw through the windscreen that the thick solid stoic wall was being hurled at him by the night and the night would not miss there was a hollow silence in the car and that seemed to last a very long time and mr kettle could feel arnold his faithful dog somewhere close to him quiet now but his eyesd be resigned no light in them any more mr kettle put out a hand to pat arnold but probably did not reach him before the impact killed both headlamps and there was no light anywhere and no sound except from afar the keening song of the old stone a few minutes later the electricity was restored bulbs flared briefly sputtered died and then came back to what passed in crybbe for life business had not been interrupted in either of the two bars at the cock where through past experience a generator was always on hand when the lights revived closingtime had come and gone and so had most of the customers few people in the houses around the town realized the power was back and the wavering ambience of oil lamps tilley lamps and candles could be seen behind curtained windows one electric light blinked back on and would remain needlessly on until morning this was the anglepoise lamp on fay morrisons editing table shed unplugged the tapemachine before going to bed but forgotten about the lamp all through the night it craned its neck over her deskdiary and a spiralbound notepad the one which often served unintentionally as a personal diary especially when she was feeling angry and hopeless across the page in deeply indented frustration the pencil lettering said wed tear your bloody hand off part two although i have been able to divine water and do other simple things of that kind for many years i had not thought that this faculty might be related to the formation of ghosts t c lethbridge ghost and divining rod chapter i no no dont hold him like that not so tightly youre like a nervous kiddy riding a bike oh sorry like this better dont think of him as an implement hes an extension of your arms be comfortable i think ive got it what do i do now just walk across towards the tree and dont be so nervous girl well ive never done it before henry im a virgin she thought shall i leave that nah maria will only chop it shell think im trying to be clever too clever for offas dyke radio god forbid fay marked it up with a white chinagraph pencil sliced and cut just over a foot of tape with a razorblade cutter spliced the ends ran the tape again crunch crunch rustle rustle all right now fay ask yourself the question huh oh er is is there any water under here i feel a bit daft to be honest henry and theres nothing happening obviously havent got your natural aptitude if thats the word course you have girl anybody can do it as really wants to its not magic look shall i help you yes please right now well do it again like this oh youre putting your hands over yours yes now relax and well walk the same path and ask ourselves the same question ok here we go is there any fucking hell henry laughter caught you by surprise did it you could say that pause look henry do you think we could do that bit again so i can moderate my response fay marked the tape fast forwarded until she heard her say ok take two made another white mark after that and picked up the razorblade shame really never as good second time around all the spontaneity gone whoops had been the best she could manage the second time when the forked hazel twig had flipped up dramatically almost turning a somersault in her hands near dislodging the microphone from under her arm whoops not good enough she started to splice the ends of the tape together wondering if she had time to go into a field with the uher and do a quick gosh wow good heaven i never expected that and splice it in at the appropriate point the phone rang yes what the damn roll of editing tape was stuck to her hands and now the receiver fay morrison yes sorry you caught me this is james barlow in the newsroom which newsroom fay demanded being awkward because the voice somehow reminded her of her exhusband who always called people by their full names offas dyke radio fay no not really like guy too young a cynical worldweary twentytwo or thereabouts james barlow she hadnt dealt with him before sorry i was editing a piece ive got tape stuck to my fingers fay maria says she commissioned a package from you about henry kettle the waterdiviner chap dowser yes pardon waterdiviner james is not an adequate term for what he does he divines all kinds of things electric cables foundations of old buildings dead bodies yeah well he obviously wasnt much good at divining stone walls have you done the piece thats what im cause if you could let us have it this morning its not for news fay explained its a soft piece for maria for alan thingys show six and a half minutes of me learning how to dowse fay ripped the tape from the receiver and threw the roll on the editing table what did you mean about stone walls tuttut dont you have police contacts down there fay henry kettle drove into one last night splat the room seemed to shift as if it was on trestles like the editing table the table and the revox suddenly looked so incongruous here the room out of the s greytiled fireplace gplan chairs lumpy settee with satin covers still grace legges room still in mourning what fay said mustve been well pissed said james barlow with relish straight across a bloody field and into this massive wall splat actually theyre speculating did he have a heart attack so were putting together a little piece on him and your stuff excuse me james but is he would go quite nicely well stitch it together here but youll still get paid obviously yes he is oh yes very much so im told splat you know yes fay said numbly can you send it from the unattended say by eleven yes send the lot well chop out a suitable clip bye now fay switched the machine back on now it no longer mattered take two didnt sound quite so naff whoops gosh henry thats amazing the twigs flipped right over if your hands hadnt been there idve a dead man said dropped it i reckon well there you are then fay youve found your first well can likely make yourself a bob or two now i dont think so somehow tell me what exactly was happening there you must have given it some thought over the years well its nothing to do with the rod for a start its in you see youre letting yourself connect with whats out there and all the things that have ever been out there i dont know sounds a bit cranky youre how can i say youre reminding your body that its just part of everything else thats going on you following me never been very good at explaining it i just does it you can mess about with this cant you fay make it sound sensible fellow from the bbc interviewed me once he yes dont worry itll be fine now what i think youre saying is that in this hitech age man no longer feels the need to be in tune with his environment well aye thats about it life dont depend on it any more do he i suppose not but look henry what if she stopped the tape cut it off after life dont depend on it any more why give them the lot when theyd only use four seconds anyway the next bit wasnt usable shed asked him about this job he was doing for max goff and hed stepped smartly back waving his arms motioning at her to switch the tape off saying that it would all come out sooner or later dont press me girl all right later hed said not being funny see only its not turned out as simple as i thought it was going to be something i dont quite understand not yet anyway she hadnt pressed him very unprofessional of her she had after all only approached henry kettle about doing six minutes for the people with unusual hobbies spot because shed heard max goff had brought him to crybbe and it was her job to find out what goff himself was doing here but shed ended up liking henry kettle and actually liking somebody was sometimes incompatible with the job so now nobody would know what hed been doing for goff unless goff himself chose to disclose it fay sat down she and the room both in mourning now hed been a great character had henry hed leave a gap but if you had to go maybe splat wasnt a bad exit line at the age of what was he eightyseven still driving his own car too fay thought about her dad and the sports cars hed had hed prefer splat to arterial strangulation anytime talking of the devil she caught sight of him then through the window strolling back towards the cottage with the guardian under his arm looking at ladies legs and beaming through his big snowy beard at people on either side even though in crybbe people never seemed to beam back the cottage fronted directly on to the street no garden canon alex peters pushed straight into the office he wasnt beaming now he was clearly annoyed about something dont they just bloody love it love what fay joined some red leader to the end of the tape deliberately not looking up determined not to be a congregation a tragedy death failure specially if its one of the dreaded people from off what are you on about dad thats what they say from off oh hes from off ive calculated that off means anywhere more than forty miles away anywhere nearer they say oh hes from leominster or hes from llandrindod wells which are places not near enough to be local but not far enough away to be off youre bonkers dad fay spun back the finished tape anyway this poor sod was apparently from kington or somewhere which is the middle category not local but not off so theyre quite content that hes dead but not as happy as theyd be if he was from say kent it clicked youre talking about henry kettle who henry kettle the dowser i interviewed yesterday morning oh god canon peters said thats who it was im sorry fay i didnt connect i never mind fay said soothingly sometimes on his good days you were inclined to forget her father whod been about to sit down was instantly back on his feet now look its got nothing to with dr alphonse sodding alzheimer alois what alois alzheimer anyway you havent got alzheimers disease the canon waved a dismissive hand alzheimer is easier to say than arteriosclerotic dementia when youre going gaga he took off his pink cotton jacket nothing to do with that anyway always failed to make connections always putting my sodding foot in it yes dad and stop being so bloody considerate all right then belt up you old bugger while i finish this tape thats better the canon slung his jacket over the back of the armchair slumped down glared grimly at the guardian fay labelled the tape and boxed it she stood back and pulled down her tshirt pushed fingers through her tawny hair asking him where was it then where did it happen canon peters lowered his paper behind the old court you know the tumulus round the back you can see it from the ludlow road got a wall round it thats what he hit but hang on that walls a bloody mile off the road couple of hundred yards actually but still i mean hed have to drive across an entire field for christs sake when james barlow had said something about mr kettle crossing a field shed imagined some kind of extended grassverge somebody said maybe hed had a heart attack so i was thinking hed just gone out of control hit a wall not far off the road not you know embarked on a cross country endurance course perhaps speculated the canon he topped himself cobblers i was with him yesterday morning he was fine not the suicidal type anyway and if youre going to do yourself in there have to be rather more foolproof ways than that nine out of ten suicides somebody says that theres always an easier way he was probably just confused i can sympathize any witnesses above the tiled fireplace opposite the window was a mirror in a victorianstyle gilt frame fay inspected her face in it and decided that for a walk to the studio it would get by canon peters said witnesses in crybbe sorry i wasnt thinking wouldnt have known myself if i hadnt spotted all the police activity so i grilled the newsagent apparently it must have happened last night but he wasnt found until this morning oh god theres no chance he might have been still alive lying there all night shouldnt think so head took most of it i gather i didnt go to look a local milkman it was who spotted the wreckage and presumably said to himself well well what a mess and then wondered if perhaps he ought not to call wynford the copper no hurry though because he wasnt local said fay precisely fay said it for the second time this week why dont you get the hell out of this town dad youre never going to feel you belong i like it here it irritates the hell out of you i know but its rather interesting in an anthropological sort of way his beard twitched she knew she wasnt getting the whole story what was he hiding and why fay frowned wondering if hed seen the spoof for sale notice shed scribbled out during a tenminute burst of depression last night she said tentatively grace wouldnt want you to stay you know that now look young fay canon peters leaned forward in the chair a deceptive innocence in the wide blue eyes which had wowed widows in a dozen parishes more to the point theres absolutely no need for you to hang around you know my methods no problem at all to find some lonely old totty among the immigrant population to cater for my whims in fact youre probably cramping my style he raised the guardian high so that all she could see was his fluffy while hair like the bobble on an oldfashioned ski hat anyway he mumbled early stages yet could be months before im a dribbling old cabbage dad ill the phone rang yes what oh mrs seagrove all she needed serves you right rumbled the canon from the depths of the guardian i saw it again mrs morrison last night when the power was off oh fay said as kindly as she could manage did you i cant bear it any more mrs morrison fay didnt bother to ask her how she could see a huge coalblack beast when all the lights were out shed say she just could she was one of the aforementioned lonely old midland immigrant widows in a pretty cottage on the edge of town one of the people who rang local reporters because they needed someone to make a cup of tea for im at the end of my tether mrs morrison im going out of my mind you wouldnt think anything as black as that could glow would you im shivering now just remembering it in other places they rang the police for help but in crybbe the police was sergeant wynford wiley and nobody wanted to make a cup of tea for him ive tried to explain mrs seagrove its a fascinating its not fascinating my love its terrifying its no joke its frightening me out of my mind i cant sleep but theres nothing i can do unless youre prepared to talk about it on tape i only work for the radio and unless we can hear your voice why cant you just say someones seen it without saying who i am or where i live because because thats not the way radio works we have to hear a voice look fay said i really would like to do the story perhaps you could find someone else whos seen it and would be prepared to talk about it and have it recorded mrs seagrove said bitterly they all know about it mrs francis at the post office mr preece they wont admit it they wont talk about it ive tried telling the vicar he just listens and he smiles i dont think he even believes in god that vicar perhaps if you came round this afternoon we could im sorry fay said ive got several jobs on the go at the moment ho ho said the guardian look fay said think about it its quite easy and informal you know just me and a portable recorder and if you make any fluffs we can keep doing it again until youve got it right well perhaps if you came round we could not unless youre prepared to talk about it on tape fay said firmly ill think about it mrs seagrove said fay put the phone down of course she felt sorry for the lady and ghost stories always went down well with producers even if the eyewitnesses were dismissed as loonies local radio needed loonies how else for instance could you sustain phonein programmes in an area like this but ghost stories where nobody would go on the record as having seen the apparition were nonstarters on that same basis fay thought ruefully a lot of stories had been nonstarters in crybbe chapter ii the windscreen was in splinters there was blood on some of them dried now and there were other bits pink and glistening like mince on a butchers tray which max goff didnt want to know about what are you saying here he demanded irritably youre saying its a fucking omen he looked up at the hills shouldering their way out of the morning mist the sun still offstage just he turned and gazed at the tump a prosaic lumpen word for the mystic mound the branches of the trees on its summit still entwined with tendrils of mist a thing so ancient so haunted yet so benign yeah well he believed in omens but there was some kind of awful creaking tearing sound as the breakdown truck hauled the car out of the wall a heavy crump and a rattle as the vws shattered front end came down on the turf its radiator ripped off carintestines hanging out max goff winced beside him rachel wade his personal assistant was saying in her deep voice dont be silly spreading out her hands in that superior pained halfpitying way she had all im saying is its not exactly an auspicious start is it goff stared coldly at rachel in her shiny new barbour coat and a silk scarf knowing how much hed depended on her judgement in the past but knowing equally that this was an area where she was well out of her depth a situation where the smooth bitch couldnt be relied upon to get it right no way she didnt of course want him to go through with it nobody whose opinion was worth more than shit had been exactly encouraging but rachel was subtler than most of them she hadnt said a word about the nylon sheets in their room at the cock had made no comment about the coffee at breakfast being instant just sat there languid and elegant and at ease refusing everything they offered her with a professional smile yeah ok under normal circumstances goff himself would have insisted on different sheets and ground coffee and some kind of muesli instead of rice krispies but he might need the cock again actually he might need to buy it hed been pondering this possibility deciding not to discuss it with ms wade just yet when the local plod had turned up waiting respectfully in the lobby until hed finished his nescafe then asking are you mr goff sir mr max goff as if they didnt recognize him the body had been taken away by the time they got to the scene max goff only hoped the poor old bastard had at least one surviving relative he didnt really feel like identifying the kettle corpse in some seedy whitetiled mortuary where the atmosphere was heavy with obnoxious smells and bodily gases if it came to that rachel could do it shed hired kettle originally and nothing ever fazed rachel just as nothing ever blew her mind there was even something suspiciously nonchalant about her orgasms right tom somebody shouted and the breakdown truck started across the field the broken car on its back a smashed coffin on an open hearse then the truck stopped for some reason and in that moment the sun came out of the mist and the land was suddenly aglow and throbbing with life force and goff remembered what day this was he turned towards the light head back eyes closing and the palms of his hands opening outwards to receive the burgeoning energy i am here at the zenith of the year i am in a state of total submission its the solstice he whispered id forgotten oh said the uncommitted rachel wade super as if guided max goff turned back to the open field opened his eyes and saw reflected quite perfectly in the rear window of henry kettles smashedup old volkswagen on the back of the truck he saw the venerable mound the tump at crybbe court and the sun above it like a holy lamp and the connection was formed revelation the truck started up again moved off towards the road goff pointed urgently at the mound talking rapidly forefinger stabbing at the air between him and rachel listen when they built these things the old bronze age guys theyd you know consecrate them according to their religion right rachel wade looked at him expressionless what theyd do is theyd sacrifice somebody i mean the remains have been found sacrifices not burials they have ways of telling the difference right rachel freed a few strands of pale hair from the collar of her barbour flicked them back and sometimes right goff surged on at very important sites the high priest himself would be sacrificed without resistance willingly yeah rachel said how would they know that know what a that he died willingly and b that the fragment of bones or whatever belonged to a high priest goff was annoyed jeez they know ok doesnt matter how im not a flaming archaeologist but what it meant was the sacrifice would put the seal on the sanctity of the place the dead priest would live on as its guardian for all time right a police sergeant came over the same one whod fetched them from the cock big moonfaced guy didnt strike goff as being all that bright wed just like you to make a statement if you would sir everything max goff does is a statement goff told him and grinned who was it wrote that time out said rachel automatically and a little wearily august the police sergeant didnt get it you appear to have been the last person to see mr kettle alive sir youll probably be called to give evidence to that effect at the inquest shit goff said how no thats ok thats fine ill join you back at the house ten minutes right if you wouldnt mind sir point i was making goff said impatiently turning his back on the departing plod is that henry kettle was about as close as you could find to a kind of high priest these days get in tune with the earth and its spirit responding to its deeper impulses shamanic yeah closing his eyes he felt the holy light of the solstice on his face carried on talking with his eyes squeezed tightly shut talking to himself really letting his thoughts unravel the connections forming so henry kettle how old was the guy eightyfive how long did he have to go anyway so ok we have this old man the shaman homing in a dead straight line across the field straight at the mound the tump right and goff opened his eyes suddenly and fully and was dazzled by radiant blobs of orange and blue spinning from the top of the mound and whoomp he clapped his big hands violently together smiling hugely at rachel wade listen what im saying were not looking at some bad omen here its a positive thing like the high priest going almost willingly to his death sacrificing himself all over again to put his life energy into my project whoomp rachel said thats really sick max but goff was looking up at the mound with a new pride not listening i bet if we mark out those tyretracks across that field well find they correspond exactly to line b line b the fucking leyline rachel max thats goff looked hard at rachel she shut up jesus she thought whoomp chapter iii bit for level fay ok here we go mr kettle said all right then we know theres got to be water yereabouts ok thats fine fay im rolling go in five she wound back set the tape running and took the cans off her ears leaving them around her neck so shed hear the engineer call out if he ran into problems leaning back in the metalframed typists chair she thought god ive been shunted into some seedy sidings in my time but this was the crybbe unattended studio ten feet long and six feet wide walls that closed in on you like the sides of a packing case a tapemachine on a metal stand a square mahogany table with a microphone next to a small console with buttons that lit up and the chair and no windows just a central light and two little red lights one above the door outside to warn people to keep away in case whoever was inside happened to be broadcasting live to the scattered homesteads of the welsh marches this studio used to be the gents lavatories at the back of the cock before theyd built new ones inside the main building then some planning wizard at offas dyke radio had presumably stuck a plastic marker into the map and said without great enthusiasm crybbe well yeah ok not much of a place but its almost exactly halfway up the border and within couple miles of the dyke itself about as central as we can get then theyd have contacted the marches development board whod have told them no problem we can offer you a purposebuilt broadcasting centre on our new kington road industrial estate at an annual rent of only at which point the planning wizard would have panicked and assured them that all that was required was a little room to accommodate reporters and interviewees one at a time and for sending tape down a landline to offas dyke main studios all selfoperated no staff no technicians very discreet you walk in you switch on and a soundengineer records your every word from fifty miles away which was how theyd ended up with the former gents at the cock a tired brick building with a worn slate roof at the end of a narrow passageway past the dustbins the original white tiles with worrying brown stains had gone now or at least were hidden behind the black acoustic screening which formed a little soundproof module inside the building but sometimes especially early in the morning fay would swear she could smell thats lovely fay thanks very much thanks barry fay told the microphone on the desk all engineers were called barry its elton actually he said hang on gavins here hed like a word elton jesus nobody in this country who was called elton could possibly be over twentyone even the damned engineer at offas dyke were fresh out of engineering school gavin ashpole came on the line the stations news editor an undeveloped rasp unsure of whether it was supposed to sound thrusting or laidback he wanted to know if fay was any closer to an interview with max goff about his plans for crybbe court or at least some sort of statement i mean is it going to be a recording studio or what we going to have enormous rock stars helicoptering in we need to know and we need to know before we read about it in the bloody papers no listen i told you his pa insists he doesnt want any publicity yet but calm down woman dont rise to it but when hes got things together fay finished lamely he says theyll tell me first i ive no reason to think shes bullshitting why cant you doorstep him just turn up put the fucker on the spot look isnt it better to try and stay on the right side of the guy there could be a lot of mileage in this one for us in in the future hesitating because in the future she wasnt going to be here was she absolutely no way she could tell him about the late henry kettle being hired by goff to do some dowsing around the court partly because she hadnt been able to persuade mr kettle to tell her what he was supposed to be looking for and partly because loony gavin ashpole would start wondering how he could implicate the famous goff in henrys death i dont know fay ashpole switching to the experienced news editors pensive drawl im not into all this pussyfooting about were gonna lose out here listen try him again yeah if you dont get anywhere well have to you know reconsider things he meant if she didnt get him an interview soon theyd send in some flash kid from the newsroom to show her how it was done nasty little sod gavin ashpole all of twentyfour career to carve youve got to stop this fay warned herself as the line went dead youre becoming seriously obsessed with age good god woman youre not old just older than almost everybody else connected with offas dyke radio which ok was not exactly old old but what it is she thought your whole lifes been out of synch thats the problem goes back to having a father who was already into his fifties when you were conceived discovering your dad is slightly older than most other kids granddads and yet when you are not yet in your teens it emerges that your mother is threatening to divorce your aged father because of his infidelity fay shook her head playing with the buttons on the studio tapemachine hed given up the other woman narrowly escaping public disgrace eight years later he was a widower fast forward over that too painful whizz on through another nevermindhowmany years and there you are recovering from your own misguided marriage to a gradea dickhead pursuing your first serious career as a radio producer in london and yes almost starting to enjoy yourself when out of the blue your old father rings to invite you to his wedding in sorry where did you say crybbe where the hell is that dad also more to the point who the hell is grace and then bloody hell before he can reply you remember oh my god grace was the woman whod have been cited in mums petition grace legge she must be sixtytwo and not terribly well im afraid fay moneywise too shes not in such a healthy position so im doing the decent thing twenty years too late you might say i might not say anything coherent for ages dad im bloody speechless anyway ive sort of moved in with her this little terraced cottage shes got in crybbe which is where she was born you go to hereford and then you sort of turn right and just er jus carry on as it were and what about your own house whos taking care of that woodstock oh i er i had to sell it didnt get a lot actually the way the market is but just a minute dad am i really hearing this you sold that bloody wonderful house are you going senile not an enormously tactful question with hindsight no option my dear had to have the readies for for private treatment for grace and er things which goes now you dont have to tell me goes against everything ive always stood for so dont spread it around but shes really not awfully well and i feel sort of sort of guilty as hell yes i suppose sort of fay would you object awfully to drifting out here and giving me away as it were very quiet of course very discreet no dogcollars this is when eleven months ago the wedding is not an entirely convivial occasion at the time grace legge getting married in a wheelchair has approximately four months to live and she knows it when you return to a damp and leafless lateautumnal crybbe for the funeral you notice the changes in your dad changes which a brainscan will reveal to be the onset of a form of dementia caused by hardening of the arteries sometimes insufficient blood is getting to his brain the bottom line is that its going to get worse the dementia is still intermittent but he can hardly be left on his own he wont come to london graces cats and things i promised and he wont have a housekeeper never had to pay a woman for washing my socks and i dont plan to start now wash my own fay sighed deeply cut to controllers office christmas eve fay its not rational why dont you take a week off and think about it i know if it was my father hed have to sell up and rent himself a flat in town if he was expecting me to keep an eye on him this is just it he doesnt expect me to hes an independent old sod all right lets say you do go to this place how are you supposed to make a living well ive done a bit of scouting around this new outfit offas dyke radio local radio independent local radio here today and oh fay come on dont do this to yourself i thought maybe i could freelance for them on a breadandbutter basis theyve got an unattended studio actually in crybbe which is a stroke of luck and the local guy they had hes moved on and so theyre on the lookout for a new contributor ive had a chat with the editor there and he sounded quite enthusiastic i bet he did and maybe i could do the odd programme for you if freelancing for a local independent as well doesnt break some ancient bbc law im sure thats not an insurmountable problem but i know i know im far too young to be retiring to the country and far too good actually youve never said before you might have asked for more money typical bloody bbc fay spun back the henry kettle tape why couldnt you rewind your life like that and let herself out throwing the studio into darkness with the master switch by the door but the spools were still spinning in her head she locked up and set off with a forced briskness up the alley an ancient passageway smoked brick walls with a skeleton of yearsblackened beams sometimes cobwebs hung down and got in your hair she wasnt overfond of this alley there were always used condoms underfoot sometimes the concrete flags were slippery with them in winter they were frozen like milk icepops she emerged into the centre of crybbe as the clock in the church tower was chiming eleven getting to eleven sounded like a big effort for the mechanism you could hear the strain there were lots of deep shadows even though the sun was high because the crooked brick and timbered building slouched together like downandouts sharing a cigarette picturesque and moody in the evening sometimes in the daytime rundown shabby people were shopping in the square mainly for essentials the shops in crybbe specialized in the items families ran out in between weekly trips to the supermarkets in hereford or leominster in crybbe prices were high and stocks low these were longestablished shops run by local people the grocer the chemist the hardware and farming suppliers other longestablished businesses had like henry kettle gone to the wall and been replaced by a new type of store like the gallery run by hereward and jocasta newsome from surrey specializing in the works of border landscape artists in the window fay saw three linked watercolours of the tump at different times of day the ancient mound appearing to hover in the dawn mist then solid in the sunlight and then dark and black against an orange sky a buff card underneath lid in careful copperplate the tump a triptych by darwyn hall price wow a snip fay wondered how they kept the place open then walked on past a little scruffy pub the lamb past middle marches crafts which seemed to be a greetingscard shop this week and then the crybbe pottery which specialized in chunky earthenware gothic houses that lit up when you plugged them in but didnt give out enough light by which to do anything except look at them and despair morning mr preece she said to the town mayor a small man with a face like a battered wallet full of pouches and creases owre you mr preece intoned and walked on without a second glance it had been a couple of months before fay had realized that how are you was not in these parts a question and therefore did not require a reply on the lines of im fine mr preece owre you or quite honestly mr preece since you ask im becoming moderately pissed off with trying to communicate with the dead braindead anyway most of them in this town nobody ever seemed to get excited or to question anything nobody ever organized petitions to the council demanding childrens playgrounds or leisure centres women never giggled together on street corners fay stopped in the street then and had what amounted to a panic attack she saw the spools on the great tapedeck of life and the one on the right was fat with tape and the one on the left was down to its last half inch another quarter of a century had wound past her eyes and she saw a sprightly redfaced little woman in sensible clothes returning from the crybbe unattended another masterpiece gone down the line for the youngsters in the newsroom to chuckle over poor old fay all those years looking after her dad feeding him by hand constantly washing his underpants think wed better send young jason over to check this one out and the buildings in the town hunched a little deeper into their foundations and nodded their mottled roofs owre you they creaked owre you fay came out of the passageway shivering in the sun tingling with an electric depression and she thought she was hearing howling and she thought that was in her head too along with the insistent urgent question how am i going to persuade him to turn his back on this dismal accepting little town where grace legge has left him her cottage her cats and a burden of guilt dating back twenty years how can i reach him before he becomes impervious to rational argument then she realized the howling was real a dog not too far away a real snoutupturned earsback bayingatthemoon job fay stopped even in the middle of a sunny morning it was a most unearthly sound shed been about to turn away from the town centre into the huddle of streets where graces house was curious she followed the howling instead and almost walked into the big blue back of police sergeant wynford wiley he was standing facing the police station and a woman who was hissing at him who was half his size sharpfaced redfaced sixtyish back arched like a cornered cat what you want me to do wynford was yelling face like an edam cheese shoot im is it i dont care what you do the woman screeched but im telling you this i dont like it she looked wildly and irrationally distressed she was vibrating youll get it stopped the dog howled again an eerie spiral the woman seized the policemans arm as if she wanted to tear it off fay had never seen anyone so close to hysteria in crybbe where emotions were private like bank accounts whose dog is it fay said they both turned and stared at her and she thought sure i know none of my business im from off the ululation came again and the sky seemed to shimmer in sympathy i said whose dog is it chapter iv from a wicker basket in the pantry mrs preece took the fattest onion she could find she crumbled away its brittle outer layer until the onion was pale green and moist in the palm of her hand she sat the onion in a saucer stuff and nonsense commented jimmy preece the mayor of crybbe the sort of thing most of the local men would say in such situations with a certain ceremony as if it were a steaming christmas pudding mrs preece carried the onion on its saucer into the parlour jimmy following her she placed it on top of the television set she said nothing a funny woman you are jimmy preece said gruffly but not without affection mrs preece made no reply her mouth set in a thin line white hair pulled back and coiled tight they both heard the click of the garden gate and jimmy went to the window and peered through the gap in his delphiniums mrs preece spoke is it him jimmy preece nodded im going to the shop mrs preece said ill go out the back way likely hell have gone when i gets back what she meant was she wouldnt come back until he was good and gone jocasta newsome a spiky lady said in a parched and bitter voice it isnt working is it even you have to admit that now i dont know what you mean her husband was pretending he didnt care he was making a pictureframe in pine the ends carefully locked into a woodvice to form a corner the truth was he cared desperately about lots of things you jocasta said me it everything she was wearing a black woollen dress and a heavy golden shawl fastened with a celtic brooch at her shoulder go away hereward started flicking sawdust from his tidy beard if all you can be is negative go away on the workbench between them lay the immediate cause of this particular confrontation the electricity bill hed let sawdust go all over that deliberately well query it hereward had stated masterfully yes jocasta had replied but what if its correct how long can we go on paying bills like that the worst of it was they couldnt even rely on a constant supply hed never known so many power cuts one of the problems of living in a rural area im afraid the electricity official had told him smugly when he complained strong winds bring down the power lines thunder and lightning cows rubbing themselves against the posts birds flying into im trying to run a business here so are the farmers mr ah newsome but theyve seen the problems at first hand up on the hills so they you see they realize what were up against oh yes very clever what he was saying to hereward recognizing his accent was you people you come here expecting everything to be as smooth as surrey if you really want to be accepted in the countryside youd better keep your head down and your mouth shut got it hereward growled and jocasta thinking he was growling at her looked across at him in his new blue overalls standing by his new wooden vice and there was a glaze of contempt over her sulky eyes the rural craftsman she observed acidly at his bench youre really rather pathetic im trying to rescue the situation hereward snarled through clamped teeth you stupid bitch jocasta looked away walked out slammed the studio door and in the vice the newly constructed corner of herewards first frame fell symbolically apart hereward sank to his knees very deliberately he picked up the two lengths of moulded wood and set about realigning them he would not be beaten he would not give up and he would not let her disdain get to him if they couldnt sell enough original works of art they would for a limited period sell a number of selected prints at reasonable prices and the prices would be kept reasonable because he would make the frames himself dammit he did know what he was doing and he had recognized that there would be problems getting a new gallery accepted in a lesser known area obviously places like crybbe had fewer tourists all right far fewer but those who came were the right sort of tourists the intelligent childless couples who didnt need beaches and the cultured newlyretired people with time to construct the quality of life theyd always promised themselves slowly but emphatically the gallery would build a reputation among the discerning they would travel from as far away as shrewsbury and cheltenham and even oxford and london the gallery would expand and then other specialist dealers would join them and pretty soon it would be crybbe for fine art the way it was hayonwye for books of course it took time he would say at dinner parties good lord i remember in the early days when to save money one actually made ones own frames festival is it jimmy preeces eyes were like screwheads countersunk into old mahogany we never had no festival before precisely the point mr mayor max goff tried to smile sincerely and reassuringly but he knew from hundreds of press photos that it always came out wide and flashy like car radiators in the sixties no mr preece shook his head slowly as if they were discussing waterskiing or firstdivision football things which transparently were not part of the crybbe scene not round yere goff leaned forward hed given a lot of thought to how hed sell this thing to the townsfolk a festival a celebration of natural potential except this festival would last all year round this festival would absorb the whole town it would recreate crybbe the point is mr mayor you got so much to be festive about go on ask me what the hell you got to be festive about the mayor just nodded jeez let me explain ok whitesuited goff was feeling well out of place in this cramped little parlour where everything was brown and mottled and shrunkenlooking from the beams in the ceiling to the carpet to jimmy preece himself but he had to crack this one getting the mayor on his side would save a hell of a lot of time ok goff said calmly lets start with the basics how much you heard about me jimmy preece smiled slyly down at his feet encased in heavy wellpolished working boots with nearly as many ancient cracks as his face goff flashed the teeth again never trust newspapers mr mayor the more money you make the more the c the more theyre out to nail you specially if youve made it in a operation like mine which as im sure you know is the music business the recording industry ive heard that sex drugs and rock and roll eh i wouldnt know about those things nor would i mr mayor goff lied only been on the business side a business like any other and im not denying its been highly successful for me im a rich man goff paused and now i want to put something back into the world if you like but more specifically into crybbe mr preece didnt even blink because you have a very special town here mr mayor only this town its forgotten just how special it is come on you old bastard ask me why its so flaming special goff waited keeping his cool very commendably he thought under the circumstances then after a while jimmy preece made his considered response well well he said and was silent again max goff felt his nails penetrate the brown vinyl chairarms i dont mean to be insulting here mr mayor he said loudly with a big wide shiny smile a cadillac of a smile but you have to face the fact that this little town is in deep shit he let the words and the smile shimmer in the room terminally depressed he said economically sterile still the mayor said nothing but his eyes shifted sideways like the eyes of a ventriloquists doll and goff knew he was last getting through ok he pulled on to his knee a green canvas bag im gonna lay it all down for you yeah there it was a hint of anxiety even a century ago goff stared the old guy straight in the eyes this town was home to over five thousand people how manys it got now mr preece looked into the fireplace breathed in as if about to answer and then breathed out without a word ill tell you at the last census there were two thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour this is in the town itself im not including the outlying farms from the canvas bag goff took a pad of recycled paper opened it began to read the figures crybbe once had a grammar school and two primary schools its now down to single primary and the older kids get bussed to a secondary school eight miles away yeah mr preece nodded slowly and then carried on nodding as his head was working loose even as recently as goff said there were four police men in crybbe how many now mr preeces lips started to shape a word and then went slack again as goff zapped him with more statistics back in the fifties there were three grocers shops two butchers a couple of chemists and there was mr preece almost yelled where you gettin all this from but goff was coming at him like a train now and there was no stopping him a regular assize court earlier this century and now what not even petty sessions any more no justices no magistrates used to be a selfsufficient local authority covering wide area from crybbe and employing over seventy people now theres your town council not much more than a local advisory body that employs precisely one person parttime thats mrs byford the clerk who lakes the notes at your meetings look what whats all this about jimmy preece was shrinking back into his chair goff leaning further towards him with every point he made but deciding it was time to cool things a little bottom line mr mayor is you got a slowly ageing population and nothing to offer the young to keep them here even the outsiders are mostly retired folk crybbes already climbed into its own coffin and its just about to pull down the lid goff sat back putting away his papers leaving jimmy preece mayor of crybbe looking as tired and wasted as his town mr mayor how about you call a public meeting crybbe and me we need to talk in the gallery itself her place jocasta newsome was starting to function at last god shed thought it was never going to begin she walked quickly across the quarrytiled floor tap tap tap of the high heels echoing from wall to wall in the highroofed former chapel a smart brisk sound she loved look let me show you this its something actually quite special no really the customer raised a hand and a faint smile this is what i came for oh but jocasta fell silent realizing that a sale was about to go through without recourse to the skills honed to a fine edge during her decade in international marketing she pulled herself together smiled and patted the hinged frame of the triptych it is rather super though isnt it actually the customer said turning her back on the triple image of the tump i think its absolutely dreadful oh jocasta was genuinely thrown by this because the customer was undoubtedly the right kind barbour silk scarf and that offhand isntlifetedious sort of poise shed always rather envied the woman revived her faint smile im sorry i didnt mean to be rude my boss thinks its wonderful and thats all that matters i suppose its the subject im not terribly taken with its only a large heap of soil after all jocasta mentally adjusted the womans standing she had a boss dare she ask who he was ill pa ill have it packaged for you oh dont bother ill just toss it in the back of the jeep havent far to go how far exactly jocasta asked silently directing a powerful ray of naked curiosity at the woman it usually worked the door closed behind him max goff stood a moment on the sunlit step crybbe laid out before him jimmy preeces retirement cottage was a fitting place for the mayor to live at the entrance to the narrow road off the little square the one which led eventually the court jimmy preece being the head of the family which had lived at court farm since sixteensomething at least it was fitting also for the mayor because it was at the top of the town with the church of st michael on the right and you could see the buildings eighteenth seventeenth century and earlier staggering gently inebriated down the hill to the river with its threearched bridge from up here goff could easily discern the medieval street pattern almost unchanged he figured the newer buildings the school the council housing and the small industrial estate had been tacked on and could no doubt just as easily be flicked away it was bloody perfect unspoiled and this was precisely because it was not a wealthy town because it was down on its luck and had been for a long long time because it was not linked to the trunk roads between wales and the midlands and was not convenient never would be no use at all for commuting to anywhere and yet beneath this town the dragon slumbered she was going to ring darwyn hall the artist immediately but hereward walked in still wearing his artisans outfit and carrying a mug of coffee the mug was one of the misshapen brown things theyd felt obliged to buy from the crybbe pottery who was that jocasta was sitting at her desk in a corner of the gallery putting the cheque away it was a customized company cheque the word epidemic faded across it like a watermark a sale of course she said nonchalantly good god hereward looked around to see which of the pictures had gone picking it up later are they you should be looking in the window jocasta just couldnt hold her cool any longer and an awful smirk of delight was spreading over her face like strawberry jam youre joking hereward said stunned he strode to the window and threw back the shutters good grief he turned back to jocasta full price this is not a bloody discount store darling stone me said hereward the triptych just like that i mean who jocasta waited a second or two adjusted the celtic brooch at her shoulder and then casually hit him with the big one max goff gosh hereward pit down his cup so its true then he has bought the court sent his personal assistant to collect it jocasta said rachel wade this is far from bad news hereward said slowly in fact this could be the turning point mrs preece waited across the square with her shopping bag until she saw the large man in the white suit stride out past the delphiniums he didnt she noticed close the garden gate behind him she watched him get into his fancy black car and didnt go across to the house until she couldnt even hear its noise any more jimmy was still sitting in the parlour staring at the wall mrs preece put down her shopping bag and reached over jimmy to the top of the television set where the onion was sitting in its saucer youll be late for your drink she said im not going today i ave to talk to the clerk before she goes back to the library what was he after demanded mrs preece standing there holding the saucer with the onion on it he wants us to call a public meeting oh he does does he and whos he to ask for a public meeting an interferer jimmy preece said thats what he is mrs preece said nothing i dont like interferers jimmy preece said there was nothing his wife could say to that she walked through to the kitchen holding the saucer before her at arms length as if what it had on it was not a peeled onion but a dead rat in the kitchen she got out a meat skewer a big one nearly a foot long and speared the onion the sharp point slipping easily into its soft moist white flesh then she took it across to the rayburn and opened the door to the fire compartment with a quick stab and a shiver partly f revulsion partly satisfaction she thrust the onion into the flames and slammed the door hard chapter v this may seem an odd question the vicar of crybbe said after a good deal of hesitation but have you ever performed an exorcism the question hung in the air for quite a while sunk into his armchair in graces former sittingroom canon alex peters peered vaguely into the thick soup of his past had he done an exorcism buggered if he could remember the sun was so bright now at least suggestive of warmth that alex had stripped down to his washedout kate bush tshirt the letters in bush stretched to twice the size of those in kate by the considerable belly hed put on since the doctor had ordered him to give up jogging on his knees was a fiendishlooking black tomcat which grace had named after some famous russian chekhov dostoevsky buggered if he could remember that either ah sorry murray yes exorcism mmm what should he say east anglia perhaps when he was in charge of one of those huge terrifying flint churches in suffolk needed to be a bit careful here ah ill tell you what it was murray going back a good many years this wasnt the full bell book and candle routine as i remember more of a quickie blessthishouse operation actually i think i made it up as i went along the revd murray beech raised an eyebrow alex said well you know the sort of thing i have reason to believe theres an unquiet spirit on the premises so in the name of the management i suggest you leave these decent folk alone and push off back where you came from theres a good chap the revd murray beech did not smile expect i dramatized it a bit alex said but thats what it boiled down to seemed to work as i recall dont remember any comebacks anyway why dyou ask although he wore the regulationissue black shirt and clerical collar rather than a kate bush tshirt young murray beech didnt seem like a real vicar to alex more like the ambitious deputy head of some innercity comprehensive school he was on the edge of one of graces gplan dining chairs looking vaguely unhappy about the can of lager alex had put unceremoniously into his hand you see the way you put it then murray said carefully as though he were formulating a point at a conference makes it seem as if you knew at the time that you were only going through the motions well thats probably true old chap but who knows what we do when we go through the motions a sunbeam stroked alexs knees the cat shifted a little to make the most of it do i understand murray that someone has invited you to perform an exorcism this appears to be the general idea the vicar said uncomfortably the central dilemma is as you know im not into sham too much of that in the church absolutely old chap you see my problem is oh i think i know what your problem is perhaps alex thought it used to be my problem too to an extent how sure of our ground we are when were young ministers for instance murray if i were to ask you what you consider to be the biggest evils in the world today youd say inequality racism destruction of the planet due to unassuageable im not going to say capitalism lets call it greed he eyed the guardian on alexs chairarm surely youd agree with that course dear boy spot on look tolstoy would you mind not sharpening your claws on my inner thigh theres good cat so who wants you to do this exorcism difficult murray smiled without humour difficult situation its a teenager lives with the grandparents think theres some sort of his mouth pursed in distaste disruptive etheric intrusion in the house poltergeist eh what have the grandparents got to say thats the difficulty im not supposed to speak to them this person is rather embarrassed about the whole thing having read somewhere that socalled poltergeists are often caused by or attracted to a disturbed adolescent you know that theory rampant hormones overflowing smart boy in my day of course the vicar would just have told him to stop wanking and the thing would go away murray said its a girl oh she wants me to go along when her grandparents are out and deal with this alleged presence oh dear alex opened his can of heineken with a snap youre right my boy it is a difficult one erm he looked across at murray all cropped hair tight mouth and steely efficiency do you suppose this youngster might have something of a crush on you well it wasnt entirely beyond the bounds of possibility there were some pretty warped kids around these days oh i dont think its that alex that would be comparatively easy to deal with glad you think so what have you said to her then we had a long discussion about the problems and insecurities of the postpubescent period made more difficult in this case because she has no parents to go to mother dead father in the merchant navy you see i dont want to fail the kid because you know so few people in this town ever actually come to me for help especially with anything of a nonmaterial nature ie anything that doesnt involve opening jumble sales its obvious most of them find me an institutional irrelevance most of the time wouldnt say that old chap wouldnt you oh certainly theyre always there on sunday well enough of them anyway so no congregation problems as such but thats what its all about old son thats the core of it bums on pews is it is that what you think the dining chair creaked as murray hunched forward chin thrusting have you ever looked out over your parishioners and seen all the animation all the commitment of a doctors waiting room or a bus queue alex nodded theyre not expressive people in this town i grant you perhaps a chap like you ought to be working in a more happening situation as they say murray clearly thought so too but alex could see the difficulty hed been lucky to get a parish this size at his age still in his twenties could be a key step on the way to the bishops palace before he turned forty if he made the right impression they heard footsteps on the path a key in the front door ah heres fay look murray why dont we ask her about your problem used to be a teenage girl herself not awfully long ago no murray beech jerked on the edge of his dining chair not a word if you dont mind alex i dont want this turned into a joke on the radio good god murray i hardly think please ok if thats how youd prefer it i say whats wrong with old chekhov the cat had leapt on to the chairback next to alexs shoulder looking even less at ease than the vicar of crybbe dad fay called from the hall you havent got rasputin in there have you if you have just hold on to him there was a patter of paws we may have a minor integration problem the cat hissed in alexs ear i must go murray beech said putting the unopened can of lager on top of graces little nest of tables the door opened and a dog came in followed by fay the dog was straining on the end of a clothesline it was a rather bizarre dog black and white the size of a sheepdog but with a terriers stance and enormous ears like a donkeys the dog ignored rasputin but sniffed suspiciously at murray beech as the vicar came to his feet sorry about this dad fay said but you and rasputin have to make allowances show a little charity oh hullo murray im quite glad youre here the dog ambled over to alex hes had a bereavement fay said listen murray do you know mrs byford halfway to the door the vicar stiffened the old police house thats the one yes is she all right im sorry what do you mean all right alex patting the dog observed how inhibited murray beech became when fay was around partly he thought because of what she did for a living and partly no doubt because he couldnt help fancying the arse off her open to that kind of thing now too since his engagement had gone down the toilet this mrs byford fay said was throwing the most amazing wobbly he looking at the dog was howling in his cell at the nick and mrs byford was reacting as if it was the fourminute warning or something really going for wynford the copper get it stopped im not having it i dont like it way over the top perhaps she simply feels she has a right to peace and quiet murray said tightly living next to the copshop drunks getting hauled in on a saturday night what the hell does she know about peace and quiet murray shrugged im sorry i have to go ill talk to you again alex yes call in any time old chap when the vicar had gone fay said creep no just a duck out of water alex said stroking the rigid rasputin hed be far more at home in birmingham preaching peaceful coexistence with islam whos your extraordinary friend um yes im sorry to spring him on you but it all happened very quickly what with this loopy woman definitely something wrong with her fay knelt down and detached the clothesline from the dogs collar hes called arnold he was henry kettles dog he seems to have been in the car when it crashed must have got out through a window afterwards they found him this morning sitting by the wreckage like the greyfriars bobby breaks your heart doesnt it arnold rested his chin for just a moment on alexs knee there was a savage hiss from rasputin poor old chap alex said he thought the dog had strangely kind eyes but he cant stay here arnold glanced at rasputin with disinterest then padded away fay said i was afraid to be honest of what wynford might have done to shut him up oh surely not i dont know the police round here are different wynford had him in this concrete coal shed kind of place hard door no windows no basket or anything a metal bucket to drink out of barbaric so i thought thats it hes not staying here then wynford and i had this terrific battle oh dear alex said poor chap oh we has to let the rspca deal with it we has to abide by the procedures bollocks i said send the rspca round to see me no contest alex said listen that guy is seriously weird his features are too small for his head and they never alter so i just opened the shed door and walked off and the dog followed me wynfords left standing there face getting redder and redder like a pumpkin with a light inside on halloween arnold was pottering around the room sniffing uncertainly huge ears pricked its remarkable really he doesnt seem to have been injured at all though i dont suppose bruises would show up on a dog psychologically though yes its a damn shame but fay psychologically he could be in pieces but he cant stay here fay alex sat up trying to look authoritative grace would have a fit she wasnt at all fond dogs and neithers old rasputin dad fay was wearing that expression grace is bloody dead anyway she squatted down beside arnold and cradled his black and white snout in her hands long black whiskers came out between her fingers if he goes i go too canon alex peters took a long swig of cold heineken splendid he said chapter vi people kept looking at her this was not usual normally on these streets even if you were greeted owre you you were not looked at you were observed your presence was noted but you were not directly examined maybe she thought it was the dog maybe they recognize the late henry kettles dog or maybe theyd never before see a dog on the end of a thin red plasticcovered clothesline that the person on the other end was now wishing she hadnt adapted because every time the dog tugged at the makeshift lead her right hand received what could turn out to be thirddegree burns arnold for christs sake with henry kettle hed appeared ultradocile really laid back now he was like some loony puppy pulling in all directions wanting to go nowhere needing to go anywhere and fast you had to make allowances he was disoriented hed had a bereavement in fact the worst thing that could happen to a oneman dog had happened to arnold so allowances definitely were called for and one of the people who was going to have to make them was canon alex peters in fays experience all this catanddog incompatibility business was grossly exaggerated even rasputin would in time come around but another animal was another root in crybbe and you dont want that fay you dont want any roots in crybbe bill davies the butcher walked past with fresh blood on his apron and he stared at them fay was fed up with this she stared back bill davies looked away maybe they were all afflicted with this obsession about dogs fouling pavements shed have to buy one of those poopscoop things on the other hand did that kind of obsession really seem like crybbe where apathy ruled for gods sake arnie make up your mind theyd come to the square and he seemed to want to turn back he circled miserably around dragging the clothesline and winding it round the legs of a woman bending over the tailgate of a range rover shoving something in the back oh hell im really sorry look if you can stand still ill disentangle you im very sorry no problem the woman said looking quite amused she was the first person who hadnt stared at them which meant she must be from off of course she was she was max goffs pa ms coolly efficient were not used to each other fay explained its henry kettles sheepdog the poor chap who im looking after him oh yes rachel wade stepped out of the loop of clothesline youre from the radio we all have a living to make fay said and then making the most of the encounter look can i talk to you some time im being hassled by my boss to find out whats happening to the court that hurt referring to gavin ashpole as a boss which he wasnt and was never going to be sure rachel said surprising her when now if you like we could go over to the court max is out seeing people great hop in then rachel said but arnold didnt want to in the end fay had to pick him up and dump him on the back seat where he flattened himself into the leather and panted and trembled sorry about this fay climbed into the passenger seat hes not surprisingly more than a bit paranoid he was in henrys car when it you know oh dear poor dog i didnt know about that rachel started the engine its rather a mystery isnt it about mr kettle do you think hed been drinking i didnt know him very well i think a heart attack or stroke or something seems more likely dont you he was a nice old man rachel swung the range rover off the square into the street that wriggled down past the church the graveyard on the right a few cottages on the left the street narrowed and entered a wood where the late afternoon sun was filtered away and the colours faded almost to grey i dont believe all that dowsing stuff but he was a nice old man dont you i thought oh max does max believes it good god yes however i dont get paid to share his wilder obsessions well he thinks i do rachel exhaled a short throaty laugh they came out of the wood a track to the left was barred by a gate with a metal sign court farm where the preece farmed jack son of jimmy the mayor and jacks two son shed seen jack once slinking almost furtively out of the church his nightly duty accomplished and what exactly is mr goffs obsession with the court ill show you in a minute rachel said affably this was too easy fay was suspicious she watched rachel wade driving with a languid economy of movement like people drove in films only you knew they werent in real moving vehicles this was the kind of woman who could change a wheel and make it look like a ballet made you despair rachel said is that your father the old clergyman or your grandfather or something father youve met him in the cock we got into conversation after my lighter fell off the bar and he picked it up rachel smiled in fact if hed been considerably younger id almost have thought fay nodded wryly the old knockingthelighteroffthebar routine then he carries out a detailed survey of your legs while hes picking it up hes harmless i think hes certainly a character rachel pulled up in a walled courtyard amid heaps of sand and builders rubble before them random greybrown stones were settled around deepset mullioned windows and a dusty oak door was halfopen fay took a breath crybbe court rachel said but dont get too excited she snapped on the handbrake leave the dog in the car he wont like it nobody does really apart from historians and even they get depressed at the state of it she wondered what had made her think it was going to be mellow and warmtoned like a country house on a christmas card its old she said elizabethan she felt cold and folded her bare arms outside it was a fairly pleasant midsummers day in here stark and grim as dankest february somehow shed imagined rich drapes and tapestries and polished panelling probably because the only homes of a similar period shed visited had been stately homes or national trust properties everything exuding the dull sheen of age and wealth divided from the plebs by brass railings and velvet ropes in crybbe court these days it seemed only the rats were rich the room was large stonefloored and lowceilinged and apparently fortified against the sun the only direct light was from three small highset windows not much more than slits bare blue sky through crossed iron bars fay said i suppose its logical when you think about it the period and everything but i didnt imagine it would be quite so she became aware of a narrow stone staircase spiralling into a vagueness of cold light hanging from above like a sheet draped over a banister ghastly rachel said is i think the word youre groping for lets go upstairs its possibly a little less oppressive the spiral staircase opened into a large chamber with mullioned windows set in two walls bars of dusty sunshine fell short of meeting in the middle it had originally been the main family livingroom rachel explained also im told the place where the local high sheriff a man named wort held out against the local populace whod arrived to lynch him have you heard that story ive heard the name but not the story oh well he was a local tyrant back in the sixteenth century known as black michael hanged men for petty crimes after allowing their wives to appeal to his better nature if you see what i mean also said to have experimented on people before they died in much the same way as the nazis did charming in the end the local people decided theyd had enough what the townsfolk of crybbe actually rebelled what did they do write wort must go on the lavatory wall probably for the first ten years of atrocities but in the end they really did come out to lynch him all gathered out there in the courtyard threatening to burn the place down with him in it if he didnt come out and did he no said rachel he went into the attic and hanged himself from the same rafters from which hed hanged his offenders and naturally fay said he haunts the place well no rachel said he doesnt actually no stories to that effect anyway and when mr kettle toured the house he said it was completely dead as in vacant unpresenced or however you care to put it max was terribly disappointed he had to console himself with the thought of the hound bounding across his path one night what black michaels hound nobody ever sees michael but there is a legend about his dog a big black baskervilletype creature said to haunt the lanes on the edge of town it comes down from the tump fay thought at once of the old lady who kept telephoning her mrs seagrove i didnt know about that rachel looked at her as if surprised anybody should want to know about it when was it last seen fay asked who knows the book max found the story in was published i think in the fifties one of those legends of the border collections the more recent ones dont seem to have bothered with it fay wondered if it would help mrs seagrove to know about the legend probably scare her even more or maybe mrs seagrove did know about it and had either invented or imagined her own sighting which would explain everything the problem with old ladies was you could never be quite sure of their state of mind especially the ones who lived alone she asked bravely are we going up to the attic then certainly not rachel said firmly for one thing its not terribly safe the floors pretty badly rotted away up there and max isnt insured against people breaking their necks unless theyve been hanged fay shivered and smiled and looked around well she said it could be wonderful i suppose if it was done up with a million pounds or so spent on it perhaps rachel prodded with a shoe and sent a piece of plaster skating across the dusty wooden floor i can think of better things you could do with a million pounds has it been like this since you know tudor times good god no at various times i mean in the past century alone its been a private school a hotel even an actual dwelling place again if we had a torch youd see bits of wiring and the ruins of bathrooms but nothings ever lasted long it was built as an elizabethan house and that in essence is what it keeps reverting to and now no big secret max is a new age billionaire with a dream you dont sound very impressed rachel stood in the centre of the room and spread her hands oh god he wants to be king arthur he wants to set up his round table with all kinds of dowsers and geomancers and spiritual healers and other ghastly cranks hes been quietly infiltrating them into the town over the past year and therell be some kind of max goff foundation on a dripfeed from epidemic hopefully with the blessing of the charity commissioners and people will get ludicrous grants to go off an search for their own pet holy grails sounds quite exciting said fay but rachel looked gloomy and rolled her eyes her hands sunk deep into the pockets of her barbour money down the drain she said whats a a geomancer its some sort of spiritual chartered surveyor someone who works out where its best to live to stay in harmony with the earth spirit whatever that is to protect yourself and your family against evil forces need i go on there were passages leading off the big room and fay took one and found herself in a dark little bedchamber it was the first room shed seen that was actually furnished there was an old chest under the pathetically inadequate window and a very small fourposter bed like a fourposter cot isnt it rachel had drifted in after her people were smaller in those days it was no more than five feet high and not much longer with very thick posts and an oak headboard with a recessed ledge on the ledge was a pewter candleholder with a candle stub in it the drapes were some kind of cumbersome brocade thick as tarpaulin and heavy with grease it seems theyd leap into bed rachel said and draw all the curtains tight and then blow out their candle having first read a passage from the bible you see theres space on the ledge for a bible because they just knew that on the other side of the curtains the evil spirits would be hovering en masse cosy isnt it claustrophobic fay had never liked fourposters however if you want a real scare rachel held out a box of matches light the candle and look in the chest she stood there holding the matchbox not much more than another shadow in the dim grimy bedchamber only a crease of her barbour at the elbow catching the light the coats dull waxen surface looked right for the period and fay had the alarming sensation that the dingy room was dragging them back into its own dark era was rachel smiling fay couldnt see her face she found herself accepting the matchbox go on rachel said light the candle ok she tried not to sound hesitant asking herself you arent nervous are you fay no she decided just bloody cold it might have occurred to me to wonder why she was wearing a barbour on midsummer day and she might have warned me about the temperature in this place she reached beyond the post at the bedhead and pulled the candleholder from the recess struck a match saw the candletray was full of dead flies and bluebottles turned it upside down but not all of them fell out yuk fay lit the candle shadows bounced the chest under the window she could see rachel wades face now in the candlelight and it wasnt smiling look rachel said forget it come on i was only joking no you werent fay smelled wax from the candle and from rachels coat perhaps id better open the blasted thing before this candle burns away rachel wade shrugged fay crossed to the window which left only a smear of light across the top of the chest obviously not elizabethan this chest it had black lettering stamped across its lid and was carelessly bound with greenpainted metal strips fay lifted the lid and lowered the candle she recoiled at once oh she said sorry what is it its eyesockets were black and two upper teeth were thin and curved a small cobweb hung between them the mouth was stretched wide in a fossilized shriek its a cat isnt it a mummified cat tiddles max calls it tiddles cute fay said and shuddered not very it was found in the rafters it may have been walled up there alive god practical geomancy rachel said the spirit of the cat acts apparently as a guardian they found half a horse behind the kitchen wall come on lets go chapter vii asleep in his armchair canon alex peters dreamed he was asleep in his armchair tucked up in a soft blanket of sunbeams he awoke in time to watch the wall dissolve it began with the fireplace he was aware that graces dreadful seethrough clock and the giltframed mirror were fading while the black sooty hole of the fireplace itself was getting bigger gradually the hole took over becoming darker and wider and then spreading up through the mantelpiece almost as far as the ceiling until the whole chimney breast dissolved into a black passageway there formed a filigree of yellowish light and then dimly at first grace appeared in the passageway standing there quite still what happened to your wheelchair alex asked he was glad of course to see her back on her feet no youre not grace said her lips did not move when she spoke but her body became brighter as if the spider web of lights was inside her like glowing veins you were glad when i died and youll be glad to know im still dead thats not true protested alex but you couldnt lie to the dead and he knew it grace turned her back on him and began to walk away along the passage alex struggled to get up desperate to explain but the chair wouldnt let him he shouted to the spindly diminishing figure grace look dont go give me a hand would you the chair held him in a leathery grip grace alex screamed grace dont go i want to explain just once grace glanced back at him over her shoulder and there was a pitying smile on her face with perhaps a shadow of malice goff did not of course have any immediate plans to live in crybbe court itself rachel wade said good god no well perhaps one day when it was fully restored you mean fay said as they walked out into the sunlight restored to what it wouldve been like if the elizabethans had had full central heating and tenspeaker stereos youre getting the general picture rachel confirmed and showed her the place where max actually would be living within the next week or so it was an lshaped stone stableblock behind the house it already had been gutted plumbed and wired and a giant plateglass window had been inserted into a solid stone wall to open up a new and spectacular view of the hills from what would be the livingroom at least the view would have been spectacular if it hadnt been semiobscured by a green mound like an inverted pudding basin or a giant helmet his beloved tump rachel said and there wasnt much affection there fay thought either for the mound or for max goff is it a burial mound or a what dyou call it castle mound motte probably both either way its pretty unsightly like an overgrown spoilheap and decidedly creepy by moonlight i mean who wants to stare out at a grave whoever built this place had the right idea i think by putting a blank stable wall in front so it wouldnt frighten the horses fay realized the court itself was built in a hollow and the tump was on slightly higher ground so that it seemed from here higher than it actually was it loomed the stone wall which surrounded it had partly fallen down on this side revealing the mesh of dense bushes and brambles at the base of the mound poor mr kettle fay said reminded by the wall rachel fingered a strand of pale hair the nearest shed come in fays presence to a nervous gesture the bitter irony is that max plans to move that wall he calls it a nineteenthcentury abomination some experts think its older than that and should be preserved but hell get his way of course in the end rachel stepped on a piece of soft plaster and ground it in the newly boarded floor he always does she said it was clear now to fay that this was not the same rachel wade who a week ago had briskly swept her down the steps of the cock with vague promises of an interview with goff when his plans were in shape sure on that occasion shed had a tape recorder over her shoulder but even if shed carried one today she felt rachels attitude would not have been markedly different something had changed fay said cautiously so when is he going to talk to me on tape leave it with me rachel said ill fix it she spread her arms to usher fay back towards the wooden framework evidently destined to be a doorway i hate having to ask this sort of question fay stopped at the entrance but he isnt going to be talking to anyone else is he first not if i can help it listen weve been walking around this place for the last fortyfive minutes and ive forgotten your name fay fay morrison would you like a job fay huh quite ludicrous salary seductively fast company car lots of foreign travel fay stared at her silly expenses rachel said untold fringe benefits shed turned her back on the big window from the far end of the room the hills had been squeezed out of the picture the window was full of tump how long have you been doing this fay asked as goffs pa nearly four years now i think ive done rather well on the whole although the physical demands are not too arduous maxs bisexuality goes in alternating phases during his dc periods he can leave you alone for months the grey eyes were calm and candid jesus christ fay said oh dont get me wrong i dont mind that i almost became an actress anyway and with max theres rarely anything terribly tiring and never anything particularly bizarre well except for the crystals and he only ever tried that once and anyway one always has to weigh these things against the benefits no its just rachel dug her fists deep into the pockets of her barbour until fay could see the knuckles outlined in the shiny waxed fabric its just i dont think i can go through with it here rachel said do you know what i mean grace legge came here to die dad came to go slowly loopy and i came to watch yes fay said bleakly i know exactly what you mean im beginning to realize how hard it is to get anything positive to take off here shed read somewhere that nobody could say for certain where the name crybbe came from it was obviously a corruption of the welsh and there were two possible derivations crib the crest of a hill which seemed topographically unlikely because the town was in a valley or crybachu to wither it appeals to him you know rachel said the fact that failure is so deeply ingrained here brings out the crusader him hes going to free the place from centuries of bucolic apathy the first story offas dyke got me to cover fay remembered was the opening of a new factory on the industrial estate quite a lively little setup producing chunky coloured sandals in fact im wearing a pair see they were providing eight local jobs and the marches development board were predicting itd be twenty before the end of the year closed down didnt it was it last week id have ordered another pair if id known fay said they stared at each other almost comically glum then rachel tossed back her ashblonde hair and strode determinedly through to the room which would soon be a kitchen come on lets get out of here hell be back soon she picked up two tumblers from the draining surface next to the new sink and fay followed her outside where she dug a bottle of sparkling wine from the silt in the bottom of an old sheep trough my private cellar and then they collected a grateful arnold from the range rover and wandered off across the field down the valley to the river where you could sit on the bank fifty yards from the threearched bridge and probably not see the court any more nor even the tump on the way down the field fay looked over her shoulder to watch the tump disappearing and saw a man among the trees on its summit he was quite still obviously watching them rachel whos that where on the tump i dont think its goff rachel turned round and made no pretence of not staring its humble she said maxs minder he loves it here he used to be a gamekeeper he prowls the woods all the time supposedly organizing security i think he snares rabbits and things very green i must say fay said maxs principles tend to get overlooked where humbles concerned i think he sometimes serves the need that occasionally arises in max for er rough boys i think im sorry i asked said fay alex awoke there was pressure on his chest when he was able to open his eyes just a little with considerable difficulty he looked into blackness oh lord he thought ive actually entered the dark place im in there with grace yet he was still in the armchair the chair was refusing to let go of him it had closed around him like an iron lung or something he was a prisoner in the chair and in the dark and there was a pressure on his chest grace he said feebly grace the darkness moved the darkness was making a soft rhythmic noise like a motor boat in the distance alex opened his eyes fully and stared into luminous ambergreen watchful eyes he chuckled the darkness was only a big black cat ras ras he whispered weakly trying to think of the creatures name the cat stood up on his chest rastus alex said triumphantly hullo rastus you know for a minute i thought oh never mind you wouldnt understand he wondered if it was teatime yet the clock said what couldnt make out if it was four oclock or five around four grace always liked a pot of tea and perhaps a small slice of dundee cake shed be most annoyed if hed slept through teatime fay on the other hand preferred a late meal women were so contrary it generally saved a lot of argument if he ate with them both alex chuckled again no wonder he was getting fat rachel put the bottle in the river and took off her barbour ill be thirtysix in january happens to us all fay said i was very much on top of the situation when i took the job nothing could touch me you know i was chief press officer at virgin and he headhunted me he said youre your price so i doubled my salary and he said ok its yours can you believe that she handed fay the glasses pulled the bottle out of the water and shot the cork at the bridge it fell short and they watched it bobbing downstream does that count as pollution rachel wondered why was goff so attracted to crybbe rachel poured wine until it fizzed to the brim of both tumblers magic magic fay repeated in a flat voice earth magic you mean leylines you know what all thats about i mean dont be ashamed its all speculation anyway tell me what it means in the crybbe context ok well presumably you know about alfred watkins who came up with the theory back in the s lived in hereford and did most of his research in these hills had the notion and set out to prove it that prehistoric sacred monuments standing stones stone circles burial mounds all this were arranged in straight lines just route markers he thought originally on straight roads ive got his book the old straight track right so you know that where four or five sites fell into a straight line hed call it a ley apparently because a lot of the places where these configurations occurred had names ending in ley ok like crybbe rachel grinned well he didnt know about crybbe or hed probably have called them crybbelines you read through watkinss book you wont find a single mention of crybbe i know i looked i was quite disappointed because apart from the tump theres nothing to see however it seems there used to be bloody dozens of standing stones and things around here at one time which disappeared over the centuries farmers used to rip them out because they got in the way of ploughing and whatever else farmers do rachel waved a dismissive hand to emphasize the general tedium of agriculture anyway there are places in britain where lots of leylines converge ancient sacred sites shooting off in all directions which obviously suggests these places were of some great sacred significance or places of power stonehenge sure and glastonbury tor and avebury st michaels mount in cornwall and other places youve probably never heard of but not crybbe youre really not going to tell me crybbe was ever sacred to anybody rachel swallowed a mouthful of wine and wiped her mouth with a deliberately graceless gesture before topping up her glass down on your knees woman im afraid youre on holy ground the bridge carried the main road into town and behind it fay could see chimneys and the church tower wooded hills mixture of broadleaf and conifer tumbled down on three sides from anywhere at a distance crybbe looked quite picturesque and that was all so how come there arent busloads of pilgrims clogging the roads then how come this is close to being britains ultimate backwater because the inhabitants are a bunch of hicks who cant recognize a good tourist gimmick when they get one on a plate i mean they did rip out the bloody stones in the first place thats why max brought in henry kettle he had to know where the stones used to be henry divines the spots sure he pinpoints the location then what you do is stick pole in the ground at the exact spot and if youre as rich and selfindulgent as max goff what you do next is have lots of lovely new stones cut to size and planted out in the fields prehistoric landscapegardening on a grand scale gosh fay was picturing a huge wild rockgarden with daffodils growing around the standing stones in the spring crybbe suddenly a little town in a magic circle i think that sounds rather a nice thing to do dont you i mean bizarre but nice somehow except its not quite as easy as it sounds rachel said and its going to cause trouble within a couple of weeks kettled discovered the probable sites of nearly thirty prehistoric stones a couple of burial mounds not to mention a holy well wow and fewer than a quarter of the sites are on the eight and a half acres of land which max bought with the court so hes going to restore stone age crybbe hes got to negotiate with a lot of farmers ah mercenary devils farmers and awkward sods in many cases true so hows he going to handle it he wants to hold a big public meeting to tell the people how he plans to revitalize their town i mean obviously youve got the considerable economic benefits of tourism look how many foreign trippers flock to avebury but also unwisely in my view hes going to explain all the esoteric stuff what ley lines are really all about and what they can do for the town energy lines fay said ive also read that other book the old golden land by j m powys distant descendant of the great mystical writer john cowper powys max loves that book coincidentally or not perhaps hes just bought the company which published it so he owns it now and he likes to think he owns j m powys for whom he has plans hes coming here if he knows whats good for him hell have plenty of likeminded idiots for company there are already nine new age people living in the town in properties craftily acquired by max over the past few months alternative healers herbalists astrologers cant say ive noticed them fay admitted thats because some of them look quite normal only they know they are the human transmitters of the new energy about to flow into crybbe the idea being that leylines mark out some kind of force field channels of energy which bronze age people knew how tap into is that right the great life force fay and so naturally resiting the stones will bring new life flowing back into crybbe max reckons well he hasnt worked it out for himself hes been told by lots of socalled experts that crybbe is only in the depressed state it is today because all the stones have gone so if you put them back itll be like connecting the town for the first time to the national grid the whole place will sort of light up fay thought about this it sounds rather wonderful if you like that kind of fairytale is it oh well sure what does it matter if its true or not itll bring in the crowds be an economic boost a psychological panacea create a few jobs but you see fay i know this guy rachel held up the bottle but fay shook her head and rachel poured what remained into her tumbler i dont think i can stand to watch him being baronial at crybbe court with his entourage of fringe scientists and magicians and minstrels and sundry jesters is that the central point at which all these leylines are supposed to meet the court or is it the church the tump rachel said its the tump its not a centre its a sort of axis the lines come off it in a fan shape the tump is like this great power station get the idea i mean really isnt it just the biggest load of old rhubarb you ever heard rachel brought an arm from behind her head and lobbed the empty winebottle into the air arnold tensed about to spring after it until he saw where it was going there was a satisfying splash now surely rachel said thats got to be pollution chapter viii fay walked back to the cottage for arnolds sake and to clear her head although she hadnt drunk all that much wine not compared to rachel anyway arnold however looked as if hed been drinking heavily veering from side to side on his tautened clothesline he was hopeless goff had not returned when they arrived back at the court shed left rachel carrying the triptych into the stableblock where it was to be doublelocked into a storeroom nearly a thousand quids worth of lessthanfine art hereward and jocasta newsome would for once have good reason to appear appallingly smug whichever way you look at it arnie fay said reflectively our friend goff is making waves in crybbe no bad thing either could she understand the guys obsession well yes she could a man whod made his first million marketing anarchic punkrock records in the midseventies waking up in the nineties to find himself sitting on a heap of money in a wilderness of his own creation all the cars and yachts and supertoys hed ever want and nothing to nurture the soul not exactly a quantum leap was it from there to the new age dream and the more she thought about it the proposed mystical liberation of an obscure welsh border town from years of economic decay was a story that deserved a bigger audience than it was ever going to reach through offas dyke radio in fact this could be the moment to approach her old chums at the bbc how about a fortyfiveminute radio documentary chronicling goffs scheme to turn crybbe into a new age camelot she could hear a sequence in her head lots of echoey footsteps and tinkly music the moaning of men and machinery as massive megaliths were manoeuvred into position it sounded good on the other hand she had an arrangement with offas dyke and the little shit ashpole would want first bite at every snippet that came out of the goff camp or well have to you know reconsider things little turd and while radio four was the interesting option a chance to prove she could still make nationalquality programmes offas dyke was bread and butter of course if there was a prospect of getting out of crybbe and back to london or manchester or bristol in the foreseeable future she could make the bbc programme and bollocks to od she passed the farm entrance and followed arnold and the road into the wood where the sudden darkness brought with it a wave of loneliness and resentment towards her dad why did the old bugger have to stay out here all that cobblers about his having to sell the house in woodstock to pay for graces treatment somehow dad fay thought all your moneys gone down the pan and tonight the close of what appeared to have been one of his better days seemed as good a time as any to make him tell her precisely how it had happened a bush moved it happened on the edge of her vision just as shed passed it and she thought its the wind then realized there was none arnold growled fay froze whos that bloody hell the phantom flasher of crybbe well there had to be one fay laughed nervously there was also black michaels hound you wouldnt think anything as black as that could glow would you thank you mrs seagrove there was a snigger an involuntary cry was snatched from fay and then he was off she saw him vanish behind a tree then reappear moving in a crouch like a spider up the field in the direction of the farm an unidentifiable shadow perhaps it was that man humble goffs minder have a nice wank did we fay called after him but it wasnt funny and that was why her voice cracked she was discovering that back alleys in the city full of chipwrapping and broken glass could sometimes be less scary than a placid sylvan lane at sunset because there was the feeling somehow that if it did happen here it would be worse hereward newsome couldnt wait to get home to tell his wife what hed learned in the cock hereward went off to what he described to visitors as my local hostelry perhaps two nights a week and stayed for maybe an hour he considered a local hostelry was one of those things a man ought to have when he lived in the country if he was to communicate with the locals on their own level why bother demanded jocasta who made a point of never going with him to the cock why on earth should i learn about sheep and pigs why cant the locals learn about fine art and communicate with us on our level because its their town hereward had reasoned pigs and sheep have been their way of life for centuries and now the industry is in crisis and they feel their whole raison detre is threatened we should show them we understand and he did his best hed started reading everything he could find in the guardian about sheep subsidies and the common agricultural policy so he could carry on a respectable discussion with the farmers in the public bar hed commiserate with them about the latest ec regulations and theyd say well well or sure tbe in their quiet contemplative tones and permit him to buy them another couple of pints of ansells bitter however he was always happier if colonel croston was in there or even old canon peters he might not have much in common with either of them but at least it would be a twoway conversation tonight however hed found common ground in a big way lights were coming on in the farmhouse as hereward parked the cv neatly at the edge of the slice of rough grass he called the paddock there was a volvo estate in the garage but he never took that into town unless there were paintings to be shifted its me darling hereward hammered on the stable door at the side of the farmhouse he kept telling her there was no need to lock it that was the beauty of the countryside but every other week shed point out something in the paper about some woman getting raped in her cottage or a bank manager held to ransom in his rural retreat but not in this area hereward would say looking pained even though shed have recognized his voice jocasta opened only the top half of the door so she could see his face and be sure he wasnt accompanied by some thug with a shotgun at his back it is me hereward said patiently when his wife finally let him in listen darling what did i say about the turning point coffee jocasta said hereward frowned when she was solicitous on his return from the pub it usually meant shed just concluded an absurdly lengthy phone call to her sister in normandy tonight though hed let it pass sorry jocasta said plugging in the percolator turning point you mean goff you remember i told you about that guy daniel osborne the homeopath who moved into a cottage in bridge street with his wife the acupuncturist now i learn that next door but one to him this is quite extraordinary theres a hypnotherapist who specializes in that what dyou call it when they try to take people back into previous lives regression jocasta turned towards him he thought she looked awfully alluring when her eyes were shining he had her full attention the fact is hereward was smiling broadly therere lots of them and we didnt know it all kinds of progressive alternative practitioners and new age experts in crybbe youre serious look ive just had this from dan osborne himself they can talk about it now seems max goffs been secretly buying property in town for months and either selling it at a very reasonable price or renting it to you know the right people what were getting here are the seeds of a truly progressive alternative community that is no no riffraff jocasta said crisply hippies if you must in fact its the sort of setup that well the prince of wales would support theres got to be a catch jocasta said ever cautious it seems remarkable that we havent heard about it before darling everybodys been ultra discreet i mean they dont look any different from your ordinary incomers and theres always been a big population turnover in this area look heres an example you remember the greyhaired woman very neat very welldressed who was in the gallery looking at paintings a couple of days ago who do you think that was shirley maclaine jean wendle said hereward who the spiritual healer she used to be a barrister or something and gave it up when she realized she had the gift oh jocasta digested this are you saying crybbes going to be known for this sort of thing with lots of tourists upmarket thinking tourists the kind that dont even like to be called tourists its going to be like glastonbury here only better itll be internationally famous well said jocasta if what you say is true its really quite annoying nobody told us we might have sold up and moved out not realizing and its still going to take time darling hereward said if goff can pull off something like this under our very noses the man is a magician the solemnity of the curfew bell lay over the shadowed square by the time fay and arnold came back into town and she found herself counting the clangs getting louder as they neared the church fiftyseven fiftyeight fiftynine there was something faintly eerie about the curfew was she imagining it or did people make a practice of staying off the streets while it was actually being rung even if they came out afterwards she stood staring at the steps in front of the clock willing somebody to walk in or out to prove her wrong nobody did nobody was walking on the street there was no traffic no children played no dogs barked only the bell and the cawing of crows like a distorted echo seventythree seventyfour seventyfive every evening the curfew would begin at precisely ten oclock you could set your watch by it and people often did how the custom had survived was not entirely inexplicable thered been a bequest by one percy weale a local woolmerchant and dogooder back in the sixteenth century hed left land and money to build crybbe school and also a further twelve acres in trust to the preece family and their descendants on condition that the curfew bell be rung nightly to safeguard the moral and spiritual welfare of the townsfolk should the preece family die off or neglect the task then the land must be rented out and the money used to pay a bellringer but even in times of plague or war it was said the curfew bell had never been silenced because hanging on to those twelve acres would be a matter of pride for the preeces also economics fay was learning that farmers in these parts would do almost anything to hold what land they had and would lay in wait for neighbouring death or misfortune to grab more when a farm was sold the neighbours swooped like buzzards snatching up acreage on every side often leaving a lone farmhouse marooned in the middle condemned either to dereliction or sumptuous restoration by city folk in search of a rural retreat the newsomes lived in one with a quarter acre of their own surrounded on all sides by other peoples property ninetyeight ninetynine one hundred although the suns last lurid light was spread like orange marmalade across the hills the town centre wore a sombre gown of deep shadows fay noticed arnolds clothesline had gone slack he was sitting on the cracked cobbles staring up at the church tower now overhung with florid cloud as fay watched him his nose went up and with a mournful intensity he began to howl as the howl rose pure as the curfews final peal with whose dwindling it mingled in the twilit air fay was aware of doors opening in the houses between the shops and the pubs on the little square no lights came on nobody came out arnold howled three times then sat there looking confusedly from side to side as if unsure hed been responsible for the disturbance fay could feel the stares coming at her from inside the shadowed portals in the square and the air seemed denser as if focused hostility were some kind of thickening agent clotting the atmosphere itself she felt she was being pressed backwards into the church wall by a powerful surge of heavyduty disapproval then someone a female voice screeched out youll get that dog out of yere and the doors began quietly to close one by one in muted clicks and snaps by which time fay was down on her knees clutching arnold to her breast squeezing his ridiculous ears warming her bare arms in his fur finding she was trembling jack preece came out of the church and walked away in the direction of the cock without looking at them chapter ix graces house was just an ordinary cottage in a terraced row which for some reason began in stone and ended in brick fay could pick it out easily because it was the only one in the row with a hanging basket over the front door as hanging baskets went this one wasnt subtle she kept it bursting with large vulgar blooms and watered them assiduously because this hanging basket was a symbol of something she was trying to say to crybbe there was no light and no sound from inside and she thought at first there must have been another blasted power cut then a light blinked on and off next door and she heard a television from somewhere hes gone to the pub she told arnold most nights her dad would stroll over to the cock for a couple of whiskies and one of their greasy barsnacks she would wait up for him because tonight they were going to have this thing out by the end of the week no argument there was going to be a for sale sign next to the hanging basket and she would start work on the goff documentary which radio four were definitely going to commission and offas dyke radio the voice of the marches could start looking for another stringer to justify the crybbe unattended but when fay marched into the office she found a note on her editing table informing her that canon alex peters had escaped to bed not feeling terrifically well to be honest having an early night ok so if you must have that dog in the house keep the bugger quiet fay smiled she knew hed come around then frowned at the postscript oh yes guy rang wants you to ring him back bloody guy did she really need this on top of everything she turned the note over in case there was an addendum re guy eight years ago her dad had been the only person with the perception to warn her off everyone else having congratulated her in some kind of awe before theyd even met guy in the flesh one friend you never forgot remarks like this saying you you and guy morrison never mind all in the past especially guy no regrets you had to be kidding except he would keep phoning as if she were just another one of his contacts oh hey listen im going to be in your part of the world next week buy you a drink fay sat down at the editing table rachel had drunk most of the wine with no discernible effects while fay had consumed less than a third of the bottle and now the room was sliding about in the light from the anglepoise it still looked very grace this room hshaped tiled fireplace and above it an oval mirror in a thick gilt frame on the mantelpiece was a clock with a glass case revealing a mechanism which looked like a pair of swinging testicles in brass this room the whole house was frozen in time in a nonetoostylish era round about the time in fact when fays dad had split up with grace and returned to her mother it was as if grace had given up after that certainly she hadnt married until the canon had come back into her life she seemed to have lived quietly in crybbe with her sister until the sister died worked quietly in the library a quiet woman a crybbe woman as fay understood it shed been working in hereford for the diocese when shed had her fling with alex how could she come back here fay said aloud and picked up the phone to call guy then put it back shed caught sight of arnold who was looking up at her in his unassuming way one ear pricked the other flopped over arnold im sorry what do you feel like for dinner he may have wagged his tail but she couldnt be sure it was that kind of tail the kitchen had knottypine cupboards and pinkveined imitationmarble worktops one of which bore her dads beloved microwave arnold accepted stewed steak from a can served on one of graces best china plates when hed finished fay let him out in the small back garden where it was almost fully dark there was no sign of rasputin or pushkin his lieutenant theyd be out hunting in the endless fields beyond the garden fence and in this pursuit they were obviously not alone somewhere out there a lightball bobbed possibly following the line of a hedge which was said to mark the old border between wales and england nobody in this town ever spoke of being english or welsh because at various times in its undistinguished history crybbe had been in both countries fay watched the light for several minutes listening illegal badgerdigging was shed heard one of the lesspublicized local recreations nasty vicious cruel but nobody had ever been prosecuted locally shed often wondered how sergeant wynford wiley would react if she rang him up one night and directed him to a spot where it was actually taking place spurts of squealing scuffling and snuffling as the terriers were sent into the soil to rip the badgers from their set there was a man who kept a pack of terriers on a farm two or three miles away ostensibly for hunting foxes fay wished she could nail the swine but she suspected that even if it was three oclock in the morning when she rang wynford would claim a prior appointment the countryside where so many pastimes were sour and furtive and tolerated arnold trotted in from the garden fay was very tired she laid out a thick mat under her editing table and folded an old blanket on top it i dont know what youre used to arnold but the management will listen sympathetically to any complaints in the morning arnold sat quietly next to the mat apart from the episode in the square he hadnt seemed a very demonstrative dog fay brought him a bowl of water im going to shut you in arnold because of the cats ok she scribbled a note to pin on the door telling her father not to go into the office if as happened occasionally he couldnt sleep and came down and dont let any cats in there then she went to bed she never put on the bedroom light the room looked squalid enough by daylight it was almost as claustrophobic as the crybbe unattended studio and its wallpaper had faded to brown fay would have redecorated the place but she wasnt staying was she they werent staying the bathroom had been modernized with characteristic taste a bath shower and washbasin in livid pink and black fay washed she looked in the mirror as she wiped the face people had been amazed at guy morrison falling for guy used to say she should spell her name fey because she looked like a naughty elf it had seemed like a kind of compliment at the time she used to be naive like that especially where guy was concerned and she wasnt going to waste any time speculating about what guy might want because the answer was no snapping off the bathroom light she found her way back to bed by the diffused rays of the midsummer moon very nearly full but trapped like a big silver pickled onion in a cloud sandwich she lay awake for a long time in her single divan thinking about the curfew and the furtive figure in the hedge about henry kettle and arnold and the wall splat horrible how did it happen thered be a postmortem forensic tests and an inquest but only arnold would ever really know and he was only a dog youll get that dog out of yere very sympathetic people in crybbe very caring wonderful warmhearted country folk miserable bastards eventually fay fell asleep with the moon in her eyes she awoke briefly and saw it all the clouds gone and she remembered that sleeping with direct moonlight on your face was supposed to send you mad she giggled at that and went back to sleep and dreamed a midsummer nights dream in which she was lying in bed and arnold was howling downstairs oh no fay flung the covers aside and sat up in bed arnolds howling seemed to filter up from below like slivers of light coming up through the cracks in the floorboards it probably would be even louder from the canons bedroom which was directly over the office she got out of bed and crept to the top of the stairs hissing shut it arnold for gods sake barefooted fay moved downstairs it was bloody chilly for a midsummers night especially when you were wearing nothing but a long tshirt with several holes in it at the bottom of the stairs she stopped and turned back picking up what she hoped was the sound of her dads snoring she ran a hand over the wall in search of the light switch but when she found it and pressed nothing happened everything hereward newsome had ever said about those cretins at the electricity company was dead right when she opened the office door arnold shot out and she caught him and he leapt into her arms and licked her face dont try and get round me she whispered you are not sleeping on my bed but when she carried him back into the office he whimpered and jumped out of her arms and she went back and found him standing by the front door ears down tail down quivering oh arnold did dogs have nightmares had he been reliving last night an almighty crunch an explosion of glass his masters head in a shower of blood i know arnold patting him i know his coat felt matted almost damp did dogs sweat christ he couldnt be bleeding could he she picked him up and lugged him back into the office automatically tipping the light switch by the door damn damn damn arnold hed squirmed out of her arms again and run away into the hall fay clutched helplessly at the air torch candle anything god it was cold moonlight was sprinkled over the room like frost the light twinkled on the twisting testicular mechanism of the clock on the mantelpiece fingered the mirrors ornate gilt frame quietly highlighting everything that was part of then while the now things the trestle editing table and the revox were screened by shadow as though in another dimension everything was utterly still get me she thought out of here out of this sad forsaken house out of this fossilized town then a sudden most unearthly sound uncurled from the fireplace like a babys cry of joy but also she thought startled and shivering also like an owl descending delightedly on its prey it came again and it sang with an unholy pleasure and she saw rasputin sitting massively in the hearth like an egyptian temple cat on a sarcophagus rasputins emerald eyes suddenly flared and he sprang fay gasped and went backwards clutching at the wall involuntarily closing her eyes against imagined flashing claws but the huge cat was not coming at her when she looked again hed landed solidly in a beam of pallid moonlight on the varnished mahogany arm of the fireside chair and he was purring in the chair grace legge sat rigidly her brittle teeth bared in a dead smile and eyes as white and cold as the moon part three a cars steering wheel like a dowsing rod is designed to amplify small movements of the drivers hands so a reflex twitch in someone who slips unconsciously into a dowsing mode would be enough to send a car travelling at a fair speed into an uncontrollable spin tom graves needles of stone chapter i memory is circling like a silent helicopter over these soft green fields strung together with laces of bright river its a warm day in june or july a friday the day you heard theyd sold the paperback rights to the old golden land directly below throwing a shadow like a giant sundial at three clock is the bottle stone its about five feet tall and four thousand years old nobody seems to know whether erosion or some damage long ago left it shaped like a beerbottle or whether it was always like that it seems now looking down looking back to be as black as its shadow but theres an amber haze memory may have created this or maybe not around the stone also around the people six of them mostly young early twenties theyre sharing a very expensive picnic you paid for it you led them on a raid to a posh highstreet deli then the wineshop and then you all piled into a couple of cars old henry kettle too although he says hed rather have a cheese sandwich than all these fancy bits and pieces and you came out here because it was the nearest known ancient site an obvious place to celebrate memory hovers its trying to filter the conversation to find out who started it who raised the question of the bottle stone legend no good the voices slip and fade like a radio between nations and its all too long ago the first part you really remember is when andy says that theres a special chant known to all the local children johnny goes round the bottle stone the bottle stone the bottle stone johnny goes round the bottle stone and he goes round once and the big mac went round and round the toilet bowl and joe powys watched it and felt queasy hed walked back to the centre in a hurry and picked up the mail box he hadnt looked at the mail even though it seemed unusually profuse just ran into the shop and dumped it on the counter then hed gone into the lavatory and thrown up the big mac had been everything theyd promised it would be well big anyway never having eaten or even seen at close hand a big mac before hed decided on impulse this morning that he should go out and grab one for breakfast it would be one more meaningful gesture that said listen i am an ordinary guy ok not a crank not a prophet not a hippy no closer to this earth than any of you see i can actually eat bits of dead cow minced up and glued together but his stomach wasnt ready to process the message he washed his hands stared gloomily at himself in the mirror he actually looked quite cheerful despite the prematurely grey hair he had a vision of himself in this same mirror in ten years time when the grey would no longer be so premature in fact did it look so obviously premature now he flushed the lavatory again felt better went through to the kitchen and made himself a couple of slices of thick toast fifteen minutes before he had to open the shop he put the plate on the counter and ate examining the mail there was a turquoise letter from america it might have been his us agent announcing proposals for a new paperback reprint of the old golden land it wasnt maybe he was glad dear jm the letter began laurel from connecticut where she was newly married to this bloke who ran a chain of roadside wholefood diners laurel his latest and probably his last earthmysteries groupie once lured spellbound to the old golden land writing to ask for jm for a copy of his latest book what latest book then there was an unsolicited shrinkwrapped catalogue from a businessequipment firm it dealt in computers copiers fax machines the catalogue was addressed to the managing director j m powys ltd watkins street hereford in the head office of j m powys ltd the managing director choked on a toast crumb the head office was a threeroom flat in an eighteenthcentury formerbrewery now shared by an alternative health clinic and trackways the alfred watkins centre the business equipment amounted to a twentyfive yearold olivetti portable with a backspace that didnt powys didnt even open three catalogues from firms with names like crucible crafts and saturnalia supplies no doubt offering special deals on bulk orders of josssticks talismans tarot packs and cassette tapes of boring new age music simulating the birth of the universe on two synthesizers and a drum machine the new age at the door again once hed had a letter duplicated a copy sent off to every loony new age ripoff supplier soliciting trackways patronage it said this centre is dedicated to the memory and ideas of alfred watkins of hereford who discovered the ley system the way ancient people in britain aligned their sacred places to fit into the landscape alfred watkins was an archaeologist antiquarian photographer inventor miller and brewer he doesnt appear however to have shown any marked interest in ritual magic zen yoga reincarnation rebirthing primal therapy shiatsu or tai chi so piss off hed realized when he sent it that alfred watkinss work had he lived another fifty years might have touched on several of these subjects perhaps the old guy would have been at the heart of the new age movement and a member of the green party the recipients of the circular obviously realized this too and kept on sending catalogues knowing that sooner or later joe powys was going to give in and fill up trackways with new age giftware to join the solitary box of healing crystals under the counter because if he didnt the way business was going trackways would be closing down within the year there were only two envelopes left now one was made from what looked like high quality vellum which hed never lave recognized as recycled paper if it hadnt said so on the back prominently a single word was indented in the top lefthand corner of the envelope epidemic powys finished his toast went to wash his hands came back and turned the envelope over a couple of times before he opened it it contained a letter which didnt mess around dear j m powys as you may have learned dolmen books publishers of the old golden land have now been acquired by the epidemic group shit powys thought i didnt know that i am writing to you on behalf of the group chairman max goff powys thought aghast ive been acquired by max bloody goff mr max goff who has long been an admirer of your work and would like to meet you to discuss a proposition and from what ive heard of max goff s propositions to personable young blokes such as myself we should therefore like to invite you to a small reception at the cock inn crybbe i may have to invent a prior engagement on friday june at pm im sorry its such short notice but the acquisition of dolmen was only confirmed this week and i obtained your address only this morning please contact me if you have any queries please contact me anyway yours sincerely rachel wade pa to max goff powys sat and looked around the shop for a while thinking about this he could see on the shelves among the dozens of earthmysteries books by alfred watkins and his successors the spine of the deluxe hardback edition of the old golden land and about half a dozen paperback copies including the garish american edition with the dayglo stonehenge on the counter in front of powys was a token display stand dowsing rods and pendula mr watkins might have been able to dowse but he didnt have anything to say in his books about energy dowsing or indeed about earth energies of any kind but all that was academic the dowsing kits were selling well soon wouldnt be able to visit a stone circle without finding some studious duo slowly circumnavigating the site dangling their pendulum and saying wow every so often under the counter because powys hadnt had the nerve to put them on sale was the box of healing crystals which annie his new assistant with the egyptian amulet had persuaded him to buy got to embrace the new age joe and let the new age embrace you mr watkins wants you to let the new age in i can feel it sometimes i even think i can see him standing over there by the door hes holding his hat and hes smiling wow powys reached into the crystals box and helped himself to a handful of sodalite for emotional stability and the treatment of stressrelated conditions max goff he thought max goff clutching the crystals he discovered he was holding in his other hand a small creased white envelope the last item of mail mr j powys the alfred watkins centre hereford handwritten not too steadily inside a single sheet of lined blue notepaper cwm draenog titley kington dear mr powys if you have not already heard i am sorry to have to inform you of the death of my neighbour mr h kettle what he was killed in a road accident in crybbe where he was working and did not suffer jesus christ mr kettle left an envelope with me to be opened after his death in which he stated what he wanted to happen to his possessions as he did not trust solicitors the house and all the contents is to be sold and the money sent to his daughter in canada but he wants you to have his papers and his dowsing rods if you would like to come to the house i am in most of the time and will let you into mr kettles house yours faithfully gwen whitney mrs j m powys put down the letter he ought to have opened the shop ten minutes ago the sodalite crystals for emotional stability and the treatment stressrelated conditions began to dribble through his fingers and roll across the wooden counter chapter ii rachel noticed that denzil george licensee of the cock had several shaving cuts this morning hed obviously overslept unused no doubt to rising early to prepare an am breakfast for his guests what a torpid town this was parcel come for you the licensee said placing a small package by maxs elbow thanks max tossed it to rachel no stamp rachel noticed obviously delivered by hand better open it max said digging into some of the muesli hed had delivered to the pub rachel uncovered a tape cassette and a note whos warren preece max looked up hes sent you a tape of his band delivered by hand huh max put down his spoon thoughtfully i dunno any warren preece but the surname has a certain familiar ring maybe you should find out more rach yes rachel said pushing back her chair ill ask the landlord the anglicans book of common prayer had nothing to say about exorcising spirits of the dead the revd murray beech knew this and was grateful for it but he was leafing through the prayer book anyway seeking inspiration murray was following the advice of alex peters and attempting to compile for himself a convincing prayer to deliver in an allegedly haunted house he came across the words peace be to this house and to all that dwell in it this actually appeared under the order for the visitation of the sick but murray made a note of it anyway surely with an alleged haunting murray recoiled from the word with embarrassment what you were supposedly dealing with was a sick property contaminated by some form of socalled psychic radiation although in his exorcism oh god the prayer would be aimed at the troubled souls of the living in his view the health of a property could be affected only by the attitude and the state of mind of the current inhabitants not by any residual guilt or distress from ah previous residents he looked around his own room the neat bookshelves the filing cabinets the office desk with metal legs at which he sat the clean white walls feeling a twinge of pain as he remembered the walls being painted by kirsty exactly a fortnight before shed said im sorry murray this isnt what i want murray looked quickly back at the prayer book turned over a page came upon the following entreaty oh lord look down from heaven behold visit and relieve this thy servant defend him from the danger of the enemy he breathed heavily down his nose he abhorred words like enemy the duty of the church was to teach not opposition but understanding he was equally uncomfortable with the next and final paragraph of the prayer book before the psalms began a commination or denouncing of gods anger and judgements against sinners the first page ended on an uncompromising note cursed are the unmerciful fornicators and adulterers covetous persons idolaters slanderers drunkards and extortioners not many of us left uncursed murray muttered the curse of the modern ministers life in his opinion was the videohire shop infinitely more alluring to teenagers than the church and full of lurid epics in which members of the clergy in bloodied cassocks wielded metal crucifixes with which they combat scaly entities from hell one result of this was that a few people seemed to think they should summon the vicar in the same way theyd call in rentokil to deal with their dampness and their rats the telephone bleeped ill ring you when theyre out shed told him he hadnt replied at the time he was considering going to her grandparents and explaining his dilemma but hed concluded this would not only be a copout it would be wrong because shed come to him in confidence and she was no longer a minor she was eighteen and would be leaving school in two or three weeks murray closed the book of common prayer and picked up the phone vicarage theyre out tessa said barry the overweight osteopath from upstairs was between patients eating a sandwich herbal pate on wholewheat ive been taken over by max goff said powys disconsolate dolmen has yeah i read that he cant do you any harm though can he youre out of print arent you between impressions powys corrected him barry are you really proposing to realign somebodys slipped disc with hands covered in soya margarine beats olive oil and cheaper hey mandy says she saw you coming out of mcdonalds this morning couldnt have been me thats what i thought barry said dubiously anyway powys said goff wants to see me in crybbe i thought you were going to say in the nude for a minute said barry wiping his hands on his smock no from what i hear hes surrounding himself with people sharing his own deep commitment to the new age movement if its this lunch in crybbe on friday several people i know have been invited and nobodys turning him down because if he likes you he invites you to join his crybbe community which means listen to this that you get offered a place to live on very advantageous terms and all kinds of fringe benefits why arent you there then bastards already got an osteopath barry said gerry moffat you believe that he could have had me but he went for moffat moffat who else dan osborne the homeopath hes moved in already superior bastard paula stirling robin holland oh and this little french aromatherapist who was in bromvard remember her i can still smell her listen do these people know who max goff is used to be joe used to be this is the new userfriendly ozonefresh max goff play your cards right and hell let you feel his aura i wouldnt feel his aura with asbestos gloves said powys and hes got some pretty heavy mystical types as well said barry jean wendle the spiritual healer some guy whos reckoned to be britains biggest tarot hotshot and andy boultontrow all converging on the new age mecca andy powys said andys involved in this and theres a single kid says andy moving round the stone very slowly at first while all the other kids are sitting in a circle clapping their hands doing the chant and by the time they finish the chant hes back where he started got to be a he it doesnt work for girls andy boultontrow lean and languid lying back in the grass spearing a quails egg from the jar beside him his voice is deep and lazy like a stroked cello and then he goes round again only this time its just eversoslightly faster johnny goes round the bottle stone and he goes round twice and they keep on repeating it and it gets faster and faster building up the momentum and the kids got to move faster each time to maintain the pace johnny goes round the bottle stone and he goes round thrice goes round four times five times and how long do they keep it up rose asks shes looking radiantly happy today this memory is agony how many times oh theres a gleam in andys eye thirteen thirteen times must be jolly dizzy by then one of the others says ben corbys girlfriend fiona something exactly andy drags out the word for emphasis the kids completely confused hes not thinking properly and its then that his mates all leap on him and before he knows whats happening they hustle him across to the fairy hill over there see it not much of a hill rose observes fairies are not very big you tell her you could fit a couple of dozen on there andy says so they lie him facedown on the fairy hill and thats when it happens what you ask what happens whatever happens says henry kettle searching in the cardboard picnic box for something uncomplicated and british its all in the mind and it dont do anybody any good meddling with that old nonsense oh yeah barry the osteopath said andys right at the centre of things as was old henry kettle i suppose you heard about that just now powys said he hadnt planned to mention henry i had a letter from his neighbour to say he was dead i dont know what happened do you have to wait for the hereford times for the full story but apparently it said on the local radio that his car went off the road and ploughed into a wall around crybbe tump i dont know that area too well but crybbe tump he hit the wall around crybbe tump killed instantly bloody shame i liked old henry he helped you with the book didnt he powys nodded the buzz is said barry that henry was doing some dowsing for max goff dowsing what barry shrugged whatever hed been doing he was on his way home when it happened there was a power cut at the time dont know whether the streetlamps were off that may have thrown him bloody shame a power cut said powys that significant just a thought powys shook his head his mind whizzing off at a peculiar tangent like a faulty firework chapter iii fay awoke late shed lain awake until dawn eyes open to the bedroom ceiling arnold a lump of solid heat alongside her on the bed it was nearly nine before she came downstairs outside it was raining the rain on the window was the only sound there was no mail on the mat no sign of the canon the door to the office was closed as shed left it last night the note to her father still pinned to it and dont let any cats in there rasputin he must still be in the office she opened the door but did not go in rasputin she called a morning croak in her voice that all it was really but she could not bring herself to go back into that room not yet though arnold didnt seem worried she left the door ajar went through to the kitchen let the dog out in the back garden when she turned back to the kitchen rasputin and pushkin were both in the opposite corner waiting by their bowls fay opened a can of felix the two cats looked plump and harmless perhaps it really had been just a horrific dream conditioned by her own desperation she forked out a heap of cat food straightened up right she said decisively and marched out of the kitchen and into the hall where she tore the note off the office door and hit the door with the flat of her hand so that it was thrown wide she walked in eyes sweeping the room like searchlights she saw the revox two spools leaning against it her deskdiary open her fathers note about guys phone call she raised her eyes to the hshaped fireplace and the mantelpiece to the seethrough clock with the mechanism like a pair of bails still jerking obscenely from side to side the fireside chair was empty its scatter cushions plumped out if someone had been sitting in it the cushions would have been flattened unless of course that person had tidily shaken them out and oh come on she made herself cross to the mirror and look into it at her own face the first shock was the incredible childlike fear she saw in her eyes the second was the other face she whirled around in alarm the canon was standing in the doorway he wore pyjamas his feet were bare his hair was standing up in spikes his beard sprayed out in all directions like a snowstorm his bewildered blue eyes were wide and unfocused he stared at fay as if she were an intruder then the eyes relaxed into recognition morning grace he said while max drove rachel took the cassette box from shoulder bag ok go ahead max said rachel slipped the tape into the player and studied the plastic box the bands name was typed in capitals across the plain label fatal accident she wrinkled her nose drums and bass guitar blundered out of the speakers rachel lowered the volume a little by the time the first track was over they were parked at the back of the court next to the stableblock where builders were busy rain slashed the windscreen max turned up the sound to compensate he was smiling faintly they sat in the range rover for two more tracks the only words rachel could make out on the last one were goin down on me repeated what seemed like a few dozen times she consulted the inside of the label the song was called goin down on me thats the lot she said neutrally therere only three numbers remembering where the max goff story had begun in the punkrock era of the midseventies she didnt add thankfully max began to laugh rachel ejected the tape saying nothing jeez max said was that shit or was that shit rachel breathed out for a couple of minutes there watching him smiling shed thought he might actually be enjoying it you want me to post it down to tommy get him to send it back in a fortnight with the customary slip what max twisted to face her you want us to give the official pissoff to mayor preeces flaming grandson but if you tell him its good youll have to do something with it wont you max shrugged so be it one single not on epidemic of course coupla grand written off against tax then he thumped the top of the dashboard no hey listen ill tell you what we do you send this kid a letter saying we think the band has promise we think its a an interesting sound right but were not sure any of these three tracks is quite strong enough to release as a debut single so can we hear a few more thatll buy some time maybe the bandll split before they can get the material together hows that sound to you it sounds devious rachel said of course it does rach do it tonight i mean shit dont get me wrong theyre no worse than say the damned in but it was fresh then iconoclastic it was shit then too yeah maybe max conceded but it was necessary it blew away the sterile pretensions from when the seventies went bad but now were picking up from the sixties and we wont make the same mistakes no rachel said in neutral again a heavy tipperlorry crunched in beside them the rain had washed a layer of thick grey dust from the door of the cab and rachel could make out the words aendy quarry new radnor hey max said slowly if this is what i think it is he threw his door open stepped down into the rain in his white suit and was back inside a minute excited raindrops twinkling in his beard it is rach the first stones have arrived the old stones of crybbe mark two oh said rachel pulling up the collar of her barbour for the run to the stables good but goff panama hat jammed over his ears made her watch while the stones were unloaded pointing out things different sizes right even where theyd vanished entirely kettle was able to figure out how tall theyd been using his pendulum i suppose of course what were seeing here gives an exaggerated idea of what theyll look like in situ half of the lengthll be under the soil maybe more than half like giant acupuncture needle in the earth whos going to advise you about these things now mr kettles dead rachel wondered as men in donkey jackets and orange slickers moved around making preparations to get the grey and glistening monoliths down from the truck one stone had to be at least fifteen feet long and how do you know its the right kind of stone things were moving too fast for rachel now max was an awesome phenomenon when he had the hots for something yeah well obviously kettle was good and he knew the terrain but andy boultontrows been studying standing stones for nearly twenty years been working with a geologist these past few weeks matching samples they checked out maybe a dozen quarries before he was satisfied and if hes satisfied im satisfied a clang came from the back of the truck a gasp of hydraulics somebody swore max called out sharply hey listen be careful yeah i want you guys to handle those stones like youre dealing with radioactive flaming isotopes he said to rachel andys moving up here end of the week hes gonna supervise planting stones on our land then well bring the farmers up here show em what it looks like and go into negotiations hey you had a call from j m powys yet hell only have got my letter this morning max give him until lunchtime then call him i want powys i dont care what he costs the customer was short and fat and bald he wore denims a shaggy beard and an earring youre j m powys right teacher powys thought or maybe the maverick in some local government planning department you are man dont deny it i recognize you from the picture on the cover youve gone grey thats all powys spread his arms submissively hey listen man that was a hell of a book the old golden land thanks powys said so what are you doing here running a shop why arent you writing more got to be ten years since golden land even longer powys said more like twelve you could count on at least one of these a week more in summer sometimes they were women sometimes in the early days of the watkins centre friendships had developed from such encounters the old golden land had hit the market at the right time the time of the great mass exodus from the cities couples in their thirties in search of meaning and purpose people were very kind when they found out who he was usually they bought something from the shop often a paperback of the book for him to sign most times he felt guilty guilty that he hadnt followed through guilty that hed written the thing in the first place and misled everybody i did that one that takes a new look at watkinss original leys he offered a bit pathetically backtrack the bald bearded guy waved it way disappointing if you dont mind me saying so jm no magic wasnt really meant to be magical powys said the idea was just to walk the leys and see if they were as obvious now as when watkins discovered them yeah and you found some of them to be distinctly dodgy thats not what we want is it powys laughed well its not is it people pouring scorn on the whole idea your archaeologists and so on and heres j m powys defecting to the establishment viewpoint not exactly what i feel is we might have been a bit premature in explaining them as marking out channels of earth energy why not because they connect so many burial mounds and funerary sites even churchyards why not simply paths of the dead the customer stepped back from the dowsing display hed been fingering he looked shocked paths of the dead he said paths of the dead what kind of negative stuff is that halfway through the door he turned round you sure youre j m powys fay oh hullo guy you didnt return my call no i didnt did i well dads having one of his difficult days he sounded fine last night well he isnt now fay said testily maybe he thought she was making it all up about the canon going batty maybe she ought to produce medical evidence no im sorry it must be difficult for you oh please not the sympathy what do you want guy i want to help you fay no comment id like to put some money in your purse fay began to smoulder purses were carried by little women as you may know im currently on attachment to bbc wales as senior producer features and docos guy had been an ontheroad tv reporter when shed first known him then a regional anchorman and then when hed realized thered be rather less security in onscreen situations after he passed forty or so hed switched to the production side much safer lots of corners to hide in at cutback time and ive got quite a nice little project on the go on your patch guy said two fifty minuteers for the network congratulations but suddenly fay was thinking hard it couldnt be guy said max goff you know what max goffs setting up shit hes developing a conscience in his middle years and putting millions into new age research anyway hes bought this wonderful elizabethan pile not far from you which he plans to restore and where did you hear about this guy oh contacts as i say well be doing two programmes one showing how he goes about what hes going to do how the locals feel about him this sort of thing and the second one a few months later examining what hes achieved or not as the case may be good hmm fascinating the bastard how the hell had he pulled it off and youve got it to yourself have you absolutely it means goff will have this one reliable outlet to get his ideas across in an intelligent way fay seethed no radio four documentary not even any exclusive insider stuff for offas dyke so much for rachel wade and her promises all the time theyd been negotiating with her exhusband obviously aware of the connection keeping quiet leading her along so she wouldnt blow the story too soon so what i was thinking fay is clearly were not going to be around the whole time we need somebody to keep an eye on developments locally and let us know if theres anything we should be looking at i was thinking perhaps a little retainer for you i can work it through the budget we producers have full financial control now of a production which means black mist came down the smug scheming patronizing bastard when fay started listening again guy was saying would have offered you the official researchers contract but one of max goffs conditions is that we use the author of some trashy book which seems to have inspired him goff wants this chap to be the official chronicler of the crybbe project and some sort of editorial adviser on the programmes of course thats just a formality i can soon lose him along the way fay put the phone down screwed again the clock ticked arnold lay by her feet under the table the chair where in her mind the smug spectral grace legge had sat was now piled high with box files nothing could sit in it now even in her imagination fay picked up the phone again and deliberate cold precise punched out the number of the offas dyke radio news desk gavin ashpole please oh it is you its fay morrison listen i can put you down a voicepiece for the lunchtime news explaining exactly what max goff intends to do in crybbe she listened to ashpole asking all the obvious questions oh yes she said impeccable sources fay put down the phone picked up the pad and began to write chapter iv the police station was at the southern end of the town centre just before the road sloped down to the threearched river bridge attached to the station was the old police house murray beech strode boldly to the front door and rapped loudly with the knocker standing back and looking around for someone he might say hello to he very much wanted to be seen did not want anyone to think there was anything remotely surreptitious about this visit indeed hed been hoping police sergeant wynford wiley would be visible through the policestation window so he could wave to him but he was not nobody was there as a last resort murray had been round to alex peterss house hoping to persuade the old man lo come with him as adviser witness and well chaperone thered been no sign of alex or his daughter no answer to his knocks but murray didnt have to knock twice on the door of the old police house she must have been waiting behind it good afternoon tessa he said loudly putting on his most clergymanly voice tessa byford looked at him in silence eighteen darkhaired darkeyed palefaced often seen leatherjacketed on street corners with the likes of warren preece but not an unintelligent girl a talented artist hed heard and more confident than most local girls born here but brought up in liverpool until her mother died and her father had dumped her on his parents in crybbe so he could go back to sea murray could understand why shed never forgiven he father for this he thought sullen resentful and eighteen prime poltergeist fodder if you accept the tenets of parapsychology about which murray of course kept an open mind he smiled well he said im here tessa byford did not smile back without a word she led him into a small dark sittingroom entirely dominated by an oppressive victorian sideboard ornate as a pulpit with many stages canopies and overhangs murray felt it was dominating him too he was immediately uncomfortable the room seemed overcrowded with the sideboard and the two of them standing there awkwardly an unmarried clergyman and a teenage girl it hit him then the folly of what he was doing he should never have come she looked down over his dark suit youve not brought any holy water have you murray managed a weak smile lets see how we get on shall we it occurred to him that while she might be an adult now this was not actually her house hed allowed himself to be lured into somebody elses house you shouldve brought holy water she said sulkily murray tried to relax his plan was merely to talk to the girl say a helpful prayer and then leave he found a straightbacked dining chair and sat on it squarely always felt foolish sinking into someones soft fireside furniture felt it diminished him i still wish your grandparents were here gone shopping she said still standing in hereford wont be back until tonight i only stayed to wait for you i was going to give you another five minutes wouldnt stay here on me own not any more why did he think she was lying i wish youd felt able to discuss this with them she shook her head firmly cant you just cant her thin lips went tight her deepset eyes stoney with the certainty of it have you tried tessas lips twisted me gran says people who are daft enough to think theyve seen a ghost ought to keep it to themselves so you have tried to talk to her about it tessa grimacing went through the motions of wiping something nasty off her hands murray tried to understand but couldnt neither mrs byford nor her husband appeared to him to be particularly religious they came to church if not every week hed watched them praying as he did all his parishioners from time to time but detected no great piety there just going through the motions lip movements like the rest of them a ritual as meaningless as sunday lunch and rather less palatable there was no bible on the shelf no books of any kind just white china above a small television set no pictures of christ on the wall no framed religious texts and yet the room itself stank of repression as if the people who lived here were the narrowest type of religious fundamentalists tessa was standing there expressionless watching him the next move was his because he was trying so hard not to be he was painfully aware of her breasts under what in his own teenage days had been known as a tank top i know what youre thinking she said and murray sucked in a sharp breath but im not she said im not imagining any of it you dont imagine things being thrown at you in the bathroom even if her lips clamped and she looked down at her feet if what murray said show you tessa mumbled murray felt sweat under his white clerical collar he stood up feeling suddenly out of his depth and followed tessa byford into the hall and up the narrow stairs all right fay i dont know she was going hot and cold maybe succumbing to one of those awful summer bugs all she needed give me a minute elton i want to make a few adjustments to the script ok no hurry ive got a couple of pieces to top and tail come back to you in five minutes ok fine fay said fine she took off the cans and leaned back in the studio chair breathing in and out a couple of times outside it was still raining and not exactly warm in here she felt clammy sticky she pulled her tshirt out of her jeans and flapped it about a bit the air in here was always stale there should be airconditioning the crybbe unattended itself was probably a serious infringement of the factories act or whatever it was called these days and the walls of the studio seemed to be closer every time she came in that was psychological of course hallucinatory just like she slammed a door in her mind on the icy grace legge smile just as shed slammed the office door last night before stumbling upstairs after the dog she wondered how she was ever going to go into that room again after dark she certainly wouldnt leave the dog in there again at night how primitive life had become fay a tinny voice rattling in the cans on the table she put them on ashpole fay tell me again what hes doing goff she told him again about the new age research centre about the dowsers and the healers she didnt mention the plan to reinstate the stones she was going to hold that back another day another dollar no rock stars then what all a bit of a disappointment isnt it really ashpole said is it fay was gripping the edge of the table just let him start nutty stuff new age old hippies big yawn some peoplell be interested i suppose when can we talk to the great man in person goff im working on it that was a laugh some chance now ill ask my exhusband he owns all the broadcasting rights god god god hmm ashpole said maybe we should without even a warning tremor fay erupted oh sure send a real reporter down to doorstep him why dont you do that get him to claim on tape that hes the son of god and hes going to save the fucking world she tore off the cans and hurled them at the wall stood up so violently she knocked the chair over stood with her back to the wall panting tears of outrage bubbling up what was happening to her see that mirror she was pointing at a cracked circular shaving mirror in metal frame it flew off the windowledge tessa byford said thats how it got the crack course they accused me of knocking it off how can you be sure you didnt it was a very cramped bathroom murray moved up against the lavatory trying not to brush against the girl ludicrous he fell completely and utterly ludicrous he was suffocating with embarrassment look she said oblivious of his agony i just opened the door and it flew off at me and other things shaving brush toothpaste but it was the mirror that started it i had to look in the mirror it could have been a draught tessa appalled at how strangled his voice sounded it wasnt a bloody draught all right calm down please and when i picked it up the mirror there was blood in the crack your blood no whose then the old mans your grandfather no the old man he used to live here i saw him i could see him in the mirror youre saying hes dead this old man what do you think tessa said losing patience with him tension rising the girl was disturbed this was not what the church should be doing this was psychiatric country and you think you saw his face in the mirror and other mirrors she sighed always in mirrors tessa listen to me when you first told me all about this you said you thought it was a poltergeist and you thought it was happening because you were at that age when when but youre eighteen youre not an adolescent any more no he saw something moving in her dark eyes and there was a little dab of perspiration above her top lip murray began to feel soiled and sordid she said softly and almost euphorically he thought later his throat was cut when i saw him in the mirror hed cut his throat put his razor through the artery that was where the blood murray swallowed there was an overpowering smell of bleach would you mind he said if we went back downstairs when the studio phone rang it was gavin ashpole being softspoken and understanding they all knew these days that if a woman dared up uncharacteristically it had to be a spot of premenstrual tension tact and consideration called for so when youre ready love ashpole said amiably just give us the fiftysecond voicepiece and then you can play it by ear with goff i mean dont worry about it long as nobody gets him first ill be happy must go the other phone thanks fay she shouldnt have exploded like that most unprofessional fay put on the cans adjusted the mike on its stand ow bloody thing was hot surely that wasnt possible with a microphone even if there was an electrical fault she didnt touch it again but looked round the back following the flex to where it plugged into the console nothing amiss there was nothing to come unscrewed on this mike it was a standard americanmade electro voice about six and a half inches long gunmetal grey with a bulb bit enlarging the end like well like a penis actually fay put out a finger touched the tip giggled sexstarved cow pull yourself together you ready now fay oh yes im ready elton i really am bit for level then she picked up the script which would take up the story from the newsreaders link its widely known fay enunciated clearly into the microphone that max goff has been involved in setting up a charitable trust to yeah fine go in five fay composed herself not easy in this heat the tshirt was sticking to her again have to put in a complaint four three two its widely known that max goff has been involved in setting up a charitable trust to finance socalled new age ventures such as alternative healing techniques and the promotion of green awareness hes also interested in fringe science and the investigation of leylines which are supposed to link standing stones bronze age burial mounds and other ancient sites across the landscape most times when you were putting in a voicepiece especially if like this it wasnt live you werent really aware of the sense of it any more only the pattern of the words the balance the cadence and the flow it was conversational and yet completely artificial automaticpilot stuff after a while easy to see how some radio continuity announcers simply fell in love with their own voices the project will be based at sixteenthcentury crybbe court for which mr goff is believed to have paid in excess of half a million pounds its expected to be a major boost to the local economy with whoah whoah elton shouted in the cans what are you doing fay what youre distorting huh how close are you to the mike i fay tasted metal oh her eyes widened a movement went through her like an earth tremor along a fault line her hands thrust the microphone away revolted the mike fell out of its stand and over the end of the table where it dangled on its flex fay sat there wiping the back of a hand over her lips what the hell said the voice in the cans fay fay are you there oh lord we humbly beseech you look down upon us with compassion eyes tensely closed murray was trying to concentrate he could still smell bleach from the bathroom although they were downstairs again now in the sittingroom that was full of repressed emotions deepfrozen in the shadow of the pulpitsideboard churchlike more churchlike anyway than a bathroom but the church was not a building he in this dark little parlour at this moment was the church two feet away an eighteenyearold girl in holed jeans and a straining tank top a girl he didnt think he liked very much any more a girl with a glistening dab of sweat over her upper lip and because there was nothing to help him in the book of common prayer he must improvise look down with compassion lord on our foolish fancies and fantasies lift from this house the burden of primitive superstition hold up your holy light and guide us away from the darkened recesses of our unconscious minds his voice came back at him in a way hed never experienced before in prayer not like in church the words spinning away over the congregation and up into the rafters or muted behind bedside screens against the chatter and rattle and bustle of a hospital ward here in a room too crowded with still silent things for an echo it all sounded as slick and as shallow as he rather suspected it was he was stricken with isolation feeling exposed and raw as if his veneer of priestly strength was bubbling and melting like thin paint under a blowlamp murray ran a damp finger around the inside of his clerical collar he realized in horror that the only ghost under exorcism in this house was his own undefined amorphous faith as if something was stealing that faith feeding from it his collar felt like a shackle he wanted to tear it off he knew he had to get out of here knowing this while hearing his voice intoning the meaningless litany bring us lord safely from the captivity of our bodies and the more insidious snare of our baser thoughts lead us her voice sliced through his i think it likes you vicar tessa said sweetly his eyes opened to a white glare the girl was holding the cracked shaving mirror at waistlevel like a spot lamp and when she tilted the mirror he saw in it the quivering flickering image of a cowering man in a dark suit and a clerical collar the man gazing down at his hands clasping his rearing penis in helpless remorse in a tortured parody of prayer murray screamed and fled a few moments later when he tumbled halfsobbing halfretching into the street he could hear her laughter he stood with his back to a lamppost sobbreathing through his mouth he looked down and felt his fly the zip was fully fastened he felt violated physically and spiritually naked and shamed a door slammed behind him and he still thought he could hear her laughing at intervals as if whatever had got into her was sharing the fun chapter v the bitch doesnt get in here again not ever under any circumstances you understand max was pulsing with rage rachel had seen it before but not often offas dyke radio had run the item on its lunchtime bulletin from which rachel had been told the story had been picked up by a local freelance hack and relayed to the london papers several of which had now called epidemics press office to check it out and goff s secretary in london had phoned goff in time for him to catch the offending offas dyke item on the five oclock news that report from fay morrison our reporter in crybbe the newsreader had said unnecessarily at the end fay morrison guy morrison goff said rachel shook her head hardly likely yeah goff accepted and then he spelled it out for her again just in case she hadnt absorbed his subtext when he wanted the world to know about something he released the information in his own good time he released it so from now on you dont talk to anybody you dont even think about the project in public you got that maybe rachel said offhand tempting fate you should fire me dont be fucking ridiculous max snapped and stormed out of the stableblock to collect his bags from the cock he was driving back to london tonight thank god and wouldnt be returning until friday morning for the lunch party when she could no longer hear the ferrari arrogantly clearing its throat for the open road rachel wade rang fay feeling more than a little aggrieved they shouted at each other for several minutes before rachel made a sudden connection and said slowly you mean guy morrison is your exhusband he didnt tell you well of course he wouldnt wheres the kudos in having been married to me rachel said thoughtlessly hes really quite a hunk isnt he a small silence then fay said hunk of shit actually max was right rachel said youre being a bitch you did the radio piece as a small act of vengeance because your ex had pushed your nose out now look no you look guys programmes wouldnt have affected anything youd still have had the stories for offas dyke radio and youd have had them first i do actually keep my promises fay sighed and told her that the truth was she was hoping to do a full programme for radio four however with a tv documentary scheduled that now looked like a nonstarter so i was cutting my losses i suppose i really didnt think itd come back on you well i suppose i didnt really think at all i overreacted keep overreacting these days im afraid im sorry im sorry too rachel said but i have to tell you youve burned your boats max has decreed that you should be banned from his estate forever i see i can try and explain but he isnt known for changing his mind about this kind of thing why should he he is the deity in these parts in the photograph over the counter alfred watkins wore pincenez and looked solemn if there were any pictures of him smiling powys thought they must be filed away in some family album smiling was not a public act in those days for a leading local businessman and a magistrate it was perhaps just as well alfred watkins needed his dignity today more than ever dont forget powys said hell be watching you any josssticks get lit hell be very unhappy no he wont annie said annie with the egyptian amulet still living in before the husband and the four kids he fancies me i can tell by the way he smiles he never smiles he smiles at me annie said ok no josssticks if youre not back by tomorrow ill open at nine after i get rid of the kids im only going to kington youre going back to the old golden land annie said halfsmiling hed shown her the letter from henrys neighbour mrs whitney admit it youre going back what happens andy says well you go around the stone thirteen times and then you lie on the fairy hill and you get the vision you see into the future or maybe just into yourself according to the legend john bottle went round the stone and when he lay on the mound he went down and down until he entered the great hall of the fairy queen with whom he naturally fell in love it was so wonderful down there that he didnt want to leave but they sent him back and when he returned to the real world he became a great seer and prophet of course andy ate a black olive he could never settle in the mundane world and he knew that one day hed have to go back powys drove his nineyearold mini out of the city turning off before the wye bridge in essence alfred watkins had been right about the existence of leys powys felt this strongly and henry kettle had been better than anybody at finding where the old tracks ran by means of dowsing after all these years hed said once to powys i still dont know what they are but i know theyre there and i know that sometimes when youre standing on one it can affect you affect your balance like give you delusions sometimes like as if youve had a few too many nothing psychic mind nothing like that but they do interfere with you sometimes they might interfere with you when you were walking along them with or without your dowsing rods or when you were driving along a stretch of road which happened as many did to follow one of the old lines many accident blackspots had been found to be places where leys crossed coincidence of course and you could go crazy avoiding stretches of road just because they happened to align with local churches and standing stones nobody really went that far certainly not henry who you would have thought was too experienced a dowser ever to be caught out that way but when an experienced dowser crashed into a wall around an ancient burial mound it demanded the kind of investigation the police would never conduct he didnt expect to find anything but henry kettle was his friend he was touched and grateful that henry had bequeathed to him his papers perhaps the famous journal that nobody had ever seen and the rods of course dont forget the rods why should he leave his rods to a man who couldnt dowse powys left hereford by kings acre and headed towards the welsh border where the sun hung low in the sky during his lunchbreak hed spent half an hour with the os maps of hereford and eastern radnorshire hed drawn a circle around the blob on the edge of the town of crybbe where it said the tump mound hed taken a twelveinch perspex ruler and put one end over the circle and then holding the end down with one finger moved the ruler in an arc making little pencil marks as he went along whenever he came upon an ancient site when the ruler had covered three hundred and sixty degrees he took it away and examined all the markshaphazard as circles and crosses in a footballpool coupon and stared into the map like a fortuneteller into a crystal ball or the bottom of a teacup waiting for a meaningful image or a pattern to form among the mesh of roads and paths and contour lines mound circle stone church earthwork moat holy well but from a leyhunters point of view it was all very disappointing there was a large number of old stones and mounds all along the welsh border but the tump didnt seem to align with any of them the nearest possible ancient site was crybbe parish church less than a mile away he looked it up in pevsners buildings and established that it was certainly prereformation always a strong indication that it had been built on a prechristian site but when he drew a line from the tump to the church and then continued it for several miles he found it didnt cross any other mounds churches or standing stones not even a crossroads or a hilltop cairn the ley system which appeared to cover almost the whole of britain and could be detected in many parts of the world seemed to have avoided crybbe bloody strange powys had said aloud giving up what the hell was there for henry kettle to dowse in crybbe why had max goff chosen the place as a new age centre powys came into the straggling village of pembridge where the agewarped blackandwhites seemed to hang over the street instead of trees driving down towards kington and the border he felt a nervousness edging in like a foreign station on the radio at night he rarely came this way too many memories or maybe only one long memory twisted with grief fiona bens girlfriend laughing and burrowing in one of the bags for the bottle of champagne better open this now warm shampoos so yucky ben holding up a freshfromthepublisher copy of the book on the cover a symbolic golden pentagram is shining on a hillside in the foreground against a latesunset sky a few stars sprinkled in the corners is the jagged silhouette of a single standing stone across the top the title the old golden land below the stone in clean white lettering the authors name j m powys and below that it says with photographs by rose hart rose looks at you and her eyes are bright enough to burn through the years and now the pain almost dissolves the memory ben saying a toast then but andy is raising a hand there remains one small formality everybody looking at him i think joe ought to present himself to the earth spirit in the timehonoured fashion forget it you think no way i mean go round the bottle stone thirteen times fiona clapping her hands oh yes do go round the stone joe chapter vi henrys place was the end of a welsh longhouse divided into three cottages the other two had been knocked into one and mrs gwen whitney lived there with her husband powys arrived around eightthirty driving through deep wells of shadow remembering henry coming out to meet him one evening round about this time his dog alf dancing up to the car that night twelve years ago powys pleading with henry come on its as much your book as mine the old golden land by henry kettle and joe powys dont be daft boy you writes i dowses thats the way of it besides theres all that funny stuff in there i might not agree with some of that you know me nothing psychic when i stop thinking of this as science well i dont know where ill be and an hour or so later but henry at the very least and dont you start offering me money what do i want any more money for with the wife gone and the daughter doing more than well for herself in canada you go ahead boy just dont connect me with any of it or ill have to disown you see silence now the late sun turning the cottage windows to tinfoil no dog leaping out at the car mrs whitney opened her door as he walked across mr powys a heavy woman in a big flowery frock smiling that sad sympathetic smile which came easily to the faces of country women always on nodding terms with death you remember me not changed have you anyway its not so long twelve years and ive gone grey is it so long good gracious would you like some tea thank you not too late am i not for you mr powys i remember one night must have been four in the morning when we finally heard your car go from here sorry about that we had a lot to talk about oh he could talk mr kettle could when he wanted to mrs whitney led him into her kitchen i think it looks nice grey she said later they stood in henrys celllike livingroom insulated by thousands of books many of them old and probably valuable although you wouldnt have thought it from the way they were edged into the shelves some upside down some back to front on a small castiron mantelshelf over the parkray were a few deformed lumps of wood local sculpture henry called it hed keep them on the mantelpiece until he found more interesting ones in the hedgerows then hed use the old ones for the fire mrs whitney handed powys a battered old medical bag this was in the car with him police brought it back a thought tumbled into powyss head as he took the bag what about alf oh old alf died a couple of years back he got another dog arnold funnylooking thing i says youre too old for another dog mr kettle give me a reason to keep on living he says always said he couldnt work without a dog at his side arnold he was in the car with mr kettle too he wasnt killed a ladys looking after him in crybbe shell have her hands full year or so with mr kettle they forgot they was supposed to be dogs powys smiled daft about animals mr kettle was hes left half his money i didnt put this in the letter half his moneys going to a dogs shelter over the other side of hereford daughter wont like that henry knew what he was doing powys said whats going to happen to the house shell sell it she wont come back that one shell sell it and itll go to some folks from off wholl put a new kitchen in and one of them fancy conservatories theyll likely stop a couple of years and then therell be some more folks from off i dont mind them myself they never does no harm in general powys opened the medical bag the contents were in compartments like valuable scientific equipment two remodelled wire coathangers with rubber grips mrs whitney said theres a whatdyoucallit pendulum thing in a pocket in the lid i know powys said i remember mr kettle had his old dowsing records in you know them office things box files aye box files must be half a dozen of them and theres this i found by his bed it was a huge old blackbound business ledger thick as a bible he opened it at random and in the middle meadow i detected the foundations of an old house from about the fifteenth century i got so engrossed in this i forgot all about finding the well he could hear henry chuckling as he wrote in black ink with his old fountain pen edge to edge ignoring the red and black rules and margins he turned to the beginning and saw the first entry had been made nearly twenty years earlier out of four or five hundred pages there were barely ten left unfilled end of an era powys closed the ledger and held it with reverence in both hands his journal i doubt if anybody else has ever seen it well you take it away said mrs whitney sometimes i had the feeling some of them things mr kettle was doing were how shall i say not quite christian science mrs whitney he was always very particular about that funny sort of science mrs whitney said theres a letter too only gave it to me last week a paleblue envelope j m powys handwritten in black ink oh he was a nice old chap mrs whitney said but with no ill respect for the departed hed have been the first to admit as he was moren a bit cracked for fay there would be no secret pleasure any more in editing tape in the office at night within the circle of anglepoise light a soft glow from the revox levelmeters and all the rest into shadow for none of what dwelt beyond the light could now be assumed to be simply shadow once these things had started happening to your mind you couldnt trust anything any more that evening she and the canon watched television in what used to be graces diningroom at the rear of the house and was now their own sittingroom two bars of the electric fire were on never guess it was summer would you arnold lay next to alex on graces enormous chintzy sofa the dog did not howl not once although fay saw him stiffen with the distant toll of the curfew hed be sleeping upstairs again tonight she watched alex watching tv and sent him mindmessages we have to talk dad we cant go on here theres nothing left there never was anything you ought to realize that now alex carried on placidly watching some dismal old black and white weepie on channel four fay said at one point dad mmmm alex kept his eyes on the screen where stewart granger was at a crucial point in his wooing of jean simmons dad would you fay gave up care for some tea or cocoa cocoa wonderful you know at one time people used to say i had more than a passing resemblance to old granger really fay couldnt see it herself came in quite useful once or twice i bet it did fay got up to make the cocoa feeling more pale and wan than jean simmons looked in black and white in one day shed hung up on guy betrayed rachel demolished relations with goff before shed even met him and caught herself about to give a blow job to a microphone in the privacy of the crybbe unattended studio what i need she thought is to plug myself into a leyline and she smiled to herself a despairing kind of smile at the absurdity of it all the box files wouldnt all fit in the boot of the mini three had to be wedged on the back seat with the doctors bag but the ledger the dowsing journal of henry kettle was on the passenger seat where powys could see it henrys letter on top just past the kington roundabout he gave in pulled into the side of the road and in the thinning light he opened the letter dear joe im doing this now while i feel the way i do if it all sorts itself out youll probably never read this letter none of it will make much sense to you at first and if it never does make any sense it means my fears will be groundless what it comes down to is ive been working out at crybbe for a chap called max goff whos bought crybbe court the nature of the job is dowsing some old alignments where the stones and such have all gone years ago and its been giving me the shivers quite honestly that whole place dont get me wrong theres nothing psychic or any of that old rubbish but its not right and as far as i can work out its a longterm kind of thing i intend to keep an eye on the situation in the weeks and months and god willing the years ahead and keep on revising my notes but im not getting any younger and you could go any time at my age and i feel as how i ought to inform somebody you have had some daft ideas in your time but youre a good boy basically and the only person i can think of who i can trust not to dismiss this out of hand as an old fools rumblings god knows im not infallible and i could be wrong and i dont even know as yet the nature of whats up in crybbe only i get the feeling its longterm and id like to think there was somebody who could keep an eye on what that goffs up to now my daughter weve grown apart no kidding myself any more shes out in canada and shes very well off so ive written to my solicitor in hereford informing him that as well as all the papers my house is to be left to you consider it as a token of my confidence yours sincerely h kettle henry god almighty powys said he could see lights coming on in kington through the trees on the other side of the road darkening hills somewhere on the other side of the hills crybbe leaving him the house was ridiculous hed probably have changed his mind by now anyway but the letter was dated june only two days before henrys death powys opened the ledger at the last completed page it also was dated june quite a successful day located three more old stones one of them would be eleven feet above the ground which would make it quite rare for the crybbe area the nearest one as high as that being down near crickhowell i have been over this twice to make sure it is very peculiar that there should have been so many big stones in such a small area i tried to date this big one but all i could come up with was when it was destroyed it seemed certain to me that this was done quite deliberately the whole thing taken out and broken up this was all quite systematic like the burning down of monasteries during the reformation what intrigues me is how this goff could have obtained the information about there having been stones here when even i had never heard of them sometimes i feel quite excited by all this it is undoubtedly the most remarkable discovery of prehistoric remains in this country for many years even if the archaeologists will never accept it at other times however i do get quite a bad feeling that something here is not right although i cannot put my finger on it i have always disliked the tump for some reason some places are naturally negative although perhaps natural is not the word i want the welsh border is a very funny place but i am sure there is a good scientific explanation the last entry neatly dated and a line drawn under it two days later henry kettle was lying dead in his car under crybbe tump it was dark when powys got back to hereford he lugged the box files up the stairs to his little flat above trackways and left them in the middle of the floor unopened it would take months to explore that lot bui he was committed now he went down to the shop and put on the lights from his photograph alfred watkins frowned down on the counter powys could see why annie had put the box of healing crystals on display he wrote out a note and left it wedged under the crystals box dear annie please hold fort until whenever ill call you dont light too many josssticks feeling a need to explain he added gone to crybbe ps dont get the wrong idea it might be old but its not golden when he put out the lights in the shop he noticed the answering machine winking red a womans low resonant voice j m powys this is rachel wade at crybbe court i wanted to remind you about friday id be grateful if you could call back on crybbe which is the cock hotel or our new office at crybbe court leave a message if im not around things are a little chaotic at present but wed very much like to hear from you if you cant make it on friday we could arrange another day just please call me ill be there powys said to the machine ok he went upstairs to bed and couldnt sleep hed seen henry barely half a dozen times in the past ten years if the old guy really had left him his house to underline his feelings about crybbe then they had to be more than passing fears what have you dumped on me henry he kept asking the ceiling and when he fell asleep he dreamt about the bottle stone chapter vii the following day was overcast the sky straining with rain that never seemed to fall after breakfast jimmy preece gnarled old mayor of crybbe went to see his son he found jack tinkering with the tractor in the farmyard his eldest grandson jonathon looking on shaking his head always the same jack grunted just when you need it mornin father i been telling him jonathon said get a new one false economy this thing gets us through haymaking ill be very surprised indeed jimmy preece shook his head then he nodded so that neither of them would be sure which one he was agreeing with got to take an overview said jonathon this years chairman of the crybbe and district young farmers club goin from day to day dont work any more break off a minute will you jimmy said come in the ouse i want a bit of advice he knew thatd get them jack straightened up tossed his spanner into the metal toolbox and walked off without a word across the farmyard to the back door warren he roared put that bloody guitar down and make some tea in the kitchen waiting for the kettle to boil warren whipped the letter out of his back pocket and read it through again hed thought at first it might have been peter the drummer pulling his pisser again but where would peter have got hold of epidemic headed notepaper dear mr preece thank you for sending us the cassette of fatal accident which i return max goff has listened with interest to your songs and believes then could be considerable potential here it was signed by this rachel wade the snooty tart warren had seen driving max goff around it had to be genuine well fuck what had he got to be surprised about max goff hadnt got where he was today without he could spot a good band when he heard one have to get working then have to get a few more numbers together get on the phone to the boys soon as the old man and bloody jonathon were out the way warren took their tea they were sprawled around the big livingroom grandad getting his knackered old pipe out looked like the start of a long session and the phone was in the same room warren was nearly grinding his teeth in frustration stuff this hed walk into town and use the phone box by the post office he left the tray of mugs on a stool and cleared out quick before the old man could come up with some filthy old job for him out in the hallway though he stopped having second thoughts warren liked to know about things he tramped loudly to the main door kicked it shut then crept quietly back and stood by the livingroom door listening and soon he was bloody glad he had fay had decided that what she must do for a start was get her dad out of the town for a few hours so she could talk to him really talk it seemed ridiculous that she couldnt do this in the house but that was how it was often in crybbe you simply couldnt seem to approach things directly there were whole periods when everything you tried to do or say was somehow deflected in the same way she felt the place smothered your natural curiosity made the urge to find out the act of wanting to know seem just too much trouble it wasnt that the air was in any way soporific she thought unlocking the fiesta not like the famous country air was supposed to be or the dreamy blue ozone at the seaside that sent you drifting off at night on waves of healthy contentment here it was as if the atmosphere itself was feeding off you quietly extracting your vital juices sapping your mental energy so that you crawled into bed and lay there like a dried out husk had the air done this to the people or had the people done it to the air or was it just her living with an old man whose mind was seizing up fay gave him a blast on the horn come on dad youre not changing your mind now in the local paper shed found a story about people in a village fifteen miles away receiving some kind of conservation award for adopting their local railway station planting flowers on the embankments that kind of thing ashpole had agreed it would probably make a nice little soft package end of the programme stuff keep it down to four minutes max from the back seat arnold barked it was a gruff throaty bark and his jaws clamped down on it as soon as it was out it was the first one fay had ever heard him produce he must be settling in she leaned over and ruffled his big ears pleased alex emerged by the front door at last it had been far from easy persuading him to come with her even though he did seem much better today more aware he sat with his hands on his lap as she drove them out of town on the welsh side hope you know a decent pub over there my child well find one the sky was brightening as she drove into the hills the border roads unravelling through featureless forestry then open fields with sheep a few cows sparse sprinklings of cottages farm buildings and bungalows the little railway station was on the singletrack heart of wales line which went on to shrewsbury it wasnt much more than a halt with a wooden bench and a waiting room the size of a busshelter fay had arranged to meet the secretary of this enthusiastic committee which existed to defend the unprofitable line against what seemed to be a constant threat of imminent closure by british rail he turned out to be a genial guy and a good talker and hed brought along a couple of villagers who spent their weekends sprucing up the station surrounds cutting back verges planting bulbs they were friendly and selfdeprecating in crybbe it would have to have been the newcomers who took the job on but crybbe didnt have a station anyway only broads interviews done she stood for a moment at the edge of the line looking out towards the hills and thinking what a quiet serene place this actually was untampered with all the old patterns still apparent a buzzard glided overhead then banked off like a world war ii fighter flashing the white blotches under its wings she thought its me all this is wonderful it isnt mean and tight and stifling at all im just a sour bitch who thinks shes had a raw deal and im blaming the poor bloody border country alex was in the car white beard brushing his guardian as he read still managing without glasses at pushing ninety he was wearing a baggy cardigan over his kate bush tshirt fay thought suddenly i wish i knew him better and mrs wozencrafts cottage old jessie wozencraft thats his as well hes bought that good luck to him jonathon said old place is near enough falling down thats not the point jonathon said jack preece point your grandads makin is oh i know what hes sayin and hes dead right what bloody use is an acupuncturist in crybbe what do they do anyway they sticks needles in you to cure things wouldnt stick any in me boy i hates them injections it dont matter what they does warren heard his grandad say thumping the chairarm its the principle retired folk i dont mind so much give em a bit of bird watchin and a library book and they dont bother nobody and they always dies after a few years anyway what i object to is these cleverarsed fellers as wants to change things to what they thinks they should be if you know what im sayin everything prettypretty and no huntin the little furry animals and no jobs either cause factories spoils the view market forces grandad you cant do nothin about market forces nine properties es had so far i counted nine everything for sale within a mile of town hes bought it many as that eh warren didnt like the way this conversation was going he fingered the crisp epidemic notepaper in his pocket jonathon said well nobody elsedve bought em would they not with interest rates the way they are all right its speculation its not just speculation jonathon theres a purpose to it and its not right you heard that woman on the wireless new age and psychic powers i dont know nothin about any of it and i dont want to and i dont want him doin it yere woken a lot of people up to it that bit on the radio jack said everybody talkin about it in the cock last night the post office this morning lot of peoples worried its going to bring the hippies in what are any of em but hippies quack healers fortunetellers who is she father somebody said it was that girl who lives with er dad the old feller with the beard fay morrison grandad said nice enough girl comes to council meetings tidy piece jonathon said warren knew who they meant seen her the other night coming back from the court with that dog followed her behind the hedge spying most likely she was nosy cow i admit i never wanted em to put that radio studio in his grandad said but if it adnt been for this girl nobodydve believed it they years it on the wireless it brings it ome to em isnt it warren heard the old feller sucking on his pipe ah but hes a crafty bugger that goff comes to my door tryin to get round me all the things hes goin to do for the town get the mayor on his side first tactics see well we cant stop him cant block market forces grandad we can stop him takin our town off us to serve his whims and howre we supposed to do that he wants a public meeting well give him one what are you savin here father give him a rough time let him know he isnt wanted behind the door warren began to seethe this was fucking typical here was max goff biggest bloody independent record producer in the country on the verge of signing fatal accident to epidemic and these stickinthemud bastards were scheming to get rid of him jonathon was saying see them stones he had delivered bloody great stones dozens of en building stone no just great big stones huge buggers like stonehenge that kind things went quiet then warren heard his grandad say hes oversteppin the mark hes got to be stopped warren wanted to strangle the old git he wanted to strangle all three of them also that fucking radio woman whod let it all out and stirred things up the one who shouted after him through the hedge that night called him a wanker every pub theyd tried had stopped serving lunch at two oclock so much for allday opening and so theyd wound up at this little chef which didnt please him bloody cooking by numbers two onion rings thirtyseven chips all this and alcoholfree lager too and these bloody girls invariably saying was it all right for you as if theyre just putting their knickers back on at least theyre there when you want them fay said getting back on the a would you like to see ludlow like to go home actually god almighty what is it about that place left my pills there i know you did but luckily i brought them whats your next excuse alex growled wish id had a son instead of me huh sons dont try to manage you dad i want to talk to you oh god was that the first time guy rang the other night hard to say my dear once i put the phone down i tend to forget all about him he may have rung earlier does it really matter i dont mean just that night has he rung any other time when ive been out cant remember suppose he could have done i didnt think you cared i dont its just guys coming down to make a documentary about max goff and i was wondering how he found out there was something interesting going on i know you tend to absorb local gossip like a sponge and then somebody squeezes you a bit and it all comes out and then you forget it was ever there you think i told him did you did i god knows say anything to get rid of him does it matter fay glanced in her wing mirror then trod on the brakes and pulled in violently to the side of the road of course it bloody matters i think youre overwrought my child youre young you need a bit of excitement bit of stimulation country life doesnt suit you crybbe doesnt suit me so why not simply she said carefully dad you may be right there may be nothing at all wrong with crybbe but yes i think its time i left and i think its time you left youve no reason to stay youve no roots there no real friends there he said sadly oh i have he wasnt looking at her he was looking straight out at the a lorries chugging past who murray beech hell be off first chance of a bigger parish hes got nothing to thank crybbe for his fiancee didnt hang around did she no alex said not murray who then he didnt reply fay fiddled with the keys in the ignition alex talked to everybody old vicars never changed a friend to everyone essence of the job but how many did he really know what are you saying dad grace he whispered and fay saw the beginning of tears in his old blue eyes she put a hand on his arm dad dont ask me about this fay alex said please just take me home chapter viii on top of the tump it all came clear you could see over the roofs of the stables and crybbe court itself which was sunk into a shallow dip and there only just showing above the trees was the church tower but then the trees hadnt always been so high or even here at all the church was at the high point of the town the main street sloping down to the river from here you couldnt see the street or the river but you could see the fields on the opposite bank rising into hills thickened now with forestry and at one time before the introduction of the voracious sitka spruce from alaska that might have been bare hillside and there would have been other markers to pick up the line joe powys looked all around him and saw how clearly the tump had been positioned to dominate the town even the church and draw in the landscape like the corners of a handkerchief that old feeling again of being inside an ancient mechanism at the centre of the wheel identifying the line took an act of imagination because there were no markers any more but henry kettle had discovered where upright stones had once been aligned to guide the eye from the tump to the distant horizons but there was something about it that henry kettle didnt like powys moved away from the highest point and stood next to a twisted hawthorn tree the sky was a tense luminous grey swollen like a great waterfilled balloon and he felt that if it came down low enough to be pricked by the trees topmost thorns hed be drowned it was his own fault places like this could ensnare your mind and your thoughts became tangled up with the most primitive instincts old fears lying hidden in the undergrowth like trailing brambles as quickly as he could but still very carefully powys came down from the tump climbed over the wall and didnt look back until he was well into the field heading towards the road where hed left the mini halfway across the field there was a bumpy rise and it was here that he found the hubcap he sat on a hummock with the disc on his knee it was muddy and badly rusted but he could still make out the symbol in the centre two letters vw still the same car then henry how old is it now twentytwo twentythree holding henrys hubcap powys looked back at the tump i have always disliked the tump for some reason some places are naturally negative powys thought sinister bloody thing that must once have appeared as alien as a gasworks or a nuclear reactor he looked down at the wall realizing that the section hed climbed over was just a few yards from the part where the stonework was so obviously scraped but hadnt collapsed because it was too hard for that harder than the rusting heap of twentyyearold tin henry kettle drove from the foot of the wall shards of broken glass glimmered like dew in the troddendown grass christ henry how could this happen henry can you hear me although perhaps natural is not the word i want but i am sure there is a good scientific explanation you misled us henry nothing psychic you kept saying we should have realized it was just a dirty word to you a word for phoney mediums and fortunetellers at the end of the pier ancient science was your term because it didnt sound cranky he could see the tracks now grass flattened lumps of turf wrenched out the field was unfenced and the car must have cut across it diagonally ploughing straight on instead of following a sharpish lefthand bend in the road powys left the metal disc on the hummock and scrambled up to the road collecting a hard look from a man driving a land rover pulling a trailer now if henry was driving out of town hed be pointing straight at the tump then the road curved away then it was directed towards the tump again very briefly then came the lefthand bend and you were away into the hills but henry never made the lefthand bend the car left the road taking him into the field he might not have noticed what hed done at first if it was dark and then the field went quite suddenly into this slope and crunch not so farfetched at alt really thered be an accidental death verdict and nobody would delve any deeper all the rest was folklore he went back into the field walked down towards the tump skirting its walledin base not knowing what he was hoping for any more come on henry give us a sign it began to rain he ran to a clump of trees to shelter and to watch the tump massive ancient glowering through the downpour as magnificently mysterious as the great pyramid powys turned away and wandered among the trees emerging on the other side into a clearing beside a building of greybrown stone crybbe court no not the court itself the stableblock now seriously renovated he saw there was an enormous oblong of glass set in the wall a huge picturewindow facing the tump behind the building he could see the corner of a forecourt where two men stood in the rain looking down on four long grey jagged stones powys stiffened one of the men was dark and thin and was talking to the other man in a voice which had he been able to hear it would probably have reminded him of a stroked cello least you can do mate andy tells you look at all the money the books going to make think of it as a kind of appeasement of the earth spirit fiona claps her hands oh go on joe well all sit here and chant and clap bastards you look at rose who smiles sympathetically reluctantly you stand up and everybody cheers well everybody except henry dont wanna play about with these old things quaint old herefordshire countryman andy leaning on an elbow i thought you werent superstitious henry ancient science and all that nothing psychic aye well electricitys science too but you wouldnt wanna go sticking your fingers up a plug socket thankful for his advice you make as if to sit down not got the bottle for it joe ben starts clapping very slowly and the others except henry pick up the rhythm joey goes round the bottle stone the bottle stone the bottle stone crybbe was fortyfive minutes away minor roads all the once theyd left the a neither of them spoke fay thinking hard bringing something into focus something utterly repellent that she hadnt up to now allowed herself to contemplate for longer than a few seconds a woman in a cold miasma frigid rigid utterly still not breathing past breathing long past she looked in the driving mirror and there was arnold the dog sitting upright on the back seat their eyes met in the mirror you saw her arnold you saw something but did i did i see the ghost of grace legge ghost spirit of the dead and yet that image the grace thing surely was without spirit static frozen and the white eyes and that horrible smile with those little thin fishteeth that was her her teeth tiny little teeth and lots of them discoloured brittle the memory you always carried away of graces fixed smile with all those little teeth shed been nothing to fay just dads other woman no not exactly nothing twenty years ago shed been something on the negative side of nothing somebody fay had blamed to herself for shed never spoken of it not to anyone for her mothers death and shed blamed her father too perhaps this was why even now she could not quite love him terrible admission she had naturally tried hard for both of them when she came down for the wedding water under the bridge an old mans fumbling attempts to make amends and a very sick woman who deserved what bit of happiness remained for her perhaps her dad thought hed killed them both both his wives compassion rising fay glanced sideways at alex sitting there with his old green cardigan unbuttoned and ate ush in fading lettering across his chest what this was about had to be was that he too had seen something in the night and what must that be like for an old man who could no longer trust his own mind or even his memories if she wasnt sure what shed seen or even if shed seen anything what must it be like for him fay clinched the steering wheel lightly and goose pimples rippled up both arms thats why you cant leave dad youve seen something that none of your clerical experience could ever prepare you for youre afraid that somehow shes still there in the house you shared and youre not going to walk out on her again henry kettle had written it is very peculiar that there should have been so many big stones in such a small area long after andy and the other man had walked away powys still stood silently under the dripping trees staring in fascination at the recumbent stones in the corner of the courtyard megaliths and andy boultontrow whom powys hadnt seen for twelve years designer of the cover of the old golden land painter of stones sculptor of stones collector of stonelore the stones lay there gleaming with fresh rain old stones or new stones did it matter one stone was as old as another stones didnt speak to him the way they spoke to henry kettle but he was getting the idea max goff presumably intended to place new stones in the spots identified by henry and the obvious man to select and shape the stones an act of love was andy boultontrow who knew more about the nature of megaliths than anyone in europe powys had met andy at art college to which andy had come after university to learn about painting and sculpture with specific regard to stone from beyond the courtyard he heard an engine start a vehicle moving away then all was quiet even the rain had ceased powys slid from the trees and made his way around the side of the stone stablebuilding to the comer of the courtyard where the stones lay fay drove into crybbe from the ludlow road the windscreen wipers squeaked as the rain eased off she thought were never going to be able to talk about this are we dad not for as long as you live she stopped in front of the house to let him out thank you he said not looking at her its been a pleasant day hasnt it ill put the car away you stay here arnold she backed the car into the entry a little tunnel affair in the terrace parking too close to the wall there was only just room to squeeze out come on arnold alex was waiting for them at the back door his face was grave but his blue eyes were flecked as they often were now with a flickering confusion got the tea on dad fay i he turned and walked into the kitchen the kettle was not even plugged in fay dad he walked through the kitchen into the hall fay following arnold trolling behind at the door of the office graces sittingroom he stood to one side to let her pass im so sorry he said at first she couldnt see what he meant the clock was still clicking away on the mantelpiece the fireside chair still piled high with box files the back door was open alex said forced she saw they must have used a sledgehammer or a heavy axe because it was a tough machine with a metal top why fay felt ravaged cold and hollow and hurting like a rape victim for gods sake why her beloved revox nighttime comfort with its swishing spools and softglowing levelmeters had been smashed to pieces disembowelled a few hundred yards of tape had been unspooled and mixed up with the innards and the detritus was splattered over the floor like a mound of spaghetti chapter ix the women who had in recent years been powerfully attracted to joe powys had tended to wear long handdyed skirts and shapeless woollies sometimes they had frizzy hair and sometimes long tangled hair sometimes they were bigbreasted earthmother types and sometimes smallboned and delicate like arthur rackham fairies sometimes when powys fantasized which was worryingly rarely these days he imagined having as he put it to himself a bit of smooth someone scented someone who shaved her armpits someone who would actually refuse to trek across three miles of moorland to find some tiny ruined stone circle you practically had to dig out of the heather someone you could never imagine standing in the middle of this halfsubmerged circle and breathing oh i mean gosh cant you feel it cant you feel that primal force the woman facing him now he could tell was the kind whod rather see stonehenge itself as a blur in the window of a fast car heading towards a costly dinner in salisbury but even if shed been wearing a homemade anklelength skirt with a hemline of mud clumpy sandals and big wooden earrings he would at this moment have been more than grateful to see her she said i think you could let him go now humble he really doesnt look very dangerous find out who he is first said the hardfaced bastard with a grip like a monkeywrench the guy hed first seen frowning at him through the window of a land rover when he was checking out the tump he made powys bend over the vehicles high bonnet which tossed another painball into his stomach this man had punched him in the guts with a considered precision and such penetration that he was seriously worried about internal bleeding ta very much deftly removing powyss wallet from the inside pocket of his muddied jacket not a local accent this was london if this is a mugging powys said awkwardly face squashed into the bonnet you could be fucking shut it his nose crunched into the metal powys felt blood come dont even twitch pal ok mmmph right then im going to have a little butchers through here see what you got by way of id all right humble if you dont let him go im going to call the police rachel you do your job i do mine our friend here dont want that ask him ask him what he was doing on private property aint a poacher aint got the bottle he cringed expecting humble to tap him in the guts again to prove his point but the pressure eased and he was allowed to stand his nose felt wet but he didnt think it was broken he looked at the woman who must be close to his own age had light midlength hair and calm eyes im sorry she said humbles used to dealing with the more urban type of trespasser trespasser powys wiped off some blood with the back of a hand now look you tell this bloody psycho he stopped what could she tell him he wondered where andy boultontrow had vanished to all right now are we dipping into powyss wallet humble smiled with the lower half of a face which had all the personality of a mousetrap he pulled out a plasticcovered driving licence and handed it to the woman she took it from him reluctantly opened it out gave a little gasp oh dear she said yeah dont tell me one of maxs bits of fluff humble smirked in which case no problems hell have been enjoying himself rachel closed the licence and held out her hand for the wallet very carefully she put the licence back then she handed the wallet to powys not entirely accurate humble she said and when he hears about this max i suspect is going to have you strung up by the balls police sergeant wynford wiley was shaking his great turnip head mindless mindless said fay you think its mindless we always prided ourselves wynford said thick blue legs astride the wreckage never suffered from no vandalism in this town not to any great extent anyhow only vandalism by neglect fay thought dully she wondered why shed bothered to call the police now wynford was just so sinister like one of those meaneyed redneck police chiefs you saw in moody american movies set in semiderelict onestreet wooden towns in the midwest think somebody wouldve seen em though the gap narrowed between wynfords little round eyes course mrs lloyd next door deaf as a post see knock on the door she dont answer you got to put your face up to the window fay imagined wynfords face flattened by glass give the poor old girl a heart attack he said sceneofcrime boyll be over later with his box of tricks ill knock on a few doors along the street see what i can turn up he paused in the doorway looked back at the wreckage mindless he said fay turned to her dad for support but alex gazing down his beard at the revox ruins had nothing to say doesnt it strike you as odd fay said clinically that this tornado of savagery appears somehow to have focused itself on one single item im no criminologist but ive witnessed my share of antisocial behaviour and this sergeant is not what id call mindless psychopathic perhaps but mindless in the sense of randomly destructive no wynfords big round face was changing colour nobody she thought contradicts chief wiley on his own manor what you sayin ere then somebody wants to stop you broadcastin that it its possible isnt it and is it gonner stop you broadcastin well no as it happens i ive got a portable tape recorder i do all my interviews on and i can edit down at the studio in town theres a machine there but would they know that listen wynford was row wearing an expression which might have been intended to convey kindness fay shuddered he they just came in and smashed up the most expensive thing they could find then could be as e was disturbed or thought e was gonna be disturbed maybe e yers somebody walkin past maybe he wasnt disturbed at all fay said maybe he just left because hed achieved what he set out to do i think youre watchin too much telly cant very well watch too much tv in crybbe the powers never on for longer than three hours at a stretch wynford turned his back on her opened the office door arnold walked in saw wynford and growled see youve still got that dog didnt leave im in the ouse then when you went out what oh no he came with us fay said what happened with the rspca by the way does anybody want to claim him no i reckon es yours now if e stays how do you mean well if e dont take off like he was wearing such a weird smile that fay pursued him to the front door i dont understand wynford shrugged awkwardly well you might wake up one day see andell be well e wont be around any more fay felt menaced meaning what come on what are you saying wynfords face went blank ill go and talk to some neighbours he said and he went dad fay said ive said this before but theres something very wrong with that guy sorry my dear alex looked up his eyes were like floss sit down dad youve had a shock im fine alex said fine if theres nothing i can do here ill probably have an early night fay watched the policeman walk past the window imagined him peering through it with his face squashed against the glass like a robber in a stocking mask she recoiled stared at the gutted hulk of the revox a bizarre idea growing in her head like a strange hybrid plant she turned to arnold who was standing placidly in the doorway gazing up for some reason at alex his tail well down christ fay said something had occurred to her that was so shatteringly preposterous that dad i have to go out ok alex said if she didnt satisfy herself that it was completely crazy she wasnt going to get any sleep tonight you go and walk off your anger alex said youll feel better something fay looked around for arnolds plastic clothesline dad ive just got to check this out i mean its so fay shook her head helplessly ill be back ok she took j m powys to her room at the cock the big room on the first floor that she shared with max but max was in london the licensee denzil watched them go up m powys looked to say the least dishevelled but denzil made no comment rachel suspected that if she organized an orgy for thirty participants denzil would have no complaints as long as they all bought drinks in the bar to take up with them rachel closed the bedroom door the room was laden with dark beams and evening shadows she switched a light on so this was j m powys not what shed imagined not at all dont take this wrong but i thought youd be older i think i am older he tried to smile it came out lopsided there was drying blood around his mouth his curly hair was entirely grey er is there a bathroom across the passage rachel said the ensuite revolution hasnt happened in crybbe yet possibly next century here let me look take your jacket off it was certainly an old jacket the oncewhite tshirt underneath it was stiff with mud and blood gently rachel prised the tshirt out of his jeans the colours of his stomach were like a sky with a storm coming on nasty that man is a liability ive never powys winced been beaten up by a new age thug before it doesnt feel a lot different actually rachel said humble has his uses in london and new york but just move over to the light would you really dont like the way hes going native i caught him laying snares the other day look mr powys i dont know what i can do for bruising apart from apologize profusely and buy you dinner not that youll thank me for that unless youre into cholesterol in the basket i dont mind that i had a big mac the other day he sounded almost proud perhaps j m powys was as loony as his book after all addressing the fireplace alex said why youve always been so houseproud why do this he mustnt touch anything fingerprints couldnt even tidy the place up a bit until theyd looked for fingerprints waste of time all that they wouldnt have grace on their files alex started to cry why cant you two get on together a tangled ball of black unspooled tape rustled as he caught it with his shoe like the tape the thoughts in his head were in hopeless flimsy coils and like the tape could never be rewound all the way up the high street fay kept her eyes on the gutter she saw half a dozen cigaretteends a crumpled crisp packet and a sweetwrapper two ringpulls from beer cans and a bus ticket issued by marches motors the only firm which ran through crybbe twice a week if you were lucky but neither in the gutter nor up against the walls did she find what she was looking for when arnold stopped to cock his leg up against a lamppost fay stopped too and examined the bottom of the post for old splashmarks there were none that she could see and arnold didnt hang around he was off in a hurry straining on the clothesline as he always did on the street shed have to get him a lead tomorrow now there was a point fay steered arnold past middle marches crafts and the worn sign of the crybbe pottery which her dad said was about to close down there was a hardware shop round the corner hereward newsome was emerging from the gallery oh hi fay out on a story youre working late were rearranging the main gallery making more picture space time to expand i think now the towns taking off is it god yes you must have noticed that lots of new faces about whatever you think of max goff hes going to put this place on the map at last ive been talking to the marketing director of the marches development board theyre terribly excited i should have a word with him sometime theyre very keen to talk about it i will thanks hereward look you havent got a dog have you mmm no jocasta had it in mind to buy a rottweiler once she gets a little nervous at night be good deal more nervous with a rottweiler around i said hah managed to talk her out of that one thank god do you know anybody who has got one a rottweiler no any sort of dog er god is that the time no its not something i tend to notice who has what kind of dog look pop in sometime theres a chap artist called emmanuel walters going to be very fashionable you might like to do an interview with him about the exhibition were planning couple of days before we open would that be possible give you a ring ok she nodded and smiled wanly and hereward newsome walked rapidly away along the shadowed street long strides shoulders back confident fay dragged arnold round the corner to the hardware shop like all the other shops in crybbe there was never a light left on at night but at least it had two big windows through which in turn she peered looking for one of those circular stands you always saw in shops like this a carousel of dog leads chains and collars there wasnt one no of course there wasnt wouldnt be would there nor would there be cans of dog food or bags of bonios the streets were empty and silent as they would be coming up to curfew time everybody paying lipservice to a tradition which had been meaningless for centuries she was starting to work it out why there was this artificial kind of tension in the air nobody came out of anywhere for about three minutes either side of the curfew except for the newcomers fay excuse me like murray beech walking across the road from the church one hand raised collar gleaming in the dusk could i have a word when he reached her she was quite shocked at how gaunt he appeared the normally neatly chiselled face looked suddenly jagged the eyes seemed to glare maybe it was the light fay reined arnold in there was a sense of unreality of her and the dog and the vicar in a glass case in the town centre public exhibits and all the curtains parting behind the darkened windows sod this sod it murray she said quite loudly very deliberately just answer me one question he looked apprehensive in crybbe every question was a threat fay said do you know anybody with a dog the words resounded around the square the vicar stared at her and his head jerked back as if shed got him penned up in a corner with her microphone at his throat anybody fay persisted any kind of dog anybody in crybbe look it was about that i because ive been scouring the gutters for dog turds and i cant find any you not one not a single bloody dog turd surprise you that does it no dog turds in the streets of crybbe fay became aware that she was coiling and uncoiling the clothesline around her fingers entwining them until the plastic flex bit into the skin she must look as mad as murray did she felt her face was aflame and her hair standing on end she felt she was burning up in the centre of crybbe spontaneous emotional combustion in the tense minutes before the curfews clang no dog turds murray no dog leads in the shops no the sensation of going publicly insane brought tears to her eyes no rubber bones murray pulled himself together or perhaps fay thought in comparison with me it just looks as though hes together go home fay he said yes fay said i will with arnold tight to her legs she turned away and began to walk back in the direction shed come along the silent street it was nearly dark now but there were no lights in any of the houses because people would be watching at the windows the woman the vicar and the dog a tableau a little public drama she turned back its true though isnt it apart from arnold here there arent any dogs in crybbe i dont know murray said it was obvious the idea had never occurred to him but well its hardly likely is it she couldnt see his face any more only his white collar luminous like a cyclists armband oh yes fay said its likely anythings likely in this town yes well ill just ill just say what ive been asked to say before before you go there came a heavy metallic creak from the church tower the bell swinging back and clangggg it had never sounded so loud the peal hit the street like a flash of hard yellow light arnold sat down in the road and his head went back fay saw him and fell on her knees with both hands around his snout as the first peal died murray beech said ive been asked to tell you to keep the dog off the streets what especially at curfew time people dont they dont like it rage rippled through fay she looked up into the vicars angular desperate face what her hands unclasped she came slowly to her feet she watched as arnold swallowed shook his head once and then quivered with the vibration from the tower as the great bell swung back clangggg arnolds first howl seemed to rise and meet the peal in the air above the square with an awful chemistry who fay said quietly go home the vicar hissed urgently take the thing away who told you to tell me there was a shiver in the night the creak of the bell hauled back fay shrieked who told you you bastard the bell pealed again like sheetlightning arnold howled the old buildings seemed to clutch each other in the shadows and she was hearing the muffled clatter of his footsteps before she was aware that murray beech was running away across the square as if hell was about to be let loose in crybbe chapter x you really didnt have to go to all this trouble j m powys said chicken in the basket would have been fine rachel said care to send down for some forget it he was remembering how shed massaged the bruises on his stomach with her lips what happened how did this come about the room overlooking the cobbled square bulged from the cocks aged frame above an entryway once theyd heard footsteps on the stones directly underneath lights shone blearily from town houses and the rooms leaded windows dropped a faint trellis on the sheets they lay in complete silence for a long time before he turned to her and said er well dont look at me rachel said i certainly didnt intend it to happen i know im hardly the person to claim she isnt a whore but we didnt even know each other until a couple of hours ago and im not actually promiscuous most of the time these days i can take it or leave it it had been the curfew which had seemed to shatter the idyll theyd fallen apart powys feeling bewildered rachel looking almost perturbed he didnt even remember getting into bed they hadnt drunk anything or smoked anything and it was not yet tenthirty hed quite fancied her certainly but thered been other things on his mind like serious pain he thought she was smiling it felt like she was smiling in her deep and opulent voice she said perhaps we should think of it as one of those whirlwind passions well im glad youre not annoyed said powys he couldnt remember much until the curfew crashing in like an alarm clock hauling him out of a hot dream that curfew he said kind of eerie dont you think did you hear a dog howling at the same time at one point or was that me no it was a dog all right really rather spooky jm why do people keep calling me jm it sounds classier than joseph miles he remembered the circumstances in which shed seen his driving licence suddenly his stomach was hurting again tell me she said are you really a descendant of john cowper powys i wouldnt entirely rule it out to take his mind off the pain he flicked aside a few strands of fine fair hair to admire the curve of her long neck hey look what would max goff say if he found out id been in his bed with his his what exactly dont worry about that hed be honoured im only a minion youre his inspiration but he isnt going to find out rachel turned her face towards him i wont even tell him you were trespassing on his property i wasnt trespassing it was what you might call an exploratory tour quite said rachel you were snooping well probably look i really am sorry about jm im not a virgin the unwritten part of my job description includes ensuring that the boss goes to sleep fully relaxed what he was shocked routine rachel said dismissively like winding up an alarm clock stone me he found this impressively cool and candid and rather sad he felt a faintly surprising tenderness coming on i must say rachel said i was genuinely surprised to find out who you were i was rather expecting m powys to be a vague if benevolent old cove in a woolly hat and halfmoon glasses by the way i think your books a dreadful sham do you mind golden land he started to smile hed been right about rachel nothing arthur rackham about this woman why do you think that no i dont mind at all i dont bruise as easily is a cursory examination might suggest well lets not talk about that now no go on talk about it really rachel faced him across the bed not touching ok well the central premise if i have this right is that theres a hidden link between us and the earth a link known to our remote ancestors but which weve forgotten about the psychic umbilicus as time went on powys had grown less and less convinced hed written this crap and by going to the various ancient shrines stone circles holy wells places like that we can unblock the doorways and find our way back as it were into the old golden land which seems to be your metaphor or whatever for this kind of harmony with the environment feeling a part of ones surroundings us and the earth feeding each other powys nodded whats wrong with it so far nothing at all rachel said perfectly commendable except its translated itself into all these old hippies staggering about with their dowsing rods and holding up their hands and feeling the earth spirit i mean lets be realistic about this if these are the people with the keys to the cosmos then god help us powys was impressed i think you could be my ideal woman jesus said rachel you really are mixed up after a minute or two he said i got a lot of it wildly wrong it was nearly thirteen years ago that book i was too young to write it id like to do it again or better still id like not to have done it in the first place its a bit late for that rachel said you do realize youre largely responsible for maxs very costly fantasies what does that mean it means hes going to be the first king of the old golden land and he wants you to be the royal scribe and tell the world about it oh my god you think i should disappear rachel pulled his left hand to her breast not just yet if you really have found the flaws in your own arguments i cant help wondering if you ought not be the one person who can bring him to his senses jocasta newsome didnt know which was worse spending a night in with hereward or being alone she thought about lighting a fire but like most aspects of country life it had lost its magic could she ever have imagined thered come a time when a logfire in an open fireplace would not only fail to induce a small romantic thrill but would actually have become a drag in the end shed been forced to admit that logs were messy timeconsuming and not even very warm the only one who got overheated was hereward chopping away and coming in covered with sweat nearly as damp as most of his logs which were so full of sap that when you threw them on the fire they just sat there for hours and hissed at you and the aga of course very attractive very prestigious for dinner parties but it wasnt made to run all the radiators one needed for a barn like this if they wanted proper oilfired central heating theyd have to install a boiler electric heating was of course out of the question with all the power cuts and hereward turning white when the quarterly bill arrived it had now become jocastas ambition to make sufficient money out of the gallery to sell it and acquire premises somewhere civilized with or without hereward but preferably without this morning rachel wade had phoned to say max goff had been terribly pleased with the tump triptych and would they please look out for more pictures of ancient sites or any local landscapes by local artists local artists there were none even darwyn hall was birminghamborn this afternoon just before closing time after school presumably another local artist had called in a girl of seventeen or eighteen an odd dark solemn girl would they like to put on an exhibition of her drawings well god forbid it should ever come to that childrens drawings the girls portfolio was now propped against the antique pine dresser in the kitchen yes of course well look at them my dear but our artists do tend to be experienced professionals you know shed let hereward examine them when he returned from his weekly attempt to become accepted in the public bar of the cock by proving he could be as boring as the natives if they only knew how far ahead of them in the boredom stakes he really was hed never have to buy his own drinks again jocasta stretched like a leopard on the sofa she herself was bored out of her mind farmers were said to shag sheep in these hills maybe she should go out and find a ram sex magic rachel was telling powys the sordid story of her life as goffs overpaid pa that was the other thing that almost pushed me over the edge isnt all sex magic thinking particularly of tonight certainly not said rachel yeah i know i do know what youre talking about aleister crowley all that stuff rachel said fortunately it didnt last though crowley was about the same build as max max couldnt summon crowleys stamina not too pleasant while it lasted though lots of dressing up and ritual undressing the idea appeared to be to build up the power and then direct it at the moment of orgasm he was the great beast i was the scarlet woman powys vaguely remembered crowleys autobiography remembered not finishing it terribly tawdry rachel said needless to say it didnt work or i presume it didnt point is max isnt a wicked man its just a case of what you might call bored billionaire syndrome youve got all the money youll ever want all the women and all the boys but youre not quite god what can one do about this minor shortfall rachel said hes doing it and powys nodded resigned as she told him about goffs plans to restore the prehistoric legacy of crybbe crybbes maxs psychic doorway his entrance to your old golden land as identified by henry kettle and how reliable was he is dowsing for real it was in henrys case henry was red hot the modern equivalent of the stone age shaman who said that max figures powys said he sighed last night i went round to henrys house to pick up his papers his journal apparently he wanted me to have them anyway it was pretty clear henry had a few misgivings about what goff was asking him to do well not so much that as what he was finding he didnt like the tump i dont like the tump rachel said and leys we dont really know anything about leys all this energylines stuff is what people want to believe henry was quite impatient with the new agers and their designer dowsing rods he used to say we shouldnt mess with it until we knew exactly what we were messing with powys watched the lattice of light on the bedspread a more plausible theory says leys are spiritual paths to holy shrines along which the spirits of the ancestors could also travel evidence shows a lot of psychic activity at places where leys cross as well as mental disturbance imbalance obviously the place to bring out the best in max rachel said drily excuse me j m i need a pee in the end jocasta had gone ahead and lit a fire for what it was worth the logs fizzed the flames were pale yellow and the smoke seeped feebly between them as she lay on the sheepskin rug enjoying in a desultory way a favourite fantasy involving the prince of wales in his polo outfit there was a crack from the logs and something stung her leg jocasta screamed and leapt up a smell of burning flesh probably made her beat her hands against her thigh in panic she switched on a tablelamp with a green and yellow tiffany shade and stood next to it examining her leg nothing visible except a tiny smudge jocasta licked a finger and wiped it away pulled down her skirt and was swamped by a sudden mudtide of selfdisgust from the livingroom window she could see the lights of the town through the trees at the end of the paddock the paddock itself was like a black pond she fetched from the kitchen the portfolio of drawings brought in by the girl if the kid was any good at all she might sell them very cheaply not in the gallery itself of course but in the small gift section they were setting up in a little room at the side jocasta sat on the sofa and opened the portfolio by the light of the tiffany lamp at first she was simply surprised shed expected landscapes and shed expected an immature hesitancy of touch so the things that surprised her were the strength and vigour of the drawing in indian ink spatters and blotches used for effect boldly controlled in the manner of gerald scarfe and ralph steadman and the fact that they were not landscapes but interiors with figures an old man shaving the eyes wide open magnified in a shaving mirror to alarming effect the chin tilted the throat uplifted to the razor a tumbler on a windowledge collecting the blood at first she was simply surprised then the shock set in the realization with a rush of bile to the throat of what was depicted in the drawing she tore her gaze away covering the drawing in horror with her hands then the lights went out through the window she saw that the lights of the whole town had gone out too jocasta didnt move she was sitting there on the sofa staring into the sputtering halfdead logs in the grate but seeing swimming in her mind the image of the thing on her knee still covered by her hands an old man cutting his own throat with a razor she thought she was sweating at first under her hands the paper felt wet and sticky and like the sap oozing from the green logs on the open fire something warm seemed to be fizzing and bubbling between her fingers jocasta let the portfolio fall to the floor and shrivelled back into the sofa almost sick with revulsion j m powys stood by the window bare feet on bare boards looking down on the street at a few customers emerging from the main entrance of the cock directly below the last he saw before all the lights went out was a couple of men stumbling on the steps and clutching at each other obviously drunk but not conspicuously merry hed been here several times but never at night never heard the curfew before and now as if the curfew had been a warning that the town would close down in precisely one hour somebody had switched off the lights such coincidences were not uncommon on the border he remembered manufacturing the phrase the celtic twilight zone as the title for chapter six of golden land the border country any border country has a special quality two cultures merging two types of landscape an atmosphere of change and uncertainty in such places it used to be said the veil between this world and others is especially thin border country a transition zone a psychic departure lounge rachel returned slipped out of the robe joined him at the window naked the moon was out now and her slender body was like a silver statuette you get used to it rachel said living in crybbe the electricity it seems were on the end of a power line or something so whenever theres a problem elsewhere it trips a switch and the whole valley goes off something like that itll be back on in a few minutes probably powys put out a hand to her then held back and put the hand on the cool windowledge things to sort out first before he allowed himself to forget henry kettle he said his car went out of control and crashed into the wall around the tump freak accident what did goff have to say about that rachel said you dont want to hear that come back to bed jm they did go back to bed but she told him anyway the nearest thing to a stone age shaman i mentioned that she lay in the crook of his arm his hand cupped under her breast powys said nobody knows a thing about stone age shamans or what they did maybe it was bronze age know bugger all about them either max said they would sometimes sacrifice themselves or allow themselves to be sacrificed to honour the earth spirit or some such nonsense theory powys said he said it must have been like that with henry kettle getting old knew he was on borrowed time so he consciously or subconsciously he decided to end it all and put his life energy into maxs project max was standing there looking at the wreckage of kettles car whoomp he kept saying whoomp and clapping his hands ok youve convinced me powys said this guys wanking in the dark and he has to be stopped before it goes all over everybody arnold whimpered fay awoke feeling the dog trembling against her leg although the bedroom light was out she knew somehow that all the lights were out knew also that in the office below the little front room that had been grace legges sittingroom she was in residence pottering about dusting the china and the clock the empty grin eyesockets of pale light and would she see through those resentful dead sockets the hulk of the wrecked revox and the fragments of its innards sprayed across the room or was that not a part of her twilit existence oh please fay clutched arnold probably there was nothing down there nothing probably part four most of the natives once stood in superstitious awe of the ancient standing stones which are dotted up and down radnorshire even today there are farmers who prefer to leave the hay uncut which grows round such stones and some people avoid them at night as they would a graveyard w h howse history of radnorshire chapter i around midmorning fay picked up the phone and sat there for several minutes holding it to her ear staring across the office at nothing the sceneofcrime man had just left a young detective with a metal case lots of prints on the revox and the desk but theyd probably turn out to be her own and her fathers the soco had said cheerfully fingerprinting them both everybody was a bit of a pro these days he blamed television fay held the phone at arms length as it started making the continuous whine that told you youd knocked it off its rest she looked into the mouthpiece the soco had fingerprinted that as well she tapped the button to get the dialling tone back could she really make this call and whats the story fay its very bizarre gavin the fact is ive discovered there are no dogs in crybbe no dogs in crybbe none at all that is except one just the one yes mine thats how i found out i see and how come there are no dogs in crybbe fay because they howl at the curfew bell gavin people dont like that that figures but if there are no dogs in crybbe how do you know they howl at the curfew well i dont im assuming thats the case because arnold howls at it thats arnold my dog least i think hes my dog yes well thank you very much fay look this illness your old mans got this dementia anything hereditary there by any chance oh god fay crashed the phone down arnold lay at her feet an ungainly black and white thing with monster ears and big expressive eyes the only dog in crybbe this morning fay had gone out soon after dawn into intermittent drizzle shed followed a milkman at whom no dogs had barked no matter how carelessly he clanked his bottles shed followed a postman whose trousers were unfrayed and who whistled as he walked up garden paths to drop letters through letterboxes and on to doormats where they lay unmolested by dogs shed walked down by the river where there was a small stretch of parkland with swings for the children and no signs warning dog owners not to allow their nonexistent pets to foul the play area finally at around shed approached a group of teenagers waiting for the bus to take them to the secondary school nine miles away does any of you have a dog the kids looked at each other some of them grinned some shrugged and some just looked stupid you know me im a reporter i work for offas dyke radio i need to borrow a dog for an item im doing can any of you help me what kind of dog you want any kind of dog doberman chihuahua giant wirehaired poodle my sister she had a dog once what happened to it ran away i think we ad a dog we did wheres it now ran off i was your dog id run off another kid said and the first kid punched him on the shoulder listen what about farm dogs mr preece has he got a sheepdog got one of them bobcats what like a little gokart thing with fourwheel drive goes over hills you got one of them you dont need no sheepdog yes fay had said i think i see she didnt see at all powys left crybbe before seven and was back before ten a changed man he wore a suit which was relatively uncreased his shoes were polished his hair brushed he was freshly shaven he parked his nineyearold mini well out of sight in the old cattle market behind the square and walked across to the cock carrying a plausiblelooking black folder under his arm taking rachels advice dont let him see you like that you have to meet his image of j m powys so if you cant look older at least look smarter dont let him see the car he mustnt think you need the money hes always suspicious of people who arent rich and you dont know anything about his plans isnt humble the new age minder going to tell him he caught me nosing around i think not he entered the lowceilinged lobby of the cock where all the furniture was varnished so thickly that you could hardly tell one piece from another it was like sitting in a tray of dark chocolates left on a radiator powys wedged himself into what he assumed to be an oak settle to wait for rachel guy morrison would be here shed told him starting work on a documentary hed once worked with guy on a series of threeminute sillyseason items on ancient mysteries of the west for a bristolbased regional magazine programme j m powys hired as the regular expert interviewee his clearest memory was of the day hed suggested they look beyond the obvious taking guy down to dartmoor to see a newly discovered stone row believed to be orientated to the rising moon he remembered the tv reporter looking down with disdain at the ragged line of stones none more than eighteen inches high barely below the level of his handstitched hiking boots lets move on guy had said affronted tm not doing a piece to camera in front of that presently the cocks taciturn licensee denzil george emerged from some sanctum and glanced across he displayed no sign of recognition still been in bed presumably when powys was sliding out of a side door into the alley just after sixthirty this morning do for you denzil said heavily powys thought of some shambling medieval innkeeper blackjowled scowling lumpenbrowed nothing at all thanks mate im waiting for ah this lady i think rachel had appeared on the stairs sleek in a darkblue business suit mr powys good morning am i too early only a little were terribly glad you were able to make it mr george im taking mr powys along to the court so if mr goff calls in tell him weve gone on ahead will you and lunch as arranged ok rachel tossed a brilliant smile at the licensee and denzil stumped back into his lair where powys imagined him breakfasting on a whole loaf of bread without slicing it very svelte said rachel surveying powys on the steps outside youre surprised arent you you thought i probably hadnt worn a suit since the seventies you thought it was going to be the wide lapels and the kipper tie had a momentary fear of flares then decided you were too young rachel said flatteringly come along jm a few minutes later he was admiring her thighs pistoning in and out of the dark skirt as she drove the range rover impatiently pumping the clutch long fingers carelessly crooked around the wheel were going to the court couple of hours before they all arrive i thought youd like to see the setup or lack of one she drove directly across the square and then thrust the vehicle into a narrow fork beside the church powys remembered coming out of this lane last night in the same seat nursing his nose feeling foolish the nose still hurt but this morning he thought with a kind of wonder he was feeling more well more focused than he had in years and he wanted to know more about rachel she swung the range rover between stone gateposts briefing him about todays lunch informal gathering of the people at the core of the venture new age luminaries a few supportive locals newcomers mostly and maxs advisers andy boultontrow rachel parked in the courtyard of course you know him all earthmysteries people know each other andy we were at an college together which is where the old golden land started both got into mystical landscapes auras around stone circles samuel palmer moons over burial mounds on the downs andy was a mature student hed already been to university he seems a very deep guy laidback i suppose so said powys rachel parked outside the stableblock max says boultontrows knowledge of stones and prehistoric shamanic rituals is second to none yeah possibly but you wrote the book rachel said powys smiled andy professes to despise commercial books on earth mysteries comes from not needing the money private income inherited wealth something like that never discussed it rachel said and whos rose hart she took the pictures for the book powys said quietly rachel made no move to get out of the vehicle there were four of us powys said looking straight through the windscreen sometimes five andy and me and rose who was studying photography and ben corby who thought of the title comes from an old incredible string band song and flogged the idea to a publisher he paused rose was my girlfriend shes dead dont talk about it if you dont want to rachel said come and look at the crumbling pile before the others arrive rachel had keys to the court one was so big it made her bag bulge watch where youre stepping when we go in its dark not too dark to find rachels lips thanks he said quietly rachel didnt move the house was silent around them back from the town around midmorning fay came in quietly through the kitchen door arnold didnt bark he was shut in the kitchen with rasputin who was glaring at him from a chair arnold seemed glad to see her he wagged his tail and planted his front paws on her sweater good boy fay said then she heard the wailing a sound which clutched at her like pleading fingers dad stay there she hissed stay wailing the only word for it not the sound of a man in physical pain not illness not injury she moved quietly into the hallway the office door two yards away was ajar little was visible through the gap the curtains were drawn as they might be she thought in a room where a corpse is laid out her movements stiff with dread fay removed her shoes padded to the door and peeped in in the office in the dead womans sittingroom the drawn curtains screening him from the street canon alex peters was sobbing his old heart out he was on his knees bent over the slender wooden arm of the fireside chair in which grace legge had seemed to materialize his head was bowed in his arms and his ample shoulders trembled like a clifftop before an avalanche fay just stood there she ought to know what to do how to react but she didnt shed never known her dad cry before when hed displayed emotions they were always healthy masculine emotions bluff strong kindly stuff in fact not emotions at all really because most of the time alex like many clergymen was an actor in a lot of little oneman playlets put on for the sick the bereaved and the hopeless hed be mortified if he thought shed seen him like this fay crept back across the hall it was so unbearably sad so sad and so crazy so unhealthy so desperately wrong she moved silently back into the kitchen and attached arnolds clothesline to his collar lets go for a walk she whispered come back in an hour and make a lot of noise as she slowly turned the backdoor handle a trailing moan echoed from the office i will alex sobbed ill get rid of her ill make her go his quavering voice rose and swelled and seemed to fill the whole house a voice that if heard in church would freeze a congregation to its pews cried out just please dont hurt her fay walked away from this quickly chapter ii this really was a rope dangling from the steepest part of the roof powys could just about reach its frayed end careful rachel warned youll fall into the pit the rope felt dry and stiff this is a touch of black humour well its obviously not the original rope jm somebody probably put it there to hold on to while doing repairs or something creepy up here though isnt it the attic was vast there were small stabs of blinding daylight here and there signifying holes in the roof or missing slates underfoot jagged gaps through which you could see the boarded floor of the room beneath i dont know why i brought you up here really rachel said i usually avoid this bit not that im superstitious she was spotlit by two thin beams from roofgaps he remembered her standing next to him naked in the window last night pale slim silvery shed brought a small flashlight and he shone it to the upper extremity of the rope where it was tied around a beam how many poor bastards did the hanging sheriff dispose of up here hard to say he was only sheriff for a year but you could be hanged for most things in those days stealing cattle or sheep picking your nose in church thats how wort got his rocks off do you think watching people dangle rachel wrinkled her nose in distaste they say he was obsessed with what you might call the mechanics of mortality what happens the moment the spirit leaves the body him and his friend john dee not the john dee the guy who was elizabeth is astrologer his old family homes along the valley of course it is said powys remembering its a farm now i went over there when was doing golden land somebody told me dee had been into ancient sites and dowsing well he must have been into hanging too rachel said if he was a mate of michael worts a jet of wind flew across the attic with a thin whine like a distant baby crying the rope started to sway very slowly powys said he was certainly into magic but back in the sixteenth century magic and science were filed in the same drawer he put out a hand to stop the rope swinging he didnt like this rope with its dangling strands somehow more disturbing than if thered been an actual noose on the end a sense of something recently severed anyway said rachel the last hanging up here was worts own there was some sort of peasants revolt in the town and one night they all gathered outside wielding flaming torches and threatening to burn the place down unless he came out we know youre in there powys said flippantly still holding the rope not feeling at all flippant so he shuffled up here and topped himself thats one story another says there was a secret tunnel linking this place with crybbe church and he escaped where was he buried i dont know rachel said i never really thought about it probably at some crossroads with a stake through his heart wouldnt you think naturally they say he haunts the place or rather his dog does this place the town the outskirts the quiet lanes at sunset over the years according to max people have claimed to come face to face with this big black dog with glowing eyes and then they die of course like in the hound of the baskervilles powys took his hand away from the rope and it began to swing again very gently rachel luv he said can you hear voices shit rachel moved to the stairs nobody was supposed to be here for another hour she went swiftly down the steps powys following not wanting to be left alone up here where rachel believed the only danger was the unstable floor blessed are the sceptics for they shall be oblivious of the numinous layers largely unaffected by the dreary density of places unbowed by the deadweight of ancient horror while people like me he thought would no more come up here alone than pop into a working abattoir to shelter from the rain only a short way down the stairs rachel disappeared powys shone the torch down the twisting stone steps the beam just reached to the great oak door at the bottom rachel he felt panic in his throat like sandpaper there was a creak to his left he spun round and the beam found a shadowed alcove he hadnt noticed on the way up here suddenly white light blasted him and he hid his eyes behind an arm this rachel said from somewhere is the only part of the house i really like whats known as a prospect chamber the window directly facing them almost floor to ceiling was without glass in fact it wasnt really a window simply a gap between two ivymatted gables a rusting iron bar was cemented into the gap at chestheight the prospect chamber was tiny too small for any furniture but it had a view powyss eyes widened he saw they were directly above the cobbled forecourt then there were the two gateposts and then the straight road through the wood over the tops of the trees he could see the weathercock on the church tower without the wood the town would be at his feet and everything the gateway the road the church was in a dead straight line hed seen this view before in fact if he turned and looked over his shoulder he did turn and looked only into blackness but if he could see through the walls of the house what he would see behind him following the same dead straight line would be the tump is this opening as old as the house i presume so rachel said spectacular isnt it which means wort had it built maybe this is why john dee came here nothing to do with the bloody hangings rachel have you ever actually seen a leyline this its textbook in fact he leaned across the iron bar not pushing it because it didnt look too steady this is the strongest evidence ive seen that the ley system was recognized in elizabethan times we know that john dee occasionally came back to his old home and during those times he studied dowsing and investigated old churches and castle sites he called it in his records and his letters treasure hunting but what kind of treasure rachel you know what i think he stopped there were the voices again humble rachel said and somebody else powyss stomach contracted painfully i dont think humble actually got round to apologizing to you did he said rachel l owe him one dont even contemplate it hes a very nasty person ah they were waiting for max the black ferrari hit the gravel with an emphatic crunch humble stepped out and opened the drivers door andy boultontrow was with him i dont like the company he keeps either powys said humble or boultontrow either rachel said is there something i dont know about you and boultontrow joey goes round the bottle stone the bottle stone the bottle stone joey goes round the bottle stone ana he goes round hold it they all look at andy its widdershins he says what says ben widdershins anticlockwise youre going round the wrong way joe why because thats what you have to do i was watching a bunch of kids its traditional widdershins ok you shrug but you arent entirely happy about this old henry kettle gets up turns his back and walks off down towards the river ok ben says start again sod it only a game you start to tramp slowly around the stone theres a smile on your face because what youre thinking about is how much you love rose and how glad you are that they managed to get her name on the cover and he goes round once when guy came to the door fay simply pretended there was nobody in knowing it had to be her exhusband calling in on the way to his lunch date with max goff and his cohorts knowing also that if guy was in the mood he was arrogant enough to have lined her up as todays emergency standby legover fay hi long time no bonk behind the bathroom door she clenched her fists there was a second ring fay sat on the lavatory with the lid down the lid was still topped by one of graces dinky little lightgreen candlewick loomats grace her dad thought that grace legge dead had smashed the revox somehow it was insane and there was no way they could talk about it there was no third ring arnold sat at fays feet and wagged his tail he never reacted to the doorbell only the curfew bell arnold fay said do you want to talk about this arnold looked at her with sorrowful eyes even when his tail was wagging his eyes were sorrowful she held his muzzle between her hands she couldnt remember ever feeling so confused so helpless so completely wiped out the phone rang in the office fay drifted down to answer it not in any hurry she wished shed put on the answering machine but the thing had been disabled so many times by power cuts that shed almost abandoned it hello there was a hollow silence at the other end mrs morrison a local accent male yes whos that mrs morrison you been told have i told what so this is your last warning mrs morrison you ave till weekend to do what but of course she knew and what if i dont fay said grimly what if i say i have no intention of even considering getting rid of the dog especially as nobody seems prepared to explain what the hell this is all about you been told the voice said and thats it chapter iii gomer parry did plant hire he operated from an old wartime aircraft hangar up the valley outside the village where he lived in this hangar he had two lorries the heaviest tractor in the county a big jcb a small jcb and these two bulldozers you didnt hire the equipment what you hired was gomer parry a tough little bloke with mad grey hair and wirerimmed glasses been a farmer for nearly twenty years before the magic of plant hire had changed his life sold most of his land to buy the old hangar and the machinery gomer parry sixtyfour now and he never looked back gomer could knock buildings down and make new roads through the forestry he could dig you a new septic tank and a soakaway that soaked away even in radnorshire clay and during bad winters the highways authority always hired him as a snowplough this was the only time that other people recognised the truly heroic nature of his job theyd pour out of their homes dozens of them as he busted through the last snowdrift to liberate some remote hamlet thatd been cut off for a fortnight big cheers mug of tea glass of scotch good old gomer but last winter had been a mild winter buggerall snow anywhere and only gomer saw the heroic side of the other things he did a few months ago hed done this broadcast about the perils of digging drainage ditches and such explaining it to that little girl from the local radio how for him it was like a military exercise although not modern military more like in these epic films where the knight gets into his armour which is so heavy he has to be winched on to his horse it was in these terms that gomer parry spoke on the radio of his life at the controls of the jcb probably gave the listeners a good laugh certainly didnt bring him any more work he couldnt remember a worse year the local farmers his regular clients tighter than ever constipated buggers sitting there waiting for a laxative from brussels farmers wouldnt fart these days unless they got an ec grant for it so gomer parry feeling the pinch had been very near excited when he had a phone call from edgar humble hed played darts with edgar humble in the public bar at the lamb in crybbe edgar didnt say much which was unusual for a londoner he just kept beating you at darts but gomer knew who employed him and that was why he was very near excited when he got the call because from what hed heard here was a bloke who was going to need plenty plant hire knock walls down can you edgar humble asked what kind of walls stone wall victorian id say thick solid five six feet high couple of feet thick in places too much for yer gomer had almost laughed down the phone put it this way he said if id been in business round jericho way all those years ago they wouldnt have needed no bloody trumpets max rachel said this is j m powys max goff put on his panama hat bizarre powys thought eccentric but not crazy those are not crazy eyes goff looked at powys for a good while he had a beard like red velcro how long you been here since last night powys said steadily i stayed at the cock yeah shit hole huh i hope you put it on my tab goff grinned at last and stuck out a stubby hand hi j m welcome to crybbe welcome to the old golden land powys took the hand goffs grip was flaccid powys said you think this is the old golden land the countryside was colourless mist was still draped around the court like grimy lace curtains not yet goff said but it will be listen if id known you were here idve driven back last night thats ok ms wade was looking after me rachel was standing behind goff in the courtyard powys deliberately didnt look at her neither he noticed did her boss the man who overpaid her for little extras goff jerked his velcro chin at the two men at his side this is edgar humble my head of security mr humble powys said tightly and andy boultontrow who of course you know yeah andy wore a white shirt and black jeans close up he looked even thinner than hed been twelve years ago you could see the bones flexing in his face as he smiled it was a quick wide smile it made powys feel cold joe andy he said quietly long time my friend andys hair once shoulderlength was shaven right to the skull and he was growing a beard it would be black they hadnt met since roses funeral goff said now henry kettles gone andys my chief adviser in the crybbe project andy knows stones chief adviser jesus there was a big difference between andy boultontrow and henry kettle what it came down to was henry would have said dont mess with electricity until you know what youre doing andy would say sure just hold these two wires and then bring them together when i give you the nod ok so you lost henry powys said andy dropped the smile tragic goff said theres gonna be a henry kettle memorial a memorial well that was all right then that made up for everything we havent decided yet where its gonna go but somewhere prominent andy said powys didnt say a thing jm goff said we need to talk you and i at length i have a proposition hell we all know each other ill spell out the basics i want you to write me a sequel to golden land for dolmen i want it to be the crybbe story the hey what about this the new golden land goff beamed and looked round powys thought for applause what im talking here j m is a substantial advance and the quality republication in under a years time of the original golden land to pave the way revise it if you like new pictures in colour whatever sure scrap roses pictures powys thought dully get better ones and theres a place for you here a place a place to live a beautiful house with a view of the river part of the deal rachel will take you there after we eat mr goff he wondered why people kept giving him houses max i have a place already i run a little shop in hereford called trackways which i know said goff which is more than a shop which is a kind of museum to alfred watkins as well the only one of its kind in hereford which but it doesnt need to be in hereford goff said and it doesnt have to be a little shop come over here he led powys to a corner of the courtyard and pointed across the field behind the stables about a hundred yards from the tump where the trees began to thicken into the wood as befits the stature of the man the watkins centre needs to be a major development in lets say an eighteenthcentury barn on the edge of the wood was a massive tumbledown barn complex beams and spars poking out of it like components of a badly assembled dinosaur skeleton place needs to be big enough to house a huge collection of watkinss photographs and leymaps and scores of original paintings of ancient sites and it needs to be here in crybbe powys felt like a cartoon character whod been flattened by a steamroller and become a onedimensional mat lowering his voice goff said i know your situation jm i know you put all the money from golden land into trackways and i know how difficult it must be keeping trackways afloat he clapped powys on the back think about it yeah goff strolled back to the silent group of three standing next to the ferrari rach theres been a slight change of plan we have lunch at two we spend the afternoon in discussion groups then we assemble early evening at the tump powys saw part of a cobweb from the attic floating free from a padded shoulder of rachels blue business suit the tump a ceremony goff said to launch the project were gonna knock down the wall around the tump maybe thats where mr kettles memorial should be were gonna finish what he began were gonna liberate the tump andy boultontrow nodded goff grinned massively its the beginning he said come on lets get back to the cock see who shows up from the top of the farmyard there was a fine view of the river and the welsh hills behind but jimmy preece and his son jack were looking for once the other way up towards the court this was a view jack had been conditioned over the years to avoid as if when he emerged from the farmyard gates he was to wear an imaginary patch over his right eye this afternoon a great black cloud hung over the tump below it the bulldozer was bright yellow gomer parrys jack said sure tbe jimmy said and only one reason es down there so what you gonner do father no choice jack i shall ave to ave a word with im when e gets back the two men stood in silence for over a minute then jack mumbled almost to himself sometimes sometimes i wonders well so what what if e do come down that ole wall an the ole bell what if e dont get rung some nights jimmy preece was too certain of his son even to reply jack was like him jonathon was like jack and warren well warren was only a second son so it didnt matter anyway about warren the mayor was about to walk away back into town when he heard jack saying and the ole box if the ole box is gone do it matter jimmy preece stopped and turned and walked back very slowly to where jack stood a bigger man than jimmy habitually in darkgreen overalls the ole box i dont know father es gone maybe mightve gone hard to say isnt it without pulling the whole wall out jimmy preece said cant ave gone jack sometimes them ole bricks subside i told you anyway leave im alone that old box keep im walled up tell jonathon when es thirty and married never tell warren found some bits of plaster and stuff in the fireplace jack said poked about a bit and the bricks fell out the cavity put em back block em up thats what i was doin cavity though see cavity was empty father that case you got a job to do jack you get in there and find where the boxs fallen to then you put im back on the ledge and you seals the bugger up proper and another thing jack you get that dog seen to last night i know yeard im from the belfry even i phoned er up i give er till weekend this is the weekend said jimmy preece get jonathon to do it jack preece looked down at his boots gets to me sometimes father thats all why us he walked off without saying goodbye because none of the preeces ever said goodbye to each other only owre you on christmas morning chapter iv the one time rachel had seen guy morrison at a preliminary meeting with max in london hed been wearing a lightweight suit with sunglasses in the breast pocket and carrying a briefcase and a mobile phone today guy was in director mode he wore denims and a leather pouch like a holster on his belt he had blond hair and craggy features a tv man from central casting rachel thought at his shoulder stood a dumpy sternfaced girl with straight black hair and a waterproof clipboard hustling jm off to the cock goff had told rachel over his shoulder morrison wants to do a few exterior shots of the court with nobody about stick around till he shows rach keep an eye on him who is this catrin guy morrison asked the blackhaired girl in rachels hearing remind me guy this is rachel wade maxs pa catrins accent had a clipped sibilance rachel identified as northwest wales of course yes rachel offered him a languid hand weve spoken on the phone guy morrison look the hand and held it limply for an extra moment looking steadily unsmiling into her eyes youre almost everything your voice implied rachel wade good said rachel with a tight tired smile guy morrison dropped rachels hand stepped back looked around the courtyard then up into the sky again where clouds and mist still formed a damp canopy he frowned i wanted some gvs today establishing shots but this weathers not conducive at all so ive told the crew rachel wade to set up in that stableplace acceptable to you yes fine because what i thought id do after lunch is bang off a brief opening interview with max goff background of sawing and rubble everywhere traces of sawdust on the white suit emphasizing the handson approach may not use it but im not happy unless theres something in the can on day one youd better see how he feels about that guy morrison nodded and turned away she watched him pace the courtyard looking up at the hills fading into mist and at the court itself grey and spectral in us small hollow like an old galleon halfsunk into a mudflat when they arrived back at the cock close to pm a car was being parked on the square close to the steps a silvergrey ford escort with an offas dyke radio sticker on its windscreen the driver got out and came over rachel is it could i just have a word guy morrison peering at the carsticker and registering it was only local radio went ahead up the steps with his assistant im from offas dyke radio we carried a report yesterday without checking the details with you rachel had never seen this person before he was a shortish muscular man about twentyfive with a halfgrown moustache word reached me you werent happy about what went out and i just want you to know ive looked into it gavin ashpole news editor youll be seeing more of me good said rachel dismissively now if problem is weve been using a freelance fay morrison in crybbe but it hasnt been working out apart from this one instance rachel said i dont think so from now on any major stories in this area were going to handle direct what mr goffs doing amounts to a major story naturally so if theres anything you want to say anything you want to get out on offas dyke radio you call me direct heres my card thank you in fact this is off the record were considering putting a staff reporter into crybbe especially if your thing takes off and the population starts to expand really in which case ashpole spread his hands palms down in a flat cutting movement wed simply stop using morrison altogether i see rachel said what an appalling little creep she thought over a bland buffet lunch carnivores catered for but strictly no smoking max goff explained his plan to publish in perhaps two years time the book of crybbe gonna be an illustrated record of the project said goff he paused and looked into his audience and a blueprint for the third millennium warm applause theyd needed extra tables in the dining room at the cock goff said ive asked j m powys to write the book because his work remains to my mind the most inspiring evocation of a country still able to make contact with its inner self powys smiled modestly the magical mystical j m powys too old he thought miserably to become someone else too young not to want to about forty people were there some from london and elsewhere to hear about the project and consider getting involved thin earnest men in clean jeans and trainers and women in long skirts and symbolic new age jewellery powys didnt know most of them but he felt dispirited that hed met them all before there was a delicatelooking tarotreader called ivory with a wife old enough to be his mother and big enough to be his minder a feminist astrologer called oona jopson in whose charts apparently virgo was a man she had cropped hair and a small ring through her nose after goff sat down powys listened idly to the chat he heard an experimental hypnotist talking about regression ive got an absolute queue of clients mostly you know from london but what id really like is to get more of the local people on the couch apart from andy boultontrow the only person hed actually encountered before was the spiritual healer jean wendle from edinburgh who was older than the rest greyhaired with penetrating eyes this really your scene jean this heaven forbid crybbe though crybbes interesting you reckon well goodness joe you said it if you hadnt revealed what a psychically charged area this was none of us would be here at all would we youre very cruel she narrowed her eyes come round one night we can discuss it anyway she smiled at him how are things now he looked around the room for rachel couldnt see her i think things are finally looking up he said later goff took him into a corner of the diningroom and lowered his voice confidentially he said i need somebody who understands these matters to make sure this arsehole morrison doesnt screw it up part of the deal he uses you as script consultant no j m powys no documentary j m powys disagrees with anything it doesnt go out thatll be fun goff put a hand on powyss arm hey you know when i first knew i had to have you write the book powys smiled vacantly beyond embarrassment see when i first came to crybbe the very first day i was here i look around and suddenly i can see this about the border country being a spiritual departure lounge im standing down by the river looking over the town to the hills of england on one side and the hills of wales on the other and that other phrase of yours about the celtic twilight zone im hearing that and im thinking yeah this is it the departure lounge it just needs a refuel right you know what im getting at here you can feel it in this room right now all these people all reaching out maybe theyre reaching out for different things ah shit jm its all one thing you know that down to generating energy and throwing it out what you put out you get back threefold jeez pretty soon this town is gonna glow seems to me there are things you need to work out joe andy boultontrow said maybe this is the place to do it those lazy knowing darkbrown eyes gazing into your head again after all these years i can see your inner self and its a mess man andy was probably goffs rolemodel new ager he had the glow like hed slowed his metabolism to the point where he was simply too laidback to be affected by the ageing process lets talk andy said and they took their wine glasses into the small shabby residents lounge just off the diningroom andy lounged back on a motheaten sofa both feet on a battered coffeetable somehow he made it look like the lotus position he said never got over it did you powys rolled his wineglass between his hands looking down into it i mean rose andy said it was a long time ago you get over everything in time andy shook his head youre still full of shit joe you know that look powys said reasonably trying to be as cool as andy we both know i should never have gone round the bottle stone and certainly not backwards bottle stone andy said and certainly not backwards i should have told you to piss off im not getting you andy said what i saw was powys felt pain like powdered glass behind his eyes what i saw was happening to me not rose you had some kind of premonition about rose i told you about it andy shrugged you had a premonition about rose but you didnt act on it huh it was me you failed to interpret thats a shame joe you had a warning you didnt react and thats whats eating you up perhaps youve come here to find some manner of redemption andy shook his head with a kind of laidback compassion if it was a big job gomer parry worked with his nephew nev today nev had just followed him up in the van and theyd got the smaller bulldozer down from the lorry and then nev had pushed off no need for a second man piece of piss this one unless of course they wanted him to take out the whole bloody mound gomer chuckled he could do that too if it came to it he was sitting in the cab of the lorry listening to glen miller on his walkman the bulldozer was in the field fuelled up waiting not far away was a van with a couple of loudspeakers on its roof such as you saw on the street at election time funny job this had to be on site at one oclock to receive his precise instructions seemed some middle bit had to come out first make a big thing of it edgar humble had said a spectacle no complaints there gomer liked a bit of spectacle with the walkman on he didnt hear any banging on the cab door it was the vibrations told him somebody was trying to attract his attention he took off the lightweight headphones halfturned and saw an old checked cap with a square patch on the crown where a tear had been mended gomer who was a connoisseur of caps recognized it at once and opened his door jim what you doin yere gomer the mayor jimmy preece asked him bluntly i been hired by that goff gomer said proudly he wants that bloody wall takin out he does does he does he indeed someing wrong with that jim you puttin a bid in for the stone want me to go careful is it jimmy preece took off his cap and scratched his head even though it was still drizzling he didnt put the cap back on but rolled it up tighter and tighter with both hands i dont want you doin it at all gomer he said i want that wall left up oh aye gomer said sarcastically belongs to you that wall is it the mayors eyes were watery as raw eggs youre not allowed take it from me gomer thats a fact been there for centuries that wall hell have a protection order on im sure to balls said gomer i was told he was victorian no oldern that well you was told wrong gomer see i dont want no argument about this no bad feeling just want you to know that we that is me and jack and several other prominent citizens of this area includin several farmers and civic leaders would prefer it if the wall stayed up gomer couldnt believe it just ang on jim sos i gets this right youre sayin if i falls that thing then jimmy preece tightened his old lips until his mouth looked like a complicated railway junction you bloody well knowed why i was yere dint you said gomer you knowed exacly i been invited the mayor said sadly that goff e phoned me up and invited me to watch silly bugger so what youre sayin if i brings him down that wall youll im not sayin nothin the mayor said firmly i got no authority to order you about and i dont intend oh no jim youre only bloody threatenin me youn sayin if i starts workn for goff then i dont get no work nowhere else around yere right gomer levelled a grimy forefinger at the mayor you bloody stay there dont you bloody move ill get a witness an you can say it again in front of im the mayor said calmly you wont find no witnesses in this town asll say i threatened you gomer cause i avent you can do what the hell you likes for mr goff cept pull that wall down eh cept pull that wall down the mayor agreed chapter v what have you got to lose rachel had asked him and he wondered about this the cottage was on a little grassy ridge overlooking the river rachel told him max had been so taken with the little place hed thought of spending nights here himself until work on the stableblock was finished but with extra builders overtime bonuses it looked as if the stables would be habitable within the next few days and max had to spend a long weekend in london anyway so its yours rachel said if you want it it had only four rooms kitchen bathroom bedroom and this small square livingroom with a panoramic doubleglazed view downstream a writers dream rachel said noncommittally furnished too powys said it was a second home the first thing maxs agent did was acquire a list of local holiday homes and write to the owners offering disproportionate sums for a complete deal basic furniture included just over a third of them said yes within two days boredom setting in wouldnt it be nice to have one in cornwall instead then out of the blue heres fairy godfather goff with a sack of cash and you say hes in london for the weekend thats the plan rachel said but you may be glad to hear or not im staying powys kissed her mmm im staying because theres a public meeting to organize for next week the people of crybbe come face to face with their saviour for the first time and learn what the new age has to offer them should be illuminating you think any of them know what new age means jm even i dont know what it means do you all i was thinking if it involves having big stones planted in their gardens country folk can be a tiny bit superstitious especially stones their ancestors already got rid of once rachel perched on the edge of a little jotul woodburning stove she licked a forefinger and made the motions of counting out paper money rarely fails she said and if theyre really superstitious they can always move out and sell max the farm for a suitably disproportionate sum said powys its another world isnt it so er youll be on your own this weekend rachel moved a hip she was wearing tight winecoloured jeans and a white blouse max suggests i move out of the cock and into the stables but nobodyll be there to know one way or the other will they powys had been quite taken with the reproduction brass bed upstairs theres humble in his caravan he doesnt like me does he like anybody debatable said rachel im sure we can work something out whats the rent on this place by the way i think its part of the advance against royalties therell be an agreement for you to sign this gives you a small small to max but not necessarily to you lump sum as well if you dont finish the book of crybbe he gets the cottage back he also reserves the right to install standing stones or other ritual artefacts on your lawn rachel luv help me what do i do my advice take it but ask for a bigger lump sum he wont doublecross you hes a very determined man the town does not know whats hit it not yet id feel better if you were here as some sort of fifth column hell listen to you powys shook his head bemused perhaps youve come here to find some manner of redemption perhaps all he had to do was make one phone call and annie would dive on the chance of taking over trackways for an unspecified period just her and alfred watkins and an everbroadening selection of new age trivia it might even start making a reasonable profit rachel said one more thing if youd like a word processor please specify the make and model to match your existing software powys thought about this chin in hands patched elbow on the pine diningtable new ribbon for the olivetti when they reached the tump they split up for the sake appearances it was pm the rain was holding off but the evening was very still and close the sky hanging low looking for trouble rachel looked around and saw quite a big semicircle of people many more than had been at the lunch word had got around that something was going to happen word very soon got around in this town shed found whats going on ms wade jocasta newsome was posing dramatically against the lowering sky in a glistening new anklelength barbour conspicuously more expensive than rachels max is going to get rid of the wall around the tump oh said jocasta disappointed thats all its a major symbolic gesture rachel said patiently is that a television camera theyre making a documentary about max oh jocasta brightened thats er oh guy morrison isnt it i think hes rather good dont you yes excellent rachel said absently excuse me shed seen fay on the edge of the field with the dog still on the end of a clothesline fay looked forlorn in a royalblue cagoule that was too long for her she wore no makeup and her hair was damp and flattened i know she said dont tell me hes here do you mean guy or the offas dyke man fay raised both eyebrows surrounded am i im sorry about this fay i really am they rang me fay said offas dyke rang and said dont bother with it were covered i think theyre trying to edge me out ashpoles a tedious little man poisonous fay said fay look perhaps theres something if she could somehow turn max round fix it so hed only talk to fay most unlikely not your problem rachel if i cant function here tempted to blame it on the town but thats the easy answer isnt it fay grinned if you really want to do something i suppose you could suggest ashpole might get some terrific actuality of the wall coming down if he stood directly beneath it she wound the end of the clothesline more firmly around her hand come on arnold well go down by the river max goff was on the summit of the tump he had a microphone on a long lead the dripping trees were gathered around him crouched under a bush guy morrisons cameraman was shooting goff from a low angle it would look very dramatic this apparition in white against the deepgrey sky and the black trees on his knees next to goff as if in worship guys soundman held a twofoot boom mike encased in a windshield like a giant furry caterpillar there were two big speakers on the roof of a van at the foot of the mound this has been a dramatic and tragic week said goff yeah not too bad for level the soundman said it fucking better be pal the assembly heard im not saying it again behind the speaker van powys smiled guy morrison said im not pleased with him joe he dropped this on me without any warning at all a spontaneous idea he said hes got to learn that if he wants spontaneity we have got to know about it in advance i have always disliked the tump for some reason powys thought what does the wall mean henry why is there a wall around it he scrambled across the field away from the crowd unable to shake the feeling that perhaps getting rid of the wall was not the best thing to do but wondering whether this feeling had been conditioned by henrys misgivings about the mound halfway across the field he saw the hubcap from henrys volkswagen glinting in a bed of thistles it reminded him that his own car was still parked in a layby alongside the road at the end of this field henrys journal was in the car bloody stupid thing to do anybody could have nicked the car gone off with the journal behind him goffs voice boomed out of the speakers im gladad thatat so many of you were able to come todayay powys moved swiftly through wet grass towards the road he reached it at a point about fifty yards from the layby the white mini was there it looked ok is that your car a lone bungalow of fleshcoloured bricks squatted next to the layby and at the end of its short drive stood a stocky elderly woman in a twinset and a tartan skirt an ensemble which spelled out incomer yes it is powys said taking out his keys to prove it unlocking the boot you arrived just in time dear i was about to report it to the police yes im sorry i got delayed actually i was beaten up and then went to bed with a woman id never seen before but whose voice id heard on my answering machine but you dont want to hear about all that henry kettles journal lay where hed left it on top of the spare tyre whats going on over there she had a midlands accent theyre pulling down the wall around the mound why are they doing that did she really want to know this well because its a bit ugly and out of period with the tump thats what they say ill tell you one thing dear that walls never as ugly as the thing in the middle i dont like that thing i dont at all my husband he used to say when he was alive he used to say hed seen prettier spoilheaps he had a point powys said opening the drivers door im on me own now dear it frightens me the things that go on id leave tomorrow but i wouldnt anywhere near get our money back on this place not the way the market is it wouldnt buy me a maisonette in dudley powys closed the car door and walked over what did you mean it frightens you you from the local paper dear no im a shopkeeper im a writer my names joe powys ive never heard of you my love but dont take it to heart mrs seagrove minnie seagrove would you like a cup of tea im always making lea for people in that layby lorry drivers all sorts i wont put you to that kind of trouble said powys but i would like to know what specifically frightens you about that mound mrs seagrove smiled coyly youll think im daft that girl from the local radio thinks im daft i ring her sometimes when it gets on top of me the things that go on what things are those ill tell you honestly mrs seagrove im the last person whos going to think youre daft following the river fay walked arnold down the field towards the bridge close to where she and rachel had gone with the bottle of wine on a sunny afternoon that seemed like weeks and weeks ago it was one of fays thinking walks she wanted as someone once said to be alone before leaving shed pored over some of the books in her small local collection howses history of radnorshire ella mary leathers the folklore of herefordshire jacqueline simpsons the folklore of the welsh border not quite sure what she was looking for anything to do with dogs really dogs and bells thered been separate entries on both two books referred to the crybbe curfew one of only a handful still sounded in british towns purely tradition with two of them along the welsh border there was all the usual stuff about the bequest of percy weale wealthy sixteenthcentury wool merchant to safeguard the moral welfare of the town one book briefly mentioned the preece family as custodian of the tradition fay untied arnolds clothesline he snuffled around on the riverbank going quite close to the water but never getting his paws wet interested in something perhaps there were otters the river looked fat wellfed by rain not raining now but it probably would before nightfall the clouds moving in together like a street gang heavy with menace it was only since coming to crybbe that fay had begun to regard intangibles like the sky the atmosphere climatic changes as what manifestations of the earths mood or something more personal like when a mist seemed to cling to you throwing out nebulous tentacles as if you and it as if it knew you and the atmosphere hereabouts threatening or blandly indifferent was not an expression of the earths mood so much as she stopped and stared across the darkening river at the huddle of crybbe not the earths mood but the towns mood this thought came at the same moment as the shot fay whirled the riverside field was empty the clouds united overhead thick and solid as a gravestone there were no more shots and no echo as if the atmosphere had absorbed the shock like a cushion everything still the field unruffled except for a patch of black and white and now red that pulsed and throbbed maybe twenty yards from fay arnold she said faintly arnold chapter vi from where rachel was standing max goff arms folded resembled an enormous white mushroom on the tump in tones which roughed by the speakers didnt sound as reverent as they were perhaps intended to goff paid a brief tribute to henry kettle said to be among the three finest dowsers in the country killed when his car crashed into the obscene victorian wall built around this very mound no way we can know what went through mr kettles head in those final moments but i guess there was a kind of tragic poetry to his death rachel closed her eyes in anguish and his death began a minor but significant preliminary task which i intend to complete today max paused looked down at his feet looked up again the cameraman could be seen zooming in tight on his face the victorians had scant respect for their heritage they regarded our most ancient burial mounds as unsightly heaps which could be plundered at will in search of treasure and to emphasize what they believed to be their dominance over the landscape and over history itself they liked to build walls around things maybe they had a sense of the awesome terrestrial energy accumulating here maybe they felt threatened maybe they wanted to contain it or maybe they didnt fool themselves it even existed rachel thought cynically but whatever their intention goff began to raise his voice this wall remains a denial a denial of the earth spirit he lifted an arm fist clenched and this wall has to come down as a first symbolic act in the regeneration of crybbe people clapped that is rachel noticed members of the new age community clapped raggedly only it wont be coming down today humble said rachels eyes snapped open we got a problem rachel this is mr parry the bulldozer man a little man in wirerimmed glasses stuck out a speckled brown hand gomer parry plant hire how do you do said rachel suspiciously shouldnt you be down there with your machine ah well bit of a miscalculation see said gomer parry what it needs is a bigger bulldozer see even if i hits him high as i can reach that wall hell crash back on me sure to dangerous see dangerous rachel repeated unbelieving oh hell aye ok so if it needs a bigger bulldozer rachel said carefully then get a bigger bulldozer that said gomer parry is im afraid the biggest one i got other thing is i got no insurance to cover all these people watchin rachel said very slowly oh shit well nobody said it was goin to be a bloody circus said gomer parry goff stood there on the top of the tump still and white monarch of the old golden land he was waiting he came across the field in loose easy strides the twelve bore under his arm barrel pointing down he wore a brown waterproof jacket and green wellingtons it was darker now still a while from sundown but the sun hadnt figured much around here in a long time sorry miss cursory as a traffic warden whod just handed you a ticket shouldnt ave let im chase sheep should you what it was only afterwards she realized what hed said fay on her knees blood on her jeans from arnold the dog lay in the grass bleeding he whined and twitched and throbbed move back miss please and she did thinking it had all been a horrible mistake and he was going to help her but when she shuffled back in the grass almost overbalancing he strolled across and stood over the dog casually levelling his gun at the pulsating heap fay gasped and threw herself forward on top of arnold feeling herself trembling violently like in a fever and the dog hot wet and sticky under her breasts now dont be silly miss es done for see move away let me finish im off go away fay screamed fuck off eyes squeezed closed lying over arnold the dog gave a little cry and a wheeze like a balloon going down oh no fay sobbed no please lying across the dog face in the grass blind anger hatred rising they both saw the dog fall not far from the river a blur of blood the woman running collapsing to her knees then the man wandering casually across the field the bastard who is he jonathon preece mrs seagrove said whitefaced clinging to her gate from court farm what the hells he think hes doing i wish i could run mrs seagrove said her voice quaking with rage and shock id have that gun off him look she clutched his arm whats he doing now joe hes going to shoot her hes going to shoot the girl as well incredibly it did look like it shed thrown herself over the dog the man was standing over them the gun pointing downwards do you know her too far away to tell joe mrs seagrove began to wring her hands oh i hate them i hate them theyre primitive theyre a law unto themselves right powys was moving towards the field common land he was thinking common land shall i call the police only if i dont come back powys said shocked at how this sounded for real jesus he slipped and scrambled to his feet with yellow mud on his grey suit shit called back what did you say his name was for gods sake be careful preece jonathon preece right you stay there mrs seagrove get ready to phone jesus he thought realizing he was trembling what kind of place is this guy morrison was about to tear his hair this was a twocamera job and he only had one how was he supposed to shoot goff and the destruction of the wall with one camera what this needed was a shot of the bulldozer crashing through with a shower of stone and a cutback to goffs triumphant face as he savoured the moment from his eyrie on the tump it would be a meaningful sequence close to the top of the first programme maybe even under the titles but now was ne supposed to get that with one crew if hed known about this beforehand hed have hired a local news cameraman as backup griggs for instance but he didnt know about it in advance because this arrogant fat bastard was playing his cards too close to his chest at least the delay was a breathing space which you want to go for then the cameraman larry ember asked him pulling his tripod out of the mud close to the summit of the mound guy pushed angry stiffened fingers through his blond hair whichever we go for itll be wrong he said uncharacteristically look if we set up next to goff how much of the bulldozer stuff do you reckon you can shoot from here useless larry ember said youre shooting a wall collapsing you got to be under the thing like its tumbling towards you even then with one camera youre not going to get much maybe we can fake it afterwards get the chap to knock down another section of wall round the back or something weve got no choice i need to get his reactions could always ask him to fake it afterwards perhaps not said guy fucking cold up here larry said what kind of summer is this a swirling breeze well more than a breeze had set the trees rattling around them going to rain too in a minute larry ember looked up at a sky like the inside of a rotten potato we should have had lights up here i told you we needed a sparks as well you cant cut costs on a job like this i didnt know it was going to happen guy hissed did i i thought it was going to be a couple of talking heads and a few gvs goff lurched over white jacket flapping in the wind some flaming cockup here switch that damn thing off for now guy will you you the producer or is he the cameraman wondered provocatively go along with him for now guy had gone red his dumpy seriousfaced assistant catrin jones squeezed his arm encouragingly guy knew shed been in love with him for some time below them the speakers on the van began to crackle goffs voice came out fractured et chel wade up here get rach ade up here now catrin zipped up her fleecy bodywarmer its a funny thing nothing snapped guy about this is funny no i mean its so cold and windy up here and down there nothing she waved a hand towards the crowd below some people drifting away now no wind at all nobodys hair is blowing or anything ok guy prodded larry embers left shoulder bellowed down his ear executive decision lets get down there take a chance shoot it from below ucking sticks gonna blow over larry clutched his camera as the wind buffeted the tripod the wind seemed to be coming from underneath catrins clipboard was suddenly snatched from her hands and wafted upwards with a wild scattering of white paper like a bird disturbed she squealed oh no clawing frantically at the air leave it guy said its the shotlist just let it go five yards away goff was shrieking into the microphone to no effect the sound had gone completely king weird this setup larrys words snatched into the swirling wind one more shot guy screaming down the cameramans car again get goff get him now goffs arms were flailing the wide lapels of his white jacket whipped across his chin the trees roaring around him the sky black he was out of control guy wanted this powys edged round the field concealed he hoped by gorsebushes and broom then crossed it diagonally approaching the man jonathon preece from behind as quietly as he could feeling himself quivering outrage and apprehension he could see the woman lying not quite flat spread across the dog looking up now at preece heard her harsh whisper done you bastard im allowed preece said with powys thought surprising belligerence the shotgun under his arm barrel unbroken if a dogs threatening sheep there are no bloody sheep there is in that next field he insisted up there e was i seen im before we ad four lambs killed up there tother week youre lying this dog wasnt even here last week if a farmer got reason to think waving his arms for emphasis the gun moving about under one you going to shoot me now jonathon preece looked down at the gun under his arm and stepped back a pace or two powys froze only three or four yards behind him now preece bent down watching the woman all the time and laid the shotgun on the grass to one side see i put im down now the ole gun you go ome nothing you can do a bit defensive now im within my legal rights you ask wynford wiley cant be elped no place for dogs sheep country the woman didnt move powys saw a tumble of tawny hair over a blue nylon cagoule a curious thing happened then although it was way past pm and the sky was deep grey no trace of sunlight for hours a shadow fell across the field like an iron bar and down it like a gust of breath through a blowpipe came a harsh wind whats he doing what is he doing rachel couldnt believe it max was lumping up and down on the summit of the mound his white jacket swirling around him his white trousers flapping as if he was trying to keep his balance struggling to stay on his feet looks like es been caught in a hurricane gomer parry observed but there was no wind the trees behind goff on the tump appeared quite motionless while goff himself was dancing like a marionette with a hyperactive child wielding the strings hes just angry rachel thought out of his mind with rage because the wall isnt collapsing and the pa systems broken down teach him to hire local firms for a job like this she was aware on the edge of her vision of andy boultontrow in his white shirt and his tight black jeans looking up at the dancing bear on the mound andys beardshadowed face was solemn and watchful then it split into a grin and he started shaking his head he saw jonathon preece look up in sudden alarm as the shaft of wind made a channel of black water across the river from bank to bank there was a strangled yelp from the woman or the dog or both but he couldnt hear either of them clearly because of the wind it came like a hard gasp of breath bad breath the wind smelled foul and as powys choking reeled away from it his senses rebelled and the whole scene seemed to go into negative for a moment so that the sky was white and the grass was red and the river gleamed a nauseous yellow he stumbled eyes streaming a roaring in his ears and when the noise faded and the halitosis wind died and his vision began to clear joe powys found he was holding the twelvebore shotgun it was heavier than he expected and he stumbled almost dropping it he gripped it firmly in both hands straightened up jonathon preece roared who the ell powys saw his face for the first time raw pink checks age maybe twentytwo or three steady pal you give me that gun mister advise me jonathon powys pointed the shotgun in the general direction of jonathon preeces groin ive never used one of these before do i have to pull the two triggers to blow both your balls off or is one enough he was gratified to see fear flit fast as an insect across jonathon preeces eyes i dont know who you are mister but this is none of your business powys felt himself grinning in his right hand the barrel of the twelvebore was comfortably warm like radiator pipes the stock fitted into his armpit firm as a crutch you watch it mister ole thingll go off yes powys said he raised the barrel so that it was pointing into jonathans chest you put im down be sensible his finger under the triggerguard so firm he thought this man deserves whats coming to him this man needs to die he felt a hard thud of certainty in his chest an acute satisfaction the flexing of an unknown muscle he drank in the dusk like rough ale closed his eyes and squeezed nnnn oooo saw in slowmotion the chest of jonathon preece exploding the air bright with blood a butchers shop cascade a tiny feeble noise he turned the woman in the blue cagoule was up on her knees now breathing hard the tiny feeble noise came out of the lump of sodden fur exposed on the grass arnie she looked up at powys he saw tearstained bloodblotched cheeks clear green eyes and a lot of mud oh god hes hanging on can you help me powyss mouth was so dry he couldnt speak jonathon preece screamed you got no bloody sense gimme that gun i please the woman begged gimme it the farmer took a step forward from out of the towns serrated silhouette came the first sonorous stroke of the curfew powys looked down in horror at the gun it felt suddenly very cold in his hands gimme get it yourself powys said backing away far enough away for jonathon preece in this light to remain unsure of what was happening until he heard the splash when the gun hit the water powys saw mrs seagrove hurrying down the bank towards them and then he saw jonathon preeces purpling face and became aware for the first time as the farmer advanced on him with bunched fists that jonathon preece was bigger than he was as well as being younger and fitter and at this point far angrier you fuckin done it now mister antique that gun is three generations of my family ad that gun powys shrugged palms up backing off he felt loose very tired suddenly yeah well not too deep just there jonathon be ok when it dries out preeces head swivelled mrs seagrove coming quickly towards them redfaced out of breath and he stopped uncertain mrs seagrove stood there in her twinset and her plaid skirt breathing hard eventually managing to gasp did you see it did you powys looked at her then at jonathon preece whod turned to the river was glaring out the river looked stagnant preece hesitated stared savagely into the drab water started to say something and then didnt please the woman said from the grass it began to rain big drops you could see individually against the hard sky powys pulled off his jacket and knelt down the dogs eyes were wide open flanks pulsating powys didnt know what to do the dog squirmed blood oozed powys laid the jacket down put him on this he slid both hands beneath the dog gently well get him to a vet you you never know your luck in the river now almost up to the tops of his wellingtons jonathon preece bellowed i know your face mister ill ave you oh piss off powys said weary of him he heard mrs seagrove wailing you mustve seen it it was coming right at you it went through you chapter vii jean wendle was living in a narrow town house on the square inside it was already quite dark she put on a reading lamp its parchment shade made the room mellow gold lettering on the book spines the warm brass of a coalscuttle in the hearth it reminded alex of his first curates house in oxfordshire before hed been promoted into an endless series of vast unbeatable vicarages and rectories shed certainly brought the warmth of her personality into the place jean wendle made him sit in a smokers bow chair his back to the fireplace with its chinese screen facing a plain whitewashed wall some days alex said it seems fine i mean there might be nothing wrong or perhaps that in itself is an illusion perhaps i think im all right and everybody else sees me as stark staring shush touch of scottish in her voice he liked that dont tell me dont tell me anything about it let me find out for myself yes he really rather fancied her sixtyish short grey hair still quite a neat little body pliable no visible stiffening sort of retired gymmistress look about her and nice mobile lips cool fingers on his forehead moving from side to side finding the right spot then quite still quite sexy would he have let himself in for this if he hadnt fancied her a bit not a chance dont talk she said i wasnt talking well dont think so loudly not for a moment or two just relax taken him a few days to arrive into the cool hands of jean wendle well a few nights tentative approaches in the pub not a word to fay definitely not a word to grace and why shouldnt he what was there to lose the gp in crybbe was a miserable beggar hadnt been much to poor old grace had he drugs always drugs drugs that made you sleepy drugs that made you sick and at the end of the day gradually he and reality would go their separate ways rather appealing in one sense what did reality have to commend it these days but not exactly a picnic for anyone looking after him alex knew what happened to people who lost their minds it sometimes seemed that half his parishioners had been geriatrics they remembered having a wash this morning when it was really days ago they peed in the wardrobe by mistake fay now that child was suffering a severe case of misplaced loyalty if he couldnt get rid of her it was his solid intention to pop himself off while he could still count on getting the procedure right shed thank him for it one day better all round though if he could make it look like an accident fall off the bridge or something would have been a pity though with all these alternative healing characters swanning around not to give it a try first what was there to lose the first chap hed been to osborne had not been all that encouraging almost as depressing as the doc alex got the feeling old age was not what the new age was about and all this like cures like stuff a drop of this a drop of that little phials of colourless liquid touch of the medieval apothecary how long before it starts to work you mustnt expect dramatic results alex osborne told him you see holistic medicine by definition is about improving the health of the whole person everything is interconnected obviously the older one is the more set in its ways the body is therefore the longer he must have seen the expression in alexs eyes look my wifes an acupuncturist perhaps that might be more what you all those bloody needles no thanks it isnt painful alex pain i dont mind pain just the image of himself lying there an overstuffed pincushion this kind of healing was a good deal more dignified if you concentrated on those cool hands and didnt think too hard about what was supposedly going on in the spirit world hed grilled her naturally dr chi dr bloody chi you dont look like a nutter wendy how can you seriously believe youre working under the supervision of some longdead chinky quack my names jean shed corrected him softly dr chi alex draining his scotch god save us do you really want to know about this alex or are you just going to be superior narrowminded chauvinistic and insulting was i hmmph sorry old age senile dementia are you really old enough to be senile alex what are you seventy im certainly way past flattery wendy way past eighty too go on tell me about this peking poxdoctor from the ming dynasty hed forced himself to listen patiently while she told him about dr chi who she said shed once actually seen as a white glowing eggshaped thing the name is significant dr chi chi is the oriental life force perhaps thats the name ive subconsciously given him i dont know if im dealing with a doctor from the ming dynasty the tang dynasty or whenever he doesnt speak to me all singsong like a waiter serving chicken chow mein all i know is theres a healing force and i call him dr chi perhaps he never was a human doctor at all or perhaps hes something that last worked through a chinese physician im not clever enough to understand these things im content to be a channel good gracious dont you believe in miracles alex isnt that the orthodox anglican way any more regarding the anglican church he wasnt entirely sure what he believed any more powys found the page ran his finger down the column headed veterinary surgeons ok d l harris crybbe threeninefour mrs seagrove dialled the number and handed him the phone the woman in the bloodstained blue cagoule sat in the hall the dog lay on powyss jacket on the womans knee panting have a cup of tea while youre waiting mrs seagrove said she shook her head no thank youwe may have to take him somewhere the number rang for nearly half a minute before a woman answered yes mr harris there please whats it about local accent weve got a very badly injured dog could you tell me where to bring it a silence dog you say shrill as if hed said giraffe or something hes been shot im sorry the woman said flatvoiced but mr harris is out will he be long is there another vet sorry cool terse we cant help you a crackle the line broke i dont believe it powys said she said the vet was out i asked when hed be back or was there anyone else and she said she couldnt help me can you believe that this was a vets for gods sake wrong fay morrison said bitterly this was a crybbe vets what the fuck was happening up there max goff lay on his bed in his room at the cock you tell me said andy boultontrow i never felt so high like at first i was really angry really furious at the inefficiency why werent they bringing the flaming wall down why was nothing happening why was the sound failing and then then i felt the power the energy i never felt anything so heavy before it took off the top of my skull that ever happen to you once or twice andy said come to london with me goff said stay at my place i have things to do here then ill stay here well stay in this room you got things to teach me i realize this now well stay here ill get rid of ms wade ill send her back to london andy placed a hand on maxs knee you go back to london max theres such a thing as too much too soon youll get there youll make it andy didnt move his hand max shivered took off the top of my skull and then the curfew started yes andy said the curfew i dont think i like that curfew jean wendle said pouring earl grey after the treatment i dont know whether its the bell or what it represents i dont like restrictions oh quite alex said couldnt stand it if it was a real curfew but as a bit of picturesque traditional nonsense its all right isnt it i think it is a real curfew in some way jean said i dont know why i think that well yes i do people do stay off the streets while its being rung have you noticed that but i think theres something else a hundred times a night is an awfully big tradition i suppose so alex would give her the benefit of the doubt on anything tonight he didnt remember when hed last felt so relaxed so much at peace and him a priest best not to go into the implications of all this its a very odd little town jean said she drew golddusted velvet curtains over a deep georgian window arent they all no they arent this is there are how can i put it pockets of strange energy in this town all over the place people see things too although few will ever admit it see things alex was wary manifestations light effects ghosts hmm said alex good cup of tea being on the border is a lot to do with it when we make a frontier when we split something physically asunder in the landscape especially when we build something like offas dyke to emphasize it we create an area of psychic disturbance that doesnt go away alex stirred his tea wishing shed talk about something else jean said do you think theyve taken on more than they can handle max goff and the new age people i thought you were one of them i like to keep a certain distance jean said i like to watch can they control it i wonder or is it too volatile for them oh we cant control anything alex said thats something everybody learns sooner or later least of all control ourselves it was well after midnight by the time they came out of the vets without arnold i couldnt stand the way he was looking at me fay said its not been his week has it hes in a car crash sees his master die saved from the clutches of the crybbe constabulary finds hes become a kind of pariah in the town then he gets shot the mini had been parked for over two hours on a double yellow line outside the vets surgery in leominster fifteen miles from crybbe the nearest one from which theyd managed to get a response the vet handling nightcalls had been understanding but had made no comments either way about the wisdom of farmers shooting dogs alleged to be worrying sheep the vet had said arnold would probably live just dont expect him to be as good as new with all that lead inside him one of the back legs had taken most of it bones had been broken the vet had seemed a bit despondent about that leg fay had spent half an hour holding arnold at different angles while the vet examined what he could removing shotgun pellets he might have to operate he said and got fay to sign a paper relating to responsibility if arnold died under anaesthetic now fay and powys were standing on the pavement unwinding it was very quiet in leominster the other side of midnight no menace here fay thought j m powys was shaking out his jacket it was scarcely identifiable as a jacket any more it looked as if someone had faced a firing squad in it oh god fay said im so sorry j m powys dangled the jacket from an index finger and looked quite amused j m powys bloody hell its hard to believe youre j m powys i thought youd be dead well not quite that lady mrs seagrove she called you mrs morrison youre not guys wife are you no fay said not any more she explained leaning on an elderly mini in a quiet street in leominster lights going out around them explained quite a few things talking too much the way you did when youd been through something traumatic only realizing she was shooting her mouth off when she heard herself saying ive got to get out of that place or im going to implode or maybe ill just kill somebody she pulled both palms down her cheeks shook her hair like a dog what am i going on about not your problem thanks for everything youve done i shall buy you a new jacket i dont want a new jacket powys opened the car door i like them full of patches and sewnup bits he drove carefully out of the town dipping the headlights politely when they met another vehicle they didnt meet many the lights sometimes flashed briefly into the eyes of rabbits sitting in the hedgerows once j m powys had to brake for a badger scampering that was really the word shed have expected badgers to lumber across the road and into a wood fay realized she hadnt phoned her dad hed be worried or he wouldnt depending on his state of mind tonight too late now arnold powys said suddenly breaking five minutes of slightly sleepy silence what arnold not henry kettles dog you arent the person whos looking after henrys dog and not making an awfully good job of it so far stone me said powys sometimes coincidence just seems to crowd you into corners especially in crybbe fay said she wished she was travelling through the night to somewhere else virtually anywhere else actually the bones were very white in the torchlight there were also some parchmentcoloured bits skin or sinew gristle ah tessa said less than awed i know what that is warren was miffed how the fuck could she know anything about it yeah warren said its a hand its a hand of glory what you on about a dead mans hand well thats bloody obvious isnt it a hanged mans hand tessa said warren squatted down next to her the spade lay on the grass next to a neat pile of earth and the square of turf set carefully to one side so it could be replaced which means its got magic powers tessa said whered you find it around all right dont tell me whats that stanley knife doing in there well i buggered if he was going to tell her hed been scared to put his hand in and take the knife out im seeing what effect it as on it you know like you puts an old razorblade under a cardboard pyramid and it comes out sharp again new age that warren cackled im learnin all about this new age now see owd you know that know what bout it being a hanged mans hand i think id like to draw it tessa said maybe ill come up here again no it was his hand keep diggin it up the groundll get messed up and somebody else might find it they wont do you know why you brought it here warren good a place as any tessa smiled what you done with then other drawings the old feller got fed up with him tessa said passed him on who to dunno where he might end up tessa said mysteriously part of the fun she smiled and fitted a forefinger down the front of warrens jeans and drew him towards her across the old box lets do it here do it by the box leave it open see what happens probly come crawlin out an pinch your bum warren said slyly anyway its too late now for that tessa took her finger out of warrens jeans i waited for you had a job to do what was so important youll find out warren said tessa reached out and touched a white knucklebone cold she said its nice and cold it was cold in the river too warren said rachel lay in the brass bed when he slid in gratefully beside her she awoke jm i couldnt put a light on the powers off again hed lit up bell street with the headlights watching the small figure in bloodstained blue nylon walking to her door when she was safely inside he drove back into the lightless main street where all the windows were blind eyes then down the hill and over the bridge a tight right turn and there was the perfect little riverside cottage hed almost expected it not to be there like a dream cottage the presence of rachel in the bed reinforced a sense of home before she could ask he told her where hed been poured it all out the whole bizarre episode arnold rachel sat up in the darkness jonathon preece shot arnold he told her about the shotgun how hed come to pick it up from the grass i really wanted to kill him i thought i had killed him at one point i could feel myself pulling the triggers both triggers and then his chest it was as if time had skipped a beat and id already shot him youre overtired rachel said then the dog arnold whimpered and i was back in the second before i did it arnold was henry kettles dog i know you dont know how badly i wanted to kill that guy this doesnt seem like you jm no powys said it didnt there was a window opposite the bed across the river he saw a few sparse lights coming on like candles on a cake powers back and youre a hero jm rachel said moulding her body into his although youll be a marked man in crybbe if anyone finds out part five you wont need to worry and you wont have to cry over in the old golden land robin williamson from the album wee tarn and the big huge chapter i no dont move im yet gomer jack preece ambled across the field to where gomer parry and his nephew nev were preparing to get the bulldozer back on the lorry dont speak to me jack gomer didnt turn round embarrassed humiliated more like aye well im sorry gomer sorry you bloody should be sorry jack preece never before have gomer parry plant hire failed to carry out a contract never i should ave told your dad where e could stick is only see the district councils avin a bit o trouble on the new landfill site over brynglas jack preece said need of an extra bulldozer quickish like three days work sure tbe gomer parry turned shrewd eyes on jack preece standing in the damp old field between downpours his back to the tump and the famous wall still intact except for the bits of masonry dislodged when old kettle had his crash reckon you can do it gomer gomer shot him a penetrating took through his wirerimmed glasses something goin on yere jack dont know what it is but theres something aye well jack preece said eyes averted no need to worry about your reputation gomer anyway youll be

gomer only young once jack aye said jack sure tbe powys drove back to hereford loaded up a couple of suitcases a box of books his olivetti and two reams of a aha said barry the osteopath from upstairs ensnared hes got you i knew he would what was the deciding factor powys the money powys shook his head the women powys said just hold that door open for me would you i knew it its the summer of love in crybbe you always were a sucker for a cheesecloth cleavage barry said powys dont you have somebodys spine to trample on good luck joe annie said wistfully what dyou mean good luck hed noticed the crystals had been joined on the counter by a small display of astrological amulets in copper where the hell had she found those youre going back annie said i am not going back annie and barry smiled knowingly to each other during the return drive it rained it rained harder the nearer he got to crybbe powys did some thinking images wafting across his mind with the rhythm of the windscreen wipers seriously unseasonal rain was throwing the river over the banks like rumpled bedclothes he saw an image of a shotgun getting slowly pushed downstream its barrels clogged with corrosive silt unless jonathon had managed to retrieve it would he ever find out and would jonathon report him to the police unlikely he hoped well it was a question of image the farmer who let a townie in a suit pinch his gun and toss it in the river theyd love that in the saloon bar of the cock it would go down in the folk history of the town rachel was spending the morning at the court organizing workmen putting finishing touches to the stableblock he thought of going to see mrs seagrove he carried his suitcases into the cottage it was a good cottage a better home than his flat it had wonderful views over the river slopping and frothing feverishly after hours of heavy rain he couldnt stay here for long though not on false pretences there was no way he was going to write the new age gospel according to goff and the sequence by the river last night kept replaying itself the feeling of the warm gun the knowledge that he was not only capable of killing but wanted to kill the bar of shadow across the grass and the river all the way from the tump where henry kettle died and arnold henry kettles dog a dowsers dog henry used to say isnt like other dogs it wasnt raining any more through the large window in the livingroom he saw the clouds had shifted like furniture pushed to the corners of the room leaving a square of light fifty yards away the river denied its conquest of the meadow slurped sulkily at its banks on the other side of the river in the semidistant field probably goffs land powys saw two tiny figures one holding a couple of tall poles he thought the dodmen alfred watkinss term for the prehistoric surveyors who had planned out the leys erecting standing stones and earthworks at strategic points the surveyors would watkins imagined have held up poles to find out where tall stones would be visible as waymarkers now modern dodmen were at work recreating prehistoric crybbe in precisely the way it was presumed to have been done four thousand or so years ago from here powys couldnt even make out whether they were dodmen or dodwomen but he was prepared to bet one of them would be andy boultontrow calm laidback omniscient old andy i think joe ought to present himself to the earth spirit in the time honoured fashion the very least you can do mate think of it as a kind of appeasement now andy was personally supervising the operation to open up the town of crybbe to the earth spirit on past experience of this irresponsible bastard did that sound like good news i think hereward newsome said almost shaking with triumph that ive cracked it you saw him hes gone back to london i saw rachel wade she said go ahead hereward took off his jacket hung it over the back of the antiquepine rockingchair by the aga sat down and began to roll up his shirtsleeves but we need to move fast why if jocasta wasnt as ecstatic as she might have been this was because herewards news had eclipsed her own small coup i mean a buying trip to the west country id suggest and pronto theres ernest wilding at street devereux in penzance sally gold in totnes melanie dufort in where is it now some place near frome all specializing in megalith paintings or they were and there have to be more what happened to the ruralists wheres inshaw these days not far from here i heard oh he stood up anyway im going to make some calls now strike while goffs hot if we go down there this weekend fetch a few back to put in front of him on tuesday when he comes back hereward paced the kitchen any second now jocasta thought hell start rubbing his hands still it was good news you ought to see his proposed exhibition hall rachel showed me this huge barn hes going to rebuild itll be a sort of interpretive centre for prehistoric crybbe and the whole earth mysteries thing hes looking for maybe seventy paintings seventy darling if we can provide half of those were talking lets be vulgar if we can get the kind of stuff he wants were talking megabucks why cant we go next weekend look so we close the gallery for a day what have we got to lose with goff out of town and the way things have been can we afford to delay hereward god he was so irritating what about emmanuel walters oh hereward sat down its sunday isnt it yees jocasta said exasperated it is and its a bloody good job one of us is efficient adding nonchalantly ive even arranged a celebrity to open the exhibition oh yes jocastas lips cemented into a hard line even if it was a member of the royal family it wouldnt impress hereward at the moment still on his max goff high its guy morrison oh er super didnt he used to be hes producing and presenting the documentary the bbc are doing on max goff and crybbe he seems very pleasant he agreed at once i think hes at rather a loose end hes spending the weekend here getting to know the town getting to know the people who count not much use coming to the gallery then hereward guffawed insensitively jocasta scowled that was it i know she said why dont you go to the west country on your own ill stay behind and handle the private view yes i suppose it makes sense jocasta knew it made no sense at all good old hereward always anxious to be accepted by artists as a friend someone who understood the creative process would spend hundreds of pounds more than she would but at least shed get rid of him for a couple of days increasingly jocasta had been thinking back with nostalgia to the days when theyd had separate jobs and only met for a couple of hours in the evening hereward said a formality she thought will you be all right on your own just for a minute she thought about last right and those drawings and the sticky feeling on her hands which had proved when the lights came on to be no more than perspiration i shall be fine she said mrs seagrove brought him tea in one of her best china cups as distinct she pointed out from the mugs she took out to the lorry drivers in the layby i thought id seen the last of you joe hows the doggie we think hes going to be ok thats good she was wearing today a plaid skirt of different tartan im not scottish she said frank and i used to go up there every autumn and wed visit these woollen mills there was a picture of frank on the sideboard he was beaming and holding up a fish which might have been a trout he was thrilled when we got this place so near the river he joined the angling club it was a shame turned out to be not a very good river for fishing and the problem was joe frank could see the river but i could only see that she sat with her back to the big horizontal window with its panoramic view across the river to the woods and of course the tump about that powys said i thought youd come about that mrs seagrove held the teacup on her kilted knees flat and steady as a good coffee table well im glad somebodys interested mrs morrison is always too busy unless i want to talk about it on the radio she says well i said would you make a spectacle of yourself on the wireless last night you said something was coming at us from the tump people are fascinated by these things im not are you joe well i used to be still am in a way but they worry me now quite right im not interested ive never been interested it nearly always happens to people who are not interested said powys i think i know when it comes now what time so i draw the curtains and turn the telly up but some nights i just have to go and look just to get it out of the way im scared to death joe but i look just to get it out of the way and what time is it usually after nine oclock and before they ring that bell in the church not always its early sometimes almost full daylight although it goes dark all of a sudden kind of thing like its as if its bringing its own darkness do you know what i mean and just once it was that night the poor man crashed his car just once it was later about halftennish just that once powys said its a dog isnt it a big black dog yes dear said mrs seagrove very quietly yes it is how often have you seven or eight times ive seen it it always goes the same way coming from the the mound thing down from the mound or out of the mound i couldnt honestly say dear one second its not there the next it is kind of thing im psychic i suppose i never wanted to be psychic not like this is it im sorry to ask all these questions but is it obviously a dog it couldnt be anything else you ask as many questions as you like dear ive been finding out about you i rang a friend of mine at the library in dudley no thats an interesting point you make there is it really a dog well i like dogs i wouldnt be frightened of a dog would i even a ghost dog naturally itd be a shock the first time you saw it kind of thing but no i dont think id be frightened oh dear i wish you hadnt asked me that now its disturbed me that has joe im sorry i dont want to stay here id be off tomorrow but how much would i get for this even if i managed to sell it if you really wanted to go quickly powys said i think i could find you a buyer youd get a good price too not you good god no not me i couldnt afford it even if look leave it with me for a day or two i dont know what to say dear mrs seagroves eyes were shining in a way id feel bad about somebody having this place but they might not be psychic mightnt they or they might be quite interested oh no she said nobodys interested in evil are they chapter ii guy dropped by she opened the back door thinking it was the milkman come for his money as was usual on a saturday fay hi oh my god she wouldnt have chosen to say that but guy seemed pleased at the reaction perhaps he saw it as an urgent suppression of instinctive desire thought id drop by as i had some time on my hands incandescent smile spending the weekend here getting acclimatized new crowns fay spotted good ones of course crews gone back but ive been invited to open some shitty art exhibition tomorrow night must be a bit short on celebrities in these parts if they want me guy laughed still a master of doubleedged false modesty fay thought wishing shed changed combed her hair applied some rudimentary makeup and then despising herself utterly for wishing all that come in guy dads gone for a walk hell be devastated to have missed you how is he guy stepped into the hall and looked closely at everything simulating enormous interest in the chipped cream paintwork the wallpaper with its faded autumn leaves the nylon carpet beneath his handstitched buffed brown shoes he wore a short olive leather jacket soft as a very expensive wallet we used to have some fascinating chats your father and i when i was in religious programmes i expect he learned quite a lot fay said going through to the kitchen that was how i swung the crybbe thing you know it cut plenty of ice with max goff me being an exreligiousaffairs producer indicated a certain sensitivity of touch and an essentially serious outlook nothing crude no juvenile pisstaking tea or coffee fay said why did you leave religious programmes anyway seemed like a good safe earner to me just about the only situation where you can work in television and still get to heaven well you know fay there came a time when it was clear that guy morrison had said all he needed to say about religion is it ground coffee or instant would i offer you instant coffee guy i dont like to make presumptions about peoples financial positions guy said sensitively were fine i did tell you didnt i that id probably have brought you in as researcher except for this jm powys problem thanks but i doubt idve had time anyway pretty busy really the handle came off the cup she was holding thatd teach her to lie twice he was foisted on me fay nothing i could do i met him last night seemed a nice bloke just before lunch j m powys had phoned to ask how arnold was comfortable fay had said having been on the phone to the vet as early as was reasonable stable as well as can be expected guy crinkled his mouth onebook wonder j m powys a spent force must be a nice bloke if guy despises him fay thought she began to filter the coffee in silence eventually guy sitting at the kitchen table said long time since we met face to face fay three years four at least physically hed hardly changed at all perhaps the odd characterful crease like the superbquality leather of his jacket pretty soon she thought in dismay hell be looking too comparatively young ever to have been married to me guy said youre looking er good fay what a bastard she made a point of net replying in kind guy said quite often you know increasingly in fact i find myself wondering why we ever split up didnt it have something to do with you screwing your production assistant guy dismissed it trivial trivial stuff i was young she threw herself at me you know that im essentially a pretty faithful sort of person no what we had he pushed graces gplan dining chair away from the table and leaned back throwing his left ankle over his right knee and catching it deftly with his right hand he obviously couldnt quite remember what theyd had i often wish wed had children fay oh hell guys intermittent livein girlfriend had apparently proved to be barren fay remembered him moaning about this to her one night on the phone she remembered thinking at the time that infertility was a very useful attribute for an intermittent livein girlfriend to have but guy was at the age when he wanted there to be little morrisons im at the cock what the cock hotel guy said its an appalling place dreadful fay said pouring his coffee i think im going to have to make other arrangements when we start shooting in earnest i should can you think of anywhere hasnt goff offered you accommodation nothing suitable apparently he says though we do have special requirements meals at all hours sore point obviously still fay said cheerfully ive heard hes going to buy the cock turn it into a new age holiday inn or something she brought her coffee and sat down opposite him if anything he was even more handsome these days it had once been terribly flattering to be courted by guy morrison and unexpectedly painless to become divorced from him ive changed you know fay hardly at all idve said oh looks thats not what its all about never was was it of course not she thought however in your case what else is there to get excited about and youre obviously just as arrogant she said brightly confidence fay he said patiently not arrogance if you dont continually display confidence in this business people think youre a spent force like j m powys something like that i should have held on to you he said softly a frond of blond hair falling appealingly to an eyebrow you kept me balanced i was terribly insecure you know thats why oh for gods sake guy you were never insecure in your life this is me youre giving all this bullshit to lets drop this subject shall we he looked hurt but not very hurt how did you get on yesterday fay asked him to change direction they never managed to pull the wall down did they dont ask guy said meaning ask all went wrong then this was probably the reason guy was here he was in urgent need of consolation ive just been looking at the rushes what youve been back to cardiff no no i sent larry to a video shop in leominster last night to transfer the stuff to vhs so i could whizz through it at the cock when he came back he said youre not going to like this and cleared off quick ive just found out why good grief fay talk about a wasted exercise first theres bloody goff plans a stunt like that and doesnt tell me until its too late to hire a second crew and then but it didnt happen anyway the walls still there i know but i had what ought to have been terrific footage of goff going apeshit on top of the tump when the sound system packed in and the bulldozer chap said he couldnt do it but the light mustve been worse than i thought or larry hadnt done a whitebalance or something he denies that of course but he would wouldnt he what it didnt come out fay whod never worked in television knew next to nothing about the technicalities of it i thought this betacam stuff didnt need much light probably something wrong with the camera larry claims first this big black thing shoots across the frame and then all the colours haywire by god if theres any human error to blame in cardiff somebodys job could be on the line over this but not yours of course said fay hold on a minute guy she was listening to a vague scraping noise its dad he cant get his key in the door fay dashed into the hall closing the kitchen door behind her and opening the front door the canon almost fell over the threshold poking his key at her eye thank god fay caught his arm whispered in his ear come and rescue me dad guys here and hes in a very maudlin mood who he was out of breath guy you remember guy we used to be married once ive got this awful feeling hes working up to asking me to have his baby a blurred film had set across the canons eyes he shook his head stood still a moment breathing hard then straightened up yes he said fay something you need to know take your time tape recorder get your tape recorder his eyes cleared focused theres been an accident a death everybodys talking about it ill tell you where to go therell be no delay the dodman said we start tonight dont you need planning permission powys asked the dodman only smiled as expected hed turned out to be andy boultontrow with a mobile phone and a map in a transparent plastic folder there are six we can put n immediately either on maxs land around the court or on bits of ground hes been able to buy not a bad start youre getting one did you know that thanks a bunch the top of your little acre where it meets the road see andy held out his plasticcovered photocopy of henrys map right there it was a largescale os blowup the former location of each stone was marked by a dot inside a circle and the pencilled initials h k they were standing in crybbes main street just above the police station looking down towards the bridge two of andys dodmen were making their way across carrying white sightingpoles powys asked him how long it had been going on all this planning and surveying and buying up of land months nearly a year all told but its all come to a head very rapidly in some curious way i think henrys death fired max into orbit henrys done the legwork now it was down to max to pull it all together there are more than fifty workmen on the project now stablesll be finished by monday ready for a start on the court itself next week first halfdozen stones in place by tomorrow night thats moving joe no he doesnt piss about does he all that remains is to persuade the remaining few diehards either to sell their land or accept a stone on it hence tuesdays public meeting a formality id guess hell have bought them off by then agents out there now negotiating farmers will do anything these days to stay afloat caravan sites windfarms you name it they take what comes most of them have no choice powys wondered if you could stop people planting a standing stone close to where you lived perhaps diverting some kind of energy through your house how would a court make a ruling on something which had never been proved to exist it seems amazing he said that there were so many stones around here and every single one of thems been ripped out except for one henry found little bent old stone under a hedge do you think they destroyed them because they were superstitious andy shrugged because youd think if they were superstitious theyd have been scared to pull them out wouldnt you people in these parts andy said who knows how their minds work powys looked up the street towards the church tower theres a major ley isnt there coming from the tump through the court then the church right through the town to the hills line one andy held out the plan i was up in the prospect chamber at the court it might have been constructed to sight along that ley might have been you think it was yes i think so andys black beard was making rapid progress concealing the bones of his face you couldnt tell what he was thinking any more john dee powys said john dee was a friend of michael worts right or at least he seems to have known him we know john dee was investigating earth mysteries in the s or thereabouts is it possible dee was educating wort and that they built the prospect chamber as a sort of observatory to observe what i dont know whatever they believed happened along that ley two cars came out of the square at speed one a police car obviously together they passed over the bridge and turned right not far beyond powyss cottage took their time andy observed whats happening body found in the river andy said with disinterest thats why we had to stop work down there they get very excited not many floaters in crybbe yes i think you could be close to it but perhaps it was wort who initiated dee into the secret have you considered that he was a remarkable man you know but suddenly powys was not too concerned about which of them had initiated the other it was quiet again in the street the cars had vanished down a track leading to the riverbank fays fingers were weak and fumbling for the first time she had difficulty working the uhers simple pianokey controls nobody had even covered him up shed expected screens of some kind a police cordon like there always were in cities shed never seen a drowned man before in all his sodden glory nobody had even thrown a coat over him or a blanket theyd simply tossed him on the bank limp and leaking skin blue crimped corrugated eyes wide open dead as a cod on a slab livid tongue poking out of the froth around his lips and nostrils tossed on the bank like somebodys catch gomers catch in this case gomer parry whod found the body was only too happy to give her what he described as an exclusive interview he told her how hed come to check on his bulldozer which was over there in jack preeces field awaiting its removal to the councils brynglas landfill site on monday when hed spotted this thing caught up in branches not far from the bank ed not been in long gomer said knowledgeably several reasons i got for sayin that number one no bloatin takes oh maybe a week for the ole gases to build up inside and then out e comes all blown up like a lifejacket also see point number two if ed been in there long fishes woulder been at im gomer made obscene little pincer movements with clawed fingers and thumb and then pointed into the river no longer in flood but still brown and churning bearing broken branches downstream theyd been frozen to the fringe of a silent group of local people on the wet riverbank they were half a mile from the bridge on the bend before the river moved across the crybbe court land flowing within two hundred yards of the tump current brings em in to the side yere right on the bend see gomer said then they gets entangled in them ole branches and the floodwater goes down and there e is high an dry theyve ad quite a few yere over the years always the same spot gomer sat down on a damp tree stump his back to the body got out a battered square tin and began to roll himself a cigarette nibbled to the bone some of em are he said with unseemly relish so i reckon if i was to put a time on it id say es been in there less than a day fay thought she knew exactly how long hed been in there approximately twenty hours oh god this was dreadful this was indescribably awful her fingers went rapidly up and down with the zip of her blue cagoule now you notice that wrinkling on is face gomer said well see thats what you calls the washerwomans ands effect gomer the colour of sergeant wynford wileys face was approaching magenta as he loomed over the little man in wireframed glasses when your wealth of forensic knowledge is required wynford said we shall send for you meanwhile all this is totally sub joodicee until after the inquest and you should know that he snapped at fay look wynford fay snapped back to beat the tremor out of her voice sub judice applies to court cases not inquests nobodys on trial at an inquest really know how to make friends dont i she thought as wynford bent his face to hers he didnt speak until he was sure he had her full attention then very slowly and explicitly he said we dont like clever people round yere mrs morrison then he straightened up turned his back on her and walked away fat bastard gomer bit on his skinny handcrafted cigarette you got all that what i said yes fay said but hes right i wont be able to use most of it not because its sub judice but because we dont go to town on the gruesome stuff especially when relatives might be listening christ how could she go through the motions of reporting this story knowing what she knew knowing if not exactly how then at least why it had happened there was a little crowd around the body including its father jack preece and its younger brother warren preece jack preeces face was as grey as the clouds he looked up from the corpse very steadily as if he knew what he would see next and the significance of it and what he saw next was fay his tired hopeless brown eyes met hers and held them it was harder to face than a curse she thought he knows everything and she dragged her gaze away and looked wildly around her but there was nobody to run to for comfort and nowhere to hide from jonathon preeces dead eyes and the eyes of his father which held the weight of a sorrow she knew she could only partly comprehend chapter iii not one person had appeared to recognize guy morrison twice today hed circuited this dreary town and nobody had done more than glance at him with he was forced to admit a barely cursory interest guy liked to be recognized he needed to be recognized he was insecure he readily admitted this everyone he knew in television was insecure it was a deeply neurotic business and it was a visual medium so if people started to pass you in the street without a second sidelong glance without nudging their companions then it wouldnt be too long before the programme controller failed to recognize you in the lift altogether a legitimate cause for anxiety and fay had depressed him living like a spinster watching her father coming unravelled in the kind of conditions guy remembered from his childhood remembered only in black and white like grainy old line television he couldnt understand why fay had failed to throw herself at him sobbing take me away from all this instead of bustling off with her uher over her shoulder in pursuit of a local news item that would be unlikely to make even a fillerparagraph in tomorrows sunday papers guy rather than attempt to construct a conversation with the canon had claimed to be overdue for another appointment and thus had ended up making his second despondent tour the town centre country towns were not supposed to be like this country towns were supposed to have teashops and flower stalls and saturday markets from which fat friendly womens institute ladies sold jars of homemade jam and chutney sealed by greaseproof paper and rubber bands without a crew without catrin and her clipboard and without even a hint of recognition from the public guy felt a sudden sense of acute isolation hed never been anywhere quite like this before a town which seemed to have had all the life sucked out of it bloodless people walking past sagging like puppets whose strings had been snipped he was almost inclined to cancel his room at the cock and race back home to cardiff instead in the gloomy lateafternoon as it began to rain again he found himself strolling incuriously into the gallery where he and jocasta newsome would soon recognize a mutual need outside powys had found some logs for the jotul stove they were damp but he managed to get the stove going and stacked a couple of dozen logs on each side of it to dry out he couldnt remember bleaker weather at the end of june his cases stood unpacked by the window on the ledge a blank sheet of a paper was wound into the olivetti life itself seemed very temporary tonight just before seven a grimfaced rachel arrived barbour awash she tossed the dripping coat on the floor coffee jm i need coffee with something in it she collapsed on to the hard orange sofa flung her head back closing her eyes i suppose youve heard powys said they found a body in the river rachel said what are you going to do jm do they know what happened i dont think so they havent questioned anyone except the father and gomer parry powys went into the little kitchen to look for coffee and called back have they found the gun not so far as i know rachel said perhaps jonathon preece didnt find it either perhaps the place where you threw it was deeper than you thought humble who seems to know what hes talking about says there are all kinds of unexpected potholes in the riverbed he says nobody in their right mind would attempt to wade across even in a dry summer when the water levels low humble powyss voice had an edge of panic he volunteered the information in passing i wasnt stupid enough to ask him i feigned disinterest not a difficult act he accepted for rachel he returned with two mugs and a bottle of bells whisky i cant find any coffee but i found this in a cupboard he poured whisky into a mug and handed it to rachel cant find any glasses either rachel drank deeply and didnt cough or choke powys said what do you think i ought to do rachel held the mug in both hands and stretched out her long legs to the stove in a vain quest for heat i think we should wait for fay shes going to come here after shes filed her scrupulously objective story about the drowning tragedy at crybbe that wont be easy whats she going to say it seems said rachel that minor flooding at crybbe has claimed its first victim she looked tired there were dark smudges on her narrow face just hope they dont find the gun i dont know what water does to fingerprints do you as the second stroke of the curlew hit the reverberation of the first clean and hard warren preece tossed his used durex wellfilled into the alley and zipped up his jeans close he said but i reckon i can improve on it if i puts my mind to it tessa byford was leaning back against the brick wall of the crybbe unattended studio still panting a little youre confident tonight yeah the trick hed learned hed learned it from tessa but hed allowed himself to forget this was to time it so you came in the split second before the bell crashed tonight hed lost his load a good five seconds before the first bong still near as buggery took the top of his head off though always did there but it could be better warren got a special kick out of thinking of his old man up the tower waiting to pull on the rope while he warren was in town here bonking his brains out dead on time again tonight nothing would come between jack preece and that bell not even his favourite son drying out in some police morgue ask not warren intoned for whom the ole bell tolls it tolls tonight ladies and gentlemen for jonathon preece of crybbe he giggled there was a snap of white tessa pulling up her knickers warren said i been feelin just lately like as im the only guy in this town the only one whos really alive sorter thing the only walkin corpse in the graveyard bleeargh warren wiggled his hands and rolled his eyes written two new songs he had in the past couple of days r edhot stuff too didnt know he had it in him how much he had in him he reckoned max golfs tape would be ready in a couple of weeks goff was going to be real blown away by his next one what would you have done warren if that woman hadnt come out of the studio before we got started or if shed come out in the middle woulda made no difference or i coulda saved some for er couldnt i takin a chance she is comin yere this time a night an she wouldnt say a word see cause i seen what appened by the river ow they killed poor jonathon poor jonathon warren started to grin oh you shouldve seen im tess lying there with is tongue out just about as wet and slimy as what e was when e was alive i couldnt ardly keep a straight face and you got to laugh see fuckin young farmers warren did laugh he placed both hands flat on the brick wall and almost beat his head into it with laughing fuckin young farmers needs a new chairman now isnt it oh shit what a bloody crisis you going to volunteer warren no warren wiped his streaming eyes with the back of a hand im goin into the plant hire business he went into another cackle im gonna hotwire me a bulldozer she was the kind of woman who in normal circumstances he would have taken care to avoid like sunstroke she was vain pretentious snobbish and too bony in the places where one needed it least but these were not normal circumstances on a wet saturday evening in crybbe jocasta newsome was almost exotic guy had her on the hearthrug where damp logs spat the occasional spark into his buttocks she was tasty and grateful guy loved people to be grateful for him she was voracious in a carefree sort of way as if all kinds of pentup emotions were being expelled she laughed a lot he made her laugh even with comments and questions that were not intended to be funny like and your husband is he an artist jocasta squealed in delight and ground a pelvic bone fully into his stomach guy said just checking youre sure theres no chance hell be back tonight tonight said jocasta hereward will be in one of those awful restaurants where the candles on the tables are stuck in winebottles and some unshaven student is hunched up in the corner fumbling with a guitar hell be holding forth at length to a bunch of artists about the beauty of crybbe and how well in he is with the local yokels hell be telling them all about his close friend max goff and the wonderful experiment in which he hereward is playing a pivotal role the artists will drink bottle after bottle of disgusting plonk paid for of course by hereward and theyll think what a sucker what an absolutely godsent wally and theyll be mentally doubling their prices jocasta propped herself up on one arm her nipples rather redder than the feebly smouldering logs in the grate oh yes she assured him we are utterly alone and likely to remain so for two whole wonderful days how long have you got guy inches and inches if im any judge oh my god what am i saying i must be demob happy the thought of two whole days of jocasta newsome didnt lift guy to quite the same heights he reached for his trousers dismay disfigured her what are you doing i didnt mean just going to the loo if you could direct me guy morrison never goes anywhere without trousers not the kind of risk one takes oh jocasta relaxed yes were having a downstairs cloakroom made but it isnt quite up the stairs turn left and theres a bathroom directly facing you at the end of the passage dont be long will you thankfully she didnt qualify the final entreaty with another dreadful double entendre guy slithered into his trousers and set off barefoot up the stairs slightly worried now happily married women were fine unhappily married women were worse than unattached women they clutched you as if you were a lifebelt they were seldom afraid of word getting out about you and them and while it might be all right for pop stars scandal was rarely helpful to the careers of responsible producerpresenters in features and documentaries barechested on the stairs he shivered the walls had been stripped to the stonework too rugged for guy morrison he probably wouldnt come here again he decided hed open the exhibition tomorrow night and slide quietly away a onenight stand was ok but a twonight stand carried just a hint of commitment the lights went out oh blast he heard from the drawingroom whats happened power cut jocasta shouted happens all the time take it slowly and youll be ok when you get to the bathroom youll find a torch on top of the cabinet guy stubbed his toe on the top banisterpost and tried not to cry out but he found his way to the bathroom quite easily because of a certain greasy phosphorescence oozing out of the crack between the door and its frame funny sort of power cut he said not thinking at all police say there are no suspicious circumstances but they still cant explain how mr preece whose family has been farming in the area for over four hundred years came to be in the river that report the offas dyke newsreader said from fay morrison in crybbe now sport and for hereford united fay switched off powyss radio it was thirtythree minutes past ten and almost totally dark mustve been awkward for you j m powys rammed a freshly dried log into the jotul and slammed the iron door on it fay in a black sweatsuit was crosslegged on the hearth by the stove not really she said in cases like this youre not expected to probe too hard if it had been a child id be spending most of the night talking to worried mothers about why the council needed to fence off the river then tomorrow this being crybbe id have to explain to ashpole why the worried mothers were refusing to be interviewed on tape but in a case like this its just assumed he killed himself be an open verdict unless unless they find the gun powys switched on a greenshaded tablelamp rachel drew the curtains against the night and the rain and the river fay said if anybody had any suspicions wed have heard from the police by now all the same jack preece his father powys said yes jack preece knows i could see it in his eyes when we were down by the river with the body knows what i think he knows jonathon had gone out to shoot arnold rachel sat down on the sofa what makes you just a minute hang on powys stood up you say jonathon had gone out to shoot arnold youre saying hed deliberately targeted arnold fay nodded do i get the feeling theres a history to this fay swallowed if i tell you this youre going to switch to small talk for a few minutes and then look for an excuse to get rid of me its so weird fay powys spread his arms im the bloke who wrote the old golden land nothings too weird there was a longish silence then the greenshaded tablelamp went out bugger rachel said ok fay said slowly you cant see my face now and i wont be able to see the incredulity on yours she took a long breath she told them about dogs in crybbe how long have you known this powys asked only a day or so i should be doing a story on it shouldnt i a town with no dogs jesus its not common is it but life here is so much like a bad dream im sure if i sold it to the papers when all the reporters arrived to check it out thered be dogs everywhere shelves full of chum at the grocers poopscoops at the ironmongers posters for the crybbe and district annual dog show she was glad they couldnt see the helpless tears in her eyes i cant trust myself here fay said fighting to keep the tears out of her voice i cant trust myself to perceive anything correctly too much has happened have you thought about why it could be powys asked a soft accepting voice in the darkness why no dogs sure ive thought about it in between thinking about my dad going bonkers about holding on to my job about somebody breaking in and smashing up my tapemachine about being arrested for manslaughter about living with a gho about tons of things im sorry im not very rational tonight so what youre saying is rachels very rational voice that because you wouldnt get rid of arnold jonathon preece deliberately set out to shoot him i had a phone call an anonymous call get rid of him this weekend or or hed be shot there was no specified threat just a warning i think jack preece was the caller therefore it seems likely he sent jonathon out with the gun she heard powys fumbling with the stove and its iron door was flung wide letting a stuttering red and yellow firelight into the room his face looked much younger in the firelight if this is right about no dogs im sorry fay if you say there are no dogs i believe you we could be looking at the key to something here youre the expert fay said there arent any experts this is the one area in which nobodys an expert if all dogs howl at the curfew rachel said logically why dont they just get rid of the curfew its not as if its a major tourist attraction not as if they even draw attention to it it just happens its just continued without much being said ok theres this story about the legacy of land to the preeces but is anybody really going to take that away if the curfew stops i dont think for one minute said powys that thats the real reason for the curfew fay sat up interested so what is the real reason if we knew that wed know the secret of crybbe you think theres something to know you think theres good reason why the place is as miserable as sin theres something fay how did you come to get henrys dog i mean did you know him well hardly at all id done an interview with him on the day he died thats interesting what sort of an interview what was it about er dowsing i wanted to know what he was doing in crybbe but it was obvious he didnt want to talk about that so anyway it was never used have you still got the tape i imagine so if you want to hear it come down to the studio sometime up the covered alley behind the cock tomorrow morning nine oclock fine and about arnold i got him from the police because it was obvious nobody else was going to he was howling away in full daylight and im pretty sure now that if i hadnt taken him hed have been dead theyd have killed him before nightfall before the curfew the torchlight shone in jocastas eyes its me guy said look yes i know come here im cold i havent been said guy i couldnt go i dont understand youve got the torch jocasta guy hissed urgently closing the drawingroom door quietly behind him for christs sake why didnt you tell me we werent alone jocasta felt very cold she began to tremble crawled to the aga and scrabbled for her dress who is he guy demanded she couldnt see him only the torch is he your father jocasta tried to speak and couldnt she tried to stand up tried to step into her dress got her legs tangled fell back on the rug i waited guy said but he didnt come out jocasta squatting on the rug in the torch circle struggled vainly to zip up her dress no eager fingers to help her now what the hells going on jocasta she found her voice but didnt recognize it my father she said slowly is in chiswick my husband hereward is somewhere in somerset there is nobody here nobody here but us guy a log shifted in the grate sending up a yellow sparkshower like a cheap firework then who the fuck was that old man in the bathroom having a shave for crying out loud with a with a his voice faltered with a cutthroat razor the improbability of the scenario seemed to occur to him at last how could i see him how could i see him when all the lights guys voice went quiet he was a strange kind of yellow he said unsteadily a very feeble shade of yellow the torchlight wavered as he advanced on the sofa where are my clothes im getting out of here no jocasta leapt at him clutching the arm which held the torch he dropped it it lay on the floor its beam directed into the fireplace the logs looked dead and grey in the strong white light dont go jocasta implored you cant go you cant leave me for gods sake dont leave me here with with chapter iv the following morning sunday just before am there was a sudden burst of sunlight a splash of dripping yellow in a washedout watercolour sky the light looked to be directly over the tump the trees on its sides and summit massing menacingly around the watery orb it was rachel thought as if a greengloved hand had reached out from the foliage snatched the emergent sun and crunched it like an egg i think we should call the police she said why said humble whoever done it saved us a job the tump squatted under the sun fat and smug you could almost think the tump was the culprit as if the great mound had taken a deep breath pulled in its girth and then let go bellying out and crumbling the wall before it then rachel had seen the bulldozer still wedged in the rubble and theres gomer parry she said whats he going to say proves him wrong dunnit he reckoned the machine wouldnt go through the wall without the wall collapsing on it which it has a chunk of wall about fifteen feet wide had been smashed in or wrenched out and then the bulldozer plunged in again clearly an amateur job but the spot had been wellchosen it would leave a jagged gap directly under the huge picture window in the stableblock all we do about gomer we just pay him off humble said he was unshaven he wore a black motorcycle jacket half an hour ago hed rung j m powyss riverside cottage put rachel on shed been quite shocked didnt see how he could possibly have known about her and jm it meant max would know by now max would not be particularly annoyed that she was with j m powys but shed done it without clearing it with him first that was the serious offence time to move on rachel decided abruptly the facades crumbling time to negotiate a settlement i think the bulldozers damaged she said look at the way the bladething is twisted couple of thou should see gomer right see rachel you bring in the old bill youre causing unnecessary hassle some f body might get the idea we paid him to do it max would not like that him you sound as if you know who did it yeah well i got my suspicions would you like to share them i keep my eyes open humble said not much you dont know is there humble humble smirked not much rachel not much the metal plate on the door said when red light is showing do not attempt to enter the red light was on not sure what to do powys walked around the dull brick building which had once been a lavatory when he arrived back at the door he was holding up a foot oh shit whats this making a face powys scraped off the used condom against a corner of the wall she was watching him in some amusement from the studio door open now the red light still on sorry should have warned you youll never pick up a dog turd in this town but french letters an alltoocommon hazard especially just here powys looked around and counted five of the things shrivelling into the gravel favourite place fay said the grunts and squeals can be quite disconcerting when you arrive here in the dark maybe its the red light gets them going powys looked up at the sign do not attempt to enter obviously nobody takes much notice of that come in said fay he followed her into the little building and looked around incredible a radio studio in crybbe geographically convenient fay was unpacking two reels of quarterinch tape its certainly not a reflection of the importance of the town she set the tape rolling i wont waste time this is one bit henry kettles dowsing masterclass ok here we go is there any fucking hell henry caught you by surprise did it powys grinned bit like sex isnt it the first time did the earth move for you certainly did when he put his hands over mine the rod just sort of flipped over i did wonder afterwards if he was making it happen just go get it over with get me off his back he was obviously very busy but i can be quite persistent i suppose he thought she probably could she looked very nice this morning in a dark skin and a glittery kind of top she noticed him studying the ensemble im going to church afterwards pushing the buttons on the tapemachine and flipping the controls on the console then ive got to go and pick up arnold from the vets hes ok actually the vet said on the phone that i might get a bit of a shock when i saw him but there was nothing to worry about have you ever been inside the church he shook his head but youre a regular churchgoer i suppose with your dad in the business oh hell nothing to do with that and im not actually what it is dad tells me murray thats the vicar is doing his sermon on the new age phenomenon in our midst ill probably get a story out of it murrays a very mixedup person the towns damaged him i think you think this town damages people its damaged me said fay listen this is the bit obviously what i was really interested in was what henry kettle was doing for goff and at one point i asked him straight out so tell me henry youre obviously in the middle of a major dowsing operation here in crybbe what exactly does that involve oh i oh dear look switch that thing off a minute will you he was waving his arms about the way people do when you ask them a question they cant answer and did you switch off i did im afraid fay said sometimes you flip the pause button a couple of times to make it look as if you have and then record the lot but i was starting to like him dont press me girl he kept saying did he say anything to indicate he was bothered or upset by what he was finding i think he did and it must be on the other tape fay spun all the way back and pulled the reel off the deck hold this a minute would you er sorry i dont actually know what the jm stands for joe joe powys mmm its a whole different person now joe powys some answers she had her fists on her hips the second reel clutched in one who killed henry kettle ah he said you dont think it was an accident at all do you well he said i dont think its who killed him so much as what killed him im sure nobody tampered with his brakes or anything so you think it might be something shall we say supernatural and dont say it depends what i mean by supernatural how about you put the tape on then well talk about it and you went to see mrs seagrove again didnt you we loonies have to stick together so you did go to talk about the black dog ok ok ill put the tape on she dragged the yellow leader tape past the heads set it running on fast forward stopped it somewhere around here i think id caught up with henry in the wood between the court and the church id come straight from another job and i still had about half a tape left so i just ran it off walking along with henry when youre putting a package together you need lots of spare atmos and stuff atmos ambient sounds birdsong wind in the trees also i needed bits of him trudging along doing his dowsing bit radios nearly as much of a fake as telly you reshape it afterwards rearrange sentences manufacture pauses for effect in using spare ambience so heres henry in the wood i hope thats curious that is curious thats it hang on a minute joe ill find the start ok here we go keep you a minute fay just something i need to look at bear with me thats ok mr kettle can i call you henry during the interview makes it more informal you please yourself girl call me a daft old bugger if you like powys felt almost tearful every time someone like henry died the world faded a shade further into neutral well bugger dont mind me fay talking to myself thats curious that is curious if i didnt know better id almost be inclined to think it wasnt an old stone at all funny old business just when you think youve come across everything you find something that dont quite add up come on then fay lets do your bit of radio only well go somewhere else if you dont mind powys said can you just play that bit again almost be inclined to think it wasnt an old stone at all thats the bit there was a parallel here something from henrys journal fay where was this can you show me have you time before church well have to be a bit quick joe fay said rewinding murray beech watched his sermon rolling out of the printer with barely an hour to go before the service normally he worked at least three weeks in advance storing the sermons on computer disk this one had been completed only last night at great personal risk murray had twice lost entire scripts due to power cuts but the electricity rarely failed in the morning and the printer whizzed it out without interruption certain claims have already been made for the effects of this socalled new awakening why am i doing this he asked himself because its what they want to hear he answered shamefully never imagined it would come to this what harm were they causing these innocent cranks with their leylines and their healing rays ironically murray had come to crybbe aware of the need for tolerance with country folk their local customs their herbal remedies but it had proved to be a myth country people real country people werent like this not in crybbe anyway where hed never been offered a herbal remedy or even a pot of homemade jam and where the only custom was the curfew an unsmiling ritual performed without comment on a metal bookshelf sat the threevolume set of kilverts diary given to him by kirsty when he told her he was leaving brighton to become a vicar in the border country just like kilvert shed been thrilled hed never heard of kilvert so shed bought him the collected diaries the record expressively written if you liked that sort of thing of a young victorian clergymans life mainly in the village of gyro about twenty miles from crybbe kilvert had found rich colours in nature and in the people around him hed also found warmth and friends even if he did have a rather disturbing predilection for young girls murrays stomach tightened he was thinking of darkeyed tessa a sweat dab over her lips loneliness loneliness had brought him to this ive no friends here kirsty had spent a week in crybbe long enough to convince her this was not the border country beloved of francis kilvert you once said youd follow me anywhere my calling took me africa south america but not crybbe murray id die id wither shed given him kilverts diary for his birthday two years ago exactly two years ago today was his birthday is there no chance of your finding a living down here murray his mother had asked this morning on the phone theyd been proud of course as he had when hed been given crybbe such a large parish such a young man nobody else wanted it no homemade jam no womens institute no welcome at the primary school no harvestsupper no bellringers no friends no wife he could of course have betrayed the inert moribund villagers by siding openly with the new age community who at least sought some kind of spirituality albeit misguided he could perhaps have made friends of a sort amongst them but he knew his role as priest was to support his parishioners even if they did not support him apart from token mute appearance at his services even if they did not deserve him murray was disgusted with himself for thinking that loneliness loneliness had brought him to this the only way either of them knew into the wood was through the court grounds when they arrived there in fays fiesta rachel was outside the stables with one of the interior designers a small completely bald man she introduced as simon what this place is about simon was saying is drama drama and spectacle powys didnt even have to go inside to see what he meant the original stable doors had been replaced with huge portals of plateglass through which you could look down into a kind of theatre the kitchen and diningroom walled off from a single cavernous room the length of the building ending in a wide wooden desk its back to the huge picturewindow and the tump when max was sitting at his desk he would be directly under the mound from the top of the room it would look as if the great tumulus with its wavy trees was growing out of his head especially now that what happened to the wall rachel grimaced person or persons unknown came in the night to do max a big favour using gomer parrys bulldozer im sure humble knows who it was he tends to be out there in the small hours killing things but humble isnt saying the attack on the wall the opening up of the stableblock with glass at either end the formation of a conduit between the tump and crybbe powys looked at it through goffs eyes a stream of healing energy deep blue surging through the stables through the court itself through the wood to the church and then into the town equally though you could see the tump as a huge malignant tumour assisted at last to spread its black cells and bring secondary cancers to crybbe a town already old and mouldering natural drama simon the designer said great in the centre of the wood was a huge hole newly dug around five feet deep must be destined for a big one powys said and theyre making sure its going to be visible fay looked around in horror there was a bit of a clearing when i was here with henry but nothing nothing like this the immediate area was strewn with chainsaw carnage stumps of slaughtered trees heaps of wet ash where branches had been burned looking back the way theyd come powys could see the roof of the court i reckon most of this woods going to disappear they want to open up the view from the prospect chamber reconnect the town with the court and the tump but you cant just chop down a whole wood fay glared at rachel who backed off holding up both hands listen i know nothing about this this is boultontrows province arent trees like this protected i should imagine so said rachel but its hardly an imprisonable offence you can take out injunctions to prevent people chopping down individual trees but once theyre gone theyre gone and if you do it quietly well like starting from the middle and working outwards powys said i dont know how old this wood is but the indication from the prospect chamber is that at the end of the sixteenth century it wasnt here at all i reckon it was planted not to give the court more privacy but so the townsfolk couldnt see the court so they could pretend it wasnt there just as the stableblock was put in to block the court off from the tump they were scared of something he was balancing on the edge of the hole looking down so fay this is where henry discovered thered been a stone i think so must be and yet he had the feeling the stone that stood here wasnt an old stone thats what he seemed to be saying fay was more concerned about the wholesale destruction of the wood and they are supposed to be bloody new age people she peered through what remained of the trees can i get to the church this way sure rachel said five minutes walk theres a footpath newly widened goes past a redbrick heap called keeper cottage which is where boultontrows living he lives here powys said surprised in the wood yes and rather him than me go past it anyway fay and youre in the churchyard in no time thanks fay pulled a bunch of keys from her bag do me a favour joe ive got to catch murrays blasted sermon could you bring my car round to the church when youve finished here its got the uher in the back ill need to interview him afterwards she vanished into the bushes like an elf he thought i came to a decision this morning rachel said she sat down on a tree stump im going to quit good i mean thats terrific youre wasted on that fat plonker im becoming peripheral anyway max doesnt listen to me any more hes getting so fanatical i dont think theres anything you or i can do to stop him also hes entering one of his dc phases hes besotted with boultontrow andy is it reciprocated you know the guy better than me jm hes an opportunist there you are then he watched her pale and graceful in this arboreal charnel house she brushed a stray hair out of one eye he said when will you tell him probably after his public meeting on tuesday thats marvellous rachel you wont regret it coming to church rachel stood up oh gosh far too busy least i can do is make sure his stableblocks ready for him besides im not a churchy person im one of those who thinks its a waste of a sunday what do you call that an atheist or an agnostic he put an arm around her waist you call it a smug bitch he grinned happy for her chapter v and lets pray now murray beech said head bowed for the soul of our brother jonathon preece kneeling in a back pew fay tensed taken so suddenly from the heart of the agricultural community he served so energetically those of us who knew jonathon and can there be any here who did not will always remember his tireless commitment to the young farmers movement and through this to the revival of an industry in which his family has laboured for over four hundred years powys slid the uher into the empty pew next to fay and stepped in after it fay kept on looking directly ahead over the prayerbook ledge seeing near the front of the church the heads of jack preece and jimmy preece one of the few places you ever saw these heads uncapped and we pray too murray intoned passionlessly for the preece family in its time of sorrow and loss fay saw young warren preece head nodding rhythmically now and then as if connected to some invisible walkman saw mrs preece jimmys wife hands clasped in prayer expecting to see a damp tissue crumpled in her palm but mrs preece seen sideon looked as dryeyed and stern as her husband they seemed to have their eyes open as they prayed if indeed they were praying looking around fay found that evenones were open everyone she could see crybbe a place where emotions were buried as deep as the dead wisely perhaps murray didnt make a big deal of it he went into the lords prayer and didnt mention jonathon preece again fay relaxed what had she expected a denunciation from the pulpit all heads turned in mute accusation whatever she breathed again and became aware of the significance of something she must surely have noticed already the presence of her father on the end of a pew two rows in front of her and powys the canon went to church every sunday sometimes attending both the morning and evening services he sat near the front and sang loudly bit of moral support for young murray boy needs all the backup he can get so what was he doing further back a couple of rows behind the nearest fully occupied pew could it be something to do with there being only one other person on alexs pew and the person being at the same end of the pew as alex and being a woman bloody hell said fay to herself hes found a totty guy morrison woke up into the greyness of am he found his watch on the bedside table it told him the time was for crying out loud he turned over and found he was alone in a kingsize bed of antique pine in a pinkwashed room with large beams in the ceiling and a view through small square panes of misty hills hed never seen this view before guy lay down again regulating his breathing he saw a door then and a glimpse of mauve tiles told him it led to an en suite bathroom which put him in mind of another bathroom full of seeping yellow with a momentary clenching of stomach muscles everything came back he remembered peeing on his shoes in the dark paddock because she wouldnt let him return to that bathroom not that he needed much persuading he remembered them staying in the kitchen for a long time drinking coffee him not talking much and not listening much either after shed been gushing like a broken firehydrant for an hour or so until it was nearly light and shed decided it was safe to go to bed this bed he remembered waking up periodically to find her hanging on to him in her fitful unquiet sleep and wondering how he could ever have found her so attractive guy pushed back the duvet to find he was naked and he couldnt see his clothes anywhere if he went downstairs like this it would be just his luck to find the vicar and the entire bloody womens institute having morning coffee in the drawingroom he went into the en suite bathroom looked at himself in the mirror and was horrified at the state of his hair and the growth of his beard detecting a distressing amount of grey and white stubble he looked around for something to shave with normally he used a stateoftheart rechargeable twice a day and could find only a primitive kind of safely razor remembering at this point the old man with the cutthroat razor in the other bathroom and hours later in the welllit kitchen thrusting aside his fourth cup of coffee asking her directly are you telling me it was a ghost hed once done a documentary about ghosts they were the programme had suggested natures holograms something like that you might get images of the dead you could just as easily have images of the living when the phenomenon was eventually understood it would be no more frightening than a mirage this one was frightening he supposed only briefly in retrospect what had he really felt when he saw the glow around the door and then walked into the bathroom and the old man had looked up and met his eyes fear or a kind of fascination did this old man have eyes he must have had guy couldnt recall his features only a figure bent over the washbasin shaving the image perhaps of a man who had lived in this house for many years and perhaps shaved thousands of times in that very basin well perhaps not that actual basin but certainly in the room and this mundane everyday ritual had imprinted itself on the atmosphere the apparition was frightening guy decided because it happened at night during a power cut also because he feeling a few misgivings about what hed got himself into a was perhaps a little jittery anyway guy shaved with the razor his first wetshave in years and cut himself twice quite noticeably no piecestocamera for him for a couple of days perhaps this chap didnt have an electric shaver because he couldnt rely on one with all the power cuts they apparently had jocasta had gone on and on last night about the power cuts and the exorbitant electricity bills how living in the country wasnt a simple life at all and certainly not cheap how she couldnt get out of here fast enough how her poor husband was weak and naive beyond comprehension guy didnt like the sound of that bit at all much preferred screwing happily married women whose only need was a touch of glamour in their lives the true horror of the night now he thought about it had been the hours hed spent with a furrowedfaced jocasta in the kitchen afterwards listening to her whingeing on and on guy where are you he looked around the bathroom door and saw her standing by the bed she wore a floorlength japanese silk dressinggown and fresh makeup facade fully restored she must have spent an hour or so in here before he was awake good morning jocasta guy stepped naked and smiling into the bedroom forgetting about the two cuts on his face staunched by small pieces of soft toilet tissue perhaps perhaps he could afford to give her just one more but she didnt look at him in any meaningful way please get dressed jocasta said crisply i want to show you something guys smile vanished your clothes are in bedroom two across the passage coffee and croissants in ten minutes and jocasta swished away leaving him most offended women did not turn their backs and swish away from guy morrison when he arrived in the kitchen nearly twenty minutes later he was fully dressed right up to his olive leather jacket and fully aware again of who he was he accepted coffee but declined a croissant he must he said be off perhaps she would give him a time for the exhibition opening keeping it as light as possible because he had quite a few people to see jocasta pushed a large folder towards him across the kitchen table id be glad she said if you could take a look at these look i am rather pushed it wont take a minute she was very composed this morning probably embarrassed as hell about last nights tearful sequence he opened the folder in a deliberately cursory fashion what the hell was all this about was he expected to buy something the drawing was penandink the face was inspecting itself in a mirror every wrinkle on the face and there were many was deeply etched the eyes were sunken the cheeks hollow the nose bulbous guy inhaled sharply he looked up at jocasta in her japanese dressinggown could tell she was working hard to hide her feelings holding a mask over her anticipation anticipation and something else something altogether less healthy he looked down at the drawing again he felt a deep suspicion and a growing alarm is this some son of joke is it him jocasta asked i dont know what you mean who did these is it him of course it was him it was either him or guy was going mad his deep suspicion was suddenly drenched in cold confusion and a bitter acrid dread look at the next one all the sensation had left his fingers he watched them as if they were someone elses fingers lifting the first drawing laying it to one side facedown on the table he didnt understand a moment earlier he saw the old man had slashed his throat the open razor had fallen from one spasmed hand it was drawn in midair floating a fraction of an inch below a finger and thumb while the fingers of the other hand we pushing into the opened throat itself as if trying to hold the slit tubes together to block the tunnels of blood the blood was black ink blotch upon blotch spread joyously as if the pen nib was a substitute for the cut throat razor guy thrust the drawing aside came raggedly to his feet he stumbled to the sink and threw up what seemed like half a gallon of sour coffee it was not the drawing he thought as he retched it was the knowledge of what if hed stayed a moment longer in the bathroom last night he would have seen he wiped his mouth with the back of a hand saw jocasta watching him in distaste knew exactly what she was thinking that perhaps all men were as pathetic as her husband im sorry guy said he washed his hands and his face snatched a handful of kitchen towel to wipe them no dammit he wasnt sorry at all i think you owe me an explanation he said coldly murray beech leaned out of his pulpit hands gripping its edges as if he were sitting up in the bath and what he demanded is this socalled new age can there be any true meaning in a concept quite so vague he paused the new age he said heavily he glared out into the church latemedieval and not much altered some of you may remember a popular song this is the dawning of the age of aquarius hes going to knock it then powys whispered to fay well of course hes going to knock it fay said out of the side of her mouth thats why im here the uher sat on the pew at her side its spools turning the microphone wedged between two prayer books on the ledge she was recording the sermon for her own reference she wouldnt get anything of broadcast quality at this range and she hadnt got permission anyway shed talk to him on tape afterwards throw his own words back at him and see how he reacted harmony and understanding murray quoted sympathy and trust abounding alien concepts in crybbe fay thought cynically the vicars words must be settling on this comatose congregation with all the weight of ashflakes from a distant bonfire caught in white light from a small gothic window set high in the nave murray beech lightbrown hair slicked flat metallic features firmly set was looking about fifteen years older than his age a man with problems fays dad shuffled and coughed he didnt know she was there who was this woman then slim and smallboned she wore a widebrimmed brown felt hat which concealed her hair and neck the vicar announced there would be a public meeting in crybbe on tuesday night when the members of this congregation would be asked to consider the merits of the new age movement and decide to what extent they would allow it to infiltrate their lives now he had no wish to condemn the obviously sincere people who offered what appeared to be rather scenic shortcuts to their own idea of heaven indeed it might be argued that any kind of spirituality was better than none at all the canon coughed again the woman next to him was very still almost almost too still we have a choice said murray we can pray for the strength and the will to confront the reality of a world defiled by starvation injustice and inequality a world crying out for basic christian charity or he said with the smallest twist of his lips we can sidestep reality and amuse ourselves in what we might call the cosmic fairground everyone alive moved a little fay thought watching the woman even sleeping people moved no not here you cant follow him here not into church murray hauled himself further up in his pulpit raised his voice how appealing how appealing it must seem to live in a little world where if were sick we can pass off the health services and the medical advances of the past hundred years as irrelevant and call instead upon the power of healing crystals powys smiled but fay had stiffened feeling the tiny hairs rising on her bare arms her fathers face was turned towards the pulpit he had never glanced at the woman by his side fay thought i can see her but can he a little world where if we feel we are suffering a certain starvation of the soul we need not give up our sunday mornings to come to church because all we need to do is to go for a stroll along the nearest ley line and expose ourselves to these famous cosmic rays fay heard him as if from afar she was looking at her father and at the woman neat smallboned widebrimmed hat concealing her hair and neck and unnaturally still the church was darkening around fay the muted colours had drained out of the congregation everything was black and white and grey nobody moved murray beech flickering like an ancient movie black and white in his surplice was gesturing in the pulpit but she couldnt hear him any more she stared hard projecting her fear and surprised at its strength her uncontrollable resentment until she felt herself lifting from the pew aware of a sudden concern in the eyes of joe powys his hand reaching out for her from a long long way away but not touching fay rising on a malign wave while at the same time very slowly the woman sitting next to her father began for the first time to move began very slowly to turn her head and fay was suddenly up on her feet in the silent church shrieking aloud how dare you get out how dare you come in here gripping the prayerbook shelf so hard that it creaked why fay screamed why cant you just get on with your death and leave him alone then everybody was turning round but fay was out of the church door and running chapter vi when the mercedes estate carrying simon and his three young assistants had vanished into the lane rachel watched andy boultontrow stripped to the waist supervising the loading of three long stones into the back of a truck there was a small digger m the back too one of those you could hire to landscape your own garden last ones andy said jibbing a thumb at the stones hed acquired very rapidly an impressive black beard somehow hardening his narrow jaw rachel said the others are in the ones that are safe to put in without arousing complaints from the landowners weve got a nice one here for your friend joe he didnt she noticed put any kind of stress on the words your friend and then im pushing off for a day or two andy said stretching is max aware of this i really dont know rachel she wondered if perhaps he was pushing off somewhere with max a very heavy guy max had said once he knows all the options whereas jm had implied that while andy knew as much about earth mysteries as anybody could reasonably be expected to it was unwise to trust him too far he takes risks especially when the potential fall guy is someone else the implication being that he j m powys had once been the fallguy one day away from here he would tell her about this whats going on over there rachel had seen a cluster of men emerging from the rear entrance of the court two of them carried a rotting plank which they hurled on a heap of rubbish in a corner of the courtyard big cleanout andy said before the renovation proper begins all the junk from upstairs the detritus of the various attempts to modernize the court anything not in period has to go didnt max tell you i think he mentioned something rachel said uncomfortably he hadnt of course increasingly things had been happening around her without any kind of consultation like the appropriation of gomer parrys bulldozer in the night max liked to live dangerously she didnt she was deeply glad to be leaving his employ make a good bonfire andy boultontrow said nodding at the pile of rubbish maybe we should organize one for lammas or something a cleansing he stretched his lithe body into the truck have fun he said powys raced out of the church clutching the uher by its strap shed left it there on the pew still recording with a motor hum and a hiss of turning spools he scanned the churchyard but she was gone he ran to the gate looked both ways thought he could hear running footsteps but there was nobody in sight he glanced over his shoulder and saw a whitebearded dogcollared old man in the church entrance also looking from side to side her father both of them looking for fay powys stabbed vaguely at the uhers pianokey controls until the hum and hiss ceased with a final whirr then he slung the machine over his shoulder stuck the microphone in his pocket and set off towards bell street or would she have gone to the studio making an outburst in church was a clear sign of instability people who made outbursts in church were usually basketcases except in crybbe leaping up and screaming powys thought was surely a perfectly natural reaction to the miasma of almostanaesthetized disinterest emanating from that congregation bloody weird though what shed said why cant you just get on with your death and leave him alone bloody weird as he came to the corner of bell street he almost lost a foot to a familiar red ford fiesta shrieking round the corner in low gear crunching over the kerb the driver saw him and the fiesta squeaked and stalled the passenger door flew open and bumped the uher and the driver called out get in powys climbed in and sat with the uher on his knee you left this in the church he said thanks fay started the engine and the car spurted into the square your father fuck my father she snapped and she didnt speak again until they passed the town boundary and there were open hills all around and a rush of cold air through the side windows the glass on both sides wound down to its limits fay breathed out hard and thrust her small body back into the seat the fiesta going like a rocket down a lane originally created for horses got to be something awry she said remotely when the most newsworthy item on the tape is the reporter having hysterics powys said whens visiting time at the vets then she turned towards him you want to come ive got a choice watch the road for christs sake she said you want me to talk about it i suppose up to you well she said i suppose if i can talk about it to anybody i can talk about it to you dont suppose ill be telling you anything you havent heard before thats right powys said im an accredited crank and ill be a dead crank if you dont yet so cynical fay slowed down you didnt used to be cynical unless that wideeyed wowmanwhata mindblower feel to the old golden land was a puton well he said the lighthearted element kind of dissipated he closed his eyes and the past tumbled down to him like a rock slide joey goes round the bottle stone and he goes round once whats happening is youre developing a link with the stone in an umbilical kind of way youre feeling every step you take bare feet connecting sensuously with the warm grassy skin of the earth and all the while the terrestrial magnetism lets imagine it exists is seeping up through the soles of your feet and he goes round twice stop it he rubbed his eyes that was your dad was it with the white beard rachel told me about him she said he was er something of a fun guy for his age he was always fun fay said that was the problem clergymen arent supposed to have that much fun powys watched her drive not like rachel she bumped the gears rode the clutch and went too fast round blind bends he tried to watch the landscape nothing like this where i grew up love at first sight when i came down here where was that where you came from up north very industrialized part a long busride to the nearest cow every square yard for as far as you could see built on for about the fourth time where we lived theyd eradicated grass like a disease its quite nice now if you like georgianstyle semis with concrete barbecuepits fay said i grew up in old vicarages and rectories in little villages with thatched houses and oxford for a time deprived childhood huh theres more than one kind fay said not many leylines where you came from i suppose you just had to work harder to find them powys said stiffening as fay clipped the hedge to avoid an oncoming lorry bloody loony could she he wondered really be referring to the innocent lorry driver how long has he known jean wendle who your dad he was sitting next to jean wendle in church after a moment fay trod on the brakes the fiesta was almost in the middle of the road the driver of a bmw behind hem blasted his horn and revved in righteous rage what she didnt seem to notice the middleaged suitandtieclad bmw driver thrusting up two furious fingers as he roared past jean wendle powys said the healer fay gripped the wheel tightly with both hands threw her head back and moaned oh god joe that was jean wendle it was fay unclipped her seatbelt would you mind taking over before i kill us both i think ive made the most awful fool of myself alex had given murray beech the usual can of heineken and this time murray had snapped it open and drunk silently and gratefully you heard my sermon murray said they were in the livingroom at the back of the house in bell street the vicar was slumped in an armchair he looked worn out and you heard my daughter i suppose alex said what was the matter with her you tell me old boy alex had once been chaplain to a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts murray reminded him of the new arrivals lankhaired greyskinned eyes like mud what did you think of my sermon good try alex said full marks for effort couple of brownie points perhaps from the town council then again perhaps not what dyou want me to say you and i both know that this fellow goffs congregations going to be a bloody sight more dedicated than yours sour grapes eh you said it old chap i dont know what to do murray said desolate alex sighed i could be good at this job murray said anywhere else i could be really good im a good organizer a good administrator i like organizing things running the parish affairs setting up discussion groups counselling sessions ive got ideas i can get things done archdeacon material if ever i saw it dont laugh at me alex sorry you see i did what i thought was right in the context of my position in crybbe the sermon i mean i expected people to come up to me outside you know well said vicar all this i thought i was echoing their own thoughts i know they dont like whats happening at the court how dyou know that not from listening to them talk thats for certain they dont even seem to talk to each other no chitchit no streetcorner gossip do you think thats natural nobody said a word to me today i was standing there holding out a hand thanks for coming nice to see you hope youre feeling better now the usual patter and some of them were taking my hand limply as if i was offering them a sandwich at the fete then theyd nod and trudge off without a word no reaction in church either except for fays outburst and the boy warren preece who was staring at me with the most astonishing malevolence in his eyes which boys that warren preece the mayors grandson the younger brother of the chap who drowned in the river looking at me as if he blamed me for his brothers death doesnt make much sense murray didnt to me either i tried to ignore it perhaps it was nothing to do with his brother hes a friend of the girl tessa byford you remember i asked you about exorcism oh yes how did that go you havent heard anything then nothing at all old chap didnt it go well youre sure you havent heard anything you wouldnt be trying to save my feelings sod off murray im a christian murray said that girls seriously disturbed tessa byford the old police house i think im talking about evil alex i think i was in the presence of evil i think she invited me in to flourish something m my face as if to say this is what youre up against now what are you going to do and what did you do i ran away murray said starkly i got the hell out of there and i havent been back and im scared stiff of meeting her in the street or a shop because i think id run away again oh dear alex said murray leaned his head back into the chair and closed and opened his eyes twice flexing his jaw alex said i seem to remember asking you what you thought were the world s greatest evils i expect i said inequality the tory government or something now id have to say ive seen real evil and it was in the eyes of a schoolgirl and now i dont know in a boy of eighteen or nineteen what does that say about me perhaps it says youve grown up alex said or that youve been watching those xrated videos again i dont know either ive been fudging the bloody issue for years and now im too old and clapped out to do anything about it perhaps you know this is one of those places where we meet it headon crybbe just thinking of something wendy said may look like a haemorrhoid in the arsehole of the world but the quiet places are often the real battlegrounds some of these new age johnnies are actually not so far offbeam when you talk to them you come across wendy murray loosed blank strict presbyterian upbringing alex said no nonsense yet she apparently cures people of cancer and shingles and things with the help of an eggshaped oriental blob called dr chi now i ask you but its all terminology isnt it dr chi jesus christ allah et theres a positive and a negative and whatever all this energy is well perhaps we can colour it with our hearts pass me another beer murray i dont think im helping you at all i thought you werent supposed to drink sod that said alex look at me do i seem sick do i seem irrational far from it in fact if you dont mind my saying so ive never known you so lucid well there you are you see dr chi little chinks a bloody wonder and theres you trying to drive his intermediary out of town we think were so smart murray but were just pupils in a spiritual kindergarten i think im cracking up murray said perhaps you need to consult old dr chi as well i can arrange an appointment murray stood up very quickly and headed for the door dont joke about this alex just dont joke was i alex asked him innocently was i joking do you think chapter vii but well she couldnt say she hadnt been warned the vet an elderly stooping man in a cardigan said thered been quite a concentration of shotgun pellets in the dogs rear end fairly close range you see must have been if hed moved a bit faster the shot would have missed him altogether i got some of them out and some will work to the surface in time but hell alwaysbe carrying a few around like an old soldier arnold was lying on a folded blanket his huge ears fully extended his tail bobbed when fay and joe appeared his left haunch had been shaved to the base of the tail the skin was vivid pink the stitching bright blue but hes only got three legs fay said i did try to save it mrs morrison but so much bone was smashed it would have been enormously complicated and left him in a lot of pain probably for life its quite unusual for the damage to be so concentrated but then dogs that are shot are usually killed hes a survivor fay said arnold was not feeling sorry for himself this was clear he thumped his tail against his folded brown blanket and tried to get up fell down again but he tried fay rushed to pat him to stop him trying again never discourage him from standing up the vet said hell be walking soon after a fashion managed a few steps m the garden this morning falls over a lot but he gets up again hes young enough to handle it with aplomb i think be cocking his stump against lampposts in no time need a lot of attention and careful supervision when hes outside for a while but hell be fine some people cant cope with it you know they have the dog put down its kinder they say kinder to them they mean with a stab of shame fay found herself thinking then about her father and theres one thing the vet said he wont be considered much of a danger to sheep now i cant see this particular farmer coming after him again most unlikely powys agreed there must have been twenty or thirty people around the court this afternoon pulling things down turning out buildings like drawers and this was a sunday every one of them no doubt on doubletime money no object the crybbe project seemed to have taken on a life of its own everything was happening unbelievably quickly three or four months work done inside a week as if max knew he had to seize the place stage a coup before bureaucracy could be cranked into action against him and it was happening all around rachel as if she wasnt there had max ordered her to stay behind here just to make this point maxs own energy seemed to be pumped entirely into his project as if he didnt have an empire to run even from london directing people and money to crybbe because unknown to its hundreds of employees this was now the spiritual centre of the epidemic group crybbe the court the tump shed caught sight of a specimen of his proposed new logo a big green mound with trees on it in maxs vision all the power of epidemic the recording companies the publishing houses the highstreet shops would emanate from the tump on a wall in the stable there was a map of the town with every building marked the ones owned by epidemic and now inhabited or soon to be by alternative people had been shaded red shed counted them there were thirtyfive properties far more than max was publicly admitting far more than even she had known about she tried to imagine the town as the alternative capital of britain with thousands of people flooding in to take part in seminars follow the leylines with picnic lunches consult mystics and healers people in search of a spiritual recharge or a miracle cure a kind of new age lourdes crybbe rachel shook her head and wandered across the courtyard head down hands deep in the pockets of her barbour couldnt wait to get rid of this greasy bloody barbour for good she arrived at the burgeoning rubbish pile which would soon consist of the entire nontudor contents of the court leftovers from four centuries reminders of the times when the courts other incarnations had been a private school failed a hotel failed even a billet shed been told for american servicemen during world war ii it was a shame a lot of the stuff they were throwing out would be quite useful to some people and some of it valuable a darkwood table scratched but serviceable a wardrobe which was probably victorian and would sell cleaned up for several hundred quid in any antique shop peanuts to max money to burn hardly new age what happened to recycling the pile was over twelve feet high filthy carpets which unrolled would probably turn out to be indian a rockingchair a couple of chests one thick with varnish the other newer bound with greenpainted metal strips black lettering across its lid you couldnt make out what it said rachel looked hard at the second chest where had she seen it before good lord she ran to the chest and pulled up its lid they couldnt do this but they had exposed to full daylight tiddles the mummified cat looked forlorn a wisp of a thing his eyesockets full of dust one of his sabreteeth broken probably in transit to the heap tiddles the guardian evicted she looked up at the court its lower windows mainly boarded up the upper ones too small to give any indication of what was going on inside one thing she knew tiddles might not be tudor seventeenth century somebody had suggested but he was part of that place he would have to go back goes round four times the earth force assume it exists rising up through the soles of your feet a kind of liquid light up into your legs and then into the body itself the solar plexus the first major energy centre feel it forming into a pulsing ball of warm white light while the chant goes on the rhythmic clapping and he goes round five times powys i need to tell you sorry are you ok powys yes sorry i was powys driving fays fiesta through a delirium of damp trees their foliage burgeoning over the road fay sitting in the passenger seat with arnold on the blanket on her knee fondling the dogs disproportionately large ears powys i need to tell you why i went berserk in church he said nothing she seemed a good deal more relaxed now something had obviously resolved itself have you ever seen a ghost he shook his head terrible admission isnt it my belief in ghosts is founded entirely on hearsay who exactly is jean wendle shes a spiritual healer one of the more convincing ones nice woman used to be a lawyer barrister or an advocate as they say in scotland very highoctane then she found she could heal people so she gave up the law to devote her life to it they were about to make her a judge at the time it caused uproar in legal circles oh you remember now yes it was in the papers wasnt it how longs she been in crybbe as i understand it he said she was one of the first of goffs bigname signings rachel says max wanted to put her into this old rectory hes bought a couple of miles outside town but she insisted on being at the heart of things so shes living in a town house on the square i didnt know she knew my father jean gets to know everybody unobtrusively she was sitting so still fay said in church so very still she slows her breathing sometimes shes a bit uncanny she intuits things absorbs atmospheres and interprets whats really going on im impressed by jean scares me a bit too i must admit scared me fay said in church i thought i was seeing dads late wife she paused again she said they were coming into crybbe powys slowed for the mph speed limit you said late wife she was called grace legge the house we live in was hers she died last year i saw her last week bloody hell fay id never seen one before you know how it is youve read about ghosts youve seen the films youve interviewed people who swear theyve seen one but you dont quite believe they exist except in peoples minds he said yes fay ran her fingers deep into arnolds warm fur i dont recommend the experience you know what they say about the flesh creeping the spine feeling chilled grace was ghastly dead whats the time ten past five we havent eaten fay remembered no wonder im shooting my mouth off lightheaded you coming in for something powys omelette sandwich im afraid dadll be there so forget everything i said about grace thanks but i ought to find rachel powys pulled up at the bottom of bell street took out the keys and passed them to fay arnold tried to stand up on fays knee hang on powys said he went round to open fays door and she handed arnold to him while she got out and shook off the dog hairs as powys handed arnold back as gently as he could fay looked him hard in the eyes serious almost severe if youve got any sense joe powys she said youll piss off out of crybbe pronto and take rachel with you shes gold shes the only person i know around here whos got her act together come on arnie im afraid were home what about you strikes me you need to get out more urgently than any of us why because im losing my marbles like dad and like me he wondered walking down the street towards the river and immediately twelve years fell away and he was going around the stone again round and round mesmeric tribal widdershins widdershins against the sun against nature and he goes round seven times powys stood on the bridge and threw up his hands warding it off wiping it away but the atmosphere was thick with it he could feel memorys helicopter beating the air above his head with great sweeping buffeting strokes it had never been so powerful he was standing upright on the bridge but his mind was ducking and crouching cowering he looked around for somewhere to run to but it was all around him eight times fluidity of movement breathing changing rhythm something else breathing for you running beside you widdershins widdershins and doing your breathing nine cant stop cant stop out of your hands now widdershins widdershins ten below you the tiny figure running around the stone widdershins all wrong below the stone and the running figure widdershins all wrong eleven and the ball of light rising up hard bright glowing pulsing into the chest widdershins engulfing your heart but its no longer warm and its bursting with a shocking rush into your head where its widdershins he was inside the running figure now pounding across the bridge and into the short gravel drive of the little black and white riverside cottage powys flung himself en to the longunmown lawn soft and damp and full of buttercups and dandelions he lay on his stomach with his face into the grass his eyes closed and the cool vegetation pressed into the sockets kept rubbing it in until it was a green mush and not so cool any more youre going back annie had said back to the old golden land back hed told himself to find out what had happened to henry kettle back they said behind his back to find redemption the cold in his stomach told him he was back but that there was no redemption to be found here he opened his eyes and blinked and then the screaming started to come out of him like aural vomit for at the top edge of the little ridge on which the cottage stood something black and alien thrust out of the grass the stone was only five feet tall but looked taller because of the prominence of its position its base was fat and solidly planted in he earth it maintained its girth until three feet above the ground it tapered into a neck presenting the illusion of a large black beerbottle chapter viii previously the cardboard box had contained a new kind of footmassaging sandal from germany which max was trying out on the advice of his reflexologist as a coffin it was not entirely satisfactory shed found the box in maxs bedroom which was built into the eaves over the far end of the long room where his desk stood the fourposter bed facing the mound had deepgrey drapes max had not spent a single night here yet but it seemed to rachel that the atmosphere in the room was already foetid with tension and a lingering sense of suffocated longing rachel thought of the nights of the great beast and the scarlet woman and was sickened and ashamed shed snatched the shoebox and fled the box was necessary there was no way she could carry tiddless chest up to the attic on her own as she knelt in the yard by the rubbish pile she was worried the mummified cat would come apart or disintegrate while being transferred from the chest he fell as light as wads of dust under an old sofa poor little devil rachel said you certainly havent much energy left to put into maxs project returning tiddles to his sentry post in the court would she decided be her last meaningful task in crybbe and she didnt want witnesses for over an hour tiddles lay in his box on the kitchen table in the stables while rachel waited for the workmen to finish clearing the court it was gone pm still she could hear them inside while a van waited in the courtyard at nearly pm she threw on her barbour picked up the shoebox marched purposefully across to the courts main entrance and hauled open the dusty oak door there was a clang from above a thump the sound of a large piece of furniture being hurled to the floor what were they doing up there and who exactly were they not judging by the quality of the stuff theyd tossed out a knowledgeable antique dealer among them rachel decided it was time to throw them out or time at least to establish the identity of the smartarse who was deciding so arbitrarily which items of furniture to discard with the shoebox under her arm she went in hello excuse me her voice seemed to go nowhere as if she was shouting into a windtunnel the court was so full of noise ceilingshaking bangs and crashes as if the entire building was being torn apart yet no one had come out of here in at least a couple of hours and the rubbish pile was no higher than it had been when shed found the cats wooden chest hello she looked around halflight floated feebly through the nighlevel slits and barely reached the stone floor rachel followed the sounds and stormed up the spiral stone stair case excuse me calling out as she neared the first floor i need to lock this place up for the night so if you could give me some idea how long youre going to be she stepped out into the main chamber where families had lived and where the hanging sheriff sir michael wort had held out against the rebel hordes oh rachel said she was alone the weak evening light washed through two mullioned windows but the shadows were taking over now well she certainly wasnt going to play hideandseek with a bunch of silly buggers getting paid well over the odds to clean the place out before morning she had half a mind to lock them in except the keys were in her bag in the stables there was a double crash from above and the sound of glass shattering what the hell rachel bounded angrily up the next spiral didnt they know how easily they could kill themselves up there or bring half the ceiling down had nobody warned them about the state of the floor the heavy door to the attics was ajar theyd been given keys then that bastard max must have had another set made without even telling her she thrust through the arched doorway past the alcove concealing the entrance to the prospect chamber up towards the attics it was only when she was halfway up the steps that it occurred to her that among the bangs and the crashes thered been no laughter none of the usual banter of men working together no shouted directions no oaths no no voices at all and now she was standing here on the last stairway far above her blades of light through broken slates and it was absolutely silent what rachel demanded is going on what was more disquieting than this sudden inexplicable cessation of bangs and crashes was the hairline crack she detected in her own voice she cleared her throat and gave it more vehemence come on i havent got all night where are you rachel did not remember ever being superstitious she did not believe in good luck bad luck heaven hell psychic forces or the secret power of leylines she found the whole new age concept not only essentially unsound but for the most part very tedious indeed yet and for the first time she found the place not just gloomy in a sad uncaredfor kind of way but in the sense of being oppressive and yes ok eerie she admitted to herself that she didnt want to go so far into the attic that she might see the rope hanging from the ceiling even though she knew it could not be a very old rope but this was a side issue something to be acknowledged and perhaps examined later with a raising of eyebrows and glass of whisky beside the jotul stove in jm powyss riverside retreat for here and for now there was only one serious legitimate fear a fear of the kind of men who on hearing a woman calling out to them and coming up the stairs would stop what they were doing slide into the shadows and keep very very quiet until this woman appeared at the top of the steps with nothing to defend her except a dead cat in a shoebox so no way was she going all the way to the top rachel steadied her breathing set her lips in a firm line tossed back her hair and began to descend the spiral stairway if the men in the attic were unaware of the instability of the floor and the danger to themselves that was their business they were presumably wellinsured if they fell they fell she hadnt been hired as caretaker of britains leaststately home and she wasnt prepared to tolerate being pissed around any longer tomorrow perhaps even tonight she would phone max in london and inform him that she had quit as of now as she descended the twisted stairway it began to grow darker when she reached the bottom she found out why the door sealing off the prospect chamber and the attics must have swung closed behind her cutting off the light from the firstfloor livinghall she pushed it with the flat of her hand it didnt move she put the shoebox on the stairs and pushed hard with both hands it was an oak door four inches thick and it did not move well it might have jammed look would somebody mind helping me with this door no response or oh god can i really credit this the bastards might have locked her in it was important to hold on to her anger when i get out of here rachel said suddenly icily without thinking you can consider yourselves officially fired which on reflection was a pretty stupid thing to say theyd never let her out she tried again now look dont be stupid its very dangerous up here the floors full of holes you know that and i havent got a torch she threw her weight against the door halfexpecting somebody to have quietly unlocked it so that it opened suddenly and she went tumbling down the stairs such was the mentality people like this but all that happened was she hurt her shoulder look would you mind letting me out she stopped suddenly and leaned back against a wall breathing hard an awful thought occurring to her what if humble was behind this suppose as she would normally have expected the workmen had actually cleared off hours ago who after all really worked until pm on a sunday evening certainly not the kind of unskilled vandals whod been let loose in here what then if it had been humble who had come up here and made a lot of noise to lure her inside hed never liked her and he knew she didnt like him he might think she was putting the knife in for him with max maybe max had found out what humble had done to jm that night maybe humbles job was on the line and he thought she was responsible but if humble was behind this he would have needed an accomplice one of them up here to make all the racket one to lock the door after shed gone through which still meant that someone was up here with her now on this side of the locked door keeping very very quiet rachel spun round it was so dark with the door closed that she could hardly see as far as the twist in the staircase which took it to the attic anything could be around that bend not six feet away humble not much authority left in her voice nor much anger she was a woman alone in the darkness of a decaying old house with a man who intended her harm humble listen whichever side of the door you are i dont know why youre doing this i wish youd tell me so we can have it out but if its anything to do with what happened the other night with j m powys i want you to know that i havent said anything to max and i dont intend to a mistake is a mistake humble can you hear me the door didnt have a handle only a lock she bent down and tried to look into the keyhole to see if there was a key in the other side she couldnt tell one way or the other it was too dark her own keys were in her bag on the kitchen table humble look if youve heard what i said just unlock the door and ill give you time to get out of the building i dont want any unpleasantness because oh what the hell did it matter now because im handing in my notice tomorrow ive got another job in london you wont have to deal with me again did you hear that do you understand what im saying humble rachel beat her fists on the oak door until she felt the skin break she had grown cold she wrapped her barbour around her and sat down on a stone stair next to the cardboard coffin and listened hard nothing she couldnt even hear the birds singing outside where there was light but from the attic clearly not far beyond the top of the spiral stairway came a single sharp triumphant bump chapter ix he remembered twelve spiralling down out of the sky seeing the stone thickening and quivering and throbbing the haze around it like a dense toxic cloud at which point memory went into negative the fields turned purple the river black everything went black he didnt remember the scramble of feet all four of them rushing the new author jm powys picking him up carrying him to the socalled fairy mound and dumping him facedown on its grassy funk with shrieks of laughter he was only able to construct this scene from what ben corby had told him years later from bens story hed tried to form an image of rose but he couldnt be sure whether she was laughing too or whether shed stopped short her face clouding feeling premonition like a small tap on the shoulder from a cold stiff hand every time he pushed himself into replaying the scene in his head he forced rose to be laughing when they dumped him on the mound he always put the laugh on freeze frame and then pulled the plug so that he could climb out of it without breaking down powys stood in the neutrality of a sunless summer evening and put both hands on the bottle stone at its shoulders when it began to taper into the neck and pushed hard it was solid a proper job as henry kettle would have said probably several feet of the thing underground the earth compressed around it a few rocks in there maybe tufts of long grass embedded at the base it might have been here for four thousand years you could dig for three hours and it would still be erect it needed a jcb to get it out but first he had to force himself to touch it to walk around it only not widdershins never widdershins the stone a cunningly hewn replica of something which had speared his dreams for twelve years he also reserves the right rachel had said to install standing stones or other ritual artefacts on your lawn all down to andy boultontrow he could imagine andys unholy delight at finding among goffs collection of newly quarried megaliths one roughly not roughly exactly the size and shape of the bottle stone or maybe knowing that powys was coming to crybbe hed actually had one cut to shape and then planted it in a spot that would emphasize the correlation of the stone and the river recreating the fateful scene of twelve years ago rough therapy or another of andys little experiments fifty yards away the brown river churned like a turbulence of worms towards the bridge the canon was angry and you didnt tell me you didnt even tell me theyd taken one of the big cushions from the sofa in what was now their livingroom at the rear of the house and put it on the rug in front of the fire and then put the threelegged dog on the cushion arnold didnt object to this at all but something in alex had clearly snapped its got to stop fay it isnt helping in fact its making things a good deal worse im sorry i didnt want to get you all worked up well i am worked up even though it was young preece and hes dead divine retribution if you ask me

coming here with your superior radio four attitude oh dear have to work for the little local radio station never mind at least theres no need to take it seriously now just a minute dad oh god how am i expected to do any decent interviews with people whore too thick to string three coherent sentences together the canon clambered awkwardly to his feet and then dumped himself into an armchair hed battered into shape over several months he swung round as if the chair was a gunturret training on her a hard blue glare a oncefamiliar glare under which she used to crumble you he said were never going to adapt to their way of life because it was the wrong way to do things because they keep their heads down and dont parade in front of the council offices with placards if they dont get their bins emptied dad im supposed to be a reporter and when this fat fellow whats his name goff when this meddling lunatic arrives with his monumentally crazy scheme to turn the place on its head well guess who cant get along with him either why its miss sophisticated fay peters late of radio four and she wont get back to london where she belongs dad you know bloody well because she has this astonishing notion that her dilapidated old dad wont be able to manage without her jesus christ alex slumped into silence fay couldnt speak either if this was jean wendles doing it was remarkable lucid cogent powerful cleareyed he might have been ten years younger and in total control of himself she was shaken he was right of course even if there was a lot he didnt know or maybe there were things he did know when she did finally manage to utter something it wasnt what shed had it in mind to come out with at all dad she heard this pathetic littlegirl voice saying close to tears dad why is grace haunting us warren never even saw his grandad until the old bugger was upon him he was out by the tump thinking how much bigger it looked now from the side where the wall had been ripped out

go along with the old man who had to give evidence that the stiff really was jonathon preece but they said after hed done that itd be adjourned for a few weeks so theyd have a long wait before they heard all the interesting stuff from the pathologist whod cut jonathon up on the slab after the inquest had been opened the bodyd be released for burial but the old man said they wouldnt be having it back at the house another disappointment for warren whod planned to come down in the night and look under the shroud at all the stitches where the pathologist had put jonathons guts back from behind

i dont know maybe i dont wanner know maybe whats up with you now his grandad was looking past him at something that caused his mouth to open a crack bit of dribble out the side false teeth jiggling about disgusting he turned and began to walk back towards the road towards the town warren slinking half a dozen paces behind when the gap between them was wide enough warren turned and saw what looked like the sunset reflected in one of the top windows of the old house just below the roofline except there wasnt any sun so it couldnt be a sunset warren shrugged chapter x the smell happened first it happened quite suddenly as if in the cracking of a rotten egg the smell and with it the light elements of the same change the smell was filthy sulphur and something cesspit putrid the light came in oily yellows the yellow of candles made of animal fat and the yellow of pus from a wound gone bad the light came from no particular direction but glistened on the stone walls like lard rachel shrank from the walls but she couldnt get away from the stairs where she crouched it was no longer dry and dusty but wet warm and slick like phlegm she touched a stone step just once and something unpleasant came off on her fingers she tried to wipe them on the oak door but that also was coated with a thick cheesy grease gritty here and there with what felt like fly corpses rachel pulled the hand away in disgust wiped it on her barbour knowing she could no longer bring herself to beat on this door her fists were sore and peeling anyway and if there was anyone out there they werent going to help her perhaps they were waiting for the cool superior professional woman to break down to shriek and sob and plead i cant stand this she said aloud i shall be sick which couldnt make the atmosphere any more foetid but if i was a woman with any imagination she thought i would be very very frightened for the court always so drab and dusty and derelict gloomy but no more menacing than an empty warehouse had swollen into a basic sort of life ludicrous a grotesque selfdelusion but that was what it felt like flickerings of things presences in the shadows the smell itself was like the houses own foul breath she began to breathe hard herself broke out in a coughing fit then tried to breathe slowly and selectively keeping her mouth closed because the air was so rancid that when she took it in there gathered at the back of her throat a richly cloying rawmeat taste like sweating sweet salami rachel suffocating closing her mouth closing her eyes trying to close down all her senses trying above all not to hear thought i need air i need light i need to walk up these few steps i need the prospect chamber soft fresh evening air gentle evening light the prospect chamber eight ten steps away but i cant move from here i cant move because of those taunting sounds from the darkness above sometimes soft rustling like satin sometimes loud as a foundry overhead and then stopping for a period of tense luminous quiet until it begins again louder and closer then distant again i am here i am there i can be anywhere i choose in an instant because im not hu shut up shut up its what he wants you to think creaks thrustings what might have been hollow footsteps on wood flat footsteps on stone on stone steps hes coming down stopping just before the bend not six feet away from where he crouched holding her arms around herself beginning to shiver pull yourself together someone is trying to terrify you its only another person you can handle people you always could you are cool and controlled you can be remote haughty offhand intimidating you are flexible you can be dominant or compliant at will all you have to do is stride up there and face whoever it is yes but thats what he wants and what if you go up there and theres nothing nothing but the dark help me rachel was screaming out seconds later her voice always so calm and deep now parched and bitter with anger and despair hum ble andy anybody please then in a soft and aching whisper she said jm and her eyes filled uncontrollably with tears when i get out of here im going to get us both away tonight thats a promise if i get out of here if i ever get to breathe the sweet night air god help me rachel thought but im not going to scream any more when shed screamed the scream had come up from her stomach like bile when she looked down at herself she saw that her barbours waxy surface gleamed sickly yellow like the walls she wanted to take it off but she didnt like the cold shed never liked the cold she wanted to remove her shoes so as to move more quietly up the stairs towards the prospect chamber but the thought of that ooze between her toes she closed her eyes closed her eyes and opened them and rose picking up the cardboard box containing the dead cat guardian come on tiddles rachel said wiping the tears away she wished the appalling sounds would begin again if only to muffle her footsteps they did not silence woven as thick as a tapestry hung over the stairs which were visible only because of the phosphorescence which seemed to move with her not so much lighting the way as holding her close in a thick and stifling miasma when she looked back there was merely an oily blackness behind her in the place near the door where she had crouched rachel couldnt remember a nightmare this bad she was sweating in the clammy barbour which seemed to have become part of this place as if the yellow light steaming from the walls was revaporizing on the wax of the coat in clusters of tiny bubbles she came to the bend in the stairs all she had to do was follow the spiral to her left would be the alcove concealing the door to the prospect chamber above her how far above her she couldnt tell because there was no light and she could not remember would be the attic better not to think about the attic shut it out i dont go into the attics im not superstitious i just dont go into the attics two steps two steps to the alcove and the prospect chamber and light and air she could stand in the opening and shout and scream and somebody would have to hear her oh please please dont let the door be locked rachel made it to the second step and was about to fall into the alcove throw herself at the door to the prospect chamber this is the only part of the house i like when to a shattering chorus of harsh clangs and grinding strangled creaks a malfunctioning clockmechanism amplified a thousand times the greasy darkness shredded before her like a rotting curtain revealing the attic all lit up in bilious yellow except for the quivering shadow of the rope hanging from the apex of the roof turning slowly stretched taut by something palely shining the source of all the light noosed and squirming it was not far off pm the night sidling in when powys drove the mini between the gateposts of the court and became instantly aware of the tump behind the house he could not see the tump but he saw for the first time that the trees towering over the court from behind were the trees growing out of its summit once you knew this you could almost see the shadow of the great mound outlined in the elizabethan stonework of the court itself the tump and house fused into a single entity even as he had that thought something flared in the house and then went out like a lightbulb which explodes the second its switched on he saw a momentary afterglow in one of the small windows immediately below the eaves maybe andys in there maybe i can wait behind the door until he comes out and then ill start hitting him powys accelerated drove around the house to the courtyard parked in front of the stableblock next to the range rover felt a pang of gratitude when he spotted that longing to see rachel again the stable door was unlocked he went in rachel the place was dim although it probably faced west there was little light left in the sky from here at the top of the long room now sectionalized you looked down towards the big picturewindow and the grey and smoky tump rachel luv you in there maybe the light way up in the house had been her with a torch i dont like that it may not frighten her up there but it scares the crap out of me and why had the torch gone out rachel he looked around for light switches found a panel of them behind the door pressed everything concealed lighting came on everywhere without a blink on the kitchen table was a scattering of magazines new age stuff and a black leather bag open rachels bag he went outside again anxiety setting in with the dusk he looked across at the court soon the sky and the stone would meld and the house would be an amorphous thing balanced on the edge of the night powys moved to the rear entrance trying not to crunch gravel he pushed the door but it didnt give locked he didnt waste time with it but followed the walls of the house around to the front and almost cried out when something big and black reared up in his path it didnt move it was a massive rubbish pile except many of the items on it didnt look like rubbish to powys even in his light near the top of the heap was an enormous double wardrobe victorian gothic its top corner projecting sharply out of the pile as if in protest this time powys tried the front door and found that it too was locked he looked back along the dead straight drive into the wood straining to the silence no birds left to sing directly above him he knew would be the prospect chamber set into the highest eaves the houses only orifice when the doors were locked and barred powys stepped back from the door and shouted as loud as he could up in the direction of the chambers hidden maw rachel a moment in a void then he saw a glowing filament of sporadic paleyellow zigzagging the length of the eaves like very feeble lightning he heard a scream so high and wild it might have been an animal on the brink of violent death in the woods and then a chasm opened under all his senses you land with a breathtaking thump on the fairy mound not hearing the laughter only aware of the pit beneath you an endless lift shaft youre falling down and down and down faster and faster a tiny point of white light far below you a point of light which gets no larger the further you fall because what it is is the light reflecting from a spearhead dirty and speckled with rust as you can see quite clearly in the long moments before you feel the tearing agony watching the spears shaft disappearing into your stomach in in explosion of blood noooooooooo he staggered frantically but uselessly about trying to position himself below her as she plummeted from the prospect chamber like a shot bird the barbour billowing out waxy wings against the leaden sky but she crashed down in the only place he could not hope to throw himself in her path and he actually heard her neck break as it connected with the projecting corner of a victorian gothic wardrobe of old dark wood something came after her a small greybrown wisp of a thing part six in many such cases it has been suspected that there was an unconscious human medium commonly an emotionally disturbed adolescent at the root of the manifestations if these effects can be produced unconsciously it is reasonable to suppose that people can learn to produce them by will indeed in traditional societies young people who have evident talents for promoting outbreaks of psychical phenomena are marked out as future shamans john michell the new view over atlantis chapter i monday morning and over the dregs of an early breakfast fay finally found out the truth about her father grace and the house and wound up wishing in a way that shed remained ignorant for in ignorance there was always hope it was not unknown for alex to be up for an early breakfast on one bestforgotten occasion five or six weeks ago hed been clanking around in the kitchen at am and when his swolleneyed daughter had appeared in the doorway had admonished her for going out and not leaving him any supper no it hadnt made any sense except in terms of the quantity of blood reaching her dads brain and fay was resigned to it with a cold damp apprehension shed accepted there would come a time when it might be necessary to change the locks on the front door and deprive him of a key so he wouldnt go out wandering the streets in the early hours in search of a chip shop or a woman or something however there were still times like last night when it might almost be in remission but last night dad why is grace haunting us theyd parted uncomfortably alex mumbling talk about it in the morning the prospect of him remembering had seemed so remote that even fay had expunged it from her memory then this morning shed come down just before eight and there was her dad fishing a slice of bread out of the toaster with a bent fork and making unflattering observations about the quality of taiwanese workmanship been remiss hed mumbled shouldnt have tried to cover up so you burnt the toast again fay said no big deal dad no grace you stupid child im trying to say i should have told you about grace oh and out it all came for the first time as if the blood supply to his brain had suddenly tripled making him more cogent more aware of his own defects than she could ever remember this wendle woman was it conceivable shed pulled off some astonishing medical coup here grace alex said this lady with whom id had a small dalliance over twenty years earlier she rather more serious about it than i i mean she really wasnt my type at all not like your mother grace was a very proper sort of woman prissy some might say i never liked to say it myself dad such a sheltered life you see here in crybbe and then the secretarial job with the diocese i think god help me i think she really believed that having an affair with a clergyman was somewhat less sinful than having a less er less physical relationship with a layman nearer my god to thee fay said wryly quite she was quite unbearably understanding when when your mother found out and threatened to get us all via the divorce courts into the news of the world tricky period things were quite hairy for a while but there we are it ended surprisingly amicably quite touching really at the time fay said you mean she accepted her martyrdom gracefully as it were to save your precious career alex lowered his eyebrows quite he said gruffly of course i felt sorry for grace and we kept in contact in an entirely platonic way for many years even when mum was alive platonically fay platonically came back to crybbe to live with her sister as you know then she died and grace was alone a very aloof proper little spinster in a tidy little house terribly sad do you think i might have another ill pour it thank you and then of course i had the letter from young duncan christie at the cathedral just happening to mention grace was in a pretty depressed state not too well sister recently dead feeling pretty sorry for herself and with reason never been quite the same since you know well youve told me this bit a chance for you to make amends nemesis you see i had ruined the poor womans life after all that might be questionable alex shook his head in a rare hairshirt mood and well i just happen to turn up there one day just passing through you know and i just happened to stay so after all these years miss legge finally becomes mrs peters or as she liked to put it mrs canon peters and alex resigns himself to a year or two of ministering to this rather severe elderly lady incurably ill and incurably set in her ways odd really she seemed much older than me although she was twentyodd years younger yes but i know im coming to it woodstock why didnt i sell this place when grace died and go back to woodstock the very question ive been trying to ask you for months dad er yes alex slurped milk into his coffee fay looked up as hard rain spots hit the window the driedblood bricks of the houses across the street gleamed drably you see there are things you dont know about woodstock like the fact that it erwell it wasnt mine to sell actually fay closed her eyes still belonged to charlie wharton i may have conveyed the impression id bought it off him fact is i was only sort of keeping it warm for his retirement and i was surviving rather longer than either of us had envisaged and they were about to boot him cut of the bishops palace you see so he was pretty anxious to have the place back in fact i er well i might have been facing a spot of legal action to remove me if i hadnt cleared off when i did to be honest might have guessed fay thought might have bloody guessed so what it comes down to she said smiling icily is that you were rather more anxious to move in with grace than she was to have you well until i er raised the possibility of marriage fay nodded still smiling problem is as you know money and i have never got along terribly well together ladies horses unwise investments alex stirred his coffee the rain came down harder fay noticed a damp patch near the kitchen ceiling it was getting bigger dad she said you are a total unmitigated shit alex went on stirring his coffee and didnt deny it fay went to wash the breakfast dishes digesting the information and its significance that her father was not a wealthy man that his total assets amounted to little more than a very small terraced cottage in a back street in crybbe a cottage which even if sold to say max goff would hardly pay a years rent on a basement room in battersea she wondered what kind of pension hed got and if he had debts she knew nothing about so much to think about that it seemed silly even to raise the issue however youve seen her havent you since she died youve been seeing her oh fay alex rubbed his eyes this parts so difficult the past few months such a blur i dont know what ive done what ive seen these past couple of days its as though im waking up wendy perhaps i dont know you know what im talking about though lets not piss about here dad graces ghost she shivered just saying the words graces empty fishsmile in her mind i this really is hard especially for me as a priest all my life so many anomalies so many things one cant encompass within the scriptural parameters that business in y groes a year or two ago and now young murray and his evil children you havent told me about that sworn to silence child and you see theres always a rational explanation always a psychological answer murray rushing ahead with his career in the blissful certainty that a clergyman can operate more effectively if he doesnt believe sod murray dad grace you dont have to bring me back to the bloody point im not rambling sorry all right so im guilty of whatever crime it might be to smooth things out for two elderly folk in a bit of a mess the problem is when grace popped her clogs rather sooner than expected my overwhelming reaction im sorry to say was one of relief there we are truth out id got a roof over my head and she wasnt under it any more hows that for a christian attitude not so deplorable it may not seem deplorable to you wretched child but i wanted to suffer i needed to suffer id been getting away with things all my life and here i was again landing on my feet fay thought christ whats he saying is he saying that in his dislocated mental condition he created graces ghost a resentful avenging presence to remind him of his sins and you alex said why the devil did you have to come back and look after me i didnt want to inflict myself on you prissy little grace didnt want you in her house the crux of it he might be able to project grace like a gruesome magiclantern slide on his own dusty mental screen but you cant make me see her dad you cant do that how could she tell him what shed seen did i really see it did i see it what would that do for his remission ok dad she said drink your coffee i understand look ive missed the news now fay switched on the panasonic radio on the kitchen window ledge she had indeed missed the news and had to listen to a couple of minutes of sport before the headlines were repeated and to recap on todays main story in crybbe police are investigating the death of a personal assistant to billionaire businessman max goff the dead woman thirtyfiveyearold rachel wade appeared to have fallen from a high window in historic crybbe court this a offas dyke radio news next bulletin ten oclock for long long seconds fay didnt move at all stood frozen at the sink a damp dishcloth hanging from one hand the kitchen clock two minutes fast said alex sliding his chair back getting to his feet said how come you didnt pick that one up fay i normally make the police calls before you get up fay said numbly we had breakfast instead offas dyke have an early duty reporter in at half past five ah alex brought his coffee cup to the sink expect youll be off to find out what happened he looked up his beard pure white in the dull morning you all right fay how well did you know this woman fine dad said fay no i i didnt know her very well excuse me arnold struggled to his feet to follow her out of the room fell over again fay picked him up and carried him into the office her face buried in his fur as she put him down on the fireside chair she caught a glimpse of her own face in the giltframed mirror a face as pale as dead grace fay picked up the phone called the information room at divisional hq not much we can tell you im afraid it was an accident though all i can say is investigations are proceeding you mean it might not have been an accident hang on a minute the police voice said then she heard yes sir its fay morrison from offas dyke sure just a sec mrs morrison the duty inspector would like a word good morning mrs morrison inspector waring here if wonder if youd be good enough to pop into the police station at crybbe see the chief inspector why just a few things you might be able to clear up for us like what i think id rather the chief told you that if you dont mind oh come on said fay off the record a moments hesitation then all right off the record weve a chap helping with inquiries joseph miles powys says he was with you yesterday what would you mind mrs morrison just popping into the station they wont keep you long im im on my way fay said chapter ii in his room at the cock guy awoke at ninethirty hed come back here for a good nights sleep but it hadnt been one and he awoke realizing why he blinked warily at the overcast offwhite morning at his suitcase on the floor by the dressingtable at the wardrobe door agape exposing his leather jacket on a hanger and finally at the portfolio against the wall next to the door especially at that he should never have slept with those drawings in the room in the practical light of morning guy knew he should have left the portfolio in his car or better still dumped them back at the gallery after his abortive attempt to quiz the girl on his way to the bathroom he picked up the portfolio and left it propped up in the passage hoping somebody would nick the thing it was still there when he returned after a pee and a very quick wash he didnt like spending too long in bathrooms any more even by daylight back in his room guy burrowed in his suitcase for his rechargeable shaver he shaved bending down to the dressingtable mirror wondering about jocasta what kind of night shed had well yes hed felt bad about jocasta in a way especially when shed clutched at his arm pleading one more night just one night herewardll be back tomorrow guy i cant i cant spend a night there alone look hed argued reasonably why not lock yourself in your er suite you dont have to go near that bathroom do you i promise you ill find out about this ill tackle the girl again tomorrow you wont jocasta had wailed your crewll be back and youll spend all day filming and youll forget all about me ive been very stupid i know but please cant you just no jocasta had sniffed and wandered back into the gallery leaving him alone on the street with the stiffbacked portfolio under his arm dammit hed done what he could opened her poxy exhibition been charming to the invited guests none of whom it seemed to guy could get away fast enough and hed tried to get at the girl the damned girl in black with the cruel dark eyes there she is jocasta grabbing his arm in front of everybody hissing at him and writhing like an anaconda where who the one who brought those drawings in you invited her of course i didnt shes just turned up guy weve got to make her tell us what its all about we we have the girl had spoken to nobody just wandered around inspecting paintings wearing a faintly superior supercilious expression as well she might hed conceded given the standard of work on show the artist emmanuel somebody or other apparently specializing in brownish pointilliste studies of derelict farmyards to guy the girl looked far too mature and aware to be still at school jocasta pushing the portfolio at him please talk to her shell be impressed by you she wont dare lie but the girl didnt seem even to have heard of guy morrison which didnt make her any more endearing add to this the darkeyed unfriendly face and the attitude i was very interested guy began smoothly in the drawings you gave mrs newsome the ones in this folder i dont know anything about them thats interesting she tells me you asked her to try and sell them for you dont know what youre on about shes a nutter that woman you know shes on valium and stuff dont you are you saying you didnt do these drawings in which case who did why dont you get lost blondie tessa byford said loudly sweet as lemon youre really not my type she turned away from guy morrison and melted into the crowd a dozen or so people looking uncomfortable feeding each other canapes and surfacechat except for one very thin woman with stretched yellowwhite skin standing alone and smiling vacuously at guy with small needleteeth guy smiled back but she didnt acknowledge him and he went outside with the portfolio under his arm to be followed by the faintly tipsy hysterical jocasta no hed said firmly do you understand no which was how hed come to walk away still holding the portfolio feeling angry and confused needing a good nights sleep so he could think this thing out the girl had obviously known about the ghost of the old man haunting the newsomes house had given jocasta the drawings in a calculated attempt to terrify her but why what had the girl got against jocasta was there something guy didnt know in the privacy of his room hed thought of examining the drawings in some detail but he found he didnt want to take them out of their folder the whole business seemed less frightening now than distasteful not the sort of thing guy morrison needed while shooting an important documentary he didnt need the dreams either last night guy had dreamed he was back on the rug in front of the fire where jocasta straddled him swinging her hips tantalizingly above his straining loins yes yes guy urged in the dream but she held herself just a fraction of an inch away so he could feel the heat of her but not the touch of her skin please he moaned please come down her face was above his she seemed to be floating both hands in the air he felt her pubic hair brush the tip of his come down on me no jocasta said calmly oh please please i cant i cant i cant hold on he tried to put his arms around her neck to pull her down on him but his arms went right through her as though she had no substance he dreamt then the way you did sometimes that he woke up still feeling alarmingly excited he was in his room at the cock and he could still feel her presence above him her bodily musk in his nostrils he moaned and breathed in deeply and almost choked she smelt foul a decaying rancid smell that filled up his throat and turned the sweat on his body to frost and when he opened his eyes he stared into the whitened skeletal face of the woman from the gallery with the little needleteeth he really woke up then in a genuine cold sweat no more nights alone in the cock guy morrison decided tonight well tonight would have to be a very special night for his adoring production assistant catrin jones the lesser of several evils chief inspectors were getting younger this one was a kind of murray beech in blue steely eyed freshly shaven although he may have been up most of the night yes she said wed been to pick up my dog from the vets i i needed somebody to drive the car so i could keep the dog on my knee no she said no i havent known him long just a couple of days in fact in this job you get to know people quite well quite quickly dont ask what was wrong with the dog she pleaded silently it has nothing whatsoever to do with this nothing we got back i suppose it would have been shortly before seven yes he drove back the last i saw of him he was walking home to the cottage he was living in max goff had commissioned him to write a book about crybbe miss wade she said yes i got on very well with her i suppose we had similar backgrounds rose she said later rose who rose hart replied chief inspector william hughes a high flier from off have you heard of her no oh wait a minute photographs by rose hart on the cover of the old golden land it said photographs by rose hart is that who you mean you dont know anything about her you never met no whats the connection here mrs morrison i have to be intrusive whats your relationship with joseph miles powys what were you sleeping with him what im sorry i have to ask this of course i wasnt bloody sleeping with him id only known the bloke a couple of days and how long had he known miss wade oh fay leaned back in the metal chair in the bare little room there was a table and two other metal chairs the chief inspector in one wynford wiley in the other fat florid red necked wynford wiley with a suggestion of a smile on his tiny lips i see what you mean fay conceded quietly two days three days four perhaps yes ok it was what you might call a whirlwind romance quite normal for some people mrs morrison yes but rachel wasnt no no listen perhaps relationships do form quickly when when you arent happy miss wade wasnt happy she she wasnt happy working for max goff no she wasnt happy about what he was doing in crybbe she thought he was pouring money down the drain the thing is it wasnt too easy to quit she was being paid an awful lot o money as goffs pa the way you babbled under interrogation no matter how smooth you thought you were at handling people how unhappy would you say she was look fay said rallying i think its time you made it clear what kind of investigation this is what do you suspect suicide or what or what repeated the chief inspector or murder i suppose fay said what do you think it was i dont know the circumstances are you trying to say i mean is this the bottom line powys pushed poor rachel out of the window because she found out he was having it off with me i mean bloody hell come on it wasnt a window mrs morrison it was something called the prospect chamber do you know it no that is ive heard of it did you go out again last night after mr powys had brought you home no is there anybody who can my father i understand hes not been very well mrs morrison i believe he gets a bit confused oh god hughes do you get a kick out of this its my job mrs morrison still what have i got to complain about itll sound interesting on the radio tonight wont it wynford wiley grinned which wasnt pleasant which radio you gonner ave it on mrs morrison he looked down at his big hands hands like inflated rubber gloves twirling a pen only i yeard offas dyke radio wasnt too happy with you lately see just what i yeard like hughes said mrs morrison do you know what happened to rose hart fay shook her head slowly the chief inspector consulted a file on the table in front of him twelve years ago he said rose hart and joe powys were sharing a flat in bristol it was a victorian building in a not very pleasant area of town and mr powys told the inquest they were hoping to move somewhere else inquest fay said faintly at the rear of the house was an overgrown area which couldnt really be called a garden one afternoon joe powys went up to london to see his publisher this is what he told the inquest when he got back he couldnt find rose anywhere but a window was wide open in the flat this is the fourth floor oh no fay said joe told the coroner he dashed downstairs and out the back and there she was rose hart fay brought a hand to her mouth there was such a thing as coincidence wasnt there the verdict was accidental death nobody quite believed that everybody thought shed killed herself but coroners tend to be kind when theres room for doubt when there isnt a note thats very sad fay said it certainly was mrs morrison halfburied in this overgrown patch at the back of this building in bristol where they lived there were these old railings jesus fay whispered they had spikes rusty iron spikes three of them went through miss hart one deeply into the abdominal area where she was carrying what was thought to be mr powyss baby fay said nothing very messy hughes said chapter iii people were flinging themselves out of windows to the ground and the grey masonry was cracking up around them the single bolt of lightning had caused a great jagged cleft in the tower fire and smoke spewed out whats this one mean guy morrison asked adam ivory didnt look up his wife whispered this card is simply called the tower or sometimes the tower struck by lightning it signifies a cataclysm is that good or bad guy was not greatly inspired by the tarot what hed really been after was a crystalball type of clairvoyant one could do things with crystal balls televisually he supposed it might be possible to match up some of these images with local scenes but it would be a bit contrived what i mean is are we talking about something cataclysmically wonderful or what it can be either way hilary ivory said she was older and bigger than her husband her hair was startlingly white good or evil a catharsis or simply a disaster with everything in ruins it depends on the spread the cameraman larry ember looked up from his viewfinder the sony still rolling his expression said how long you want me to hold this bloody shot guy made small circles with a forefinger to signify larry should keep it running initially this was to have been no more than wallpaper images of new age folk doing what they did but then hed persuaded adam ivory who called himself a tarotist to try and read the future of the crybbe project guy had managed to convince him that this was being shot with goffs full approval and would in no way threaten the ivorys tenure of this comfortable little towncentre apartment it occurred to him that the opportunity of relocating to form part of a likeminded community in crybbe had been something of a godsend for adam and hilary the tarot trade couldnt have been very lucrative in mold ivory had agreed to be recorded on vt while doing his reading but had stipulated there was to be no moving around no setting up different angles no zooming in or out or anything that might affect his concentration larry had done a bit of snorting and facepulling at this cameramen werent overconcerned about public relations and it was evident to guy that this cameraman thought this interviewee was a snotty little twerp guy morrison would not have disagreed completely but in the absence of a crystalball person this might be the best hed get in the general area of divination the camera had been rolling for nearly seven minutes and for the last four the shot had been entirely statis adam ivory who wore a suit and looked more like a dapper trainee accountant than a clairvoyant intent on the spread of nine cards the last of which was the tower little gaily dressed puppetfigures hurling themselves to the ground guy thought of rachel wade an unfortunate incident it would bring regional news crews into crybbe if they werent here already trespassers on his property adam are you going to tell us what the cards are indicating guy asked softly silence larry ember whod been a working cameraman when guy was still at public school stepped back from his tripod the camera still running he looked straight at his director the way cameramen did conveying the message youre supposed to be in charge mate what are you going to do about this fucking prat then turning away from guy larry lit a cigarette hilary ivory was on him in seconds furiously pointing at her husband and shaking her hair into a blizzard guy tensed just praying she didnt snatch the cigarette out of larrys fingers hed once known a film unit cameraman whod hit a woman in the face for less than that adam ivory himself rescued the situation he moved larry bent over his camera again ivorys movement amounted to taking off his glasses cleaning the lenses on the edge of the black tablecloth and putting the glasses back on again he resumed his study of the cards and larrys shoulders slumped in disgust time guy realized was getting on goff was coming back hed heard in the wake of this rachel wade business his eyes were drawn back to the tower it would be inexcusably tasteless to cut from shots of policemen and the upstairs window at the court to these little puppetfigures tumbling from a greystone tower struck by a bolt of lightning pity adam ivory looked up suddenly eyes large and watery behind the rimless glasses the soundmans boommike came up between ivorys legs fortunately out of sight forget it ivory croaked scrap it scrap it guy said scrap it he didnt believe this im sorry ivory said it isnt working i dont think its its not reliable the cards obviously dont like this situation i should never have agreed to do a reading in front of a tv camera as well as he fell silent staring hard at the cards as if hoping theyd rearranged themselves as what guy said trying to control his temper as well as what other negative influences ivory glanced nervously at the glowering cameraman and glanced quickly away the balance is so easily affected guy said carefully mr ivory are you trying to say the cards were the prediction was unfavourable the camera was still running guy very deliberately walked around to ivorys side of the table and peered over his shoulder at the cards he saw death he saw the devil i am not ivory swept the nine cards together in a heap guy noticed his fingertips were white trying to say he snatched his hands away as if the cards were tainted anything and pushed both hands underneath his thighs on the chair looking like a scared but peevish schoolboy larry ember shot half a minute of this then switched off and slid the camera from its tripod fucking tosser he muttered hilary ivory went to her husband looking concerned in a motherly way a single tarot card fell over the edge of the table guy picked it up it was the hanged man he put it carefully on the table faceup in front of ivory whats this one mean its very complicated hilary said the little mans hanging upside down by his foot so its got nothing to do with hanging as such look would you please leave the tarotist almost shrieked his face sweating like shrinkwrapped cheese under the tv lights i i dont feel well larry ember lit another cigarette no mr preece said i wont he and his wife had not been inhospitable catrin jones guys production assistant had been given the secondbest chair and a cup of milky instant coffee but you see she didnt know where to begin the blanket refusal was not at all what shed expected even though she conceded it had been a difficult week for mr preece with the drowning of his grandson and everything biscuit offered the mayor oh no thank you catrin wondered why there was an onion in a saucer on top of the television because what we were thinking she said rapidly is that it would be far better to talk to you in advance of tomorrow nights public meeting rather than afterwards at this stage because you are talkin to me said the mayor simply on camera mr preece catrin said on camera im not going to change my mind im keeping my powder dry oh but you see you wont be giving anything away because it wont be screened for months catrins voice growing shrill and wildly querulous and its not a great ordeal any more being on television we could shoot you outside the house so there wouldnt be any need for lights and as well as being terrifically gifted guy morrison is wellknown for being a very understanding caring sort of producer thats as maybe mr preece said all im sayin is i dont ave to be on telly if i dont want to be and i dont but you will be during tomorrow nights meeting whats the difference i doubt that very much mr preece you are supposed to be chairing the meeting aye but as you wont be allowed in with that equipment it makes no odds do it catrin outraged sat straight up in her chair but its a public meeting anybody can go in its all arranged with max goff max goff mr preeces leathery jowls wobbled angrily max goff isnt running this town yet young woman and if i says theres no telly theres no telly police sergeant wynford wiley will be in attendance and any attempts to smuggle cameras in there will be dealt with very severely but catrin was close to tears she had never before encountered anyone less than delighted and slightly awed at the possibility of being interviewed by guy morrison ave another cup of coffee said the mayor what he kept seeing was not rachel plunging out of the sky not the willowy silvery body broken on the rubbish pile he would not think of that not here in this grim victorian police station if he thought of that hed weep he wasnt going to indulge in that kind of luxury not here no what he kept seeing was the greybrown thing falling like smoke hed seen it again as he waited for the police it lay where it had landed three or four yards from the pile light as the fluff which collected in a vacuum cleaner ive seen them before powys thought now in museums in glass cases labelled remains of a mummified cat found in the rafters believed to have been a charm against evil the cat had fallen to the ground after rachel he hadnt told them that and you heard her scream did you she cried out before she fell she wasnt screaming as she fell i dont think so i mean no she wasnt didnt that strike you as odd nothing struck me at the time except the sheer bloody horror of it telling it four times at least how hed attacked the rubbish heap frantically hurling things aside to reach her lifting her head staring into her face eyes open so wide that you could almost believe until you fell the dead weight saw last desperate hopes corroding in your hands the angle of the head to the shoulders staring stricken into her face and the curfew bell began to toll a distant death knell can we return to this point about the door mr powys you say you tried the rear door to the courtyard and found it locked you couldnt budge it no it was locked i put my full weight against it then how do you explain why when we arrived this door was not only unlocked but was in fact ajar i cant explain that unless there was someone else in there with rachel someone other than you look ive told you i theyd gone over his statement several times last night and then said ok thank you very much you can go home now mr powys but well undoubtedly want to talk to you again but he knew as he tried to sleep back at the cottage that they were out there watching the place making sure he didnt go anywhere and it was no real surprise when the knock came on the door at am and the car was waiting a car to take him less than a quarter of a mile across the bridge to the police station you didnt tell us mr powys that this wasnt exactly a new experience for you you didnt tell us about rose so who had somebody had he sat on the metal chair alone in the interview room wishing he still smoked he could hear them conversing in the passage outside but not what they were saying so you went to leominster with fay morrison yes attractive woman mrs morrison yes what was wrong with the dog he had a badly injured leg this could lead back to jonathon preece in no time at all holistic policework everything interconnected joseph miles powys i am arresting you on suspicion of the murders of jonathon preece rachel wade and rose hart you dont have to say anything but anything you do say perhaps i should confess he thought looking up to the single small high window and seeing a hesitant sun in the white sky wobbling nervously like the yolk of a lightly poached egg maybe i did it maybe i killed her as surely as if id been standing behind her in the prospect chamber with both hands outstretched he thought if i start believing that were all finished so he went back to thinking about the cat chapter iv the sun was out for the first time in ages hanging around unsurely like a new kid standing in the school doorway fay walked aimlessly up the hill from the police station towards the town square and the cock pausing by the railings alongside the few steps to its door even a weak sun was not kind to this building its bricks needed pointing its timbers looked like old railway sleepers the cock didnt even have a sign as you might have imagined with a bight painting of a proud rooster crowing joyfully from the henhouse roof but knowing crybbe would you really imagine a sign like that and anyway whoever said the name referred to that kind of cock a far more appropriate emblem for this town fay thought would be a decidedly limp penis crybbe crybachu to wither fay looked down the alley towards the brick building housing the crybbe unattended studio and wondered if shed ever go in there again they were obviously handling the rachel wade story themselves nobody had even attempted to contact her i need the money fay realized suddenly i need an income i need a job why are they doing this to me she thought of joe powys i think ive got problems helping the police with their inquiries quite legitimately by the sound of it rachel wade the dead woman rachel wade he couldnt have surely she liked joe he seemed so normal for the author of a seminal new age treatise well comparatively normal oh god what was happening she didnt notice the door open quietly in a narrow townhouse to the left of the cock didnt hear the footsteps when she turned her head the woman was standing next to her looking across the square to the church good morning fay fay was too startled momentarily to reply shed never seen this woman before a woman nearly as small as she was but perhaps a quarter of a century older well never seen the face before jean wendle fay said i am last seen in a hat sitting very still impersonating the ghost of grace legge may i perhaps offer you a coffee jean wendle said catrin jones knew guy would be furious about the mayors ban on cameras at tomorrows public meeting she also knew from experience that when bad news was brought to him guy had a tendency to take it out on the messenger the need to salvage something from the morning had brought her to this subdued secluded house opposite the church at the entrance to the shaded lane leading down to crybbe court id be delighted to help you any way i can said graham jarrett hypnotherapist small silvery haired latefifties i was thinking perhaps this what is it recession regression it was very quiet and peaceful in the house with many heavy velvet curtains catrin could imagine people here falling easily into hypnosis yes regression she said this is past lives well we dont like to talk necessarily in terms of past lives graham jarrett said matteroffact like a customerfriendly bank manager but sometimes when taken back under hypnosis to an area of time prior to their birth people do seem to acquire different personalities and memories of events they couldnt be expected to have detailed knowledge of fantastic catrin said i certainly wouldnt be averse to having you film a session if the client was in agreement that would be excellent catrin said but i have to warn you that many of them do prefer it to be private oh listen my producer guy morrison is a wonderfully assuring man they would have nothing to worry about with him perhaps he would like to be regressed himself said graham jarrett with a meaningful smile oh well or you perhaps me think about it graham jarrett said lightly fay sat in the wooden bowchair jean wendle was on the edge of a huge floppy sofa with both hands around a mug of coffee she wore a white cashmere sweater and pink canvas trousers i heard it on the news she said about poor rachel wade yes fay said wondering if shed also heard about powys helping with inquiries its a crumbling old place the court what was she doing there at that time of night i dont know ive only heard the news too ill expect ill be finding out all i know is oh what the hell the woman was supposed to have been lawyer wasnt she maybe she could help all i know is the police arent convinced it was an accident joe powys apparently saw her fall and called the police theyre kind of holding him on suspicion a sunbeam licked one gilt handle of a big chinese vase with an umbrella in it then crept across the carpet to the tip of jean wendles moccasins oh dear jean said fay told her how things had been between joe and rachel in case she wasnt aware of that she described her own interrogation by the police what theyd told her about rose can they hold him do you think it doesnt sound as if they have any evidence to speak of jean said they cant convict on a coincidence they also have to ask themselves why this man should engineer the death his lover in the same way that a previous girlfriend died then immediately report it as an accident knowing that the police would sooner or later learn about the earlier misfortune i wonder how they found out about that so quickly did joe tell them himself i wonder do you mind if i smoke fay shook her head jean went across to the georgian table put down her coffee mug lifted the lid on an antique writing box found a thin cigar and a cheap disposable lighter she picked up a small silver ashtray and brought everything back to the sofa it could be of course that the police are looking at possible psychiatric angles fay was thrown yes im an accredited crank joe had said had said several times variations on the same selfdeprecating theme youre saying they think hes possibly a psychopath who is into pushing women out of upstairs windows and i dont know subconsciously hes seeking help and thats why he called the police after hed done it jean shrugged who knows how the police around here think perhaps theyll do some checks with bristol police and find out if he really was in london the afternoon rose died if they arrest him hell need a solicitor until they decide what theyre going to do i dont think theres anything we can do meanwhile jean wendle turned serious quizzical eyes on fay tell me about yesterday in the church tell me what that was all about fay sighed it seemed so long ago and in retrospect so foolish also it said too much about her state of mind that even when jean had turned in the pew to look at her she was still seeing somebody else its very silly she said i thought you were grace legge thats my fathers late wife jean wendle nodded showed no surprise at all youve been seeing this woman once i think i mean how can anyone say for sure they dont really exist do they only in our minds that depends on what we mean by existing i suppose well all i can say is that whatever it was im not anxious to see it again jean smiled she was fay thought the sort of woman sharp poised you wouldnt mind being like when you were older that is you wouldnt mind so much being older if you were this relaxed i dont quite know what came over me you were just so completely still that the thought occurred to me that there was nobody at all sitting next to dad but i was seeing grace jean said the time you really did see her when you saw whatever it was you saw where was this in the house in the office which used to be her best room the room that when she was alive i suppose she thought of as her sacred place so neat and perfect because nobody really used it maybe she thought this room had been violated by my desk and the equipment and everything or maybe i thought shed be angry and so i conjured up this fantasy you dont think that for one minute jean said no fay admitted all right i dont think that then please only tell me what you do think and stop looking at me as though youre wondering what i might change you into miss wendle jean jean look im sorry but it gets you like this after a while crybbe ive been here nearly a year and it gets to you you mean you cant relate to the people here you dont understand what makes them tick do you well i think jean lit the cigar at last people talk a lot about energy energy lines leylines trying to explain it scientifically makes them seem less like cranks if theyre talking about earth energies and life forces she inhaled deeply blew out a lot of blue smoke the pronouncements of new age folk are wrapped up in too much glossy jargon concealing massive ignorance what are you doing in crybbe then if you think its all bullshit oh it isnt all bullshit not by any means and at least theyre searching trying to reach out as it were which itself generates energy in fascinating contrast to the natives who appear to be consciously trying not to expend any at all and perhaps to the electricity company who cant seem to summon sufficient to see us through an entire day im sorry what are you saying im saying that perhaps the people of this town are as they are because theyve known for generations what a psychically unstable area this is and most people sadly in my view are afraid to confront the supernatural and all it implies for instance i should be very surprised if you were the only person who was seeing the shades of the dead in this town fay shivered slightly at that the shades of the dead sounded almost beautiful but grace wasnt i try to avoid letting anything get touched by the dead hand of science or indeed pseudoscience jean said but lets suppose that in certain places certain forms of energy collect our friend joe powys says in his book that the border country is have you read it the psychic departure lounge yes and poor henry kettle the dowser couldnt abide such terminology because he was really awfully superstitious and terrified of admitting it nothing psychic jean waved her cigar a terrible old humbug may he rest in light henry of course was just about as psychic as anyone can get anyway your ghost grace did she speak not a word and she didnt move no harmless then im so glad fay said sceptically can i explain please do ok if we stick to our scientific terminology then pockets of energy can accumulate in certain volatile areas and in such areas the spirits of the dead usually in a most rudimentary form may appear like a flash of static electricity and they go out just as quickly or youll get sounds or smells the scent of freshcut lilies or something or fresh shit jean said harshly it depends im sorry i wasnt flippant when it was happening to me i doubt you were jean said all right sights or sounds or smells or tastes even rarely anything simultaneous because theres rarely sufficient energy to support it if there was a massive accumulation of it then one might have a complete sensory experience i only saw her and it was cold it went cold energy loss jean said quite normal so if i may give you some advice if you should see your grace again blink a couple of times and shell be gone she cant talk to you she cant see you theres no brain activity there entirely harmless not pleasant though fay said reluctant to admit feeling better about the idea of grace as a mindless hologram no jean said the image of a dead person is rarely pleasant but its not as much of a problem as these damned power cuts you really think thats connected oh it has to be psychic activity causes all kinds of electrical anomalies voltage overloads or whatever they call them sometimes people will find they have terrific electricity bills they cant explain and the electricity people will come along and check the meters and the feeds and theyll say were really sorry madam but you must have consumed it our equipment cannot lie the truth is the householders may not have used it but something has fay remembered poor hereward newsome and his astronomical bills but your wee ghost jean said is the least of your problems here sporadic psychic activity on that level isnt enough to cause power fluctuations on the crybbe scale whatevers happening theres much more that needs to be explained before you can get close to it youve been very reassuring fay said thank you im also very impressed with what youre doing for dad hes almost his old self again i mean do you really think there any hope of i never discuss my patients jean said severely by the time fay left jean wendles house the sun had vanished behind an enormous black raincloud and she hurried down the street to make it home before the rain began again she saw guy across the square followed by his cameraman with the camera clamped to his shoulder and a tripod under his arm guy made as if to cross the road towards her but fay raised a hand in passing greeting and hurried on she couldnt face guy this morning fay someone said quietly she turned her head and then stopped blink a couple of times jean wendle had advised but this apparition didnt disappear joe she said he looked terrible bags under hopeless eyes hair like cigarette ash they had to let me go he said insufficient evidence fay said nothing can we talk maybe its not a good time fay heard herself say i dont think you killed rachel lets just leave it at that for now which was the last thing she wanted to do she bit her upper lip they had you in presumably he said yes and they told you about rose yes and thats why you dont want to talk about it look fay said ive lost the only real friend i had in this town i desperately want to talk about it i just it wasnt an accident powys said what it wasnt an accident after she fell something else came out what are you saving a cat fay looked at him there was something seriously abnormal about all this about joe powys too i dont mean a live cat this ones been dead for centuries tiddles fay said faintly getting a picture of black eyesockets and long sabreteeth and her she was becoming abnormal she had to get out of here cats thatve been dead for hundreds of years dont hurl themselves three storeys to the ground while somebody puts on a lightshow under the eaves hallucination fay said no fay thought about jean wendle and the energy anomalies about grace about the curfew and the howling and the town with no dogs joe said can you spare the rest of the day no she wanted to shriek and then to push past him and run away down the street and keep running i might have a job i have to go home and talk to my father and check the answering machine if it turns out youre free can i pick you up say twenty minutes would that be entirely safe she wanted to ask am i going to be all right as long as i stay away from open windows all right she said chapter v they said dont leave town or words to that effect joe powys floored the accelerator fuck them he said fay tried to smile theyd left crybbe on a road she wasnt too familiar with the road into wales by way of radnor forest which didnt seem to be a forest at all but a range of hills he hadnt said where they were going she didnt care she felt apart from it all in a listless kind of dream state she was watching a movie about a woman who was out for a drive with a murderer but in films like this the woman had no reason to suspect the man was a murderer only the viewers knew that theyd seen him kill she hadnt the woman in this particular movie had a black and white threelegged dog on her knee must be one of those experimental surrealist epics the car moved out of an avenue of trees into a spread of open sheepstrewn hills with steep wooded sides and hardly any houses before they left shed written a note for her dad fed the cats and listened to the answering machine which said hi fay this is james barlow from offas dyke just to say we understand max goffs coming back to crybbe and hell probably be holding a press conference around four this afternoon following this rachel wade business but dont worry about it gavin says to tell you hell be going over there himself so im free fay thought bitterly free as a bloody bird as if he were watching the same movie powys said if i killed her why would i report it why did you had to get an ambulance there might have been a chance did she oh god did she die instantly i heard it you know snap her neck she thought his voice was going to snap too and tried not to react what were you doing there anyway how come you happened to be under the window when she fell still dont know how much of that was coincidence dont know if she saw me if she was trying to attract my attention and fell against the bar but she didnt call out to me she just screamed as if she was screaming at something inside the house and couldnt she get out the house was locked up with her in it it was locked when i tried the doors it wasnt when the police got there so they say work that one out so she was killed by somebody in the house if she was killed humble well they didnt like each other but that doesnt explain the light doesnt really explain the cat either maybe rachel was holding the cat for some reason and it took longer to reach the ground because there was no weight left in it joe i have to ask you this what exactly were you doing at the court told the cops i was looking for rachel i think i was really looking for andy oh god he sighed what happened was hed planted a stone outside the cottage an exact replica of a thing thats been hanging over me for years a stone the bottle stone do you want to know this itll be the first time ive talked about it to anybody apart from the people there do you want to tell me i dont know ok yeah he fell silent what do you want fay said a drum roll sorry ok it goes back over twelve years to the moot the moot fay said solemnly its organized every year by the leyhunter magazine its a gathering of earthmysteries freaks from all over the place we meet every year in a different town to discuss the latest theories and walk the local leys i bet you all have dowsing rods and woolly hats youve been to one fay laughed it sounded very strange laughter today this particular year powys said it was in hereford birthplace of alfred watkins everybody was amazed there wasnt a statue nothing at all in the town to commemorate him which is how i came to establish trackways a couple of years later but anyway all the big names in earth mysteries were there and we were all there too rose and me andy ben corby who was at college with us bit of a wheelerdealer the guy who actually managed to sell golden land to a publisher and henry kettle of course we knew there was a deal coming through and on the monday morning after the moot before we all set off for home ben rang the publishers and learned theyd flogged the paperback rights for ten thousand quid powys smiled bloody fortune well it was a nice day so we decided rose and i to invite the others the people whod been in on the book from the beginning to come out for a celebratory picnic we wondered where we could go within reach of hereford then andy said listen he said i know this place she looked out through the side window of the mini she didnt recognize the country one hill made a kind of plateau she counted along the top like tiny ornaments on a green baize mantelpiece three mounds little tumps a thin river was woven into the wide valley bottom powys was dizzily swivelling his head somewhere here the third mound had a cleft in it like an upturned vulva yes he said yes he hit the brakes pulled into the side of the road it was down there the bottle stone powys nodded let me get this right fay said this legend whatever it was its a common enough ritual ive found out since it can be a stone or a statue or even a tree yew trees are favourites for it you walk around it usually anticlockwise a specific number of times thirteen isnt uncommon and then you have an experience a vision or whatever theres a church in south herefordshire where if you do it youre supposed to see the devil but you didnt see anything like that no just this sensation of plunging into a pit and becoming impaled and there was nothing ethereal about it i can feel it now ripping through the tissue blood spurting out yes thank you i get the picture but it happened to me that was the point no indication of any danger to rose was she unhappy not at all that day at the bottle stone she was very happy thats whats so agonizing ive had twelve years to get over it i cant if i could make sense of it but i cant and it was how long before she fell not quite two weeks ok thirteen days hmm fays fingers were entwined in the fur around arnolds ears was was she unhappy at all afterwards i mean pregnant women it was at a very early stage i dont even know if it had been officially confirmed she hadnt told you powys shook his head the post mortem report that was the first i knew about it so this experience you had on the socalled fairy mound what are your feelings about that do you feel you were being given a warning that there was something you should have realized powys said youre interviewing me arent you i can spot the inflection oh god im sorry joe force of habit how about if i try and make the questions less articulate no carry on at least its more civilized than the cops no it didnt make any sense any more than the average nightmare and you told rose no why not because it had been such a nice day up to then because the future looked so bright because i didnt want to cast a pall i just said when they dumped me on the mound i must have fainted i said i was very dizzy i did tell andy about it after after rose died and what did he say he said i should have told rose that was tactful of him and what do you think fay what do you think i should have done what about henry kettle what did he say he wanted nothing to do with it he used to say this kind of thing was like putting your fingers in a plug socket fay glanced at him quickly uneasily over arnolds ears was it possible that joe powys was indeed insane or worse perhaps was it possible he was sane he was hunched over the steering wheel oh fay how could i have killed rachel he looked at her im not saying i was in love with her wed only known each other a couple of days but she looked up into the hills all the little tumps laid out neatly he said think arnold can manage a walk arnold struggled to his feet on fays knee he obviously thinks so fay said come on then lets go and find the bottle stone max began to breathe hard it was astonishing take me over again mel max said then maybe well get guy morrison and his crew to come up with you we have to have pictures of this for the record he leaned forward thoughts of rachels death blown away by all this magic melvyn his helicopter pilot took them over the town again making a wide sweep of the valley max counted six standing stones first time round hed missed the one by j m powyss cottage near the river he couldnt believe it a week ago crybbe was scattered random like somebodyd crapped it out and walked away now it had form and subtle harmonies like a crystal it had been earthed he could spot clear as if it had been blasted in with a giant aerosol paintspray the main line coming off the tump it cut through the court cleaved a path through the woods until it came to a small clearing and in the centre of this clearing surrounded by tree stumps and chainsawed branches there was a tall stone thin and sharp as a nail from up here lucky he owned the wood lucky also that nobody in crybbe seemed to give a shit about tree conservation nice work andy andy such a plain and simple userfriendly name but the thought of andy made him shiver and he liked to shiver the line eased out of the wood across the graveyard and sliced into the church clean down the centre of the tower then it ploughed across the square and hit this building which building go in a bit mel the helicopter banked and max looked back shit it was the cock hed never realized the line cut through the pub the pub hed known intuitively he had to buy maybe sleeping there in that crummy room hed picked up the flow these things happened when you were keyed into the system his thoughts came back to rachel who for once had not been keyed in who hadnt known how to handle country people who hadnt believed in the crybbe project hadnt believed in much should he feel any kind of guilt here leaving her to handle things while he was in london knowing she was out of sympathy with the whole deal ok max yeah sure mel take us in thrown out on the fucking rubbish heap like the court itself didnt want anybody in there hostile to the project rough justice jeez was this fanciful or what what hed do hed have some kind of memorial to rachel fashioned in stone a plaque on a gate or a stile along the leywalk well away from the court couldnt have people staring up at the prospect chamber yeah this was where that woman took a dive just here but accidents were bad news first thing hed need to have that crossbar replaced arrange things so the whole room was sealed off until it was fully safe they cleared the river and headed back over the town towards the court the other leys were not so obvious as the big one down the middle this was because fewer than half the new stones were in place several farmers refusing to give permission until after the public meeting or more likely they were holding out to see how keen he was how much he was prepared to pay yeah he could relate to that cars in the courtyard people waiting for him press conference scheduled for pm he looked at his rolex it was time to find out precisely what had happened talk to the police before he faced the newsmen and the tv crews whose main question would be this mr goff this is obviously a terrible thing to happen it must surely have overshadowed your project here the press were just so flaming predictable arnold was in fact moving remarkably well he doesnt think hes disabled fay said he just thinks hes unique they climbed over a stile arnold managed to get under it without too much difficulty she picked him up for a while carried on walking across the field with the dog in her arms the few sheep ignored them the sky was full of veined clouds yellow at the edges like wedges of ancient stilton cheese powys had watched fay wander down the field and at one point memory vibrating on its helipad turned her into rose in a long white frock and a wide straw hat very french impressionist he blinked and rose was fay again in lightblue jeans and a greenpeace tshirt she put arnold down he fell over and got up again fay stopped and turned to him where is it then he said faintly it isnt here i thought perhaps there was something wrong with my eyes fay said i dont understand it this was the field theres the river see the hills are right theres the farmhouse just through those trees fay didnt say a word you think im bonkers dont you scheduled ancient monuments dont just disappear she said do they chapter vi one of the women who cleaned the church was paid to come into the vicarage on weekdays to prepare murrays lunch he rarely saw her do it especially in summer it would just be there on a couple of dishes under clingfilm variations on a coldmeat salad and a piece of fruit pie with whipped cream she never asked if he enjoyed it or if there was something he would prefer he lifted up a corner of the clingfilm saw a whitish glistening smudge of something mayonnaise he knew it could only be mayonnaise but still murray retched and pushed the plate away this had been happening increasingly of late hed scraped the lunch untouched into the dustbin he never seemed to miss it afterwards rarely felt hunger although he knew he was losing weight and even he could see his face was gaunt and full of long shadows pretty soon he though sourly there would be rumours going around that he had aids next week he might let it be known that he was interested in a move he would see how he felt today was not the day to do anything hasty today hed left the vicarage as usual before eight and walked the fifty yards to the church where hed found what hed found the church door had not been damaged because it was never locked nothing had been torn or overturned only the cupboard in the vestry where the communion wine and the chalice were kept had been forced murray had heard of cases where centuriesold stained glass had been smashed or in the case of catholic churches plaster statues pounded to fragments swastikas spraypainted on the altarcloth defecation in the aisle nothing so unsubtle here what was missing was that element of frenzy of uncontrolled savagery this was what had unnerved him made him look over his shoulder down the silent nave candles his own christmas candles had been left burning on the altar two of them one so far gone that it was no more than a wick in a tiny pool of liquid wax between the candles stood the communion chalice not empty what was in the bottom of the cup was not mayonnaise murray had looked inside once then turned away with a short whispered outraged prayer it might have been a prayer or it might have been a curse either way it was out of character his reserve had been cracked with distaste hed placed the chalice on the stone floor remembering too late about fingerprints but knowing even then hat he would not be calling in the police because that was all theyd done and it was enough it was inherently worse than any orgy of spraypaint and destruction the single small symbolic act profoundly personal almost tidy appalling in its implication but nothing in itself simply not worth reporting to the police and thus alerting the newspapers and fay morrison they always ask you he remembered a colleague with an urban parish complaining once if you suspect satanism what are you supposed to say its certainly more than antisocial behaviour but do you really want some spotty little vandal strutting around thinking hes the prince of darkness but this he thought staring down at his clingwrapped lunch suddenly nauseous and unsteady this is another gesture to me its saying come out come out priest come out and fight however as hed thought while rinsing out the chalice this morning this can hardly be down to tessa byford can it murray had thrown away the candles performed a small lonely service of reconsecration over the chalice and decided to keep the outrage to himself by the time the monday cleaner came in at ten there had been no sign of intrusion as for the small cupboard in the vestry he would unscrew it from the wall himself and take it to an ironmongers in leominster explaining how hed had to force the lock after being stupid enough to lose the key silly me ha ha impractical souls vicars absentminded too just how absentminded he was becoming was brought dramatically home to him when the doorbell rang just before two oclock and he parted the lace curtains to see a hearse parked in front of the house with a coffin in the back it had slipped his mind completely but even so wasnt it at least a day too early ah mr beech the undertaker said cheerfully got jonathon preece for you yes of course funerals wednesday afternoon so its just the two nights in the church is it yes i i wasnt expecting him so soon i thought with the post mortem aye we took him for that first thing this morning and collected him afterwards oh but didnt you have things to er no we cleaned him up beforehand mr beech if theres no embalming involved its a quick turnover right then top of the aisle is it bottom of the steps before the altar thats where we usually yes fine ill now you just leave it to us mr beech we know our way around well make im comfortable in that case jean wendle said firmly do you mind if i come in and wait if that wouldnt be disturbing you a refusal would be impossible this was a deliberate uncompromising footinthedoor situation it having occurred to jean that if she took it easy she might actually get more out of the wife mrs preece took half a step back with no pretence of not being reluctant she held the cottage door open just wide enough for jean to slide inside there were roses around the door which was nice which showed somebody cared or had cared thank you the first thing jean noticed in the parlour was a fresh onion on a saucer on top of the television she was fascinated she hadnt seen this in years mrs preece actually had hair like an onion coiled into a tight white bun and everything else about her was closed up just as tight she looked unlikely to offer her guest a cup of tea i do realize things must be very difficult for you at present jean said if there is anything i can do mrs preece snorted jean smiled at her the reason im here the public meeting will be upon us tomorrow evening and i felt there were one or two things i should like to know in advance if youre yere as a spy for mr max goff mrs preece said bluntly then theres no need to dress it up jean was not unpleasantly surprised do you know mrs preece she said being equally blunt this is the first experience ive ever had of an indigenous crybbe person coming right out with something instead of first skirting furtively around the issue maybe you been talking to the wrong people said mrs preece and who would you say are the wrong people by the way i wouldnt waste that nice onion on me i beg your pardon just dont tell me jean said levelly that the onion on the saucer is there to absorb paint smells or germs you put it there to attract any unwelcome emanations from people you dont want in your house and when theyve gone you quietly dispose of the onion will you be getting rid of it when i leave mrs preece mrs preece face reddening looked down at her clumpy brown shoes or am i flattering myself jean said i dont know what youre talking about och away with you mrs preece im no one of your london innocents youre none of you innocent mrs preece cried youre all as guilty as as her voice dropped as guilty as sin of what jean asked gently mrs preece shook her head youre not getting me going im not stupid you must know as youre doing no good for this town and why is that mrs preece do you mind if i sit down and before mrs preece could argue jean had slipped into the mayors fireside chair because it seems to me you see that all the new people love crybbe just exactly the way it is mrs preece they would hate anything to happen to the local traditions in fact thats why im here i was hoping your husband could tell me a wee bit about the curfew mrs preece turned away im also compiling a small history of the town and its folklore jean said nothing to tell mrs preece said eventually nothing thats not written down already i dont think so i think there is a remarkable amount to tell which has never been written down mrs preece stood over jean she wore a large striped apron like a butchers discernible anxiety in her eyes now tell me about it mrs preece tell me about the ritual which your husbands family has maintained so selflessly for so many centuries just a bequest the mayors wife said thats all a bequest of land a long time ago in the sixteenth century depending on the bell to be rung every night this is codswallop jean wendle said this is a smokescreen well we ave the documents to prove it mrs preece was getting angry thats how much its codswallop oh im sure you do but the real reason for the curfew is it not is to protect the town from well lets call it the black dog mrs preeces face froze like a stopped clock into the silence came lazy footsteps on the path be my husband back very visibly relieved damnation jean almost said aloud so close but it wasnt the mayor a thin streaky haired youth with an earring shambled in without knocking all right gran i come to tell you you stay outside with them boots warren too late gran the youth was in the livingroom now giving jean wendle the onceover with his narrow eyes ah she thought the surviving grandson interesting hello jean said so youre warren s right yeah from his earring hung a tiny silvery deaths head i was very sorry to hear about your brother warren blew out his mouth and nodded aye well one o them things isnt it anyway gran message from the old from dad all it is they brought jonathon back and es in the church i see said mrs preece quietly thank you warren in is coffin said warren jean observed that the boy was somewhat less than griefstricken lids on like warren said jean thought he sounded disappointed but es not screwed down see so if you wanna gon ave a quick look at im theres no problem no i dont think i shall his grandmother said thank you warren tiny tears were sparkling in her eyes if youre worried the ole lid might be a bit eavy for you gran warren said considerately i dont mind goin along with you i got half an hour or so to spare before i got to leave he turned to jean i got this band see we practises most monday and wednesday nights mrs preece said her voice high and tight no thank you warren warren watched his grandmothers reaction with his head on one side this boy jean registered with considerable interest is trying not to laugh see its no problem gran warren said slowly and slyly cause ive already ad im off once see that ole lid he stood with his hands on narrow hips encased in tight leather trousers and his lips were just the merest twist away from a smirk jean had been listening to the tension in the air in the small brown livingroom humming and then singing dangerously offkey sending out invisible wires that quickly tautened and then finally snapped get out mrs preeces big face suddenly buckled get out she turned to jean breathing rapidly and you as well if you please jean stood up and moved quietly to the door im really very sorry mrs preece things is not right mrs preece said sniffing hard things is far from right and no youre not none of yous sorry theyd stopped for coffee but hadnt eaten couldnt face it fay still felt a bit sick and more than a bit alone she badly needed someone she could rely on and joe powys no longer seemed like the one but while she felt slightly betrayed she was also sorry for him he looked even more lost than she felt all i can think of he said driving listlessly back to crybbe is that the stone near the cottage is the actual one the bottle stone you mean he had it dug up under cover of darkness and sounds crazy doesnt it im afraid it does joe why would boultontrow want to do that anyway well he knows that was the worst thing that ever happened to me and and he wanted to bring it all back by confronting you with the stone again that would make him well you know quite evil i cant imagine im sorry im asking too much of you maybe i ought to stay out of your way for a while fay looked at him hopelessly maybe well take some time and think about things see what we can come up with she decided shed go after all to goffs press conference in a private capacity just to listen see what questions other people raised and how they were answered i dont think we have much time joe powys said i really dont why i mean before what i dont know he said he looked broken alone again mrs preece shut herself in the livingroom fell into her husbands sunken old chair and began to cry bitterly her white hair spooling free of its bun strands getting glued by the tears to her mottled cheeks when the telephone rang she ignored it and it stopped after some minutes mrs preece got up from the chair went to the mirror and tried to piece together her bun without looking at her face out of the corner of her right eye she saw the onion in its saucer on top of the television set then mrs preece let out a scream so harsh and ragged it felt as though the skin was being scoured from the back of her throat the onion fresh this morning was as black as burnt cork chapter vii goff said as you say gavin its been a hell of blow obviously cast a pall over things here racheld been with me nearly four years she was the best pa i ever had but you ask if its gonna dampen my enthusiasm for what were doing here i have to say no of course it isnt what we have here is too important for crybbe and for the human race gavin ashpole of offas dyke radio nodded sympathetically at the back behind everybody fay groaned nobody noticed her not even guy there were about a dozen reporters and two tv crews in the stableblock everybody asking what fay thought were excruciatingly banal questions but ok what else could they ask what did they have to build on if it hadnt involved max goff all this sad little episode would have been worth was a couple of paragraphs in the local paper and an offas dyke oneday wonder a small insignificant accidental death ok goff didnt want the residue of anything negative hanging on him or the crybbe project but if rachel had been here shed have talked him out of this minicircus it wasnt worth a press conference which would only draw the wrong kind of attention but then if rachel had been here fay fell the clutch of sorrow in her breast and something else less definable but close to anxiety joe had said got to sort this out im going to find him boultontrow is that wise i want to take a look at this place hes got in the wood i saw it yesterday when i look the shortcut to church it might be better inside but it looks like a hovel well find out i didnt like it i didnt like the feel of the place joe had shrugged shed felt torn on one hand yes he really ought to sort this thing out even it meant facing up to his own delusions on the other hand well ok she was scared for him you go to your press conference hed said touched her arm hesitantly and then walked away head down across the square towards the churchyard so here she was sitting a few yards behind guys stocky aggressivelooking cameraman guy standing next to him occasionally whispering instructions the chairs had been laid out in three rows in the middle tier of the stableblock so that the assembled hacks were slightly higher than goff and yet somehow he appeared to be looking down on them goff was at his desk his back to the window and the tump as if this was his personal powersource max one of the hacks said barry speake evening news can i ask you what kind of feedback youre getting from the local community here i mean whats the local response to your plans to introduce what must seem to a lot of ordinary people to be rather bizarre ideas all this leylines and astrology and stuff goff gave him both rows of teeth think its bizarre do you barry im not saying i think its bizarre max but but you think simple country folk are too unsophisticated to grasp the concept isnt that a little patronizing barry there was a little buzz of laughter no but hold on goff raised a hand theres a serious point to be made here we call this new age and sure its new to us but folks here in crybbe have an instinctive understanding of what its about because this place has important traditions what you might call a direct line to the source something id ask the author j m powys to elaborate on if he were here yeah lady at the back fay stood up mr goff youre obviously spending a lot of money here in crybbe yeah just dont ask me for the figures muted laughter fay said as my colleague tried to suggest it is what many people would consider a slightly bizarre idea attempting to rebuild the towns prehistoric heritage putting back all these stones for instance what id like to know is why crybbe who told you about this place who told you about the stones who said it would be the right place for what you had in mind goffs little eyes narrowed he was wearing unusually a dark suit today out of respect for the dead rachel or his image who exactly are you he said which paper you from fay morrison adding freelance with a defiant glance at ashpole yeah i thought so hed never actually seen her before he was certainly making up for that now little eyes never wavering im not sure how relevant your question is today goff said but yeah on the issue of how we came to be doing what were doing here well weve been kicking this idea around for a year or two ive had advisers and people looking what kind of advisers who exactly the questions were coming out without forethought she was firing blind in fact what the hell was she doing she hadnt planned to say a word just sit there and listen goff looked pained ms morrison i dont see yeah ok i have many friends and associates in whats become known as the new age movement let me say i dont like that term its been devalued trivialized right but yeah it was suggested to me that if i was looking for a location which was not only geophysically and archaeologically suited to research into forgotten landscape patterns and configurations but was also suited shall we say atmospherically to research into human spiritual potential then crybbe fitted the bill he produced a modest philanthropic sort of smile and it was also clearly a little down on its luck in need of the economic boost our centre could give it so i came along and looked around and i well that answer your question was it the late henry kettle did he suggest you came here no i sought advice from henry kettle in a very small way at a later stage we were already committed to crybbe by then what are you getting at here goff leaned back in his leather rockandswivel chair he was alone at the desk although humble and a couple of people she didnt recognize were seated a few yards away fay didnt think andy boultontrow was among them well she said still on her feet henry kettle was of course the first person to die in an accident here wasnt he aw now hey goff said several reporters turned their heads to look at fay maybe some of them hadnt heard about henry he was hardly a national figure except in earthmysteries circles his death had been a minor local story his connection with goff had not been general knowledge still wasnt outside crybbe it occurred to her that what shed inadvertently done here was set the more lurid papers up with a possible curse of crybbe story she imagined rachel wade looking down on the scene from wherever she was rolling her eyes and passing a hand across her brow in pained disbelief fay started to feel just a little foolish gavin ashpole sitting well away from her was smirking discreetly into his lap she knew goff had to make a move here he did he gave the hacks a confidential smile yeah take a good look he said extending a hand towards fay this is ms fay morrison more heads turned guys not surprisingly was one of the few which didnt ms morrison drawled goff is a smalltime freelance reporter who earns a crust here in town by stirring up stories nobody else can quite see some bastard laughed unfair fay said starting to sweat henry kettle henry kettle goff changed effortlessly to a higher gear was a very elderly man who died when his car went out of control probably due to a stroke or a heart attack well no doubt find out what happened when the inquest is held meantime i and any rightthinking rational person would certainly take a dim view of any sensationmongering attempt to make something out of the fact that my company had paid him a few pounds to do a few odd jobs i think suggesting any link between the death of henry kettle in a car accident and rachel wade in a fall is in extremely poor taste indicating a lamentable lack of professionalism and a certain desperation perhaps in any selfstyled journalist who raised it goff relaxed knowing how good he was at this fay whod never been much of an orator lapsed redfaced into a very lonely silence now goff said not looking at her if there are no further questions i have ten minutes to do any tv and radio interviews outside the heads had turned away from fay shed lost it you dont do yourself any favours do you fay ashpole said drily out of the side of his mouth passing her on the way out not even looking at her i suppose guy morrison said youd know about all the suicides around here wouldnt you seven pm the only other customer in the public bar at the cock was this large man the local police sergeant wynford somebody he was leaning on the bar with a pint obviously relieved at unloading the two divisional cid men whod spent the day in town in connection with this rachel wade business guy was feeling relieved too his heart had dropped when max goff had approached him immediately after the conclusion of the appalling press conference guy expecting to be held responsible for his wayward exwife and at the very least warned to keep her out of goffs way in future but all goff wanted was for the crew to get some aerial pictures of crybbe from his helicopter so that was ok guy had sent catrin jones up with larry and escaped to the pub sooner or later hed be forced to have a discreet word with goff and explain where things stood between him and fay ie that she was an insane bitch and hed had a lucky escape meanwhile there was this business of the suicide and the haunting this was upsetting him he wouldnt be able to concentrate fully until it was out of the way because guy morrison didnt like things he didnt understand he waited for wynfords reaction hed got into suicides by suggesting that perhaps rachel wade had killed herself would they ever really know guy morrison was an expert at manipulating conversation but wynford didnt react at all as if he hadnt noticed the silence guy said doesnt do a places reputation any good i suppose being connected with a suicide i was talking to that woman who runs the gallery it seems her house is allegedly haunted by a chap who topped himself wynford didnt look up from his beer but he spoke at last you been misinformed my friend i dont mean anything recent guy said this probably goes back a good while talking about the same place are we heavily renovated stone farmhouse about half a mile out of town on the hereford road yes yes wynford said the ole thomas farm well as i said it could be going back quite a while i mean any time this century i suppose maybe earlier how long had there been cutthroat razors anyway he wondered hundreds of years probably bit of a romancer that woman you ask me wynford said from off see meaning a newcomer guy supposed it was an interesting fact that he personally was never regarded as a stranger in areas where he was recognized from television if theyd seen you on the box youd been in their livingrooms so you werent an intruder except perhaps here in crybbe no look guy said this happened in the bathroom oldish chap cut his own throat with one of those oldfashioned open razors wynford licked his cherubs lips his eyes frosted with suspicion whats wrong guy asked somebody tell you to ask me about this did they no guy said of course not you sure look sergeant whats the problem here wynford had a drink of beer no problem sir no you do guy was about to accuse him of knowing something about this but keeping it to himself he looked into the little inscrutable features in the middle of the big melon face and knew hed be wasting his time wynford swallowed a lot of beer wiped his mouth his face was very red hes on the defensive guy thought and he doesnt like that he was right wynford looked at him for the first time somebody said you was married to that fay or is it you just got the same name no its true im afraid we were married for what nearly three years i suppose wynford smiled conspiratorially a sinister sight bit of a goer was she what an appalling person guy who didnt like people asking him questions unless they were about his television work looked at his watch and claimed he was late for a shoot and actually they had got something arranged for later catrin had set up one of those regressive hypnotist chaps and agreed to be the subject should be entertaining perhaps in some past life shed actually been someone interesting he wondered as he strolled into the square what crime she could have committed to get landed with the persona of catrin jones in the crybbe unattended studio gavin ashpole sniffed he knew the pace used to be a toilet but that wasnt what he could smell this was a musky perfumed smell and the odd thing was that gavin wasnt sure he could actually smell it at all it was just there probably because fay morrison used this studio for an hour or so every day there were a few of her scripts on the spike in the outer room all handwritten big and bold in turquoise ink gavin picked up the phone and sniffed the mouthpiece sweating comfortably cooling in his shellsuit gavin was a fitness freak kept a holdall in the back of his car with his jogging gear and his trainers inside any spare half hour or so hed get changed go for a run tuned your body tuned your mind and other people could sense it too you were projecting creative energy dynamism hed got an hours running in tonight been up into the hills felt good in control of himself and his destiny within a year hed either be managing editor of offas dyke radio or hed have moved on unlike fay morrison who was over the hill and going down the other side fast left to him the station would never have agreed to use her stuff she was unreliable awkward to deal with and obviously unbalanced bloody sexy though the thought hit him surprisingly hard a muscular pulse where you noticed it he hadnt really considered her on this level before she was older than he was shed had a lot more experience on radio and although she never mentioned that it was always there in the background making her sound superior and she was a nutter not rational not objective as a reporter hed see the boss tomorrow and explain precisely what had happened at goffs press conference shes doing us a lot of damage hed say if shes put max goffs back up who else is she antagonizing no need to say anything to her or put anything in writing just fade her out use less and less of her material until she stops bothering to send any then well put somebody else in gavin attached a length of redleader to the end of his tape it hadnt taken much editing just a fortysecond clip for the morning he rang the newsroom to tell them he was ready to send put on the cans waited for the news studio to come through on the line he felt fay in the cans shed worn them over that darkblonde hair sexy bitch he stretched his legs under the desk feeling the calf muscles tighten and relax imagining her in here with him in this tiny little studio not big enough for two youd be touching one another all the time projecting forward to tomorrow night he was back in crybbe covering the public meeting the big confrontation between goff and the town councillors fay had followed him in here apologizing for her behaviour saying shed been worrying about her father letting it take her mind off her work couldnt handle things any more couldnt he see that he could see her now kneeling down by the side of his chair looking up at him got to help me gavin why should i help you i like muscular men gavin hard men fit men thats how you can help me gavin he put his hands out one each side of her head gripped her roughly by the hair her lips parted gavin huh weve been calling out for five minutes you couldnt have been gavin rasped into the microphone he was sweating like a bloody pig we could certainly hear you panting mate what were you doing exactly very funny elton ive been for a run six miles you going to take some level or not go ahead im rolling hope youre going to clean up in there afterwards gavin angrily gavin snapped the switch set his tape turning this was another little clever dick whod be looking for a new job when he was managing editor he took his hand out of his shellsuit trousers put it on the desk below the mike and watched it shaking as if it wasnt his hand at all chapter viii on reflection maybe chopping holes in this particular wood wasnt such a crime it was not a pleasant wood something powys hadnt consciously taken in when they were here yesterday and fay had been so incensed about the slaughter of the trees and rachel had no he didnt like the wood and it was uncared for too many trees overcrowded trees which had died left to rot strangled by ivy and creepers their white limbs sticking out like the crowpicked bones of sheep while sickly saplings fought for the soil in between the corpses the wood was a buffer zone between the tump and the town and some of what would otherwise have reached the town had been absorbed by the wood which was why it had such a bad feel and why people probably kept out and perhaps why andy boultontrow had chosen to live there until you reached the clearing the path was the only sign that anyone had been in this wood for years it was too narrow for vehicles a horse could make it just about but nobody with car would want keepers cottage it was redbrick probably s small and mean with little square windows looked as if it had only one bedroom upstairs it was in a part of the wood where conifers alaskan spruce or something had choked out all the hardwoods crowding in like giant weeds blinding keepers cottage to the daylight a sterile place no birds no visible wildlife hardly the pick of goffs properties hardly the type of dwelling for a boultontrow even the gardeners which he assumed certain boultontrows would employ wouldnt be reduced to this the door had been painted green once a long time ago powys knocked no answer unsurprising nobody in his right mind would want to spend too much time in keepers cottage ok either he isnt here or he is and keeping quiet powys felt old sorrow and new sorrow fermenting into fury he called out andy no answer andy i want to talk not even an echo powys walked around the cottage it had no garden no outbuildings only a rough brickbuilt shelter for logs the shelter was coming to pieces most of the bricks were loose and crumbling so he helped himself to one a brick and he went to the back of the house away from the path and he hefted the brick thoughtfully from hand to hand for a moment or two before hurling it at one of the back windows a whole pane vanished powys slipped a hand inside and opened the window dementia alex thought was an insidiously cunning ailment it crept up on you with the style of a pickpocket striking while your attention was diverted one didnt wake up in the morning and think hello im feeling a bit demented today better put the trousers on back to front and spray shaving foam on the toothbrush no the attitude of the intelligent man saying look its been diagnosed its there so im going to have to watch myself jolly carefully was less effective than one might expect and the problem with this type of dementia furred arteries not always letting the lift go all the way to the penthouse as it were was that the condition could be at its most insidiously dangerous when you were feeling fine today hed felt fine but he wasnt going to be fooled keep calm at all times jean wendle had said learn how to observe yourself and your actions be detached watch yourself without involvement ill show you how to do this dont worry but for now just keep calm which wasnt easy when you lived with someone like fay whod made a career out of putting people on the spot shed come in just after six and put together rather a nice salad with prawns and other items she obviously hadnt bought in crybbe bottle of white wine too and then over coffee dad we didnt get a chance to finish our conversation this morning didnt we youre feeling ok arent you not too bad because i want to get something sorted out god preserve me from this child alex thought always had to get everything sorted out the business of the revox you remember the vandalism of course i remember the tape recorder yes well they havent actually pulled anybody in for it yet havent they and perhaps you dont think they ever will well with that fat fellow in charge of the investigation i must say im not overoptimistic no no regardless of wynford you dont really think fay alex said how do you know what i think or what i dont think and what gives you because i heard you talking to grace oh said alex he had been about to take a sip of coffee he didnt fay was waiting well you know alex said switching to autopilot ive often had parishioners old people who talked to their dead husbands and wives all the time nothing unusual about it fay it brought them comfort they didnt feel so alone any more perfectly natural kind of therapy dad yes has grace brought you comfort alex glared with resentment into his daughters green eyes why did you think it was grace who smashed up the revox he started to laugh uneasily shes dead thats right alex said look times getting on ive a treatment booked for eight with jean whats she charging you out of interest nothing at all so far that is i er gave her a basic outline of the financial position and she suggested i should leave her her fee in my will very accommodating perhaps you could make a similar arrangement regarding your tab at the cock now to return to my question alex stood up let me think about this one would you fay how could he tell her his real fears about this well of course dead people couldnt destroy property on that scale even poltergeists only tossed a few books around even if dead people felt a great antipathy to someone in their house it was only living people who were capable of an act of such gross violence but perhaps dead people were capable of making living people do their dirty work did i he asked himself as he walked up bell street was it me alex felt terribly hot and confused just wanted to feel the cool hands again the microphone was in the way jarrett had it on a bracketthing attached to the ceiling so that it craned over the couch like an oldfashioned dentists drill guy said rather impatiently what do we need that thing for anyway if were recording the whole session on vt i understand that guy jarrett said but i need it i keep a record of everything also it acts as a focus for the subject im using the microphone in the same way as hypnotists do to swing their watches on a chain ok guy said ill go with that well do some shots the mike make it swim before our eyes ok larry no problem ill do it afterwards come in over catrins shoulder we ok with the lights guy looked at graham jarrett small and tidy in a maroon cardigan silver haired and just a tiny bit camp graham jarrett said one light may actually assist us if it isnt directly in her eyes because well all be thrown into shadow and catrin will be in her own little world can you make do with one say that big one i dont see why not guy said gratified remembering the hassle hed had with adam ivory nice to know some new age people could live with television jarrett arranged a tartan travelling rug over the couch and patted a cushion ok then catrin lie down and make yourself comfortable i want you to be fully relaxed so have a good wriggle about wheres your favourite beach somewhere on the med west indies porth dinllaen catrin said patriotically on the lleyn in north wales guy turned away concealing a snigger jarrett adjusted the mike switched on a cassette machine on a metal table on wheels like a drinks trolley ok can we try it with the lights guy signalled to the lighting man and catrins face was suddenly lit up he thought like a fat madonna on a christmas card there was a tiny black personal microphone clipped into a fold of her navyblue jumper right catrin jarrett said softly its a soft warm afternoon youre on the beach hang on tom the soundman said lets have some level say something catrin tell us what you had for lunch it was another twenty minutes or so before everyone was satisfied guy watched jarrett taking off catrins shoes and draping another travelling rug over her stumpy legs just below the knees no bad thing catrins legs wouldnt add a great deal to the picture only wished hed known about this far enough in advance to have set up someone more photogenic he thought with some amazement back to this morning when the nightterrors had persuaded him that he ought to invite catrin to share his room tonight he shuddered thank heaven he hadnt said anything to her ok said jarrett its very warm not too hot just pleasant perhaps you can hear the sea lapping at the sand in the distance and if you look up why theres the sun the big light shone steadily down happy catrin catrin nodded her lips plumped up into a little smile but i dont want you to look at the sun catrin id like you to look at the microphone you must be quite comfortable with microphones working for the bbc guy watching her intently didnt notice her go under or slide into a hypnotic trance or whatever they did nothing about her seemed to change as jarrett took her back to previous holidays when she was a child he almost thought she was putting it on when she began to burble in a littlegirl sort of voice about her parents and her sister and paddling in the sea and seeing a big jellyfish lapsing into welsh at one point her first language she would fake it he knew she wouldnt want to let him down but then catrin started coming out with stuff that nobody in their right mind would fake hard against the streaming evening light jack preece took the tractor into the top meadow and he could tell the old thing was going to fail him that poor jonathon had been right when he said it was a false economy nobody had open tractors like this any more tractors had changed tractors nowadays were like gomer parrys planthire equipment big shiny things jack had sworn this old thing was going to see them through the haymaking which would mean he could put off the investment until next year maybe check out what was available secondhand but jonathon had been right false economy especially if it failed him in the middle of the haymaking and he had to get one from gomer to finish off jonathon had been right and hed tell him so tonight least he could do jack hadnt been in yet to see his sons coffin couldnt face it couldnt face people seeing him walking into the church the bloody vicar there with his bankmanager face and his phoney words of comfort the bloody vicar who didnt know the score couldnt know the way things were couldnt be any help whatever but that was how vicars had to be in this town father said dont want no holyroller types in crybbe just go through the motions do the baptisms and the burials keep their noses out and dont change nothing dont break the routine and jack wouldnt break his routine hed go into the church as usual tonight to ring the old bell and hed go just a bit earlier but not so much earlier as anybodyd notice so he could spend five minutes alone in there in the neardark with his dead son jack urged the tractor up the long pitch and the engine farted and spluttered like an old drunk if it couldnt handle the pitch on its own any more then it was going to be bugger all use pulling a trailer for the haymaking and hed be going to gomer for help at a price hed be going to warren too for help with the haymaking this time and the price there was a good deal heavier all these years watching warren growing up and growing away watching him slinking away from the farm like a fox jack thinking it didnt matter so much only one son could inherit only enough income from this farm to support one and if the other one moved away found something else well that could only help the situation but now jack needed warren and warren knew that and that was bad because there was a streak of something in warren that jack didnt like always been there but never so clear as it was now come on then jack talking to the tractor like she was an old horse be better off with an old horse when you thought about it come on could be tricky if she stalled near the top of the pitch and rolled back jack was ready for this happening always a cautious man never had a tractor turn over on him yet nor even close to it go on bad times for the preeces not that thered ever been good times but you didnt expect that you held on if you could hold on you were all right farming wasnt about good times hed be fiftyfive next birthday of an age to start taking it a bit easy no chance of that now he saw himself going into the church to ring the bell in less than two hours time and jonathon lying there in his box what could he say you was right son was all hed mumble you was right about the ole tractor when what he really wanted to say to scream was you stupid bugger boy all you had to do was shoot the bloody dog and you winds up bloody drowned father always said you gotter keep a old on your feelins jack thats the main thing you let your feelins go youre out of control see and its not for a preece to lose control we arent privileged to lose control bugger you father is that all there is is that all therell ever be we stands there in our fields of rock and clay in the endless drizzle with our caps pulled down so we dont see to the horizon so we dont look at the ole tump so we never asks why us tears exploded into jacks eyes just as he neared the top of the pitch and through the blur he saw a great big shadow size of a man rising up sheer in front of him he didnt think he trod hard on the brake the engine stalled and then he was staring into the peeling greygreen paint on the radiator as the tractors nose was jerked up hard like the head of a ringed bull the old thing the tractor gave a helpless hearttearing moan like a stricken old woman in a geriatric ward and the great wheels locked and jack was thrown into the air he heard a faraway earthshaking bump like a blast at a quarry miles away and he figured this must be him landing somewhere not long after that he heard a grinding and a rending of metal and when he looked down he couldnt see his legs and when he looked up he could only see the big black shadow it was very much like a hand this shadow a big clawing black hand coming out of the field out of the stiff ripe grass on a curling wrist of smoke as he stared at it not wanting to believe in it it began to fade away at the edges just like everything else chapter ix although her eyes were fully open she wasnt looking at anything in the room not even at the microphone suspended six inches above her lips there was a sheen on her face which might have been caused by the heat from the single tv light the only other light in the draped and velvety room was a very dinky tiffanyshaded tablelamp in the corner behind guy morrison and the camera crew graham jarrett can you describe your surroundings can you tell me where you are catrin jones i am in my bedchamber in my bed they understood she was called jane she only giggled when they asked for her second name but strangely after a few minutes guy morrison had no difficulty in believing in her she spoke of course with catrins voice although the accent had softened as if a different accent was trying to impose itself and the inflection was altered this was not catrin not any catrin he knew jarrett is it night catrin it is dark jarrett so why arent you asleep catrin i ache so much jarrrett are you not well catrin im aching inside jarrett you mean youre unhappy about something catrin sounding distressed im aching inside inside long pause and a mixture of wriggles halfsmiles and soft moans my sheriffs been to take his pleasure strewth this really was not shrill plump chapelraised catrin from bangor also guy realized watching catrin licking her lips suggestively it was suddenly not useable footage catrin he watches me sometimes he comes in the night and i can see him and he watches me i awake the room so cold he is here uurgh hes his eyes his eyes in the darkness only his eyes aglow catrin was rolling from side to side breathing in snorts the tartan rug slipped from her legs she dragged her skirt up to her waist and spread her legs catrin screaming is that what youve come to see wonderful alex murmured i think this is the only thing i live for these days the cool hands you jean wendle said are an old humbug thats dr chis diagnosis is it shush hmmph after the treatment jean made coffee but refused to let alex have any whisky in his time you took yourself in hand she said no chance of you taking me in hand i suppose jean smiled this dementia of yours she said sitting next to him on the sofa when i said the other night that you should relax and observe yourself i think i was teaching my grandmother to suck eggs i think you almost constantly observe yourself i think you have a level of selfknowledge far beyond most of the socalled mystics in this town oh im just a bumbling old cleric alex said modestly this condition unlike say alzheimers its far from a constant condition sometimes the blood flow to the brain is close to normal is that right i mean like now at this particular moment there is no apparent problem i dont know about that alex said some people would say consulting someone who communes with a longdead chinese quack is a sure sign of advancing senility oh hell im sorry wendy ive sheltered so long behind not taking anything seriously its jean yes of course i i want to say youve made a profound difference to me i havent felt so well in a long time i feel im part of things again that make sense when precisely did you first suspect there was something wrong with your general health oh i suppose it would be not long after poor old grace died feeling a bit sorry for myself id had a spot of angina nothing lifethreatening as they say but my morale because grace had died alex sat back said you scare me wendy bit too perceptive for comfort yes i was low because of the guilt i was feeling at being initially really rather relieved that shed popped off he paused for a reaction but didnt get one jean stood up went away and returned looking resigned with a bottle of bells whisky perhaps you can start taking yourself in hand tomorrow god bless you my dear alex diluted his coffee with a good halfinch of scotch a silence alex thought he could hear a distant siren sound like a police car or an ambulance i gather youve been talking to my daughter jean rested a hand lightly on his thigh i dont think she knows quite what to make of you alex looked at jeans hand not daring to hope and what about you wendy do you the siren grew louder jean stood up and went across to the deep georgian window she looked back at him over a shoulder her little bum tight in paleblue satin trousers coquettish dare he describe that look as coquettish oh i think i can make something of you jean said fire service hello its fay morrison from er from offas dyke radio can you tell me whats happening in crybbe wheres the fire youve been very quick my girl i dont think theyve even got there yet it isnt a fire its a tractor accident tractor turned over one person trapped the location is top meadow court farm one machine no more details yet im afraid court farm bloody hell fay reached for the uher thanks a lot she put the phone down what do you want to do arnie you coming or are you going to wait here for dad thinking what if hes here on his own when the curfew starts whos going to keep him quiet arnold was lying under what used to be an editing table before somebody smashed the revox he was obviously finding it easier to be down than sit he wagged his tail ok then you can come need any help arnold stood up very carefully shook himself and fell over stood up again seemed to be grinning like he often did before leaving the office she forced herself as she always did now to look back from the doorway to the fireplace the mantelpiece with its testicular clock the armchair where the ghost of grace legge had materialized she tried to avoid this room now after dark she wished she could talk to joe powys preferably on the ground away from any windows dont be stupid she looked at the clock and saw it was nearly nine and realized she was worried about joe and had been for over an hour that was why she was sitting over the phone shed never once worried about guy guy was always ok in any difficult situation guy would either find a way out or simply walk away from it as if it had never happened to him whereas joe was vulnerable because as anybody whod read his book could deduce he was a professional believer present him with a crackpot theory and hed make it sound sensible which was what made him so useful to max goff she hadnt heard from him since hed told her he was going to look for andy boultontrow joe was like a child in a dark bedroom where theres a monster in the wardrobe and a dwarf behind the dressingtable and the lampshade is a human head on a string and every deep shadow is alive and he was out there now in a town full of deep deep shadows jarrett do you live in a house catrin at the inn we all live at the inn me and my sisters and my father my father is the jarrett the licensee the landlord catrin contemptuously hell never be a lord jarrett and whats the name of the inn catrin the bull theres another inn called the lamb where robert lived jarrett robert who is robert catrin my man hes hanged now the sheriff hanged him jarrett jane can i ask you this the sheriff had your robert hanged and now he sleeps with you is that what youre saying catrin laughing tears on her face he doesnt sleep much guy was transfixed something astonishing was happening here no way had catrin the imagination to conjure stuff like this unless jarrett had broken through the inhibitions to a deeper layer of the girl perhaps this was the real catrin but what about all the crybbe references was it even conceivable that his production assistant was the reincarnation of a woman who had lived in this same town in the reign of elizabeth i guy didnt understand he was at a disadvantage he hated that approximately fifteen minutes later he began to hate the situation even more jarrett had brought the character jane several years forward in an attempt to discover how long the sheriffs exploitation of her had continued and the responses were becoming garbled catrin but i am the best of us all he says and he will never leave me never never im stroking his beard his hard black beard never leave me never never never jarrett jane please listen catrin ill come down ill come down on you catrin began to giggle and to roll her head again she started to ignore jarretts questions he looked vaguely puzzled by this and left her alone to squirm about for a few minutes larry ember took the opportunity to change the tape and his camera battery then catrin blinked as if trying to focus on something the giggling slowly drying up and her lips went into a pout catrin with a new authority come here im cold her voice had changed again it was affected now and petulant and very english catrin come on for christs sake guy guy froze larry looked up from his viewfinder the camera still rolling catrin we are utterly alone and likely to remain so for two whole wonderful days how long have you got inches and inches if im any judge a profound chill spread through guy catrin theres a bathroom directly facing you at the end of the passage catrin smiled guy thought he was going to scream catrin dont be long will you guy morrison strode erratically into shot dragging a wire nearly bringing the light down fucking hell guy larry ember yelled guy ignored him shook his shoe out of the lamp wire clutched at graham jarretts cardigan wake her up for christs sake man wake her up chapter x it was cold in the wood still he waited the words in his pocket scribbled in the pages of a pocket diary kept appearing in his mind as though the lines were rippling across a computer screen alle the nyte came strange noyses and lytes and the dogges howled in the yarde and when he vysyted me in myne chamber he apered lyke a clowde and a yellow cullor in the aire by ninethirty the air was singing with tension as if great pylons were carrying buzzing sizzling power cables across the darkening sky joe powys was standing by the new stone in the clearing around the centre of the wood a hundred yards or so from keepers cottage this stone narrow like a sharpened bone would be on the line from the tump through the court to the church at either end of the clearing undergrowth had been hacked away to form the beginning of a track or to reinstate an old one he knew all about this track now this was the legendary secret passage between the court and crybbe church along which sir michael wort was said to have escaped like most legends it was a literal interpretation of something more complex something suggested by the notes hed found in keepers cottage which had turned out to be a primitive kind of schoolhouse primitive in that there was no electricity only candles and it was not very clean it smelled of candles and mould and paint there was a mattress and a duvet andy or someone had slept here like a monk might sleep in a little whitewashed cell with no worldly possessions or a rich philanthropist might feed the need to live like a squatter for a while to restructure his consciousness or a modern man might have a need somehow to shed centuries tolde me he would come at nyte in hys spyryte by the olde roade these were andys own notes handwritten powys had discovered them in the only modern luxury item to be found in keepers cottage absurdly a black leather filofax the filofax had been kept in what once might have been a breadoven inside the stone open fireplace which suggested this hovel was rather older than it appeared from the outside upstairs powys had found a single room with a skylight which appeared to be used as an artists studio there was a table with brushes and palettes on it and coloured inks and a large assortment of paints oil and acrylic there was turpentine and linseed oil and other dilutants in tightly corked medicine bottles he uncorked one and sniffed incautiously it was urine another one looked like blood eye of newt he thought toe of frog christ this room with its skylight was the only welllit area of the house all the windows in the sides of the building were screened by dense conifers there was a work in progress on an easel a canvas underpainted in black and yellowochre shapes of buildings and a figure he decided not to sniff the painting there were two chairs up here just as there were two downstairs andy and a lover or a pupil he didnt know quite why he thought that maybe it was because someone else had been doing what he himself was doing copying out pages of material from the filofax in the breadoven had been a small pile of looseleaf pages with writing on them in a different hand bold big letters a schoolboy hand or a schoolgirl there was also a paperback book on elizabethan magic with pages marked hed read one and immediately put the book into his pocket to study later the filofax had contained about thirty looseleaf pages of closely written notes together with handdrawn plans and maps powys had sat down at the table with the artists materials on it a roughhewn item of rustic garden furniture hed copied everything out as carefully as he could including the maps and plans some of which made sense some of which didnt he could have stolen the filofax that would have been simpler but he suspected that what he held here was something like what the old magicians called a grimoire a book of magical secrets a book of shadows it belonged only to one person to anyone else if you believed in all this which he was rather afraid he did it could be as insidiously dangerous as a radioactive isotope so what you did you copied it out he stopped copying at one stage his wrist aching a distant siren sounding in his head like the beginning of a migraine what the hell am i doing i mean am i out of my mind hed crossed again into the old golden land where everything answered to its own peculiar and archaic logic so by candlelight hed gone on copying material from the filofax into the blank pages of a slim blue book of his own with photographs of stones and mounds in it and maps of britain networked with irregular thin black lines indented gold letters on the cover spelled out the leyhunters diary they sent him one every year he carried it around the way you did but this was the first time hed ever actually written in one it took him a long time and if andy had come back caught him at it so what the bastard had more explaining to do than he did he was scared though you couldnt not be in this environment not if you were inclined to believe it worked as he wrote he started to understand not all of it but enough enough to convince him that the original source of some of these notes was probably dr john dee astrologer to elizabeth i that dee who lived along the valley who was not psychic but studied people who were had been the recipient of the visit from the man who came at nyte in hys spyryte and that the visitor was michael wort high sheriff of radnorshire and you can prove that of course not what does that matter i believe it but youre not rational powys youre a certifiable crank hed put the filofax back into the breadoven wishing there was somewhere to wash his hands and climbed out through the window again walking away into the dusk the wood gloomy treacherous place now spiked with fallen branches bramble tentacles the night coming on and he didnt feel so certain of ability to deal with this this diabolical sorcerie this phrase appeared several times in the text standing now by the stone feeling the tension like an impending thunderstorm only denser and the feeling that when the storm broke and the rain crashed down the rain would be black and afterwards the earth would not be cleansed and purified but in some way poisoned acid rain of the soul he moved a few feet away from the stone stood behind a thick old oak tree bound with vines and creepers the logic of the old golden land told him that right next to the stone was not the place to be when the storm broke it also told him that the ringing of the curfew every night was some kind of climax and if he wanted to get a feel of what was going on he ought to stay near that stone for what he stretched his arm towards the sky to see his watch for less than half an hour he was frightened though and really wanted to creep back through the wood to the nearest lights so he thought about henry kettle and he thought about rachel and found himself thinking about fay too she sped through the shadowed streets arnold on the passenger seat not the other son what was his name warren not him surely she could hear her own voicepiece the accident came only a week after warrens brother jonathan was tragically drowned in the swollen river near his home the usual reporters moral conflict taking place in her head better for the preece family if it was someone else better for the media if it was another preece double disaster for tragic farm family better for her in truth if she was away from offas dyke radio which was clearly in the process of ditching her anyway and away from crybbe also which went without saying headlights on she dropped into the lane beside the church nothing like other peoples troubles to take your mind off your own other brighter headlights met hers just before the turning to court farm and she swung into the verge as the ambulance rocketed out and its siren warbled into life still alive anyway but that could mean anything fay drove into the track shed never been to court farm before firemen were standing around the yard and there was a policeman one of wynfords three constables fay ignored him shed always found it easier to get information out of firemen didnt take you long one said teeth flashing in the dusk you wanner interview me which ways the camera no need to comb your hair fay said its radio oh in that case you better talk to the chief officer ron firemen were always affable after it was over bugger of a job getting to him ron said right up the top this bloody field and the ground was all churned up after all this rain still we done it bloody mess though knackered old thing it was that tractor thirtyodd years old it just turned over ah its not all that uncommon said ron i reckon we gets called to at least two tractor accidents every year usually young lads not calculated the gradients never have imagined it happening to jack preece though jack preece hey now listen dont go putting that out till the police confirms the name will you no see i cant figure how it couldve happened jack muster been over there coupla thousand times just shows dunnit dangerous job farming how is he off the record hell live ron said changing his boots gets everywhere this bloody mud his left legs badly smashed i dont know still they can work miracles these days so im told fay got him to say some of it again on tape it was nearly dark because of all the cloud as she pulled out of the farmyard she was halfway down the track when a figure appeared in the headlights urgently waving both arms semaphoring her to stop arnold sat up on the seat and growled fay wound her window down give me a lift into town will you it was too dark to see his face under the cap but she recognized his voice at once from meetings of the town council and the occasional owre you in the street mr preece oh christ get in the back arnold fay hissed as she pushed the dog into the back seat something shocking wrenched at her mind but she hadnt time to develop the thought before the passenger door was pulled open and the mayor collapsed into the seat next to her gasping in a hurry hell of a hurry the old man breathing heavily and apparently painfully as they crunched down the track as she turned into the lane mr preece said oh its you most unhappy about this she could tell i didnt know it was you im terribly sorry fay said about jack it must be aye mr preece broke off turned his head recoiled mighter known you got that damn thing in yere the dog the shocking thought of a couple of minutes ago completed itself with an ugly click as she was pushing arnold into the back seat shed felt the stump of his rear left leg and heard ron the leading fireman in her head saying left legs badly smashed mr preece fay said carefully id like to come and see you i know its a bad time a terrible time but i have to know what all this is about he said nothing fay said i have to know not for the radio for myself why nobody keeps a dog in crybbe the mayor just breathed his painful soggy breaths never looked behind him at what crouched in the back seat said not a word until they moved up alongside the churchyard and entered the square ill get out yere mr preece the old man scrambled out started to walk stiffly away then turned and tried to shout voice cracking up like old brown parchment you leave it alone see he started to cough leave it alone you mr preece hawked and spat into the gutter stupid bitch he said roughly biting off the words as if he was trying to choke back more phlegm and a different emotion and then leaving the passenger door for her to close he was off across the cobbles limping and stumbling towards the church hes going to ring the curfew fay thought suddenly his sons just been mangled within an inch of his life in a terrible accident and all he can think about is ringing the curfew jonathon had been saying for months years even that it was time they got rid of that old tractor probably this wasnt what hed had in mind warren thought standing in top meadow alone with the wreckage of the thing that had crippled his old man all the coppers and the firemen gone now the old man had been working on that tractor all day giving himself something to concentrate on take his mind off jonathon and his problem of having nobody to hand over the farm to when he was too old and clapped out then hed mumbled something about testing the bugger and lumbered off in it up the top field silly old bastard testing it bloody tested it all right warren had to laugh with the last of the light he could more or less see what had happened the tractor climbing towards the highest point and not making it sliding back in the mud out of control and tipping over the old man going down with it disappearing underneath as the bloody old antique came apart but warren still couldnt figure how hed let it happen all the times hed been up here on that bloody old tractor at least he couldnt see rationally like how it had happened it was the unrational answer the weird option glittering in his head like cold stars that wouldnt let him go home he followed the big tracks through the mud by the field gate up the pitch to the point where the tractor had started rolling back prior to keeling over he followed the tracks to the very top of the rise to where the tractor had been headed glancing behind him and seeing the trees moving on top of the old tump half a mile away by the time he was on top of the pitch he was near burning up with excitement it hadnt seemed like the right part of the field at all but that was because hed come in by a different gate looking at it from a different angle warren hesitated a moment and then dashed back down to the tractor somebody had left behind a shovel theyd been using to shift the mud so the firemen could get their cutting gear to the old man he snatched up the shovel carried it back up the pitch prised away the top sod knowing instinctively exactly where to dig threw off a few shovelfuls of earth and there it was the old box the jagged thrill that went through him was like whitehot electric wire oh fuck oh fuck blinded by his power i done it me his fingers were rigid with excitement as he opened the box just to make sure and he almost cried out with the euphoria of the moment he couldnt see proper but it was like the hand of bones the hand of glory in the box had bent over and become a fist it was curled around the stanley knife gripping it and the blade was out warren shivered violently in horror and pleasure the combination making him feel so alive it was like he was a knife himself sharp and savage steely and invulnerable the only indestructible preece chapter xi at first the figure was dressed in dark clothes so that when it filtered through the twilit trees only the soft footsteps and the rustlings told powys anyone was coming he moved behind his oak tree sure it was going to be andy holding himself still packing away the anger and the grief an unstable mixture because for once he intended to have the advantage what he had to do was break this guys habitual cool to raise the vibration rate until the basscello voice distorted and the lotus position collapsed in a muscular spasm hed never seen andy anything but laidback this he realized was the most impenetrable of all screens laidback people were not evil laidback people were wise evil people ranted like hitler they werent people youd known half your life and they were never called andy but then powys thought watching the figure enter the clearing and move towards the stone the stench from a rotten egg was only apparent when the perfectly rounded smooth white shell was cracked the stone gleamed pearly grey collecting what light remained a ghostly obelisk powys watched and tried to slow his breathing not yet time to get a stake into dracula you had to wait for daylight or in this case until the curfew was over the curfew was central to the crybbe experience the curfew was pivotal whatever had been building up tension fear excitement climaxed and then died with the curfew hed experienced it twice in radically different ways the first night with rachel when theyd wound up in bed at the cock so fast they hadnt even been aware of the chemical interacting until the chemicals had fully interacted and then by the river when hed found the shotgun in his hands and come within a twitch of blowing jonathon preece in half he lifted the sleeve of his sweatshirt to expose his watch it was too dark to be certain but he was sure it must be ten oclock ten oclock and no curfew staggering into the church jimmy preece was faced with its silent solitary occupant a wooden arrow pointing at the altar rails he stood gasping in the doorway and there was jonathons smooth mahogany coffin shining like a taunt a pale gleam of polish in the dimness mr preece couldnt find his breath his legs felt like wet straw and the urge to pray had never been as strong please god protect us he wanted to cry out until the words leapt into every corner of the rafters and came back at him with the illusion of strength and illusion was all it would be he remembered the trouble thered been when the old vicar was ill and the diocese had sent a replacement whod turned out to be one of these charismatics some new movement in the church this chap spouting about something he called dynamic prayer shouting and quivering and making them all sing like darkies and hug each other no end of disturbance until a phone call to the bishop had got rid of him not the border way they told him not the crybbe way oh jonathon jonathon mr preece felt his chest quake in agony and he turned away groping for the narrow wooden door to the belfry the old routine making his painful way to the steps but for the first time the routine resisted him and his foot failed to find the bottom step twentyseven years hed done it without a break until jack started to take over and now jimmy preece had come back and he couldnt find the blessed step mr preece squeezed his eyes shut dug his nails into his cheeks raised his other foot and felt the steps worn edge slide under his shoe what time was it was he late his chest pumping weakly like these old brass firebellows his wife still kept although the leather was holed and withered his foot slipped on the edge of the second step come on come on you hopeless old bugger he set off up the narrow stone steps some no more than two foot wide used to be when he was ringing the old bell every night that these steps was never a problem even when hed been working solid on the lambing or the haymaking and was bone tired because mr preece paused to catch a breath six steps up because sometimes in the old days hed just like floated to the top like as if there were hands in the small of his back rushing him up the steps and then the same hands would join his on the rope because it was meant but tonight there were different hands pressing down from above pressing into his chest go back you poor tired old bugger you dont wanner do this no more a son in the hospital a grandson in his coffin what if you dies on the steps one preece in the hospital one in his coffin one in a heap on the flagstones and warren best not to think about warren and a silence in the belfry no in a rage mr preece snatched out his dentures thrust them down into a pocket of his old tweed jacket forced some air into his broken bellows of a chest and made it up two more steps hed do it hed be late but hed do it never been so important that he should do it he saw the light above him and the ropes never more important now the wall around the tump had been breached and something was in the court as had been shown by the death of that woman but it had never been in the church it couldnt get into church no it couldnt but it wasnt andy boultontrow waiting by the stone it was a woman well a girl and naked now she stood with her back to the stone as if sculpted from it her eyes closed and her mouth open and the night sang around her jesus god powys whispered the voyeur behind the oak tree stunned into immobility the pupil it was one of those nights when the thoughts were so deep you couldnt remember getting home or putting the car away some small thing brought you back into your body like the tiny grind of metal in metal as your yale key penetrated the frontdoor lock fay could just about read her watch in what remained of the light and the glow from neighbouring windows she couldnt believe how rapidly the days had been shortening since midsummer day mr preece was already a couple of minutes late with the curfew she imagined him toiling up all those steps to the belfry poor old sod obsessive behaviour did he really think the family might lose percy weales sixteenthcentury bequest if the curfew remained unrung for a single night because of a dire family crisis had to be more than that joe powys would find out oh god powys where are you one thing was sure jack preece wouldnt be ringing the curfew for a long long time if ever again what does it mean joe she ought to have gone with him even if this was something crazy between him and boultontrow something that went back twelve years or more it was so easy at night to believe in the other side of things that there was another side that rachel and rose had died because of a magic with its roots four centuries deep or perhaps deeper perhaps as old as the stones with arnold tucked not without some effort under her arm fay went into the house it was far too late now to send the tape for the morning news the lateduty engineer at offas dyke would be long gone shed have to go into the studio early in the morning again having rung hereford general to find out jacks condition she lowered the dog to the doormat i wish i could trust you arnold fay said not quite knowing what she meant his tail was well down he looked no happier than she was jonathon preece had set out to kill him and had died in the river arnold had lost a leg so might jack preece by now if this was the seventeenth century shed have been hanged as a witch arnold stoned to death as her familiar stop it you stupid bitch she clenched her fists and felt her nails piercing the palms of her hands everyone around her seemed to be carrying a burden of possibly misplaced guilt powys for rose and rachel her dad for grace and for her mother she herself fay went down on her knees in the hall the front door open to the street behind her she buried her head in arnolds fur arnold who looked no more evil than than joe powys as she began quietly to sob all the lights went out in the neighbouring homes bloody electricity company how could this keep happening fay choked a sob in bitter anger and punched at the wall until her knuckles hurt oh god god god god god she stood up shakily dad there was no response she closed the front door behind her hed either gone to bed or he was still over at jean wendles having his treatment or his end away if hed got lucky fay sniffed and smiled shed once asked the local doctor what the canons condition meant libidowise hell be less inhibited the doctor had said by which i mean hell talk about it more often the canon wasnt back but arnold whimpering somebody was as fay stiffened in the darkness of the hallway she saw vague yellowish light under the door of the office very slowly the office door began to open fay caught her breath it did not creak she only knew it was opening because the wedge of yellow light was widening and it was not the soft and welcoming mellow yellow of a warm parlour at suppertime this was the yellow of congealing fat the yellow of illness the hallway was very cold it was a cold she remembered grace fay heard herself say in a voice she didnt recognize a voice that seemed to come from someone else she felt her lips stretch tight with fear she kicked the office door open did she speak jean wendle had asked not a word grace legge wore a nightdress or a shroud was this what shrouds looked like and she didnt move no grace was standing by the window very straight a hand on a hip halfturned towards fay she was haloed in yellow light the yellow of diseased flesh the yellow of embalming fluid she was hovering six inches off the floor harmless then grace fay said slowly go away grace but grace did not go away she began to move towards fay not walking because her feet were bound in the shroud which faded into vapour fay backed away into the hall dead eyes that were fixed burning like small still lamps burning like phosphorous she cant talk to you she cant see you theres no brain activity there blink a couple of times and shell be gone fay shut her eyes screwed them tight stood frozen in the doorway with her eyes squeezed tight stood praying praying to her fathers god for deliverance please make it go away please please please she smelled an intimate smell sickly soiled perfume and felt cold breath on her face she opened her eyes because she was more afraid not to opened them into a fishteethed snarl and yellow orbs alight with malice and spindly hooked fingers the whole thing swirling and shimmering and coming for her rancid and vengeful filling the room with a rotting spitting incandescent yellow haired fay began to scream chapter xii it was fear that drew minnie seagrove to the window of her lounge fear that if she didnt look for it it would come looking for her for a short while there was a large early moon it wasnt a full moon not one of those werewolf moons by any stretch but it was lurid and bright yellow it appeared from behind the tump before it became visible rays had projected through the trees on the top of the mound like the beams you saw seconds before the actual headlights of an oncoming car the trees on the tump were waving in the breeze even though the air all around minnies bungalow was quite still shed come to associate this breeze with an appearance of the hound afterwards mrs seagrove sat with her back to the window in franks old parker knoll wing chair feeling its arms around her and hugging a glass of whisky the remains of franks last bottle of chivas regal malt oh lord how she wished she hadnt looked tonight im that cold dear she said pretending she was talking to young joe powys or anybody whod believe her i cant keep a limb still i dont think ill ever get warm again powys knew it was on its way when the naked girl at the stone began to moan and shiver when the moon rose he saw that the girl was certainly no more than twenty and might even be significantly younger which made him uncomfortable he wondered for a time if she was real and not some kind of vision what kind of a girl would come alone at night into this appalling place and take off all her clothes powys was not at all turned on by this he was afraid afraid he rationalized not only for her but of her afraid because he suspected she knew what was coming while he could have no conception except of ludicrous phosphorous fur fiery eyes and gnashing fangs and basil rathbone in his deerstalker with his pistol he found his fingers were tightly entwined into some creeper on the trunk of the oak tree he squeezed it until it hurt the silence in the neglected wood was absolute no night birds no small mammals scurrying and scrabbling if there was any sound any indication of movement of change it would be the damp chatter of decay max could not move his eyes were wide open he took his breath in savage gulps he lay in awe couldnt even think he could smell the candles as if in anticipation of a power failure the room had been ringed with them max halfafraid theyd be black but no these were ordinary yellowwhite candles of beeswax or tallow whatever tallow was they didnt smell too good at first kind of a rich fatty smell now the smell was as intoxicating as the sour red wine the mattress was laid out on the third level of the stable block so he could lie in the dusk and take in the tump filling the window stealing the evening light surrounded with candles like a great altar max lay under the black duvet feeling like a virgin the great beastscarlet woman sessions with rachel a faint and farcical memory for the first time in his adult life max was terrified and then when the dark figure rose over him in the yellow waxy glow even more frightened and shocked rigid at first by the intensity of his longing warren looked up into the sky at the night billowing in and he loved the night and the black clouds and the thin wind hissing in the grass his insides churning his mind clotted with a rich confusion but the curfew was coming and the box was screaming at him to close the lid he slammed it down then bewildered he started to claw at the earth with his hands set the box down in the hole heard a rattling noise inside the hand battering the side of the box it dont wanner go back in the ground its done what it came for now it wants to go back in the chimney and sure enough when warren picked up the box the rattling stopped and so he ran holding it out in front of him like a precious gift down from field to field until he reached the farm where nobody else lived now except for him and the hand of glory in the end the curfew did come a strained and hesitant clatter at first and then the bell was pounding the wood like a huge shiny axe slicing up the night and the girl was gone joe powys wandered blindly through the undergrowth repeatedly smashing a fist into an open palm the night shimmered with images the bell pealed and rose in a pure white nightdress threw herself from a thirdfloor window fluttering hopelessly in the air like a moth with its wings stuck together falling in slow motion and he was falling after her reaching out for her in the spiny dampness of the wood powys cried out just once and the curfew bell released at last his agony he staggered among the stricken twisted trees and wept uncontrollably he didnt want to control it he wanted the tears to flow for ever he wanted the curfew bell to peal for ever each clang cometbright in the shivering night the bell pealed on and with that high wild cry rachel tumbled into the air and then rose and rachel were falling together intertwined a needle of light like the filament of a lowwattage electric bulb zigzagged across the eaves silently in slowmotion the rusty spike pierced the white nightdress and a geyser of hot blood sprayed into his weeping eyes chapter xiii max awoke to find himself alone damp and smouldering like a bonfire in the rain the cold deluge had been the curfew when the curfew was gone he realized at last the town would be free he got up and shambled to the big window wrapped in the black duvet it was too dark to see the tump it didnt matter he could feel the tump it was like the stables and maybe even the court itself hid been absorbed by the mound so that he was in essence inside it no going back now max feeling very nearly crazy his face and hands slashed by boughs and bushes powys followed a dead straight line back into crybbe as if the path was lit up for him which perhaps it was the bell strokes landing at his feet like bars of light all he did was lurch towards the belt each stroke laid on the landscape heavy as a gold ingot and when he emerged from the wood into the churchyard scratched and bleeding from many cuts he just collapsed on the first grave he came to its stone was of new black marble with white lettering and when he saw whose grave it was he started to laugh slightly hysterically grace peters beloved wife of canon a l peters and that was all powys scrambled to his feet from what he knew of grace she would take a dim view of somebodys dirty battered body sprawled over her nice clean grave he walked stiffly through the graveyard out of the lychgate into the deserted square his plodding footsteps marking sluggish time between peals of the curfew the power was off hardly a surprise in four or five townhouse windows he could see the sallow light of paraffin lamps then with a noise like a lawnmower puttering across the square a generator cranked into action bringing a paleblue fluorescent flickering into the grimy windows of the old pub the cock yes powys thought i could use a drink quite badly it occurred to him he hadnt eaten since pushing down a polystyrene sandwich in this very pub before setting off to find his old mate andy boultontrow he didnt feel hungry though a drink was all he wanted that illusory warmth in the gut and then hed decide where to go whose night to spoil next whose peace of mind to perforate he clambered up the steps and pushed open the single scuffed swingdoor to the public bar it was full faces swam out of the smoke haze pallid in the stuttering fluorescence the air was weighed down it seemed to powys with leaden dull dialogue and no merriment he felt removed from it all as though hed fallen asleep when he walked in and being here was a dream brandy please he told denzil the neanderthal landlord a single denzil didnt react at all to whatever kind of mess the wood had made of powyss face he didnt smile so where was the smile coming from he knew somebody was smiling at him you could feel a smile especially when wasnt meant to be friendly thanks he said and paid he saw the smile through the bottom of his glass it was a small smile in a big face it might have been chiselled neatly into the centre of a whole round cheese police sergeant wynford wiley had sat there wearing this same tiny smile last night and early this morning while his colleagues from cid had been trying to persuade j m powys to confess to the murder of his girlfriend been in a fight is it mr powys wiley looked more than halfdrunk he was sitting in a group of middleaged men in faded tweeds or sleeveless quilted bodywarmers summer casual wear crybbestyle you want the truth powys swallowed some brandy but still didnt feel any warmth all i ever wants is the truth mr powys wynford was wearing an old blue police shirt over what looked like police trousers amateur dramatics powys said wearily ive been auditioning for the crybbe amateur dramatic society banquos ghost what do you think of the makeup wynford wiley stopped smiling he stood up at once rather unsteadily planted himself between powys and the door and came out with that famous indictment of intruders from off those few words which powys suddenly found so evocative of the quintessential crybbe we dont like clever people wynford stifled a burp round yere there was that thrilled hush which the first spark of confrontation always brings to rural pubs powys said maybe thats why this towns dead on its feet he finished his brandy now placing his glass carefully on the bartop why dont you piss off and stop bothering me you fat bastard he listened to himself saying this as if from afar listened with what ought to have been a certain horrified awe hed done it now thrown down a direct public challenge to the authority of the senior representative for what passed for the law in this town in order to retain his authority and his public credibility sergeant wiley would be obliged to take prompt and decisive action and sergeant wiley was drunk and powys didnt care because tonight hed seen the appalling thing that was known locally as black michaels hound and witnessed the dark conflagration of its union with a young woman and in terms of total black menace wynford wiley just didnt figure lets slip outside shall we mr powys wynford held open the door to get out of here powys would have to step under his arm and as soon as he was outside the door the arm would descend he was likely to wind up in a cell if he resisted he would wind up hurt in a cell if he ran away the town would soon be teeming with coppers anyway he was too knackered to run anywhere even if thered been anywhere to run dont make a fuss mr powys i only wanner know ow you got that face powys couldnt think of a way out he stepped under wynfords arm and the arm predictably came down somebody held open the door for wynford and the big policeman followed him out hand gripping his elbow at that moment as if to make things easier for the forces of the law the power came back on or so it seemed and wynfords face shone like a full moon powys froze in the brightness momentarily blinded wynford reeled back there was a figure behind the light maybe two the light was blasting from something attached like a miners lamp to the top of a big video camera carried on the shoulder of a stocky man with a beatles hairstyle circa hamburg and an aggressive mouth whom powys recognized at once as guy morrisons cameraman larry ember you carry on sarge larry ember moved to a lower step and crouched the light still full on wynford just pretend we aint here wynford was squinting mouth agape you switch that bloody thing off you ear me when did you ave permission to film yere dont need no permission sarge public place innit we were just knocking off a few routine nightshots you go ahead and arrest this geezer dont mind us this is nice wynford blocked the camera lens with a big hand and backed into the pub door pushing it open with his shoulders he glared at larry ember over the hot lamp i can ave you for obstruction man walks into a pub face covered with cuts and bruises its my job to find out why yeah yeah well there was a very nasty accident happened up at a place called court farm tonight while some of us sergeant were safely in the pub getting well pissedup as i understand it this gentleman was up to his neck in shit and oil helping to drag some poor bleeder out from under his tractor fact is hell probably be in line for an award from the humane society powys kept quiet wondering what the hell larry ember was on about well wynford backed off that case why didnt e i speak up stead of being clever hes a very modest man sarge wynford wiley backed awkwardly into the pub stabbing a defiant forefinger into the night all the same you been told powys dont you leave this town dickhead said larry ember when the door closed shit i enjoyed that best shots ive had since we came to this dump you all right squire well not as bad as the guy under the tractor was that on the level sure we didnt go on account of our leader was otherwise engaged shafting his assistant well thanks for what you did powys said i owe you one yeah well i was getting bored larry swung the camera off his shoulder switched the lamp off and i figured hed never arrest you in his state more likely take you up that alley and beat seven shades out of you the cameraman whod obviously had a few pints himself grabbed powyss arm and started grinning hey listen you know morrison dont you bleedin hell shouldve seen him we shot this hypnotist geezer taking young catrin back through her past lives you know this what dyou call it regression right and in one life socalled shes this floozy back in the sixteenth century having it away with the local sheriff right powys stiffened in crybbe thats what she said anyway in real life catrins this prim little welshie piece butter wouldnt melt but stone me under the influence shes drooling at the mouth pulling her skirt up round her waist and morrison well he cant bleedin believe it soon as we get back he says in his most pompous voice he says catrin and i catrin and i laurence have a few programme details to iron out then he shoves her straight upstairs blimey im not kidding poor bleeder could hardly walk what time was this ages ago well over an hour and they aint been seen since amazing eh not really powys said sadly the few oil lamps in the houses had gone out and so had the moon the town what could be seen of it was like a period filmset after hours an old man with a torch crossed his path at one point nothing else happened powys supposed he was going back to the riverside cottage to sleep alone just him and the bottle stone he couldnt face being alone even if it was now the right side of the curfew and the psychic departure lounge was probably closed for the night what was he going to do he had an idea of what was happening in crybbe and how it touched on what had happened to him twelve years ago but to whom did you take such ideas certainly not the police and if what remained of the church was any good at this kind of thing it wouldnt have been allowed to fester he could of course go and see goff and lay it all down for him explain in some detail why the crybbe project should be abandoned forthwith but he wasnt sure he could manage the detail or put together a coherent case that would convince someone who might be a new age freak but was also a very astute businessman what it needed was a henry kettle or a dr john dee come to that what he needed was to talk to fay morrison but it was unlikely shed want to talk to him he passed the house he thought was jean wendles jean might know what to do but that was all in darkness faced with a power cut many people just made it an early night as he slumped downhill towards the police station and the river bridge something brushed with some intent against his ankles it didnt startle him it was probably a cat there being no dogs in crybbe it whimpered powys went down on his knees arnold it nuzzled him he couldnt see it he moved his hands down counted three legs christ arnold what are you doing out on your own wheres fay he looked up and saw hed reached the corner of bell street sudden dread made his stillbruised stomach contract not again please no no he picked arnold up and carried him down the street if the dog had made it all the way from home hed done well so soon after losing a leg arnold squirmed to get down and vanished through an open doorway powys could hear him limping and skidding on linoleum and then the lights came back on powys went in he couldnt take it in at first as the shapes of things shivered and swam in the sudden brilliance then he saw that arnold had nosed open the kitchen door and was skating on the blood part seven but we could not bring him to human form he was seen like a great black dog and troubled the folk in the house much and feared them elizabethan manuscript chapter i max goff said i came as soon as i heard indeed he had it was not yet am jimmy preece was surprised that someone like goff should be up and about at this hour unhappy too at seeing the large man getting out of his car waddling across the farmyard like a hungry crow mr preece remembered the last time goff had been to visit him alone this morning hed been up since five and over at court farm before six to milk the few cows he couldnt rely on warren to do it he hadnt even seen warren yet mr preece was back on the farm which he still owned but was supposed to have retired from eight years ago to make way for future generations becoming a farmer again was the best way of taking his mind off what had happened to the future generations everything changing too fast too brutally even this goff looked different his suit was dark and he wore no hat he didnt look as if hed had much sleep he looked serious he looked like he cared but what was it he cared about was it the sudden tragic death of jonathon followed by the grievous injury to jonathons father or was it what he goff might get out of all this like the farm mr preece thought of the crow again the scavenger he hated crows humble said youd be here goff walked past him into the old bare livingroom where all that remained of jack was a waistcoat thrown over a chair back no photos not even the old gun propped up in the corner any more goff said reason i came so early is the meeting its the public meeting tonight what i wanted to say theres time to call it off mr mayor call im off jimmy preece shook his head no it would be an ordeal this meeting but it couldnt be put off the meeting would be his best opportunity to make it clear to this goff that he wasnt wanted in crybbe that this town had no sympathy with him or his ideas there would however be a great deal of sympathy overwhelming sympathy for old jim preece whod lost his grandson and whose son was now lying maimed for life in hereford hospital goff would have realized this cunning devil no way mr preece wanted that meeting calling off too late now people coming yere from all over never get word out in time if we start now mr mayor spread the word in town get it out on offas dyke radio no no very kind of you to offer but the town council stick to their arrangements come fire flood and personal tragedy like hed be making time today to pay a final visit to each of the farmers with land around crybbe make sure they all understood about the need to keep the stones away he thought they were still with him but money could turn a farmers head faster than a runaway bull thought i should at least make the offer mr mayor and tell you how sorry i was aye there was a long silence mr preece noticed circles like bruises around goffs eyes and his beard not as well manicured as usual well mr preece said he might as well say it now make it clear where they stood i expect youll be wonderin bout the future of this place whats gonna happen if jacks crippled and with jonathon gone like its a problem mr mayor if theres any way i can help were neighbours right no jimmy preece said theres no way you can elp and no i wont be sellin the farm goff spread his legs apart and rocked a bit he didnt laugh but he looked as if he wanted to aw jeez i realize you got to be in an emotional and anxious state mr mayor but if youre thinking maybe im here because im angling to buy the place let me say that was about the last thing im not a fucking property shark mr preece no jimmy preece said and it might have been a question this familys been here four five centuries yeah isnt there another son young er warren said mr preece yeah warren who dont want anything to do with farming as you well know mr goff huh es gonner be a star isnt that right i dont pop guitarist isnt it youre gonner make the boy a millionaire sign im up turn im into a big star so he e can get his lazy arse out of crybbe and dont need to ave nothing to do with us ever again you ask me if theres anything you can do mr goff i reckon you done enough for the first time murray beech had locked the church for the night hed waited until the curfew was over and then walked over with the keys surprised to find jimmy preece and not his son emerging from the belfry in an arid voice from which all emotion had been drained jimmy preece had explained why he was here leaving murray horrified hed remembered hearing the ambulance wondering who it was for how could lightning strike twice so cruelly at a single family how could any kind of god murray often wondered just how many of his colleagues in the church seriously believed any more in a fount of heavenly wisdom perhaps there should be a confidential survey some sort of secret ballot within the organization no one could fault the basic christian ethic but murray couldnt help wondering if it wasnt in the best interests of sustaining a credible relevant functioning clergy to have this anachronism known as god quietly phased out god was a millstone three times as many people would seek clerical help with their personal problems if they didnt have to cope with god and without god the question of sacrilege would not arise and nobody he thought now standing by the altar rail would have to cope with this the church door had not been forced last night a window had simply been smashed in the vestry this morning jonathon preece lay apparently undisturbed a silent sentinel still presumably and murray was not inclined to check in his coffin still safely supported on its bier a slim metal trolley only slightly more ornate than those used in hospitals the coffin was still pointing at the altar with its white and gold cloth neither the coffin nor the bier had been disturbed only the altar itself in the centre of the cloth a silver dish had been heaped high with something brown and pungent murray approached with trepidation and distaste to find the substance in the dish was not what hed feared next to the dish was the tin from which the brown gunge had been scraped it was dog food murray was almost relieved and so puzzled by this that he failed to carry out a more detailed inspection of the church and therefore did not find out what else had been done goff raised a faint smile and both hands im starting to understand mr preece i see where youre coming from the boy sent me a tape right you tell me sir you tell me sure ill tell you this kid warren warren yeah mr mayor you know how many tapes we get sent to us jeez i dont even know myself a thousand two thousand a year how many we do anything with in a good year two young warren sure well the reason he got further than ninetynine point nine per cent of the others was he sent it to the cock and i listened to it myself the normal thing is i pay guys to pay other guys to listen to the tapes on the slushpile saves me a lotta grief right but i didnt wanna appear snobbish big london record chief sneering at local hopefuls so i listened to the tape and i had a letter sent back and what it said was this stuff isnt basically up to it but we arent closing the door when you feel youve improved try us again were always prepared to listen you know what that means youd like me to give you a frank and honest translation mr mayor jimmy preece swallowed yes he said id like you to be quite frank im always frank mr mayor cept when its gonna destroy somebody like in the case of this tape you ever hear your grandsons band mr preece used to practise in the barn till jack turned em out hens wouldnt lay yeah that sounds like them said goff smiling now crude lyrically moronic and musically inept they might improve but i wouldnt take any bets my advice dont let the kid give up sheepshearing classes it went quiet in the livingroom at court farm in the whole house thank you jimmy preece said dully no worries mr preece believe me the boyll make a farmer yet behind the door at the foot of the stairs warren preece straightened up his face entirely without expression chapter ii jeans narrow town house had three floors and five bedrooms only three of them with beds in one alex awoke to his amazement he knew at once exactly who he was where he was and how he came to be there separating his thoughts had once been like untangling single strands of spaghetti from a bolognese could jean wendle be right could it be that his periods of absentmindedness of the mental mush of wondering what day it was even what time of his life it was were the results not so much of a physical condition but of a reaction to his surroundings through living in a house disturbed by unearthly energy a house on a leyline no leylines passed through this house something jean said shed been very careful to establish before accepting the tenancy why not try an experiment jean had suggested why not spend a night here an invitation hed entirely misunderstood at first wondering whether in spite of all his talk hed be quite up to it jean had left a message on fays answering machine to say alex wouldnt be coming home tonight shed shown him to this very pleasant room with a large but indisputedly single bed and said good night he might notice she said a difference in the morning and by god she was right the sun shone through a small square window over the bed and alex lay there relishing his freedom for that was what it was and all thanks to jean wendle how could he ever make it up to her well he knew how hed like to make it up to her yes this morning he certainly felt up to it alex pushed back the bedclothes and swung his feet on to a floor which fell satisfyingly firm under his bare feet he flexed his toes stood walked quite steadily to the door clad only in the bermuda shorts hed worn as underpants since the days when they used to give ladies a laugh thus putting them at their ease under the clerical costume a pair of orange bermuda shorts i shall have them in purple when im a bishop half the battle alex had found over the years was giving ladies a laugh there was the sound of a radio from downstairs local news at nine oclock from offas dyke radio the voice of the marches heres tim benfield good morning a farmer is critically ill in hospital after his tractor overturned on a hillside at crybbe the accident happened only days after the tragic drowning of his son in the river nearby james barlow has the details barlow should have been fay alex thought why wasnt it fay alex found a robe hanging behind the door and put it on bit tight but at least it wasnt frilly in the bathroom he splashed invigorating cold water on his face walked briskly down the stairs smoothing down his hair and his beard he found her in the kitchen a sunny highceilinged room with a refectory table and a kettle burbling on the rayburn good morning alex standing by the window with a slim cigar in her fingers fresh and athleticlooking in a lightgreen tracksuit you know alex said i really think it bloody well is a good morning all thanks to you jean jean it struck him that hed persisted in calling her wendy simply because it was something like her surname which he could never remember he went to the window which had a limited view into a sidestreet off the square he saw a milkman a postman a grocer hopefully pulling out his sunblind normality harmless normality he thought about grace perhaps if he left the house then what remained of grace would fade away fay had been right there was no reason to stay here everything was clear from here a different house not two hundred yards away but not on a spirit path spirit paths new age nonsense but he couldnt remember the last time hed felt so happy hereward newsome was seriously impressed by the paintings tonal responses the way the diffused light was handled shades of rembrandt how long have you been painting ive always painted she said just that i havent seen any of your work around you will she said he wanted to say did you really do this yourself but that might sound insulting might screw up the deal and this painting was now very important after the less than satisfactory buying trip to the west country an item to unveil to goff with pride hereward had returned the previous afternoon terrified of facing jocasta with two hotel bills a substantial drinks tab and a mere three paintings including a study of silbury hill which was little more than a miniature and had cost him in excess of twelve hundred pounds to his surprise his wife had appeared almost touchingly pleased to have him home shed looked tired there were brown crescents under her eyes and her skin seemed coarser shed told him of the terrible incident at the court in which rachel wade had died hereward who didnt think jocasta had known rachel wade all that well had been more concerned at the effect on his wife who looked well she looked her age for the first time in years hereward felt protective towards jocasta and in an odd way stimulated hed shown her his miserable collection of earthmystery paintings never mind shed said astonishingly hed trimmed his beard and made a tentative advance but jocasta felt there was a migraine hovering this morning theyd awoken early because of the strength of the light the first truly sunny morning in a week jocasta had gone off before half past eight to open the gallery and hereward had stayed at home to chop logs on a day like this it was good to be a countryman then the young woman had telephoned about the painting and insisted on bringing it to the house saying she didnt want to carry it through town he thought hed seen her before but not in crybbe surely dark hair darkeyed darkly glamorous and confident in an offhand way arrived in a blue land rover she wore a lot of makeup black lipstick but she couldnt be older than earlytwenties which made her mature talent quite frightening if indeed shed done this herself he didnt dare challenge her it was a large canvas five feet by four when he leaned it against the dresser it took over the room immediately what it did was to draw the room into the scene reducing the kitchen furniture to shadows even in the brightness of this cheerfully sunny morning the painting hereward thought stole the sunlight away he identified the front entrance of crybbe court the building looking as romantically decrepit as it had last week when hed strolled over there out of curiosity to see how things were progressing broken cobbles in the yard weeds a dull grey sky falling towards evening the main door was open and a tall blackbearded man halfshadowed stood inside behind the figure and around his head was a strange nimbus a halo of yellowish powdery vapour the man had a still and beckoning air about him hereward was reminded in a curious way of holman hunts the light of the world except there was no light about this figure only a sort of glowing darkness its very interesting hereward said how much three hundred pounds hereward was pleased it was in its way a major work lustrous like a large icon this girl was a significant discovery he wanted to snatch his wallet out before she could change her mind but caution prevailed he kept his face impassive where do you work here in crybbe youre a fulltime professional painter i am now she said would you like to see the preliminary sketches very much hereward said she fetched the portfolio from the land rover the sketches were in indian ink and smudged charcoal studies of the bearded face and some colourmix experiments in acrylic on paper he wondered who the model was didnt like to ask this artist had a formidable air watched him unsmiling and she was so young does it have a title it speaks for itself i see hereward said he didnt look he said ill take a chance ill buy it shed watched him the whole time studying his reaction she hadnt looked once at the painting most unusual for an artist normally they couldnt keep their eyes off their own work could i buy the sketches too you can have them she said keep them in your attic or somewhere i certainly wont i shall have them on my walls the girl smiled one thing she had a trace of accent not local i might be doing more even if its sold id like the painting in the window of your gallery for a couple of days no card no identification just the picture well certainly of course but you really dont want your name on a card under the picture shook her head you dont know my name anyway arent you going to tell me she left it was not yet ten oclock the mayor of crybbe was seeing his youngest grandson for the first time as a man an unpleasant man hed patrolled the farm checking everything was all right collected a few eggs then noticed that something apart from the tractor was missing from the vehicle shed when he got back to the house he saw warren landing hard on the settee like hed been doing something else heard his grandad and flung himself down in a hurry wheres the land rover warren lent it to a friend you what mr

to shake sprawled across the settee was a hard thin man with a head shaved close until you got right to the top when it came out like a stiff shaving brush a sneering man with an earring which had a little metal skull hanging from it a man with flat lizards eyes before it had been an irritation the way warren was but it didnt matter much you looked the other way and you saw jonathon you saw the chairman of the young farmers club you saw jimmy preece fifty years ago now this his only surviving grandson he tried warren we never talked much before warrens laughter was like spit wasnt no reason

jimmy preece wanted to hit him again but this time warren would be ready for it he could tell by the way he was standing legs apart hands dangling loose by his sides wouldnt worry him one bit beating an old man jimmy preece saw the future he saw himself prising mrs preece out of her retirement cottage dragging her back to this old place he saw himself running the farm again such as it was these days and ringing the old bell every night until jack was out of hospital and then mrs preece caring for her crippled son and what meagre profits they made going on hired help as he jimmy preece got older and feebler he knew from last nights ordeal how hard it was going to get ringing that bell jack mustve sensed it but he hadnt said a word that was jack though keep on grit your teeth do your duty you dont have to like it but you got to do it going to be hard going to be a trial while this this thing slinks around the place grinning and sneering going to be no fallback a feeble old man and no fallback why dont you just let it go grandad warren said with a shocking hint of glee whats it worth think about the winter them cold nights when youre all stiff and the old steps is wet and slippery could do yourself a mischief isnt it jimmy preece seeing his youngest grandson for the first time as a man a bad man he wanted to take what goff had told him this morning and hurl it in warrens thin snidey face instead he turned his back on his sole remaining grandson and walked out of the house across the yard warren went back into the fireplace and lifted out the old box he set the box on the hearth and opened the lid the hand of bones looked to be lying palm up this morning the stanley knife across it the fingers no longer closed around the knife like the hand was offering the stanley knife to warren so warren took it chapter iii an did bnnge out hys bodie and shewde hym to the crowde with the rope about hys necke joe powys lay on the floor still wearing last nights sweatshirt flecked with mud and stuff from the woods and some blood from later he was alone shed slipped quietly away a few minutes ago the hanged man was obviously the high sheriff sir michael wort displayed by his frightened servants to the angry townsfolk to prove that he really was dead so if theyd seen his body how did the legend arise that wort had perhaps escaped down some secret tunnel only one possible answer to that it had been in his head almost as soon as he woke halfremembering copying out the material and halfthinking it was part of some long tortured dream but the leyhunters diary i was there in his jacket on the floor by his pillow and it was still throwing out answers not very credible answers the door was prodded open and arnold peered round powys beckoned him plunged his hands into the black and white fur it felt warm and real not much else felt real arnold licked his hand powys looked around the room at the darkstained dressingtable the wardrobe like an upturned coffin the milkchocolate wallpaper not the least depressing room hed ever slept in dont blame me for the decor she stood in the doorway she was in a red towelling bathrobe arms by her sides hands invisible because the sleeves were too long its certainly very crybbe he said fay nodded and im never going to sleep here again thats for sure hed awoken several times during the night on his makeshift bed of sofa cushions laid end to end once it was arnold licking his forehead and once with an agonizing image arising in his mind an exquisitely defined twilit image of rachels broken body both eyes wide open in a head that lolled offcentre the perfect pale preraphaelite corpse ophelia the lady of shalott lady cast out upon a rubbish heap hed stood up hearing fay moaning in the bed oh god twisting her head on the pillow it hurts it really hurts it was just numb for a while now it really hurts let me take you to a hospital im not leaving this room and i thought arnold looked a mess she said whats the time theres only one reliable clock in this house and i couldnt bear to look at it powys consulted their two watches on the bedside cupboard half nine ten mines probably right yours is cracked so its ten even my watch has a cracked face fay smiled feebly i was lying there thinking you know it cant be as bad as it feels it really cant then i staggered to the bathroom mirror and it was it really bloody was the cut ran from just below the hairline to the top of the left cheek the left eye was black blue orange and halfclosed the bitch has scarred me for life he remembered all the blood on the linoleum and thought she actually looked a good deal better than the quaking thing hed found curled up on the kitchen floor incapable for a long time of coherent speech its never going to heal fay said bleakly it will but she was probably right thered be a longterm scar this town was good at leaving scars he swung his legs out of bed quite decent still wearing his boxer shorts but he doubted shed have noticed if hed been naked shes back now all right its her house again grace shes repossessed it fay shivered and held her robe together at the throat its like when she was alive there was this thin veneer of gentility ok of politeness now shes dead theres no need to keep up appearances its all stripped away and theres just this this rotting core resentment hate just dont let anybody tell me the dead cant feel hatred maybe they can just project it maybe were not even talking about the dead as such fays right profile was all white she turned her head with a lurid rainbow blur and her mouth lightened with the pain and dont let anybody tell me again that theyre harmless joe she flew at me she was hovering near the floor everywhere this icy stillness and then she sprang there was a perfumy smell but it was a kind of mortuary perfume to cover up the rotting the decay you know powys said helplessly ive never seen a ghost then what did you see last night what in christs name was that the raging black horror in the wood he was sure the girl at the stone would be killed or die of fright but the bitch knew what she was doing so im backing out of the office fay said thinking she can only exist in there jean wendle said i should blink a couple of times close my eyes and when i opened them shed be gone shes only a light effect no more real than voices on quarterinch fragments of magnetic dust and i hit the pause button and the voice cuts out in midsentence so i took the advice closed my eyes and i got out of the room fast because she cant exist outside there can she thats her place right fays fingers were white and stiff around the collar of the red robe and im in the hall ive closed the door behind me ive slammed the door in its in graces face and suddenly just as im shes there too shes right up against me again in my face grace has had has these awful little teeth like fishbones and you know the kitchen doors opposite the office door and so i just threw myself across the hall and into the kitchen and i thats all i remember you hit your head on a sharp corner of the kitchen table shes right he thought she cant stay here tonight any more than i can spend it with the bottle stone it was too dark to see much i thought you were thanks what would you think no i mean thanks you keep rescuing me thats not the way its supposed to be any more arnold waylaid me at the top of the street and dragged me down here with his teeth the dog wagged his tail staggered to the edge of the bed and looked down dubiously good old arnie said fay id just virtually accused him of exacting some awful psychic revenge on the preece family for trying to shoot him come on ill make some breakfast we have to eat neither of them had mentioned the bottle stone he wished he could prove to her it had all happened but he couldnt he couldnt prove anything yet i wanted to call a doctor last night he told her but you started screaming at me i hate doctors you ought to see one all the same sod off sorry i dont mean to be churlish but nothing seems to be fractured cuts and bruises anyway look at the state of you powys picked arnold up to carry him downstairs fay said i wonder what he sees he thought i think ive seen what he sees he said the other time you saw this grace thing what time was it after midnight what was it like on that occasion she didnt move very pale very still like a lantern slide at the foot of the stairs the office door remained closed figures powys said she wouldnt be up to much after midnight or more correctly after ten after the curfew it probably took all her energy just to manifest but last night it was just minutes before the curfew thats when its strongest thats when the whole towns really charged up before the curfew shatters it what are you on about fay shook her head looked at the kitchen floor god what a mess whod have thought i had so much blood in me i think you mention doctors or hospitals again joe ill never sleep with you again fay grinned which was the wrong thing to do because it pulled on the skin around her bruised eye she had to go back into the office to answer the phone it looked as it always did in the mornings far too boring to be haunted the call was from her father sounding wonderfully bright and happy last night while she was sitting by the sink joe trying to bathe her eye the phone had rung and jeans message amplified by the answering machine had been relayed across the hall i cant believe it alex said now i feel tremendous i feel about oh sixtyfive do you think im too old to become a new age person you going to stay at jeans for awhile dad ill probably drift back in the course of the day dont want to lose touch with old doc chi at this stage dads shed a quarter of a century overnight fay told powys no woman is safe well keep him away from the cock why it seems to have aphrodisiac properties it turns people on i dont follow you he told her at last about getting beaten up by humble and rachel taking him to hers and goffs room what had happened then the sudden inevitability of it it was the right time coming up to curfew time i mean rachel was not promiscuous nor me come to that i mean lonely sexstarved but not anyway i just dont think wed ever have got together if it hadnt been for the time and the place i dont understand all right think about the condoms all those used condoms in the alley up by the studio in a town surrounded by open fields doesnt it strike you as odd that so many couples should want to do it standing up in an alley i never really thought about it not that way and last night again at the cock again in the hour before the curfew your exhusband was suddenly overwhelmed with lust for his production assistant and whisked her upstairs catrin guy and catrin powys nodded why do they call it the cock he was buttering more toast it was she reckoned his fifth slice how long since he last ate is that what its really called it certainly hasnt got a sign to that effect fay said what do you know about denzil the landlord got many kids for instance i dont know he isnt married i dont think somebody once told me he put it about a bit but i mean youre getting carried away joe im a loony im allowed he spread the toast with about half a pot of thickcut marmalade sorry look i havent got this worked out yet whatever i says going to make you think im even more of a loony no hang on joe i fay clasped her hands together tightly squeezing them im sorry about yesterday i had no right to dispute your story town full of ghosts no dogs i mean christ im sorry he put a hand over both of hers sighed tell me fay said so he told her he told her about the cottage and the magical filofax and the art studio blood fay touched her temple winced urine what does it mean i dont really know but i wouldnt have one of those paintings on my wall and then he told her about the girl at the stone and the apparition you saw it you saw black michaels hound i dont know what it was maybe the hound is something it suggests whatever it is its feeding off the energy which starts to build up in this town probably at dusk and it comes in a straight line from the tump through the court and on towards the church its evil its cold as the grave fay shivered inside her robe and this girl was getting off on it something like that when the curfew began shed gone shed done this before knew the score what does that tell us about the curfew that the curfew was established to ward something off i think were talking about black michael look he took from his jacket a slim black paperback elizabethan magic by robert turner i found this in the breadoven with the filofax and i nicked it theres a couple of chapters on dee but what i was really interested in was this the page was marked he opened the book at a chapter headed simon foreman physician astrologer and necromancer there was a picture of foreman who had a dense beard and piercing eyes the book talks of a manuscript in foremans handwriting evidently something he copied out much as andy did in his filofax its the record of an attempt to summon a spirit and look this bit he cast out much fire and kept up a wonderful ado but we could not bring him to human form he was seen like a great black dog and troubled the folk in the house much and feared them so what its suggesting powys said is that the black dog image is some kind of intermediary state in the manifestation of an evil spirit in this case the spirits furious at not being able to get any further so hes coming on with the whole poltergeist bit theres a famous legend in herefordshire where a dozen vicars get together to bind this spirit and all thats appeared since is a big black dog so when we talk about black michaels hound were probably talking about the ghost of michael himself we know from these notes of andys which im attributing to john dee for want of a more suitable candidate that michael wort while alive appeared to have taught himself to leave his body and manifest elsewhere travelling on the olde road which is presumably a reference to leylines spirit paths and then theres this legend about him escaping by some secret passage when the peasantry arrived to lynch him dee or whoever records that worts body was brought out after he hanged himself to prove he was indeed dead so maybe he escaped out of his body along the olde road maybe his ghost was seen bringing a lot of black energy with it and they managed to contain it to reduce it to the black dog stage by some ritual which has at its heart the curfew how does that stop it well making a lot of noise banging things bells tincans whatever was popularly supposed to be a way of frightening spirits off maybe by altering the vibration rate im not really qualified to say this is fay held on to his hand seriously eerie i mean youre the expert youve been here before but christ it scares the hell out of me no im not he said im not any kind of expert i wrote a daft speculative book im not as qualified as most of these new age luminaries all i know is that andy boultontrow with or without goffs knowledge is experimenting with what we have to call dark forces hes probably been doing it for years since well never mind now we know why henry kettle was getting the bad vibes boultontrow put goff on to this place probably something else occurred to me too i dont know how much to make of it but try spelling trow backwards tr her eyes widened jesus i mean it could be pure coincidence there are too many coincidences in crybbe fay said she stood up ok what are we going to do about this i think we need to get everything we can and quickly on michael wort any local historians you know fay smiled in crybbe joe an historian is somebody who can remember what it said in last weeks paper what about the localauthority archives where for instance would we find the transactions of the radnorshire society county library i suppose but thats in llandrindod wells how far twentyfive thirty miles lets get over there he started to get up oh god sat down again i cant i have to go to hereford crematorium its henry kettles funeral you cant not go to henrys funeral fay said look ill go to the library tell me what were looking for you cant drive with that eye of course i can and theyre only country roads what am i looking for anything about wort his experiments his hangings his death and the wort family if theyre still around if we can get hold of any of them and john dee can we establish a connection but i mean dont make a big deal of it if we meet back here at what four oclock ok joe look is there nobody we can go to for help what about jean wendle ha fay put a hand up to her rainbow eye her assessment of grace wasnt up to much was it harmless eh were on our own then powys said chapter iv crybbe town hall was in a short street of its own behind the square an absurdly grandiose relic of better days colonel colin col croston thought strolling around the back to the small door through which members of the town council sneaked as though ashamed of their democratic role tonight the huge gothic double doors at the front would be thrown open for the first time in twenty years suspecting problems col croston had brought with him this morning a small can of threeinone penetrating oil to apply to the lock and the hinges col croston let himself in and strode directly into the council chamber the cleaner would not be here until this afternoon and so col made his way to the top of the room where the highbacked chairmans chair stood on its platform he sat down in the chair there was a pristine green blotter on the table in front of him and on the blotter lay a wooden gavel unused like the chair since local government reorganisation in before reorganisation the rural district authority had been based here but progress had removed the seat of power to a new headquarters in a town thirty miles away now there was only crybbe town council a cursory nod to local democracy with ten members and no staff apart from its parttime clerk mrs byford who dealt with the correspondence and took down the minutes of its brief and largely inconsequential meetings the council chamber itself had even been considered too big for the old rdc and meetings of the town council were selfconscious affairs with eleven people hunched in a corner of the room trying to be inconspicuous although their meetings were public few townsfolk were ever moved to attend tonight however it seemed likely the chamber would actually be too small for the numbers in attendance and the chairman would be occupying for the first time in nearly twenty years the official chairmans chair the chairman tonight would be col croston mrs byford the clerk had telephoned him at home to pass on the mayors apologies and request that he steer the public meeting why surely col said briskly can hardly expect old jim to be there after whats happened oh hell be there colonel mrs byford said but hell have to leave soon after ninethirty to see to the bell isnt it shouldnt have to mess about with that either at his age all hes got to do is say the word and ill organize a bunch of chaps and well have that curfew handled on a rota system makes a lot of sense mrs byford the clerks tone cooled at once that bell is a preece function colonel oh dear foot in it again never mind all got to rally round at a time like this mrs byford besides it could be the first step to getting a proper team of bellringers on the job crying shame the way those bells are neglected its a preece function mrs byford said from somewhere well within the arctic circle the meeting starts at eight oclock minefield of ancient protocol this town col croston often thought goose green had been somewhat safer col was deputy mayor this year long army career never mentioned the sas but everybody seemed to know recommended for a vc after the falklands respectfully suggested it be redirected but still regarded becoming deputy mayor of crybbe as his most significant single coup on the grounds of being the only incomer to serve on the town council long enough to achieve the honour which virtually guaranteed that next year hed become the first outsider to wear the chain of office his wife considered he was out of his mind snuggling deep into this hotbed of smallminded prejudice and bigotry but col thought he was more than halfway to being accepted and when he made mayor he was going to effect a few tiny but democratically meaningful changes to the wav the little council operated as well as altering the rather furtive atmosphere with which it conducted its affairs he often felt that although it gave a halfhearted welcome to new industry anything providing local jobs this council appeared to consider its foremost role was to protect the town against happiness indeed until being asked to chair it hed been rather worried about how tonights meeting would be handled he been finding out as much as he could about max goffs plans and had to say that the new age people hed met so far hadnt invariably been the sort of headintheclouds wallies one had feared if it pulled in a few tourists at last it could be a real economic shot in the arm for this town so col croston was delighted to be directing operations with a mischievous little smile he lifted the gavel and gave it a smart double rap silence silence at the back there whereupon to his horror mrs byford materialised in doorway with a face like a starched pinny i hope colonel that youre banging that thing on the blotter and not on the table oh yes of course mrs byford see he gave it another rap this time on the blotter it sounded about half as loud yes ha well ah your morning for the correspondence is it mrs byford stalked pointedly to the corner table used for town council meetings and placed upon it the official town council attache case glad you came in actually col croston said i think we ought to send an official letter of condolence to the relatives i that poor girl who had the accident at the court i see no necessity for that mrs byford began to unpack her case theres no necessity mrs b just think itd be a sympathetic thing to do dont you not my place to give an opinion colonel i should think twice though if i were you about making unauthorised use of council notepaper col croston whod once made a disastrous attempt to form a crybbe cricket club estimated that if he bowled the gavel at the back of mrs byfords head thered be a fair chance of laying the old boot out just a thought it was bill davies the butcher who rang jimmy preece to complain about the picture im sorry to ave to bother you at time like this jim but i think you should go and see it for yourself i know you know more about these things than any of us but i dont like the look of it several customers mentioned it see how is jack now jacks not good jimmy preece said and put the phone down he could see trouble coming been seeing it all the morning in the calm of the fields and the weight of the clouds in the cold gleeful eyes of his surviving grandson ten minutes after talking to bill davies the mayor was walking across the square towards the gallery traders and passersby nodding to him sorrowfully nobody said owre you they all knew where he was going even in todays profoundly pessimistic mood he was not prepared for the picture in the window of the gallery he had to turn away and get some control of himself then face like parchment he pushed through the pinepanelled door with its panes of bullseye glass the woman with too much makeup and a tootight blouse opened her red lips at him oh mr preece isnt it im so terribly terribly madam mr preece his heart wrapped in ice had seen in the gloating eyes of the yellowhaloed man in the picture that the accident to jack and the drowning of jonathon were only the start of it this was what theyd done with their meddling and their new age rubbish that picture in the window whered e come from my husband brought it back from devon why is there did e mr preece said heavily brought it back from devon is it couldnt stop himself devon devon saw the womans lips make a colossal great o as he raised a hand and brought it down with an almighty bang on the thick smokedglass counter the cremation was at twelve and powys was late he felt bad about this because there was barely a dozen people there he spotted henrys neighbour mrs whitney he noted the slight unassuming figure of another distinguished elder statesman of dowsing and there was his old mate ben corby now publishing director of dolmen newly acquired by max goff bloody minister never even mentioned dowsing ben said it had been a swift efficient service no sermon nothing too religious nothing psychic powys said i dont think henry would have wanted to be wheeled in under an arch of hazel twigs do you too modest joe all the bloody same these dowsers look at old bill over there he wouldnt do me a book either powys smiled henry left me his papers in that case you can do the book the strange life of henry kettle an official biography by his literary executor hows that come and have a drink my train back to paddingtons at ten past two ben corby plump and balding yorkshireman the original new age hustler they went to a pub called the restoration and sat at a windowtable overlooking a traffic island with old stone cross on it golden land two said ben how long a year not the time powys thought to tell him there wasnt going to be a book seen andy lately he asked great guy max ben said best thing that couldve happened to dolmen been burdened for years with the wispy beard brigade wimps who reckon you cant be enlightened and make money give me the white suit and the chequebook any day the new age movements got to seize the world by the balls andy powys said patiently you seen him recently andy pain in the arse he wouldnt write me a book either hes always been an elitist twat hates the new age movement thinks earth mysteries are not for the masses but there you go he knows his stuff i gather hes giving max good advice maybe hes just using max everybody uses everybody joe its a holistic society how did andy get involved ben shrugged i know he was teaching art at one of the local secondary schools had a house in the area for years apparently that made sense had he really thought andy was living in a rundown woodland cottage with no sanitation but why teaching teaching what andys hardly short of cash maybe he hit on hard times said ben maybe he felt he had a duty to nurture young minds young minds powys thought of the girl at the stone and then a man leaned over and tapped him on the shoulder excuse me mr powys could i have a word peter jarman mr kettles solicitor peter jarman looked about twentyfive without his glasses hed have looked about seventeen he steered powys into a corner uncle henry he said we all called him uncle henry my grandfather was his solicitor for about half a century did you get my letter powys shook his head ive been away no problem i can expand on it a little now uncle henrys daughter as you may have noticed hasnt come back from canada for his funeral he didnt really expect her to which i suspect is why hes left his house to you bloody hell he really did that seems shes done quite well for herself the daughter over in canada and communicated all too rarely with uncle henry he seems to have thought you might value the house more than she would this is all rather informal but there are formalities so if you could make an appointment to come to the office yes powys said faintly sure in the meantime said young mr jarman if you want to get into the cottage at any time mrs whitney next door is authorised to let you in uncle henry was very specific that you should have access to any of his books or papers at any time you told me jocasta newsome said suppressing her emotions but not very well that you hadnt managed to buy much in the west country and you proceeded to prove it with that mediocre miniature by dufort hereward nervously fingered his beard now that it was almost entirely grey hed been considering shaving the thing off as a statement it was no longer sufficiently emphatic the black beard of the darkeyed figure in the picture seemed to mock him where did it come from hereward all right he snapped it wasnt from the west a local artist sold it to me jocasta planted her hands on her hips girl well young woman get rid of it jocasta said not a request not a suggestion dont be ridiculous take it back now what the hells the matter with you its a bloody good painting worth eight or nine hundred of anybodys money and thats what max goffs going to pay so if goffs going to pay the money whats it doing in our window upsetting everybody one man he couldnt believe this the mayor of this town hereward who was so distressed he nearly cracked my counter but hereward clutched his head hes the mayor not a bloody cultural arbiter not some official civic censor hes just a tinpot smalltown i mean how dare the old fuck come in here complaining about a picture which isnt even an erotic nude or or something whats his problem he calmed down after slapping the counter jocasta admitted he apologized he then appealed to me very sincerely for the future wellbeing of the town he said not to flaunt a picture which appeared to be heralding the return of someone called black michael who was apparently the man who built crybbe court and was very unpopular in his day he actually said that in the year nineteen hundred and ninetythree the first citizen of this town the most senior elected member of the town council seriously said that words to that effect and i agreed i told him it would be removed immediately from the window and off these premises by tonight i apologised and told him my husband obviously didnt realise when he purchased it in the west country that it might cause offence for a moment hereward was speechless when his voice returned it was hoarse with outraged incredulity how dare you how bloody dare you black bloody michael what is this bilge i tell you if this gallery is to have any artistic integrity hereward its going jocasta said bored with him i dont like that girl shes a troublemaker i dont like her weird paintings and i want this one out well i cant help you there hereward said flatly i promised it would stay in the window until tomorrow jocasta regarded him as she would something shed scraped from her shoe it occurred to him seriously for the first time that perhaps he was something shed like to scrape from her shoe in which case the issue of his failed trip to the west his attempt to recover ground by buying this painting on the artists eccentric terms all this would be used to humiliate him again and again she turned her back on him and as she stalked away hereward saw her hook the tip of one shoe behind the leg of the wooden easel on which sat the big dark picture he tried to save it as he lunged towards the toppling easel jocasta halfturned and seeing his hands clawing out must have thought they were clawing at her so she struck first hereward felt the nails pierce his cheek just under his right eye it was instinctive his left hand came back and he hit her so hard with his open palm that she was thrown off her feet and into a corner of the window where she lay with her nose bleeding snorting blood splashes on to her cream silk blouse there was silence a bunch of teenage boys just off the school bus home early after endofterm exams gathered outside the window and grinned in at jocasta the picture of the unsmiling man with the yellow halo in the doorway of crybbe court had fallen neatly and squarely in the centre of the floor and was undamaged its darkness flooded the gallery and hereward newsome knew his marriage and his plans for a successful and fashionable outlet in crybbe were both as good as over assessing his emotions much later he would decide hed been not so much sad as angry and bitter at the way a seedy little town could turn a civilized man into a savage jocasta didnt get up she took a tissue from a pocket in the front of her summery skirt and dabbed carefully at her nose hereward knew there was blood also on his torn cheek he didnt touch it outside the school kids began to drift away jocasta had her back against the window unaware of them still she made no attempt to get up only said calmly voice nasally blocked as if she had a cold i accepted some drawings from that girl a few days ago sale or return do you remember them i didnt make the connection hereward said quietly they were drawings of an old man i didnt see them he was cutting his own throat yes hereward said dully what the reason i dont want this painting here is that the other night while you were away the figure the likeness of this old man the old man in the drawings was seen in our bathroom hereward said nothing not by me of course his wife assured him but the man i was sleeping with swears it was there everything was completely still in the gallery hereward newsome stunned aware of a droplet of blood about to fall from his chin jocasta newsome lying quietly in the window red splashes like rose petals on her cream silk blouse chapter v fay had a whole pile of books and just two short names she was alone in the reading room of the county library in llandrindod wells nearly thirty rural miles from crybbe and another world bright spacy streets a spa town two names wort and dee fortunately there was an index to the dozens of volumes of transactions of the radnorshire society a huge collection of many decades of articles by mainly amateur scholars exploring aspects of the social political and natural history of the most sparsely populated county in southern britain there were also books on tudor history and three biographies of john dee whose family came from radnorshire she read of a farmhouse nantygroes once the dee family home at pilleth six miles from crybbe but it had apparently been demolished and rebuilt and was now unrecognisable as elizabethan dee himself had been born in the southeast of england but had always been fascinated by his welsh border ancestry the name dee it seemed had probably developed from the welsh du meaning black history fay discovered had not been overgenerous to this mathematician astronomer and expert on navigation perhaps because of his principle role as astrologer to the court of elizabeth i and his lifelong obsession with magic and spiritualism most schoolchildren learned about walter raleigh and francis bacon but john dee hardly figured on the syllabus despite having carried out major intelligence operations in europe on behalf of the queen during periods of spanish hostility two hours superficial reading convinced fay that john dee was basically sound he studied natural magic a search for an intelligence behind nature but there was no serious evidence despite many contemporary and subsequent attempts to smear him of any involvement in black magic dee wanted to know eternal secrets the ones he believed no human intelligence could pass on he sought communion with spirits and angels for which a medium was required fay read of several professed psychics who sometimes turned out to be less wellintentioned than he was people like the very dubious sir edward kelley who once claimed the spirits had suggested that in order to realise their full human potential he and dee should swap wives now that fay thought was the kind of scam guy might try to pull but there was no mention of dee working with sir michael wort in radnorshire she skipped over all the weird impenetrable stuff about dees socalled angelic conversations and went back to the radnorshire transactions it emerged that while dee himself might not have been a medium he clearly was like henry kettle an expert dowser in he wrote to elizabeths lord treasurer lord burghley requesting permission to seek hidden treasure using a method that was scientific rather than magical nothing psychic fay smiled involving a particular type of rod he was also most interested in folklore and local customs druidic lore and landscape patterns ok speculation time if there were such things as leylines the mounds and stones which defined them must have been far more in evidence in dees time if leylines had psychic properties dees interest in the remains would have been of a more than antiquarian nature if hed been in the area in the s he could hardly have failed to run into wort if dee felt that wort had knowledge or psychic abilities he lacked he might have been inclined to overlook the sheriffs less savoury practices fay looked up wort and found only passing references no mention of hangings his name was in a chronological list of high sheriffs and that was all she looked up trow and found nothing she looked in the local telephone directories found several worts and several trows noted down numbers then she simply looked up crybbe and found surprisingly little apart from references to the curfew with the usual stuff about the legacy of percy weale a mention of the town hall as one of the finest in the area had crybbe received so little attention because for much of its history it had been in england or was it as shed intimated to powys because local historians werent too thick on the ground it was almost as though nobody wanted the place to have a history and so fay emerged from the library with only one significant piece of information it came from a brief mention of crybbe court in an article dated about the few surviving manor houses of radnorshire crybbe court which the writer said was in dire need of extensive restoration had been built in the s by a local landowner sir michael wort who later served as high sheriff of the county and who lived there until his death in the summer of it was precisely four centuries since the hanging of black michael oh what the hell colonel col croston said dont see why not im really very grateful guy told him it was the first piece of genuine cooperation to come his way well from the locals anyway whether you could call this chap a local was highly debatable but he was the deputy mayor as soon as guy had found out that the public meeting wasnt after all going to be chaired by old preece hed driven off by himself to the deputys home a partly renovated welsh longhouse across the river about a mile out of town on the ludlow road col croston had turned out to be an affable paleeyed sparsehaired athleticlooking chap in his fifties he lived quite untidily with a couple of labradors who rather resembled him and a toughlooking little wife who didnt there was a mechanical digger working on a trench fifty yards or so from the house try and ignore the smell the colonel had greeted him breezily spot of bother with the old septic tank what the deputy mayor had just agreed was to let guy shoot a few minutes of videotape in the meeting before it actually started so there would at least be some pictures of an assembly of townsfolk and councillors guy would milk this opportunity for character closeups of the taciturn grizzled faces of old crybbe his heart lurched he wished he hadnt thought of grizzled old faces with bulbous noses and bulging eyes and blood fountains from severed arteries and er colonel he said hurriedly what id also like if you have no objections is a little interview with you possibly before and after outlining the issues the towns attitudes to becoming a major new age centre well ill do my best guy but i must say one of the things i was hoping to learn in there tonight is what exactly new age is drink thanks just a small one you like it here colonel col names colin well you know got to settle somewhere no its not a bad place once one gets used to their little peculiarities like the dogs used to take these chaps into town of a morning pick up the paper that kind of thing always wellbehaved never chase anything but a word or two was said and now i walk them in the other direction compromise you see secret of survival in the sticks i dont mind so if i were to ask you how people here feel about max goff and ho said mrs croston passing through wearing a stained boiler suit ruths not terribly impressed with mr goff col said my own feeling is its no bad thing at all long as it doesnt get out of hand youve got to have an economy and this place has ignored the possibilities of tourism and that kind of business for too long agricultures going down the chute so on the whole i think were quite fortunate to have him will you say that on camera oh why not long as its clear im speaking personally not on behalf of the council super guy said now what about all these prehistoric stones goffs sticking in the ground ah well thereve been rumblings there i have to say fine by me but country folk are incredibly superstitious who after all got rid of the original stones money however money does tend to overcome quite a lot doesnt it but i wouldnt be at all surprised if some of them started disappearing again interesting guy said so you think therell be fireworks in there tonight col laughed will there be disagreement oh yes will there be suspicion resentment resistance definitely fireworks well theyll listen very patiently to what goff has to say then theyll ask one or two very polite questions before drifting quietly away into the night and then just as quietly theyll do their best to shaft the blighter thats how things are done in crybbe if they dont like you best to keep the removal van on standby with the engine running doesnt sound as if it would have made very good telly in that case even if we got in excruciatingly boring telly col confirmed unless youve got some sort of infrared equipment capable of filming undercurrents nother one no no thanks guy covered his glass with a hand sounds like you have this place pretty well weighed up col good lord no only been here a few years thats just about long enough to realise one needs tove been established here a good six generations to even get close to it annoy the hell out of me these newcomers who profess to be like that col hooked two fingers together with the locals after a month or two i know where i stand and i dont mind weve got an interesting home with about fourteen acres im still trying to decide what to do with and im the token outsider on the council which is just about as close as anyone can aspire to get when im mr mayor ill try to effect a few minor structural changes on the council which will doubtless disappear when the next chap takes over mrs byford will see to that shes the clerk mayors come and go mrs b doesnt is that tessa byfords mother guy watched the colonels eyes grandmother no specific reaction the girl tessa lives with them what they call in crybbe a problem child shows a lot of promise as an artist apparently thats not a very crybbe thing to be as youll have realised shell leave go to college and never come back they all do all anybody who doesnt want to be a farmer or a shopkeeper or some such sad but thats the way it tends to be ah said guy but will she move away now now theres a place for artistic types now crybbe looks set to become a little melting pot for ideas and creativity look guy creativity and ideas have always been frowned upon in crybbe and before you ask no i certainly wont say any of that on camera nother drink did i ask you graham jarrett was just too smooth too confident powys didnt trust him hed wander down to your subconscious like he owned the fishing rights i assure you jarrett insisted that this is on the level ive checked dates ive checked what facts i can and now heres something the bull the girl said she lived at the bull and as you know theres no such pub in crybbe any more but ive discovered the bull was actually the original name of the cock and thats not a cockandbull story graham jarrett straightened his cardigan i have it on very reliable authority hed given powys a transcript of the catrin tape without argument because graham jarrett wanted to be in the book didnt he ok how many other cases have you encountered where the subject is regressed to the very same town where the regression is taking place its been known very often they specifically return to a town because they feel theyve been there before but she didnt she came here to work jarrett opened his hands stranger things yeah ok but youve got a situation here where one personality is fading and another just forces its way in over the top right graham jarrett shrank back into the darkgreen drapery of his consulting room powys was sure there must be more on the tape than there was on the transcript jarrett claimed hed given the cassette to guy but he wouldnt have done that before making a copy i know what youre going to suggest joe well dont dont even use that word possession in here there was a bonus for guy in his visit to col crostons house hed raised the matter of the suicide the old man and the razor less inhibited about it now and less intimidated by it as time went on thered been no disturbance in his room at the cock last night unless one included catrins shrill moments of ecstasy catrin had been quite amazing with the light out no col croston said cant say i have but hed referred the question to his wife neither of them fortunately seeming overcurious about guys interest in local suicides i know mrs croston had said why not ask gomer gomer knows everything the little man working on the soakaway to the crostons septic tank had been only too happy to come out of his trench for a chat there was a disgustingly ripe smell in the vicinity of the trench and guy found that he and gomer parry were very soon left alone good chap the colonel gomer said ad this other job lined up over to brynglas see and it was postponed last minute straightaway the colonel says you stick around boy do my soakaway fills in two days perfect very considerate man the colonel it didnt take him long to get a reaction on the suicide unlike most people in this area gomer appeared to have a healthy appetite for the unpleasant handel roberts gomer beamed sure to be and who precisely was handel roberts copper said gomer while back now i wasnt so old but i remember handel roberts all right didnt wynford tell you about this no i spose e wouldnt coppers see they dont gossip about their own gomer broke off to wipe something revolting from his glasses with an oily rag he blinked at guy thats better aye handel roberts he was station sergeant see like wynford only there was twice as many police in them days before there was any crime to speak of theres logic isnt it well this was the time theyd built the new police ouses as part of the council estate and it comes to handel retiring and the county police lets him carry on living in the old police ouse peppercorn rent sort of thing everybody happy until i forget the details but some new police authority takes over and they decides the old police ouse is worth a bob or two so theyll sell it guy could see where this was going old handel roberts unable to afford the place no savings nowhere to go nowhere but the bathroom ear to ear gomer said with a big grin blood everywhere but e ad the last laugh the old boy did they couldnt sell the police ouse after that not for a long time and then it was a cheap job see billy byford ad it for peanuts newly wed at the time nettie played ell wouldnt move in till billy stripped that bathroom back to the bare brick put in new basin bath and lavvy guy said delicately and he still er that is handel roberts was believed to haunt the place i gather well youre better informed than what i am gomer said anything funny going on there nettiedve been off like a rabbit oh hell aye want me to tell you all this for the telly cameras no problem just gimme time to get cleaned up like no no just something i needed to check anything else you wanner know youll find me around most of the week ad this job lined up with the council but its been put back so im available see any time thats very kind of you indeed gomer i wont hesitate oh there is one final thing handel roberts what did he look like gomer indulged in a long sniff he seemed immune to the appalling stench from the soakaway big nose is all i remember see hell of a big nose powys drove to fays house but there was no one in he didnt know where else to go so he sat there in the mini in bell street it was twothirty hed bought some chips for lunch and ended up dumping most of them in a litter bin feeling sick hed learned from graham jarrett that rachels body had been sent for burial to her parents home somewhere in essex jarrett thought he ought to find out send flowers with a message saying what i think i know why you died rachel you died because of a cat a cat placed in the rafters to ward off evil spirits you died because a fourhundredyearold dead cat cant hurl itself from the building because somebody has to be holding it and unfortunately for you nobody else was around at the time the bottle stone was no more than a sick coincidence albeit the kind that questioned the whole nature of coincidence but the cat had been part of the ritual procedure to prevent something returning before the spirit could regain its occupancy the cat had to go just a little formality powys took a tight hold of the steering wheel i am not a crank chapter vi powys waited half an hour for fay she didnt show he couldnt blame her if shed just taken off somewhere for the night or possibly forever she and arnold battlescarred refugees from the old golden land leaving him to convince goff that the crybbe project was a blueprint for a smallscale armageddon on impulse he started the car and drove slowly through the town towards the court the afternoon was dull and humid the buildings bulged as though the timber frames were contracting squeezing the bricks into dust and the people on the streets looked drained and zombified as if debilitated by some organic power failure affecting the central nervous system or the blood supply which made powys think of fays dad the old canon whose blood supply had been impeded but who now was fast becoming a symbol of the efficacy of new age spiritual healing maybe everybody here could use a prescription from jean wendles dr chi maybe in fact jean the acceptable selfquestioning face of the new age was the person he ought to be talking to this afternoon but first he would find goff and with any luck andy too sooner or later andy had to resurface it seemed very unlikely for instance that he wouldnt be at tonights public meeting rachel had said goff was besotted with boultontrow if there was indeed a sexual element that would mean complications but goff wasnt stupid however even as he drove into the lane beside the church he was getting cold feet about making a direct approach to goff and when he arrived at the court he saw why it was useless something had changed something with its beginnings perhaps in an effluvial flickering in the eaves two nights ago powys drove out of the wood between the gateposts and when the court came into view he had to stop the car you didnt have to be psychic to experience it where before it had worn this air of dereliction of crumbling neglect of seeping decay the atmosphere which had caused henry kettle to record in his journal the court is a dead place no more than a shell i cant get anything from the court it was now a distinct and awesome presence as if its ancient foundations had been reinforced its elizabethan stonework strengthened as if it was rising triumphantly from its hollow the old galleon finally floating free from the mudflats he knew that structurally nothing at all had altered that he was still looking at the building hed first seen less than a week ago as a shambling pile of neglect it had simply been restored to life its power supply reconnected occupancy regained there was a glare from the rearview mirror the mini was stopped in the middle of the narrow drive blocking the path of a big black sports car goffs ferrari headlights flashing as powys released the handbrake prepared to get out of the way the ferraris drivers door opened and goff squeezed out raising a hand powys switched the engine off jm where ya been goff untypically was in a dark doublebreasted suit over a white opennecked shirt he looked strong and for a man of his girth buoyantly fit youre a very elusive guy jm ive been calling you on the phone putting out messages listen that problem with cops thats sorted out now id like to think so max fucking arsehole cops cant see further than the end of their own truncheons they got so little real crime to amuse them in these parts they cant accept a tragic accident for what it is powys said nothing he was pretty sure goff must have known about him and rachel listen goff said the reason ive been trying to track you down i need you at the meeting tonight i dont anticipate problems i think the majority of people in crybbe are only too glad to see the place get a new buzz but but im the first to recognise they might find me a little how can i put this overwhelming larger than life larger than their lives anyhow you on the other hand youre a downbeat kind of guy jm nobodys gonna call you flash nobodys gonna call you weird that a compliment max goff laughed delightedly and clapped powys on the shoulder just be there jm i might need you powys nodded compliantly then said casually wheres andy these days max goffs little eyes went watchful hes around just for the record this whole idea the idea of coming to crybbe that was andys wasnt it it was mine goff said coldly but you did know about andys ancestral links with the court dangerous ground powys watch his eyes goff said you got a problem with that i was just intrigued that nobody talks about it maybe thats not yet something you advertise goff went quiet obviously thinking something over then he put a hand on powyss shoulder jm come over here he steered powys into the centre of the drive to where the court opened out before them like an enormous popup book will you look at that i mean really look powys did and felt uncomfortably that the house was looking back at him jm this was once the finest house in the county not that it had much competition this part of the borders never been a wealthy area but it was something to be envied you can imagine what it musta been like this introverted taciturn region where by tradition survival means keeping your head down and this guy builds a flaming palace well jeez to these people theyre looking at a tower of babel situation heres a guy who takes a pride in the place he lives who loves this countryside who wants to make a statement about that they couldnt get a handle on any of it these working farmers these peasants powys said to get the name out sir michael wort listen this guy has been seriously maligned he hanged people goddamn it jm all high sheriffs hanged people in the attic arguably more humane than public execution but yeah ok that was the other thing about him they couldnt handle he was a scientist and a philosopher he wanted to know where he came from and where he was going to he wanted to find whats that phrase the active force the force above human reason which is the active principle in nature yeah definition of natural magic john dee yeah i got this oxford professor whos so eminent i dont get to name him till he comes through with it but this guys doing a definitive paper on the collaboration between john dee and wort has access to a whole pile of hitherto unknown correspondence from the wort side powys thought of andys filofax wondered whether the professor had been given all the correspondence maybe yeah maybe also some of dees papers that came into worts possession all authenticated material this is heavy stuff jm point is you can imagine how the people hereabouts reacted to it back in the sixteenth century pretty much the way some of them are reacting to your ideas now i should have thought powys wondering how dees private notes if that was what they were had fallen into worts hands unless wort had taken steps to acquire them in order to remove any proof of the collaboration they drove wort to suicide the people around here a witch hunt by ignorant damn peasants threatening to burn down the court goff stood up straight his back to his domain tell you one thing jm no fuckers gonna threaten to burn me out you do have this one small advantage you havent hanged anybody yet goff laughed you really wanna know about this hanging stuff doncha listen how many people get the opportunity to study precisely what happens when life is extinguished when the spirit leaves the body doctors do priests do goff shook his head they got other things on their minds the doctors trying to save the dying person the priests trying to comfort him or whatever else priests do last rites kinda stuff powys saw goffs eyes go curiously opaque only the watcher at the execution can be entirely dispassionate goff said powys could tell he was echoing someone else only he can truly observe chapter vii in a helterskelter hill road a mile and a half out of crybbe there was a spot where you could park near a wicket gate with a publicfootpath sign the path quite short linked up with the offas dyke longdistance footpath and was itself a famous viewpoint from just the other side of the gate you could look across about half the town you could see the church tower and the edge of the square with one corner of the cock you could see the slow silvery river from up here under a sporadic sprinkling of sunlight from a deeply textured sky crybbe looked venerable selfcontained and almost dignified it was nearly pm theyd come out here because there were secrets to exchange which neither felt could be exchanged in crybbe there was always a feeling that the town itself would eavesdrop when powys had returned to bell street fay had been in her car outside with arnold dads not back yet tried to steel myself to go in couldnt do it alone feeble woman chickens out well if youve left anything in there that you want me to fetch he said forget it i suspect youre being indirectly patronising there powys but ill let it go her eye actually looked worse the rainbow effect quite spectacular part of the healing process no doubt he was surprised how glad he was to see her again although there must be no involvement not this time up here the air was fresher and a gust of wind carrying a few drops of rain hit them like a sneeze it was unexpected and blew arnold over he got up again looking disgruntled im beginning to feel im part of andys game joe powys said suppose he left all that stuff in the breadoven for me to find to give me a chance to figure it all out while knowing there was nothing i could do about it and have you figured it out black andy powys said i mean black andy how can anyone called andy possibly be evil andy hitler andy capone andy the hun andy the ripper so youre convinced now its andy wort families often change their name if somethings brought it into disrepute why shouldnt they simply reverse it i made some enquiries thats why i was late there are no worts left in crybbe what remained of the family seemed to have sold up everything well nearly everything and moved down to the west country as for the bottle stone please powys said lets not i think that whole episode was andy trying out his emergent skills weaving a fantasy around a stone creating a black magic ritual seeing what happened yes but look down there pouts said goffs prehistoric theme park the old stones back in place they could see a sizeable megalith at a point where the river curved like a sickle on that bit of tape you played me henry was puzzled by a standing stone hed located because it didnt seem to be an old stone he recorded the same problem in his journal experienced dowsers can date a stone with the pendulum asking it questions too complicated to explain but it seems to work anyway henry noted that he couldnt date this particular stone back beyond when it was destroyed after worts death the townsfolk destroyed the stones after his death perhaps they were advised to to stop him coming back along the spirit paths but the point is perhaps henry couldnt date the thing earlier than because that was also when it was erected there was another gust of wind and the blue cagoule fay carried under her arm billowed behind her like a windsock wort erected the old stones of crybbe they werent prehistoric at all he was marking out his own spirit paths along which he believed he could travel outside of his body are we saying here that wort perhaps in collaboration with john dee had created his own leylines look powys said theres this growing perception of leys as ghost roads paths reserved for the spirits therefore places where you could contact spirits sacred arteries linking two worlds or two states of consciousness new agers say theyre energy lines in their eternal quest for something uplifting theyre discarding the obvious leys tend to link up a number of burial sites tumps barrows cemeteries this kind of thing no healing rays powys shrugged whether this rules out the energyline theory i dont know we might just be talking about a different kind of energy theres certainly a lot of evidence of psychic phenomena along leys or at points where they cross and ghosts need energy to manifest so were told and crybbe for some reason has all these curious pockets of energy fluctuations causing power cuts all this id be interested to know how many people in crybbe have seen a ghost or experienced something unnatural hundreds id guess especially along the main line which comes down from the tump through the court the church the square and along the passage leading to your studio im surprised nothing strange has happened to you in there with this kind of hermetically sealed broadcasting area maybe it has oh i dont think i want to talk about it fay said tasting the electrovoice microphone look she spread out the cagoule on the damp grass at the edge of a small escarpment overlooking the town she patted it they both sat down lets not mess about any more fay said were not kids weve both had some distinctly unpleasant experiences in this town lets not be clever or pseudoscientific about this lets not talk about light effects or atmospheric anomalies ive had it with all that bullshit so in simple colloquial english whats actually happening here she looked down on crybbe the sky had run out of sunlight and it was once again a mean cramped little town surrounded by pleasant rolling countryside to which the inhabitants seemed entirely oblivious almost as if they were deliberately turning their backs on it all living simple functional lives on the lowest practical level without joy without beauty without humour without any particular faith without ive had a thought about the crybbe mentality fay said but youre the expert you go first ok powys said this is what i think i reckon andys got hold of a collection of family papers may have had them years for all i know relating to worts experiments some of them seem to have been written by an outsider perhaps john dee relating how wort came to visit him in spirit using what he calls the olde road wort was haunting him no i think wort was alive then id guess hed found a way you said you wanted this straight yes yes go on ok a way to project his spirit thats his astral body along the leys in much the same way as its suggested the old shamans used to do it or at least believed they could do it the psychic departure lounge said fay glib but it wasnt far out and ive seen a transcript of the socalled regression of catrin jones the character assumed by catrin seems to be suggesting that not only was the sheriff bonking her and quite a few other women on a fairly regular basis in his physical body but that he was also able to observe them while not actually there in the flesh quite a bastard powys nodded and in conclusion she says something on the lines of he swears hell never leave me never which suggests to me that wort believed he would still be able to use these spirit paths these astral thoroughfares after his death except theres something stopping him so he can only actually manifest as a black dog or whatever the curfew every night at ten oclock somebody goes up the church tower and rings the curfew bell one hundred times and when the bell sounds the energy which has been gathering along the leys is released and dissipated we know this happens weve both experienced it fay stood up held out a hand come on ill tell you my theory about the crybbe mentality she led him a few paces along the footpath arnold hobbling along between them until the town square came into view the buildings so firmly defined under the mouldering sky that she felt she could reach out and pinch slates from the roofs they stood on the ridge and watched a school bus stop in the square a land rover pulling a trailer carrying two sheep had to wait behind the bus traffic chaos hits crybbe fay extended an arm like a musichall compere on the edge of a stage miserable little closedin town right sad decrepit morose right said powys cautiously the border mentality fay shouted into the wind play your cards close to your chest dont take sides until you know whos going to win here in crybbe the whole attitude intensified and it operates on every level particularly spiritual a big crow landed on the wicket gate and watched them powys said thoughtfully but there isnt any noticeable spirituality in crybbe precisely youve seen them in church sitting there like dummies drives murray mad but theyre just keeping their heads down never take sides until you know whos winning doesnt matter who the sides are the welsh or the english good or evil fays cagoule rose up from the ground in the wind and the crow flew off the gate cawing fay went back and scooped up the cagoule powys said strength in apathy joe look being a vicars daughter isnt all about keeping your frock clean and not pinching the cream cakes at the fete you learn a few things confrontation between good and evil is highoctane stuff the risks are high so most people stay on the sidelines even vicars what am i saying especially vicars but maybe its harder to do that in crybbe because the psychic pressure is so much greater so they have to keep their heads even lower down neither good nor evil can thrive in a place without a soul who was it said that probably you more to the point we dont like clever people round yere who said that wynford wiley the copper well there you are we dont like clever people says it all doesnt it does it yes because for centuries crybbes been avoiding making waves disturbing the psychic ether or whatever you call it if anybody happens to see a ghost they keep very quiet about it until it goes away dont do anything to encourage them dont give them any energy to play with if they see the black dog they try and ignore it they dont want it to get ideas above its station how am i doing so far go on traditionally dogs react to spirits dont they dogs howl right dogs howl when someone dies because they can see the spirit drifting away so in crybbe dogs simply get phased out maybe theyve even forgotten why they dont like them but traditions soon solidify in a place like this the dogs the curfew there may be others we dont know anything about but anyway suddenly the towns flooded with clever people max goff and his new agers absolutely the worst kind of clever people said fay dabblers in this and that the rain came in on the breeze pulling on the blue cagoule fay looked down into the town and saw that the air appeared motionless down there it was probably still quite humid in the shadow of the buildings its hard to believe powys said that andy didnt know about all this when he planted on goff the idea of establishing a new age centre in crybbe especially if hes a descendant of michael wort hed know it could generate a psychic explosion down there and maybe christ he took fays hand and squeezed it the hand felt cold maybe generate enough negative energy to invoke michael wort in a more meaningful form get him beyond the black dog stage of course he bloody knew in just over three hours time fay said the public meeting begins crybbe versus the new age lots of very negative energy there part eight let us forget about evil this does not exist what does exist is imbalance and when you are severely imbalanced particularly in the negative direction you can behave in very extreme and unpleasant ways david icke love changes everything chapter i even for crybbe the night was rising early it rose from within the shadowed places in the covered alleyway behind the cock beneath the three arches of the river bridge in the soured spiny woodland which skirted where the churchyard ended with a black marble gravestone identifying the place where grace legge beloved wife of canon a l peters was presumed to rest it filtered from the dank cellars of the buildings hunched around the square like old morose drinking companions it was nurtured in the bushes at the base of the tump it began to spread like a slow stain across the limp white canopy of the sky tinting it a deep and sorrowful grey and not yet seventhirty give us a whitebalance larry ember said and catrin jones stood in the middle of the street and held up her clipboard for him to focus on guy morrison looked at the sky shoot everything you can get i cant see it brightening up again i think this is it wasnt forecast larry said no thunderstorms and i cant see there being one in there guy said glancing at the town hall this is probably a wasted exercise what you want me to do then boss weve got permission to go in and grab some shots of the assembly before it starts so shoot absolutely everything you can plenty of tight shots of faces expressions ill point out a few then just hang on in there till they actually ask you to leave and then well stay outside close to the door and catrin and i will try and haul out a few punters with opinions though ill be very surprised if these yokels manage to muster a single opinion between them the victorian facade of the town hall reared over the shallow street like a gloomy gothic temple its double doors spread wide to expose a great cavemouth through which the younger townsfolk wandered like tourists many had probably never been inside before there werent many public gatherings crybbe guy ordered shots of their faces shots of their feet the feet are probably saying more than the faces he thought with frustration at least theyre moving for the first time he began to wonder how he was going to avoid making a stupefyingly boring documentary hed been determined to keep the voiceover down to a minimum let the events tell their own story but to get away with that he needed a pithy commentary on these events from a collection of outspoken locals so far the only outspoken local hed encountered had been gomer parry who lived at least three miles outside the town what are we going to do he whispered despairingly to catrin showing weakness to an assistant he never did that catrin gave his thigh a reassuring squeeze itll be fine gods sake catrin not in public catrin how could he have this place was destroying him parking his escort xr in the old cattle market behind the square gavin ashpole had no fears at all about his story being boring this was the beauty of radio the place might look like a disused cemetery but you could make it sound like bloody beirut whatever happened here tonight gavin was going to put down a hardhitting voicepiece for the ten oclock news describing the uproar as beleaguered billionaire max goff faced a verbal onslaught by hundreds of angry townsfolk fearing an invasion by hippy convoys lured to the new age mecca somebody had suggested to gavin that perhaps he could try out the new radiocar on this one park right outside the meeting send in some live onthespot stuff for the ninethirty news gavin thought not the stations only unattended studio was not three minutes walk from the town hall and he hadnt been able to drag his mind away from last nights interrupted fantasy in that same studio somehow he had to get little ms morrison in there ms morrison whod really screwed any chance she had of holding down the offas dyke contract whod failed to provide a report on last nights tractor accident who hadnt even been reachable on the phone all day ill go in live at ninethirty hed told the nightshift sub james barlow and i want a full two minutes i dont care what else happens he was thinking about this as he parked his car in the old livestock market unusually dark this evening even the sky looked in the mood for a setto humid though gavin took off his jacket locked it in the boot and slung his uher over his shoulder two cars and a land rover followed him into the market half a dozen men got out tweed suits caps no chat no smiles farmers in town for the meeting meaning business i like it gavin told himself everybody who was anybody in the district was going to be here tonight to listen with varying degrees of enthusiasm or hostility to goffs crazy hippy themes there was a small danger that if the opposition was too heavy goff might have second thoughts and decide to take his new age centre somewhere else like out of offas dykes watch which would be no use at all but this was highly unlikely goff wasnt a quitter and hed probably already invested more than gavin could expect to earn in the next ten years even if he did become managing editor no goff had gone too far to pull out too many people relying on him danger of too much bad publicity on a national scale if he let them down he crossed the square and followed everybody else into the sidestreet leading to the town hall gavin quickened his pace and walked up between a couple skinny guy with a ratty beard and a rather sultry wife gavin had to walk between the man and woman because they were so far apart not talking to each other obviously had a row that was what he liked to see acrimony and tension were the core of all the best news stories it was building in the air gavin mentally rubbed his hands alex and jean were taking tea in the drawingroom the canon wearing his faded kate bush tshirt was standing in front of the chinese fire screen legs comfortably apart cup and saucer effortlessly balanced in hands perfectly steady earlier hed spotted himself in a mirror and it had been like looking at an old photograph hair all fluffed up the famous twinkle terrifyingly potent again old boys a walking advert for the dr chi new age clinic he was aware that jean wendle had been looking at him too with a certain pride and several times today they had exchanged little smiles so jean was on the sofa hands linked behind her head jolly pert little body for her age shall we go or shall we stay in several times today shed looked at him like that just a quick glance one really was rather too old to jump to conclusions however which do you think would be most er stimulating och that depends jean said on what turns you on perhaps your poor old brain is ready at last for the intellectual stimulus of public debate as max strives to present himself giftwrapped to the stoical burgers of crybbe give me strength said alex fayll be there no doubt wont want me in her hair or theres grace all alone in bell street will she be worried perhaps that you havent been home for a couple of nights i thought you said she didnt exist as anything more than a light form she didnt unfortunately shes become a monster uh alex lost his twinkle tell me jean said have you ever performed an exorcism the cock was no brighter than a victorian funeral parlour denzil the licensee no more expressive than a resident corpse half past eight and only two customers all his regulars over the town hall jm powys stared despairingly into his orange juice back to his habitual state of confusion everything had seemed so clear on the hillside overlooking the town when fay was aglow with insight arnold lay silently under the table possibly the first dog in several centuries to set foot all three of them in the public bar of the cock we cant fay had warned sod it powys had replied following the dog up the steps ive had enough of this whos going to notice whos going to care and indeed now they were inside there was nobody except denzil to care and denzil didnt notice not for a while powys glanced up at fay across the table it could all be crap he said there fay was drinking tomato juice it was a night for clear heads you see what youre back in crybbe youre doubting yourself youre thinking what the hell why bother its easy to see isnt it why after four centuries the apathys become so ingrained except that it could though couldnt it it could all be crap and were just two weirdoes from off trying to make a big deal out of something because we dont fit in and if its not not crap what can we do about it excuse me sir denzil was standing by their table lowbrowed heavyjowled he picked up their empty glasses thanks powys said well have a couple more of the same glanced at fay ok fay nodded glumly no you wont denzil said not with that dog in yere you wont im sorry dont allow no dogs in yere powys said mildly where does it say that you what sir where does it say no dogs we never ad no sign sir because because you never had no dogs before now this is interesting powys tried to catch his eye impossible were the only customers theres nobody else to serve so perhaps you could spell out in detail what this town has against the canine species take your time give us a considered answer weve got hours and hours powys sat back and contemplated the licensee who looked away the bar smelled of polish and the curdled essence of last nights beer no hurry powys said weve got all night denzil turned to him at last and powys thought yes he does he really does look like a malignant troll mr powys denzil said slowly youre a clever man and we said fay we dont like clever people round yere and collapsed helplessly into giggles denzils expression didnt change no more drinks he said get out it was getting so dark so early that mrs seagrove decided it would be as well to draw the curtains to block out that nasty old mound ugly as a slagheap frank used to say it was the curtains were darkblue dralon behind curtains like this you could pretend you were living somewhere nice there she said thats better isnt it frank frank didnt reply just nodded as usual hed never had much to say hadnt frank just sat there in his favourite easychair his own arms stretched along the chair arms great capacity for stillness frank had i feel so much safer with you here mrs seagrove said to her late husband chapter ii like an old castle the church was when the light was going with the tower and the battlements all black something to really break into not like a garage or a school or a newsagents magic this was when you got in standing there in the great echoey space shouting out fuck and piss when you broke into a church there was like an edge to it sacrilege what did it mean what did it really mean religion was about being bored they used to make him come here when he was a kid just you sit there warren and keep it shut until they gives you a hymn to sing and dont sing so bloody loud next time you tryin to show us up so when he stood here and shouted fuck and piss who was he shouting it at his family or the shorttempered ole god they didnt like to disturb by singing too loud tonight he didnt have to break in nobodyd bothered to lock the place after hed done the window in the vestry when hed been up the belfry and then doled out this plate of dog food on the altar still couldnt figure why hed done that tessas idea shed given him the can next time shed have to explain he was taking no more orders not from anybody warren ground his teeth and brought his foot back and slammed it into the side door wanting to kick it in anyway because it was a rotten old door thatd needed replacing years ago because he wanted to hear the latch splintering off its screws because he wanted jonathon to know he was coming me again jonathon you dont get no peace bro till youre in the ground there was a real rage in him tonight that just went on growing and growing the more he thought about that bastard goff and the way hed tricked him warren could see right through the layers of blubber to the core of this fat phoney the real reason hed had a nice letter sent back to warren with the tape was he didnt know how warrens grandad stood the question of warren being a professional musician for all goff knew the old git couldve been supportive as they said and the old git was the mayor and goff couldnt afford to offend him warren got out his stanley knife the stanley knife and swaggered up the aisle to the coffin saw its whitish gleam from this window over the altar that used to be stained glass only the bloody ole stained bits blew out once in a gale on account the lead was mostly gone and they filled it up with plain frosted glass like you got in the windows of public lavs typical that of the cheapo bastards who ran the church anyway what was left of the white light shone down on reliable steady trustworthy ole jonathon saint jonathon now he flicked out the blade felt his lips curling back into tight snarl as he sucked in a hissing breath and dug the point into the polished lid daggerstyle and then wrenched it back getting two hands to it one over the other sssccccreeeeagh remember me jonathon im your brother i was there when you died maybe you dont remember that wasnt a chance i could very well miss though was it not when that feller sets it up for me so nice chucking the old gun in the drink couldnt go back without that could you bro couldnt face the ole man steady reliable ole jonathon lost the bloody family heirloom shooter didnt see me did you didnt see me lying under the hedge on the other side of the bank well people dont see im good at that even if i dont know nothing about farming and im a crap guitarist always been good at not being seen and watching and listening and you gets better at that when you know they dont give a shit for you not any of the buggers you learn to watch out for yourself see anyway so there you are wading across the river getting closer and closer to my side hey listen how many times did the ole man tell us when we were kids never get tempted to cross the river that ole river beds not stable see full of these gullies see you might not remember this next bit being you were in a bit of trouble at the time like bit of a panic churning up the water something cruel and like if you did see me well you might still be thinking i was trying to rescue you brotherly love all that shit mightve thought i was trying to hold your head above the water well fair play thats an easy mistake to make when youre floundering about doing your best not to get yourself drowned anyway you failed jonathon gotter admit its not often a bloke gets the chance like that to drown his goodiegoodie smartarse chairman of the young farmers brother is it worth getting your ole trainers soaked for any day you ask me gotter laugh though jonathan gotter laugh it was quite impressive inside late nineteenth century perhaps highceilinged whitewalled and a white elephant now guy thought with no proper council any more he was watching from the entrance at the back of the hall while larry ember was doing a shot from the stage at the front people were pointing at larry whispering shuffling in their seats real flyonthewall stuff this was going to be with half the punters staring straight into the lens looking hostile make it quick guy will you col croston said behind a hand ive been approached about six times already by people objecting to your presence catrin said do they know who he is stay out of this catrin said guy col well have the camera out within a couple of minutes but as its a public meeting i trust nobody will try to get me out i should sit at the back all the same col said without opening his mouth look larry ember suddenly bawled out at the audience leaping up from his camera standing on the makeshift wooden stage exasperated hands on his hips stop bleedin looking at me stop pointing at me you never seen a telly camera before stone me its worse than little kids screaming hello mum pretend im not here cant yer maybe you shouldnt be yere then a man shouted back sorry about this guy said to col croston larrys not terribly good at public relations better get him out col said im sorry guy i suspect were all going to be sorry before the nights out guy said unknowingly blessed for the first time in his life with the gift of prophecy a hush hit the hall and guy saw larry swing his arms and his camera in a smooth arc as though hed spotted trouble at the back of the room the hush came from the front left of the hall occupied by members of the new age community and further back other comparative newcomers to the town the other side of the hall where the crybbe people sat was already as quiet as a funeral the hush was a response to the arrival of max goff only the trumpet fanfare guy thought was missing goff was accompanied an entourage first came hilary ivory wife of the tarotist carrying her snowy hair wound up on top like a blazing white torch her bony nervy husband adam was way back behind goff even behind graham jarrett in his palegreen safari suit there were some other people guy recognized from last fridays luncheon party including the noted feminist astrologer with the ring through her nose and a willowy redhead specializing in dance therapy there were also some accountantlooking men in john majorstyle summerweight grey suits max goff in the familiar white doublebreasted and a velvet bowtie looked to guy like a superior and faintly nasty teddy bear the kind that wealthy american ladies kept on their bed with a pistol inside would you turn your town over to this man guy watched goff and his people filling the front two rows on the left the chamber divided by its central aisle into two distinct factions old crybbe and new age tweeds against talismans he felt almost sorry for goff this was going to be an historic fiasco but he felt more sorry for himself because they werent being allowed to film it alex drained his cup in a hurry and bumped it back on its saucer hand trembling slightly exorcism oh god well obviously i was supposed to know about things like that been a practising clergyman for damn near threequarters of my life but sometimes she was in my bedroom id wake up shed be sitting by the bed wearing this perfectly ghastly smile couple of seconds that was all then shed be gone happened once twice a week i dont know fay came down to stay one weekend i was in turmoil looked awful felt awful what did she want with me hadnt i done enough jean put on her knowing look yes alex said guilt again you see a most destructive emotion was she a product of my obsessive guilt a lifetime of guilt perhaps jean nodded poor old fay i think she thought id finally slipped into alcoholism anyway she sent me to the doctors he sent me for tests and they discovered the artery problem everything explained poor old buffers going off his nut cant be left alone and that was how fay and i got saddled with each other and do you feel you need her now well i no im not sure i do wendy this this dr chi business look i dont mean to be offensive of course not said jean solemnly but this renewed er sprightliness of mind its just that i dont honestly feel im the most worthy candidate for a miracle cure jean stood up went over to the window and drew the curtains on the premature dusk bent over to put on the lamp with the parchment shade showing him her neat little gym mistressy bum came back and sat down next to him on the settee close enough for him to discover she was wearing perfume there are no miracles alex surely you know that by now she didnt move an inch but he felt her coming closer to him and smelled the intimacy of her perfume he felt old stirrings hed expected never to feel again and yet it was somehow joyless dr chi and i have done almost all we can for you alex youve been here more than a day intensive treatment it seems longer jean nodded you feel well now alex cleared his throat never better he said carefully so why dont you go home ah said alex jean looked steadily at him in the lamplight unsmiling he said what time is it approaching eight shell be there soon alex will she only one way to find out jean said gently isnt there oh now wendy look perhaps she stood up and went to lean against the mantelpiece watching him perhaps it worries you that once you leave this house your mind will begin to deteriorate again and when you face her once more the guilt will return he squirmed a little you might not be responsible for actually bringing her spirit back her eyes narrowed i think we can blame crybbe for that but you do seem to have made her rather more powerful in death than she was in life youve projected upon her not only the portion of guilt to which she may or may not have been due but all the guilt due to your wife and no doubt many other ladies and husbands and whatnot and bearing in mind your rather poor choice of profession perhaps your god himself is that not so alex i youve been feeding her energy alex the way ive been feeding you a kind of psychic saline drip so im afraid its your responsibility to deal with her alex began to feel small and old and hollow when you leave here jean said regretfully this house i mean when you do leave theres a chance youll lapse quite soon into the old confusion and youll have that to contend with too im sorry alex stared at her feeling himself withering no dr chi jean smiled sadly i never did like scientific terms im on my own then im afraid you let her get out of hand now shes become quite dangerous she wont harm you youre her source of energy you feed her your guilt and she lights up but jean hesitated she doesnt like fay one bit does she stop it alex said sharply youve known that for quite a while havent you you would even plead with grace not to hurt her it didnt work alex she appeared last night to your daughter in a rather grisly fashion and fay fell and cut her head and almost put out an eye alex jerked as though electrocuted opened his mouth trying to shape a question with a quivering jaw shes all right no serious damage jean came back and sat next to him again and put a hand on his shoulder dont worry alex its ok you dont have to do anything i wont send you away alex began quietly to cry shoulders shaking come on said jean taking her hand away lets go to bed thats what you want isnt it come along alex jean wendles expressionless face swam in his tears she was offering him sex the old refuge when all he wanted was the cool hands but the cool hands were casually clasped in her lap and he knew he was never going to feel them again he came slowly to his feet he backed away from her she didnt move he tried to hold her eyes she looked down into her lap where the cool hands lay alex couldnt speak slowly he backed out of the lamplight and with very little hope into the darkness chapter iii the crybbe dusk settled around them like sediment on the bottom of an old medicine bottle thank you denzil powys said to the closed door of the cock that was just what we needed of course its not crap cant you feel it he started to grin ruefully thinking of new age ladies in anklelength handdyed cheesecloth dresses cant you feel that energy not energy not life energy anyway fay where can we go quickly he was aware of a picture forming in his head glowing oil colours on top of the drab turpentine strokes of rough sketching and underpainting everything starting to fit together coming together by design someone elses design studio fay said opening her bag searching for the keys right he didnt need the gavel didnt need even to call for silence in fact he rather wished he could call for noise few murmurs coughs bit of shifting about in seats nothing not a shuffle not even a passing owre you between neighbours put him in mind of a remembrance service for the dead the only difference being that when you cast an eye over this lot you could believe the dead themselves had been brought out for the occasion been like this since goff and his people had come in and the cameraman had left bloody quiet sergeant wynford wiley in uniform on guard by the door as if he was expecting trouble no such luck col croston thought not the crybbe way no wonder the cunning old devil had stuck this one on him thanks a lot mr mayor gavin ashpoles uher tape recorder and its microphone lay at the front of the room half under the chairmans table and a good sixty feet from where gavin himself sat at the rear of the hall the stupid paranoid yokels had refused to accept that if he kept the machine at his feet he would not surreptitiously switch it on and record their meeting he saw a man from the hereford times and that snooty bastard guy morrison nobody else he recognized and gavin knew all the national paper reporters who covered this area there was no sign of fay morrison bitch the newsomes sat side by side but there might have been a brick wall between them with broken glass along the top hereward had planned to come alone to the meeting but jocasta had got into the car with him without a word the inference was that she did not want to remain alone in the house after this alleged experience about which hereward was more than slightly dubious but he suspected the real reason shed come was that she hoped to see her lover with this in mind hereward had subjected each man entering the hall to unobtrusive scrutiny and was also watching for reactions from his wife the appalling thought occurred to him that he might be the only person in the hall who did not know the identity of the other man he could be a laughing stock or she a liar col looked at the wallclock which the caretaker had obligingly plugged in for the occasion five minutes past eight off we go then well he said thank you all for coming i er i dont think that we can underestimate the importance of tonight why did he say that wasnt what hed meant to say the idea was to be essentially informal take any heat out of the situation let me say straight off that no decisions will be made tonight thats not what this meetings about its simply an attempt to remove some of the mystery and some of the myths about developments here in crybbe developments which are transpiring with what might seem to some of us to be rather er rather bewildering speed bloody bewildering speed by crybbe standards and let me say first of all that apart from minor planning matters the changes the developments introduced to crybbe by mr max goff are for the most part outside the remit of local government and require no special permission whatsoever what we doin yere then a lone voice demanded a mans voice but so highpitched that it was like a sudden owl hoot in silent barn nobody turned to look whose it was obviously the voice spoke for all of crybbe col looked up and saw hereward newsome staring at him he smiled hereward did not can i say from the outset col said that from here on in only questions directed through the chair will be dealt with however what are we doing here this as it happens was the point i was about to move on to what are we doing here col tried to look at everyone in the room only those in the new age quarter to his right looked back were here tonight at the instigation of mr max goff himself were here because mr goff is aware that aspects of his project may appear somewhat curious even disturbing to a number of people whats he doing erecting large stones in fields even if they do happen to be his own fields why is he keen to purchase property for sale in the locality col paused what is this new age business really all about on a single page of the leyhunters diary with a fibretipped pen and a nonetoosteady hand powys had drawn the rough outline of a man with his arms spread fay thought it looked like one of those chalkmarks homicide cops drew around corpses in american films the cock powys said breathlessly why do they call it the cock its selfexplanatory this is going to be rather tasteless isnt it look powys turned the diary around on the studio desk to face her he marked a cross on the head of the man this is the tump he made another cross in the centre of the mans throat crybbe court he traced a straight line downwards and put in a third cross the church it was in the middle of the chest and finally where the mans legs joined he drew in a final cross the cock he said or more precisely id guess the alleyway and perhaps this studio she looked at him uncertainly his face soft focus in the diffused studio lighting i dont understand the cock which used to be called the bull occurs precisely on the genitalia if we want to get down to details this studio would cover the testicles and the erect er organ would project into the square very much as the pub itself leans i remember when i spent the night there with rachel i was thinking the upper storey hung over the square like a beer gut close but anyway we were in the room which is directly over the passage the alley and were on that same line now joe this is ridiculous not really you ever do yoga anything like that i never had the time ok well eastern mysticism and western magic suggests there are various points in the human body where physical and spiritual energy gathers and from where it can be transmitted the chakras ive heard of them i think so what we could be looking at here are some of the key chakras the centre of the forehead mental power the throat controlling nervous impulses the centre of the breast affecting emotions and the sex glands responding more or less to what youd expect fay leaned back against the tapemachine im still not getting this joe youre going to have to spell it out like simply the town is the man is the town oh shit what man wort black michael in essence hes never gone away hes fused his energy system his spirit with the town im not putting this very well no youre not this girl jane the character assumed by catrin jones speaks of the sheriff promising hell never leave her he hasnt hes left the sexual part of him here his cock fay looked down at the electrovoice microphone eight inches long with a bulblike head jesus it might even be i dont know buried somewhere powys i dont want to hear this this is very seriously creepy so anybody making love having sex love doesnt come into it is getting some added impetus buzz whatever from a fourhundredyearold fay never wanted to do another voicepiece with that microphone come on she said between her teeth lets get out of here before if what you say is correct we start ripping each others clothes off ironically given the ragged quality of local communal singing the absence of a trained choir or the will to form one the church was widely known for its excellent acoustics and so the revd murray beech heard it all standing appalled behind the curtain separating the side entrance from the nave he heard everything the astounding confession and then the bumps and crashes it was not long after eight although dark enough to be close to ten the churchyard outside reduced to neutral shades the birdsong stilled the small swift bats gliding through the insect layer when murray had first picked up the noises hed been on his way to the public meeting at which he rather hoped he would be able to assume the role of mediator while at the same time putting a few pertinent theological questions to the selfstyled heralds of the new age he was wearing a new sports jacket over his black shirt and clerical collar hed felt more relaxed than for quite some time had in fact been looking forward to tonight it would be his opportunity to articulate the fears of townsfolk who were well unpractised let us say in the finer techniques of oratory at least he had been relaxed until hed heard from within the church what sounded like a wild whoop of joy in this situation it might in fact be wise to summon the police or it might not hed look rather foolish if it turned out to be a cry of pain from someone quite legitimately in the church whod say tripped over a hassock also he hadnt reported the minor by lay standards acts of vandalism of the past two nights and if this intruder did turn out to be the perpetrator of those sordid expressions of contempt a quiet chat would be more in order this was a person with serious emotional problems so murray had hesitated before going in quietly by the side door noting that its latch had been torn away and was hanging loose which rather ruled out the wellmeaning but clumsy parishioner theory no sadly this was the sick person well well he heard now dont you look cheesedoff as behind the floorlength curtain he could not be seen from anywhere in the church the remark could not have been aimed at him which meant warren preece was addressing his dead brother his if this crazed boy was to be believed murdered brother the confession had emerged in a strange intermittent fashion incomplete sentences punctuated by laughter as if it was a continuous monologue but some of it was being spoken only in warrens head it was deranged and eerie and murray remembered the malevolence of warrens face in the congregation on sunday the way the hate had spurted out in shocking contrast to the unchanging stoical expressions of his father and his grandparents murray was in no doubt that this boy at least believed hed drowned jonathon the hardworking conscientious older brother slain by the youthful wastrel almost like cain and abel in reverse he ought he supposed to make a quiet exit summon the police and let them deal with it and yet there was in this situation a certain social challenge of a kind not hitherto apparent in crybbe the inner cities were full of disturbed youth like warren preece always a valid project for the church although some ministers shied away if warren preece was a murderer murray could hardly protect him but if there was an element of selfdelusion brought about by guilt causing a strange inversion of grief he could perhaps help the boy reason it out he heard footsteps but could not be sure from which direction they came or in which direction they were moving for these acclaimed acoustics could hed found sometimes be confusing with three sharp clicks the lights came on and murray clutched at the curtain in alarm very nice he heard very nice indeed and the perverse laughter again invoking an image in his head of the communion chalice on the altar and what it had contained a sudden whitehot sense of outrage overrode his principles his need to understand the social and psychological background to this and he swept the curtain angrily aside all right murray entered the nave in a single great stride surprised at his own courage but aware also of the danger of bravado his eyes sweeping over the body of the church the stonework lamplit pale amber and sepia the stainedglass windows rendered blind and opaque and in the space between the front pews and the altar rail the aluminium bier empty and askew like an abandoned supermarket trolley stay where you are murray roared and then realized in a crystal moment of shimmering horror how inappropriate this sounded because the only preece in view had no choice the vicar wanted to be sick and the bile was behind his voice as it rose choking to the rafters lost in their shadows come out come out at once you you filthy another slack liquid chuckle eeeheheh trailing like spittle murray could not move stood there staring compulsively into the closed yellowed eyes of jonathan preece the open coffin propped up against the pulpit like a showcase the body sunk back like a drunk asleep in the bath the shroud now slashed up the middle to reveal the livid line of the postmortem scar where the organs had been put back and the torso sewn up like a potato sack jonathons corpse splayed in its coffin like a pig in the back of a butchers van and murray beech could not move his nose twitched in acute involuntary distaste as the smell reached him otherwise he was so stiff with shock that he didnt react at first to the swift movement as a shadow fell across him and he heard a very small neat crisp sound like a paper bag being torn along a crease when he looked down and saw that his clerical shirt had come apart a deep vertical split down the chest and upper abdomen so that he could see his white vest underneath turning pink then bright red he couldnt at first work out precisely what this meant chapter iv the square was absolutely empty flat dead quiet under a sky that was too dark too early powys looked up at the church tower hanging behind the serrated roofs of buildings which included the town hall behind him leaning towards him was the cock they stood in the centre of the square which was where the navel would be were on the solar plexus powys said the solar plexus i think is the most significant chakra more so than the head its like the centre of the nervous system i think where energy can be stored and transmitted fay hung on to his arm wanting warmth although the night was humid you see ive never gone into this too deeply its just thing you pick up in passing we may not even be looking at chakra at all fay began to shiver she began to see the town as something covered by a huge black shadow manshaped she knew nothing about chakras almost nothing about leylines energy lines paths of the dead its happening tonight she said isnt it black michael is coming back yeah powys nodded i think its possible it was working from the rear of the hall packed out way beyond the limits of the fire regulations guy morrison saw it all as though through the rectangle of a tv screen and incredibly it was working in spite of his evangelical white suit goff was starting to convey this heavy sober sincerity beside which even the authoritative col croston looked lightweight col in his ornate gothic chairmans chair max goff standing next to him at the table having vacated a far humbler seat but oozing presence goff standing with his hands loosely clasped below waist level goff looking down at first saying not too loudly i want you to forget everything you ever heard or read about the new age movement im gonna give you the crybbe version im gonna tell you how it might relate to this town im gonna make it simple no bull then slowly raising his eyes and the moment i cease to make sense to any one of you i wanna know about it smiling a little now an accessible kind of smile if not exactly warm i want you to stand up and stop me say hey we arent following this max or max we dont believe you we think youre trying to pull the wool it could have sounded patronizing it didnt guy could see only the backs of the heads of the two distinct factions new age old crybbe no heads moved on either side theyd been expecting a showman in a white suit but goff had changed even his small eyes were compelling not a showman but a shaman you see what i dont want is any of you people just sitting there thinking who is this lunatic why are we listening to this garbage whos he think hes kidding because bringing his gaze down very slowly from the back rows to the front rows taking in everybody because im not kidding i never kid i look at this town fay said and i dont see streets and buildings any more i only see shadows powys didnt say anything hed been seeing shadows everywhere for years when theres a gust of wind fay said i look over my shoulder maybe its me he thought maybe ive contaminated her and when the lights go out look powys said quickly hes always been there bits of him he kept snatching breath trying to keep his mind afloat just like behind us along the passage theres a pool of sexual energy that builds up in the hours approaching the curfew accumulates in the place where the studio is no doubt other forms of energy gather elsewhere but it all dissipates when the curfew bell starts to ring each night the ringing of the curfew frustrates the spirits attempts to collect enough energy to activate all the power centres simultaneously all right fay said so one hundred strong evenly spaced tolls of the bell sends the black energy back to the tump with its tail between its legs why do real dogs howl she looked down at arnold lying on the bottom step front of the cock panting slightly im guessing powys said ok its all guesswork isnt it go on this is the big one joe why precisely do dogs howl at the curfew right he sat down on the second step and arnold laid his chin on his shoe ive been thinking about this a lot the curfews a very powerful thing its like an act of violence hits the halfformed spirit like a truck and the spirit wants to scream out in rage and frustration now there are two possibilities either because its at this black dog stage it communicates its agony to anything else in the town on the canine wavelength or it simply emits some kind of ultrasonic scream like one of those dog whistles people cant hear hows that well fay conceded it does have a certain arcane logic she looked up at the church tower powys pushed at his forehead with the tips of his fingers somebody lets continue to call him john dee saw what was happening what michael wort had left behind in essence an opening for him to return to possess crybbe literally from beyond the grave and he recommended certain steps get rid of the stones build a wall around the tump ring the curfew every night one hundred times avoid any kind of psychic or spiritual activity which will be amplified in an area like this anyway and could open up another doorway and so the rituals are absorbed into the fabric of local life and crybbe becomes what it is today morose fay said apathetic resistant to any kind of change every night the curfew leaves the place literally limp guy morrison was clenching his fists in frustration this would have been terrific television he looked around for the mayor of crybbe the man who more than anybody else in the entire world he now wanted to strangle jimmy preece was in fact not six yards away on the end of a row close to the back presumably so that he could slip away to ring his precious curfew guy moved forward a little to see how the mayor was taking this and discovered that for a change mr preeces face was not without expression he looked very nervous his adams apple bobbed in his chickens neck and his eyes kept blinking as though the lids were attached by strings to his forehead where new wrinkles were forming like wormcasts in sand the poor old reactionarys worried max is going to win them over guy thought hes afraid that by the end of the night this will be max goffs town and not his any more and why not for goff indirectly was promising them the earth but somebody had told him about the way business was done in this locality and about the border mentality and he was handling it accordingly what he was telling them in an oblique kind of way was i can help you i can recreate this town make it soar if you cooperate with me but i dont need you i dont need anybody goff was talking now about his dreams of expanding the sum of human knowledge and enlightenment speaking of the great shrines of the world subtly mentioning lourdes and all the thousands of good hopeful faithful people it attracted all year round mentioning in passing the amount of money it made out of the good hopeful faithful thousands but tourisms not what im about goff said what im concerned with is promoting serious research into subjects rejected by universities in britain as well lets say as insufficiently intellectual the growth of basic human happiness for instance has never been something which has tended to absorb our more distinguished scholars far too simple life and death the afterlife the beforelife the human soul why should university scientists and philosophers waste time pondering the imponderable why not simply study the psychology of the foolish people who believe in all this nonsense goff paused with another disarming smile you shoulda stopped me tourism is an option this town can explore at its leisure you want tourists they can be here tens of thousands of them you dont want tourists you say to me max this is a quiet town and thats the way we like it and i retire behind the walls of crybbe court and i become so low profile everyone soon forgets i was ever here guy conceded to himself that had he been the kind of person who admired others he might at this moment have admired goff this was very smart goff saying of course nobodys forcing this town to be exceedingly wealthy laying it on the line for them i have nothing to lose you have everything to gain not even the faintest hint of threat how could they resist him theyll listen very patiently to what goff has to say then theyll ask one or two very polite questions before drifting quietly away into the night and then just as quietly theyll do their best to shaft the blighter but why should col croston think theyd want to the man was offering them the earth limp stagnant powys lowered his voice although they were alone in the square afraid perhaps fay thought that the town itself would take offence as if that mattered now over the roofs of shops she could see the victorianitalianate pinnacle of the townhall roof the stonework blooming for the first time in the glow from its windows there were probably more people in there tonight than at any other time since it was built all the people who might be on the streets in the pub scattered around town and then goff arrives powys said unwitting front man for andy trow last of the worts a practising magician the heir crybbe is his legacy from michael fay sat next to him on the step arnold between them apart from them the town might have been evacuated nobody emerged from the street leading to the town hall nobody went in ok she said hes put the stones back as many as he can hes knocked a hole in the wall around the tump so that whatever it is can get into the court the next point on the line right i saw its light in the eaves i watched it spit rachel out along with the cat not much of a guardian any more but it was there it had to go the next point on the line is the church supposedly the spiritual and emotional heart of the town from where the curfews rung jack preece rings the curfew jonathon his son was to inherit the job somethings weeding out preeces no wonder old jimmy was so desperate to get to the church after jack had his accident hes a bit doddery isnt he the old chap stronger than he looks id guess but sure at that age he could go anytime joe can nobody else ring it what about you what about me what about whats his name warren i dont see why not but it was a task allotted to the preeces and perhaps only they know how vital it is the big family secret the mayors probably training this warren to take over hes got to hasnt he fay was still trying to imagine taciturn wizened old jimmy preece in the role of guardian of the gate to hell no more bizarre she supposed than the idea of crybbe court being looked after by a mummified cat what happens she said if the curfew doesnt get rung powys stood up then it comes roaring and spitting out of the tump through the court through the new stone in the wood and straight into the church through the church gathering enormous energy until it reaches he began to walk across the cobbles his footsteps hollow in the dark and the silence here he stood in the centre of the square the centre of crybbe my guess is there used to be a stone or a cross on this spot but it was taken down with all the stones i bet if you examine goffs plans youll find proposals for some kind of monument wouldnt matter what it was could be a statue of jimmy preece the preece memorial fay said wouldnt that be appropriate fay was silent aware of the seconds ticking away towards ten oclock sure she could feel something swelling in the air and a rumbling in the cobbles where arnold lay quietly no panting now so what do we do if weve got any sense powys said we pile into one of the cars and drive like hell across the border to the nearest place with lots of lights then we get drunk and forget yeah forget fay said my fathers here and jean and mrs seagrove and a few hundred other innocent people the rumbling grew louder fay was sure she could feel the cobbles quaking we cant leave powys said and andys here somewhere andy wort i dont even like to imagine what hes doing its too quiet much too quiet except for the rumbling and two big white blazing eyes on the edge of the square powys said what the hells that the eyes went out and now the thing was almost luminous in the dimness a large yellow tractor with a mechanical digger on the front im gonner park im yere they saw the glow of a cigarette and two tiny points of light from small round spectacles nobody gonner mind for a few minutes its gomer parry fay said ah miss morris is it hello gomer where are you off to gonner grab me a swift pint miss just finished off down the colonels got a throat like a cloggedup toilet flush im out see they watched gomer ascending the steps to the cock a jaunty figure entirely oblivious of whatever was accumulating the commotion of the diggers arrival had for just a short time pushed back the dark powys said fay look weve got to start making our own waves itll be feeble it probably wont do anything but we cant drive away and we cant just stand here and watch sure fay said more calmly than she felt we need to try and break up that meeting well before ten because if they all start pouring out of the town hall and theres something i dont know something in the square i dont know what might happen were going to have to break it up set off the fire alarm or something i doubt if theyve got one but ill think of something i didnt necessarily mean you im the best person to do it ive got nothing to lose i have no credibility left what you need to do because you know all the fancy terminology is go and see jean see if shes got any ideas and make sure dad lies low can you take arnold sure he looked down at her he couldnt see her very well she looked like an elf if paler than the archetype a plaster elf that fell off the production line at the painting stage so all the colours had run into one corner of its face he put his arms around her and lightly kissed her lips the lips were very dry but they yielded he felt her fear and hugged her fay smiled up at him or tried to watch it joe she said remember where you are chapter v have you ever performed an exorcism sitting in the neardark in graces parlour sitting awkwardly with his elbows on the table where fay used to keep her editing machine until until somebody broke it and the only voices he could hear were jeans and murrays alternately repeating the same strange question exorcism well have i canon alex peters remembered the sunny afternoon when murray was here only about a week ago the very last sunny afternoon he could remember remembered exploring his memory with all the expectation of a trufflehunter in milton keynes finally dredging up the suffolk business wasnt the full bell book and candle routine more of a quickie blessthishouse operation actually i think i made it up as i went along graces chair waited in front of graces fireplace the brass balls twisted in the seethrough base of graces clock catching the last of the light pulsing with the final deaththroes of the day and now when you really need the full bell book and candle routine you havent got the right book and the only bell in town is the bloody curfew which we dont talk about candles though oh yes plenty of bloody candles everybody in powerstarved crybbe has a houseful of bloody candles alex dipped his head into his hands and moaned what are you doing to me wendy i cant handle this you know i cant he looked at the clock he could see the twisting balls but not the time but it must be getting on for nine nine oclock and alex sitting waiting for his dead wife and frightened oh yes coming closer to the end didnt take away the fear dear lord said alex hopelessly take unto thee thy servant grace make her welcome in thine heavenly kingdom that she should no longer dwell in the halflight of limbo let her not remain in this place of suffering but ascend for ever into thy holy light alex paused and looked across at the mantelpiece as though it were an altar amen he said and lowered his chin to his chest he had no holy water no vestments no bible no prayer book an old man in faded kate bush tshirt tracksuit trousers and an ancient peeling pair of gymshoes standing head bowed in the centre of the room making it up as he went along what else could he do certainly not this strident stuff about commanding unquiet spirits to begone not to grace a prim little lady who never even went to the newsagents without a hat and gloves forgive me grace alex said he sat down in the fireside chair which had been hers on those special occasions when the sittingroom was in use forgive me he said and fell asleep fay slipped into the hall unprepared for the density of the crowd how could so many be so silent every seat was taken and there were even more people standing lining every spare foot of wall two or three deep in some places wynford wiley guardian of the main portal turned his sweating cheese of a head as she came in rasping at her not got that tape recorder ave you fay held up both hands to show she hadnt and wynford still looked suspicious as if he thought she might be wired up with a hidden microphone in her hair for christs sake what did it matter she stood just inside the doors and saw the impossibility of her task there must be over three hundred people in here joe powys hadnt been entirely serious but hed been right the best thing they could have done was pile into the car and make a dash for civilization and shed been so glib ill think of something fay looked among the multitude at individual faces each one set as firm as a cardboard mask except in the new age ghetto towards the front of the hall to her left where there was a variety of expressions a permanent halfsmile on the nodding features of a smart man in a safari suit a woman with an explosion of white hair wearing a beatific expression face upturned to the great god goff max was being politely crossexamined on behalf of the townsfolk by the chairman craggy colonel croston who fay knew from council meetings the only councillor whod ever spoken to her before the meetings i think one thing that many people would like me to ask you mr goff is about the stones why is it necessary to erect what i suppose many people would regard as crude symbols of pagan worship goff seemed entirely at ease with the question well you know leaning back confidently in his chair i think all that pagan stuff is a concept which would raise many an eyebrow in most parts of wales where nearly every year a new stone circle is erected as part of the national eisteddfod i realize the eisteddfodic tradition is not so strong here on the border any more if it ever was but if you were to place these stones in the ground in aberystwyth or caernarfon or fishguard i doubt anyone would even notice the point is mr chairman all this is largely symbolic it symbolises a realisation that this town was once important enough to be a place of pilgrimage like lourdes perhaps and that it can be again spontaneous sycophantic applause burst from the new age quarter is he blatantly lying fay wondered or does he seriously believe this bullshit or are we joe powys and i grossly insultingly libelously wrong about everything but almost as soon as she thought this she began to feel very strongly that they were not wrong it was ten minutes past nine the chamber lit by wroughtiron electric chandeliers and she just knew there was going to be a power cut within the next half hour come in joe jean wendle said i fear we shall be losing our electricity supply before too long how do you know that carrying arnold he followed her down the hall and into her livingroom where a pleasant victorian lamp with a paleblue shade burned expensive aromatic oil theres a sequence jean said perching birdlike on a chairarm tea no time thanks whats the sequence well temperature fluctuation to begin with either a drop or a raising of the temperature coupled with a kind of tightening of the air pressure that you come to recognize ysee these new trip mechanisms or whatever they use do seem to be rather more vulnerable to it than the old system or so it seems to me jean crossed her legs neatly she was wearing purple velour trousers and white moccasins no time eh my he put arnold down when you say it it oh we could be talking about anything from the geological formation did you know theres a fault line running through mid wales and right along the border here thereve been several minor but significant earthquakes in recent years theres the geology to start with jean powys said were in a lot of trouble aye jean wendle said i know so lets not talk about temperature fluctuations or rock strata lets talk about michael wort what about him powys sat down gathered his thoughts and then spent three minutes telling her in as flat and factual a way as he could manage his and fays conclusions ending with the shadow of black michael falling over crybbe whatever remained of his earthly power centres fused with the towns the exchange of dark energy he felt arnold pushing against his legs in the way hed done last night in bell street before leading him to the blood and the semiconscious fay powys reached down a hand and patted him and arnold began to pant hes aware of the urgency too powys thought but then hes a dowsers dog itll try and take the church tonight he said and then god knows jean sat and listened when he finished she was silent for over a minute powys looked at his watch and then bit on a knuckle thats very interesting jean said you may be right arnold whined shush powys laid a hand on the dogs side arnold breathing rapidly we havent any time to waste jean i think it seems to me i need to get over to the church and ensure that well that old preece makes it to the belfry i cant think what else i can do thats halfway meaningful can you jean thought for a moment and then shook her head what i think is in fact i know that you ought to go for the source her eyes were very calm and sure powys said i dont know what you mean the source joe where it begins he thought of the great dark mound with its swaying trees and the blood of henry kettle on its flank thats right jean said the tump i it was forbidding enough by daylight dont think you can handle that i dont see the point im not a magician im not a shaman im just a bloody writer not even that any more no he might just as well have said i dont think i can handle it this was jean wendle he was talking to jean wendle the psychic also jean wendle the barrister the human lie detector oh joe joe youre like alex you wont face up to the way it is to what has to be done you lost the wee girl rose you lost rachel wade no he shook his head he didnt understand he hadnt understood when it happened either time and he didnt understand now what am i missing suddenly he was in a mental frenzy why did she have to say that why did she have to slap him across the face with the incomprehensible horror of rose and rachel and was he missing something dont let yourself lose this one jean said fay please what cant i see and when i get to the tump he asked weakly what am i supposed to do then youre looking for boultontrow arent you he stared at her arnold throbbing against his ankle if boultontrow has orchestrated all this then he has to find somewhere has he not with his wee conductors baton he has to have a podium from which if you really want to end all this you must dislodge him im sorry joe its never easy you know that really dont you you could indeed lend jim preece a supporting arm as he climbs the steps to the belfry but are you going to be there again tomorrow night and the night after powys stood up his legs felt very weak he was afraid he gathered the trembling arnold awkwardly into his arms looked vaguely around wheres the canon jean saw him to the door dont worry about alex hes coming to grips with his past too she gave his arm a sympathetic squeeze its the night for it col croston was pleased and yet disappointed too it was going smoothly max goff was making his points very cogently and had been impressing him as the strictly neutral chairman and no he hadnt expected fireworks but wasnt this just a little bit too tame hadnt once had to bang his gavel or call for silence just that spot of aggression towards the cameraman minor premeeting nerves and that single reedy interruption during his introduction all of this before hed even called on goff to address the meeting and now the fellow had been given a more than fair hearing right col said well i think ive put all my questions so what about all of you whats the general feeling i think we at least owe it to mr goff for him to be able to walk away from here tonight with some idea of how the townsfolk of crybbe are reacting to his ideas wasnt awfully surprised to get a lot of blank looks well come on dont be shy this is a public meeting and you are in fact the public when he did get a response it came unsurprisingly from the wrong side of the room the large middleaged woman with the white hair was on her feet yes said col mrs ivory isnt it go ahead mr chairman mrs ivory said sweetly im sure we seem a pretty strange lot to the local people she paused if she was waiting to be contradicted fay thought shed be on her feet for the rest of the night well mrs ivory blushed i suppose we all have adjustments to make dont we i know i got some very odd looks when i went into a sweetshop and said i preferred carob to chocolate actually and didnt mind paying the extra for a no dairy alternative good grief col thought is this the best you can do what i mean is mr chairman i suppose we have got what seem like some funny ideas but well were harmless and dont mind people thinking im an eccentric as long as they accept me as a harmless eccentric thats the point i want to make we dont want to take over or impose some weird new regime were not like the jehovahs witnesses we wont be knocking on doors or handing out pamphlets saying come and join the new age movement were gentle people and were not going to intrude and well thats all i have to say really thank you thank you mrs ivory said col well there you are i think that was very er a valuable point so what about some local reaction mr mayor youre down there on the floor of the meeting tonight somewhat of a new experience for you but what it does mean is you are entitled to speak your mind give us the benefit of your er he was going to make a little new age sort of joke then about the mayors ancient wisdom but decided perhaps not years of experience he watched jimmy preece rising skeletally to his feet not expecting a sermon just a few words mr mayor well i jimmy preece looked down at his boots and then he said prosaically on behalf of the town id like to thank mr goff for coming along tonight and telling us about his plans very civil of im im sure well all bear in mind what es ad to say and the mayor sat down col looked helplessly at max goff at the back of the room fay morrison looked at her watch saw it was coming up to twenty minutes past nine and was very much relieved within a couple of minutes the meeting would be wound up and all these people would go their separate ways theyd be off the line away from what she was slowly and less credulously corning to think of as the death path thank you mr mayor goff said rising to his feet thank you mr chairman but this is only the start of things what goff said id like you to meet at this point some of the people youll be seeing around town for those who wanna know more about the heritage of the area the distinguished author m powys will be er with us presently but id like to acquaint you first of all with some of the very skilled practitioners who for an introductory period will be making their services available entirely free of charge to anyone in crybbe whod like to know more about alternative health as hilary said a few moments ago therell be no proselytizing theyll simply be around if required so first of all id like you to meet he stopped the chairman had put a hand on his arm one moment mr goff i think we appear to have another question think i saw a hand going up at the back oh col had recognized fay morrison the radio reporter this was public meeting not a media event however in the absence of any worthwhile response from the floor he supposed it would be all right to let her have her say yes he said mrs morrison goffs head spun round this is not a press conference mr chairman yes im aware of that mr goff but mrs morrison is a resident of crybbe yeah sure but and i am the chairman col said less affably goff shut up but he wasnt happy col was this was more like it go ahead mrs morrison id like to know if mr goff is going to introduce us to his chief adviser mr boultontrow im afraid goff said coldly that mr boultontrow is unable to be with us tonight why not goff dropped his voice look mr chair ive had dealings with this woman before shes a load of trouble she makes a practice of stirring things up shes been fired by the local radio station for inaccuracy shes mr goff thin steel in cols voice this is a public meeting and im the chairman go ahead mrs morrison but i hope this is relevant i dont want a slanging match thank you mr chairman fay said ive certainly no intention of being at all argumentative oh god go for it woman id simply like to ask mr goff what contribution he expects will be made to the general wellbeing of crybbe by employing a descendant of perhaps perhaps the most hated man the history of the town she paused people were turning to look at her especially from the crybbe side of the room and goff was on his feet this is ridiculous the chairman slammed down his gavel please im referring fay said raising her voice to the sixteenth century sheriff known popularly since his death as black michael and widely known at the tune for unjustly hanging mrs morrison said the chairman with the best will in the world i dont honestly think andy trow has of course reversed his real surname he is andy wort isnt he mr goff there was a silence oh fuck it fay thought take it all the way hes also i understand your lover and the lights went out chapter vi plea se take my arm better good do you remember when i used to offer you my arm in the street and you absolutely refused to accept it not until were married you would say even though you were quite poorly worried about your reputation i suppose bit late for that and then of course when we were married it was quite impossible with you in a wheelchair and me pushing the damn thing all right now though isnt it yes all right now which way shall we go no you choose down to the river no to the church yes of course bring back some memories young murray did rather well i thought yes i agree about the amendments to the vows saved any embarrassment didnt it indeed it did it is dark isnt it careful now mind you dont trip over the kerb or the end of your shroud do tell me wont you if youre feeling tired jolly good as joe powys drove on full headlights into the lane that slipped down beside the church he formed an image of crybbe as an old and poorly built house riddled with damp periodically new people would move in and redecorate the rooms bright new paint new wallpaper new furniture but the wet always came through and turned the walls black and rotted the furniture and eventually people stopped throwing money at it and just tried to insulate themselves and their families as best they could it wasnt much fun to live in and the people who stayed there were the ones with few prospects and nowhere else to go and that was the basic socioeconomic viewpoint trying to explain the supernatural aspects in terms of rising damp was more complicated if only he could speak to the shadowy figure who in the late s had attempted to install just above groundlevel an effective dampproof course lets assume this man was john dee astrologer at the court of queen elizabeth i powys braked hard as a baby rabbit shot from the hedgerows into the centre of the road and then stopped turning pale terrified eyes into the headlights he switched off the lights and the rabbit scampered away just for a moment powys smiled theres a portrait john dee in middle age a thinfaced man with high cheekbones watchful but kindly eyes he wears a black cap suggesting baldness and has a luxurious white beard like an icecream cone in andys notes dee if it is he gives only graphic descriptions of experiences like the visit of the spirit wort in the night perhaps somewhere dee has documented the action he took to contain the rampant spirit after worts death dee never seems to have been very wealthy towards the end of his life he was virtually exiled to the north as warden of christs college manchester with elizabeth dead and james on the throne james who was in constant fear of satanic plots and clamped down accordingly on all forms of occultism the elderly dee was forced to defend himself and his reputation as a scholar against various accusations that he practised witchcraft illfounded accusations no doubt but these were dangerous paranoid times so what would the penurious dee do if contacted by old friends or relatives in crybbe with tales of hauntings and oppression by dark forces invoked by the late sir michael wort he drove past the turning to court farm and could see no lights between the trees no lights anywhere he might out there be twenty miles from the nearest town it was like driving back in time or into another dimension to percival weale merchant of crybbe my dear mr weale it was with much sorrow that i received your letter informing me that our mutual associate sheriff wort continues to torment the town from a place beyond this life it has long been apparent to me that the ethene layer is so dense upon the atmosphere along the border of wales and england that it may not always be so comfortable a place of habitation and did dee old impecunious and in constant fear of arrest appeal to percy weale to make financial provision for the curfew to be rung so that the most dangerous hours of darkness might remain peaceful and to assign some longestablished local family to the task and being unable to travel to crybbe himself did he vaguely suggest that if the malignant spirit were to be controlled it was essential for the stones to be removed the tump walled in and the spiritual energy level to remain low and you must warn the townspeople to continue with their lives but not to expand the town to any great extent and above all to offer no challenge to the spirit and as for the hand and any other of his limbs or organs that should come to light no purpose will be served in their destruction you must take these and enclose them in separate and confined places i would suggest within a chimney or fireplace or beneath a good stone floor where they may never be exposed to the light or the air this is far from satisfactory but my knowledge does not extend to more forgive me powys drove between the gateposts of crybbe court and felt the house before he saw it a dark and hungry maw he thought hand what hand i dont know anything about a hand get your act together powys he thought about fay and started to worry so he thought about rachel instead and he looked up towards the house and felt bitterly angry better keep to the path i think my dear somewhat safer in the dark not that they take much care of this path or indeed the church itself never much in the way of civic pride in crybbe poor murrays got his hands full ah now i know where were going were going to your grave arent we now look before you say anything im sorry it had to be down at this end not exactly central i realise that another few yards in fact and youd be in the wood but its surely shady on a warm day and you never did like too much sun did you i suppose you spent most of your life in the shade really and well you know i always had the impression that was how you wanted it to be i know i know the flowers i keep forgetting memory isnt what it was as you know you bring a few flowers with the best of intentions and then you forget all about them and the next time you come theyre all dead and forlorn and there are stalks and seedpods everywhere all a terrible mess and i do understand the way you feel about that of course i do hello whos this oh grace look its young murray no dont get up old chap well er its a lovely night isnt it yes indeed whats that cain and abel im sorry im not quite getting your drift what youre saying is abel killed cain well not in my version old son but i suppose you modernists have your own ideas abel killed cain eh well if you say so murray if you say so arnold was not at all happy about being left in the mini joe powys had pushed back the slideopening drivers window several inches to give him plenty of air and he stood up on the seat and pressed his head through the gap and whined frantically i cant take you powys said please arnold hed left the dog a saucer of water on the back shelf poured from a bottle he kept in the boot because the radiator had been known to boil dry knowing full well that he was doing all this just in case for some unknowable reason he didnt get back good boy he said good boy he locked the car and moved quickly uncomfortably away he didnt want to be here he felt he was in the wrong place but he didnt trust his own feelings he trusted jean wendles feelings because jean was an experienced psychic and a wise woman and he was just a writer and when it came to dealing with real life writers didnt know shit the mini was tightly parked in a semiconcealed position behind the stableblock powys carried a handlamp with a beam projecting a good fifty yards in front of him it was probably a mistake he should be more surreptitious what was he going to do stand amid the ruins of the wall pinning andy in the powerful beam as he cavorted naked in the maelstrom of black energy it all sounds he said aloud into the night so bloody stupid earth mysteries book your seats for a magical mindexpanding excursion to the old golden land a funfilled new age afternoon a book of halfbaked pseudomystical musings on your knee as you picnic by a sacred standing stone around it a glowing aura of fascinating legend as he moved uncertainly across the field towards the tump it struck him that it was past ten oclock and thered been no curfew well it was late last night too took old preece longer to make it to the belfry but he still thought thats where i should be or with fay not here or am i just trying to put it off again the confrontation afraid my reasonings all to cock and this man with his precise laidback logic and his superior knowledge of the arcane is going to hold up another dark mirror as was usual with these things he didnt notice it happening until it had been happening for quite some time climbing easily over the ruins of the wall where somebody had taken a bulldozer for a midnight joyride the rhythm of his breath began to change so that it was a separate thing from what he was doing which was labouring up the side of the mound normally to do this he would be jerking the breath in like a fireman on a steam train shovelling more and more coal on breath as fuel but he was conscious in an unconcerned dreamlike way of the climb being quite effortless and the breathing fuelling something else some inner mechanism each breath was a marathon breath long long long but not at all painful when you discovered that you after all possessed a vast inner strength it was a deeply pleasurable thing he followed what he thought was the beam from the lamp until he realized the lamp had gone out but the beam had not as though he was throwing a shadow a negative shadow which made it a shadow of light out of the tufted grass and into the bushes moving with ease watching his legs doing the work as legs were meant to do tearing through the undergrowth in their eagerness to take him to the summit of the mound the source each breath seeming to take minutes breathing in not only air but colours all the colours of the night which were colours not normally visible to undeveloped human sight moving up the side of the tump between bushes and tree trunks and moving effortlessly effortlessly as the last time goes round thrice goes round chapter vii nobody panicked well they wouldnt would they not in crybbe theyd be quite used to this by now part of everyday life everynight life anyway so there were no screams no scrambles for the door guy morrison knew this because he was standing only yards from the exit where the fat policeman wiley was doubtless still at his post only a matter of time wasnt it col croston called out dont worry it often happens during council meetings mrs by fords gone to switch on the generator it was a bloody mercy in guys opinion the woman was completely and utterly insane for the first time guy was profoundly thankful he and fay had never had children he hoped that by the time the lights came on shed have had the decency to make herself scarce the sheer embarrassment of it guy somebody snuggled against his chest just as well it is me he whispered and she giggled and kissed his neck a worrying thought struck him youre not wearing lipstick are you catrin not any more catrin jones said and guy plunged a hand into his jacket pocket searching frantically for a handkerchief no im not catrin said honest im sorry shut up then he hissed conscious of the fact that nobody else appeared to be talking wont be long now col croston shouted cheerfully at least guy thought it would be an opportunity for him to pretend the five minutes before the power cut had never happened he became aware that somebody had drawn back the curtains at the windows and what little light remained in the sky showed him a scene like the old black and white photographs hed seen of the insides of airraid shelters in the blitz only even more overcrowded all it needed was someone with rampant claustrophobia to start floundering about and thered be total chaos but nobody moved and nobody spoke and it was quite uncanny he felt catrins hand moving like a mouse in one of his hip pockets when they got back to cardiff hed suggest she should be transferred something she couldnt very well refuse six months attachment as an assistant trainee radio producer or anything else that sounded vaguely like promotion as his eyes adjusted guy was able to make out individual faces a fat farmer who hadnt taken off his cap that cocky little radio chap trying vainly to see his watch jocasta newsome and her husband strange that she wasnt talking perhaps theyd had a row the radio bloke at least this outfit had had the good sense not to have fay covering the meeting was on his feet and moving to the door just a minute guy heard wiley say officiously where do you think youre goin look ive got an urgent news report to go down gavin ashpole offas dyke radio well you can ang on yere studio wont be workin if theres no power is it then ill do it by phone do you mind im not bein offensive sir but you might ave lifted somebodys wallet in there and be makin off with the proceeds oh for look pal ive got an expensive tape recorder on the floor under the chairmans table you can hold it to for ransom if i dont come back now please lucky i recognizes your voice mr ashpole wynford wiley said genially and guy heard a bolt go back thanks guy heard the door grinding open but he didnt hear it close again he didnt hear anything had he been looking through the viewfinder of a camera it would have seemed at first like a smear on the lens then it took shape like a sculpture of smoke and a figure was standing in the central aisle between the two blocks of chairs it looked lost it moved in short steps almost shuffling like a chaplinesque tramp in an old film but in slowmotion there was a yellowish tinge to its illdefined features it was a man his nose was large and bulbous his eyes were pure white and he was moving down the aisle towards guy morrison even without his razor guy would have known him anywhere guy screamed no get away get back catrin gasped and moved sharply away from him but ex veryex police sergeant handel roberts continued to shuffle onwards as if the room were not illegally overcrowded but empty apart from guy morrison and himself jocasta guy screamed look its him its him closing his eyes throwing an arm across his face he plunged forward like someone making a desperate dash through flames to the door of a blazing room there was a ghastly tingling moment a damp and penetrating cold and then he was on his knee his head in her lap his hands clawing at her dress mumbling incoherently into her thighs he began to sob oh god jocasta its jocasta newsome didnt move when he opened his eyes he saw there were lights on in the room but different lights fluorescent bars high on the walls he looked up at her face and found it harsh and grainy in the new light and frozen into an expression of ultimate disdain you filthy bastard the thin bearded man next to her said moving like a train through the night the track unrolling before you a ribbon of light straight as a torch beam there are deepgreen hills on either side deep green because they are dense with trees and the silver snaking river all of this quite clearly visible for they do not depend on sunlight or moonlight but have their own inner luminescence there are no buildings in this landscape no farms or cottages or barns or stables or sheepsheds no cars no tractors no gates no fences no hedges in some places the trees give way diminishing themselves become not separate definite organic entities but a green wash a watercolourists view of trees then they fade into fields but with the spirit of the old woodland still colouring their aura it is a strange land at first but then not so strange for what you see is the true essence of the countryside you know this is a country unviolated by man this is the spirit landscape what you once presumed to call the old golden land and the unfurling ribbon of light is what over half a century earlier your mentor alfred watkins had presumed to call the old straight track alf alf watkins isnt it you here too no answer he isnt here youre alone lying between two tall trees on top of the tump in the heat and moving like fast train in the night until with no warning the track buckles in front of you and the night shatters into a thousand shards of black glass remember me a whisper tumult in the hall nobody else heard the whisper dry as ash whos that oh dont reckernize the voice then is it yeard it before though you ave huh crude what lyrically mor onic what the an musically musically inept jeez you must be cant even remember my fuckin name can you listen ill talk to you later tomorrow make an appointment youre a bloody old bag of shit you are listen i can understand dont let the kid give up sheepshearing classes thats what you said yeah but i knows ow to shear sheep already though see what you do is gavin ashpole was discovering that there was virtually nowhere quite as dark as a tiny windowless unattended radio studio during a power cut belonging as it did to offas dyke radio the crybbe unattended unlike the town hall did not have a generator the emergency lighting amounted to an old bicycle lamp which fay morrison left on the table in the outer office it took several minutes and a lot of explicit cursing for gavin ashpole to find it he knew time must be getting on as he sat down at the desk to transcribe his notes and scramble together a voicepiece a phone call confirmed it gavin whereve you been man youre on air in two minutes huh gavin aimed the bicycle lamp at his watch it said shit shit

businessman max goff at a packed public meeting to discuss his plans for a socalled new age mystical healing centre in the border town of crybbe from where gavin ashpole now reports got that gavin hung up he had enough for one minute with what hed already written he pulled off his tie stretched out his legs switched off the lamp and waited for the studio to ring sodding power cut maybe he should have brought the radio car after all he could have done an exclusive interview with the famous fay morrison stupid slag she deserved everything she was going to get everybody knew max goff was pretty wellestablished in shirt lifting circles but unless you were seriously suicidal you didnt bring up this issue before about three hundred witnesses including a couple of suits who looked like outriders from the epidemic legal department he should sue the pants off the bitch pants off the bitch aaaah went through him like a redhot wire he nearly took off ssssstrewth he wanted her in truth he wanted anybody but superbitch fay morrison was the one whose image was projected naked into his lap with its legs wrapped around him in the dark hot stifling in here warm air jetting at him like a fanheater too fucking hot and who was there to notice anyway if he took off his trousers the phone rang gavin news studio can you hear this ok plugged into the news major row erupted in the commons tonight when welsh nationalist mp guto evans challenged the governments then faded down and james barlows voice in the earpiece gavin well be coming to you in about a minute and a half and youve got fifty seconds ok yeah gavin croaked yeah the fluorescent bars were only secondary lighting linked to what must have been a small generator the room was still only halflit and the light from the walls was blue and frigid fay unmoving at the rear of the hall knew that something had changed and the light was part of it it altered the whole ambience of the room and better reflected the feeling of the night in that it was a cold unnatural light she couldnt understand for a moment why so few people were taking in the ludicrous spectacle of her exhusband the sometimes almostfamous tv personality making such a prat of himself over the appalling jocasta newsome then she heard the silence silence spreading like a stain down the hall from the people at the front whod seen it first fay looked and didnt believe her eyes hurrying back to stupid guy standing in the aisle now dusting off his trousers mumbling sorry sorry must have tripped col croston up on the platform next to max goff didnt see it either at first goffs back was turned to him ah col croston was saying here we are lights we can continue splendid well i think if there are no more questions well sorry max goffs hand on his arm you want to say something sure fine go ahead fay was not aware that goff had actually asked the colonel anything but now the bulky man was coming slowly quite lazily to his feel and opening his mouth as if to say something monumentally significant but there was no sign of the large even white teeth which normally shone out when the smooth mat of red beard divided a black hole in the beard goff trying to shape a word but managing only aw and then out it all came hes being sick said the sensible part of fays mind hes been eating tomato chutney and thick rich strawberry jam full of whole ripe strawberries awk a gob of it landed thopp on the blotter in front of max goff in the front row hilary ivory exploded into hysterics and struggled to get out of her seat something crimson and warm having landed in her soft white hair fay saw that max goff had two mouths and one was in his neck he threw back his head with an eruption of spouting blood raised both whitesuited arms far above his head like a last proud act of worship and then overturning the table he plunged massively into the well of screams chapter viii his own light was in his eyes you know mr powys humble said mr trow was dead right about you the handlamp was tucked into the cleft between two tree roots humble was sitting in the grass a few feet away from the lamp he couldnt see humble very well but he could see what humble was holding it was a crossbow very modern plenty of black metal it had a heavylooking rifletype butt which was obviously what humble had hit him with back of the neck maybe between the shoulder blades either way he didnt want to move what he said was humble explained his actual words joe powys is very obedient he always does what hes told someone tells him to go to the tump he goes to the tump powys senses were numbed well thats how i prefer it humble said making people do fings is very time consuming i much prefer obedience wheres andy powys was surprised to discover he could still talk well he aint here is he somebody indicate he might be humble lifted his crossbow to his shoulder squinted at powys he was about ten feet away the was a steel bolt in the crossbow powys cringed pheeeeeeew humble said straight frew your left eyeball mr powys powys didnt move you live in fear of the unknown and the unseen and when youre facing death death turns out to be a yobbo with a mousetrap mouth and a lethal weapon favoured by the lower type of countrysport enthusiast but it wont come to that humble said seeing as obedience is one of your virtues i wont say thats not a pity i never done a human being with one of these but if i got to postpone the experience i got to postpone it on your feet please mr p i dont think i can i think you broke my collarbone oh thats where you keep your collarbone these days is it dont fuck with me please get up and powys did accepting without question that this guy would kill him if he didnt humble stood up too he was wearing a black gilet his arms bare humble was a timeless figure the hunter he killed now were going to go down off the tump mr powys on account you cant always trust your reactions up here as you surely know were going to go down back over that wall ok wheres andy powys said im empowered to answer just one of your questions and that wasnt it im sorry powys tripped over a root and grabbed at a bush aaah thorns keep going please dont turn round powys froze hes going to kill me hes going to shoot me from behind something slammed into his back and be cried out and lost his footing and crashed through the thorn bush and rolled over and over did tell you to keep going as he lay in a tangle at the foot of the mound humble dipped down beside him just inside the wall ill tell you the answer shall i then you can work out the question at your leisure the answer is you ready the answer is his mother now get on your feet over the wall and across to the old house the night has gathered around warren and hes loving it earned himself a piece of it now a piece of night to carry round with him and nibble on whenever hes hungry and hes still hungry his appetite growing all the time hes off out of the back door of the town hall and across the square into the alley by the cock the stanley knife hot his right hand only its not his hand any more this is the hand of glory the ole box is just a box now and whats in the box is just bones his is the hand and his will be the glory felt like doing a few more while he was in there that colonel croston of the sas thatd have been a laugh incredible the way he just walked in the back way and the lights had gone dead on cue like wherever he goes he brings the night in with him he has this brilliant night vision now just like daylight better than daylight cause he can see and no bugger else can standing behind this fat phoney big man on a squidgy little chair glaring white suit youd have to be blind not to see him and all the time in the world to choose where to put it in didnt need to choose the hand of glory knew brilliant thought hed be squealing like a pig but he never made more than a gurgle brilliant theres someone behind tessa in the alley tall guy whos this tessa laughing my teacher hows it going warren the teacher saying how are you feeling warren grinning savouring the night in his mouth and his eyes are like lights headlights yeah good lad says the teacher minnie seagrove was not too happy with the bourbon creams it was long after nine when she placed a small china plate of the long brown biscuits on one of the occasional tables and set it down by the side of franks chair at just the right height putting the camping light on the table next to the plate still dubiously pursing up her lips i do hope theyre all right frank theyre nearly a month over the sellby date i remember i bought them the day they took you into the general theyd just opened that new safeways near the station and i thought id go down there from the hospital cause its not far to walk take me mind off it sort of thing tears came into mrs seagroves eyes at the memory i bought a whole rainbow trout too i thought hes never managed to catch one least i can do is serve him one up for his first dinner when he comes out she turned away and grabbed a scottie from the box to dab her eyes they were kleenex really but mrs seagrove called all tissues scotties because it sounded more homely had to throw it in the bin that trout well past its sellby still you did come back from the general after all didnt you frank looking at him through the tears mrs seagrove had to keep blinking and on every other blink frank seemed to disappear she applied the scottie to her eyes again and sat down opposite him he didnt look well she had to admit eat your bourbons frank she said therell be nothing left of you if you go on like this i know ill put the wireless on you can listen to the local news mrs seagrove kept the wireless on the sideboard to tell the truth it wasnt her kind of wireless at all justin had bought it for them last christmas but one it was a long black thing with dozens of switches and you could see all these speakers through the plastic grilles big ones and little ones all jumbled up why they couldnt make them with just one speaker and cover it up neatly like they used to shed never know being that changing stations was so complicated she had it permanently tuned to offas dyke radio shed have preferred radio two herself that young chris stuart had ever such a comforting voice but frank said if you were living in a place you ought to keep up with what was happening around you even if it wasnt very interesting mrs seagrove certainly found most of it quite boring too much about councils and sheep prices so she put it on quite low tonight frank had good ears belter than hers and she only turned it up when she heard that max goff mentioned at a packed public meeting to discuss his plans for the socalled new age mystical healing centre in the border town of crybbe from where gavin ashpole now reports gavin who what had happened to fay morrison she might have been a bit awkward about the thing but she did seem quite a nice girl when you actually met her townsfolk listened in hostile silence as max goff explained his plans to turn crybbe into a kind of new age lourdes bringing in thousands of tourists from all over the world and providing a massive boost for the local economy however he said it would be up to the town whether it oh oh you bitch oh you oh please mrs seagrove recoiled from the wireless as if a wasp had flown out of one of the speakers frank did you hear that oh oh please yes yes do it chew it off there was a long silence and then the voice of the news reader came back im sorry i im not sure what happened there well try and return to that report er other news now frank said minnie seagrove did you hear that frank thats your precious offas dyke radio for you chris stuart never goes to pieces like that did you hear frank franks chair was empty all the bourbon biscuits were still on the plate six of them arranged in a little semicircle frank frank where are you breathing faster mrs seagrove turned and switched off the wireless and turned back to the chair and rubbed her eyes with the screwedup tissue but frank was gone and the door was closed she started to feel very confused get a grip minnie get a grip nothing was right nothing was right mrs seagrove went to the window and flung back the curtains its you isnt it its you great ugly slagheap thing shed probably be able to see the church if it wasnt for that always liked to see a church in the distance even if she didnt go she could see the mound quite clearly tonight even though there was no moon it was a bit like the mound was lit up from inside not very lit up sort of a yellowish glow like a lemon jelly she thought she could see a shadow moving across the field is that you frank she banged on the window youre not going out in that wet grass this time of night he was stupid sometimes frank like a little boy hed walk down to that river and just stare at it wondering why he never caught that many fish she pulled her walking shoes from under the sideboard you come back here frank seagrove its not safe out there chapter ix fay was still seeing it like a bad home video fuzzy illlit full of camerashake and overreaction women screaming people staring at each other in shock trying to speak faces hard and grainy in the blue deepfreeze light stricken max goff convulsing on the floor col croston bending over him get a doctor portly man from off shouldering his way to the front fay recognized him as the local gp wynford wiley probably the last to react moving like a sleepwalker fay following in his considerable wake up the central aisle pushing past guy hilary ivory stumbling towards them face in a permanent contortion like that painting of munch s the scream etched in similar stark nervy colours because of the stammering lights hilarys hands squeezing her hair and then the hands coming out like crimson rubbergloves and hilarys shrieks almost shredding cols crisp command nobody move nobody leaves the hall and then turning to the doctor bloody obvious had his throat slashed at which point spangled brightness burst out of the wroughtiron chandeliers an electrical blip and fay saw the mayor councillor james oswald preece standing on the edge of the raised area holding his arms as though with his frail frame he could conceal the carnage silence even wynford wiley stopped so suddenly that fay almost bumped into his big blue back the big lights stuttered again leaving the mayor with a momentary jagged aura of yellow and black listen to me is he dying a woman demanded from the new age quarter one of the men in suits said look im his legal advisor and this is is max dead i insist you call an ambulance is he will you be quiet madam a new and significant jimmy preece fay saw no longer the husk of a farmer flatcapped monosyllabic owre you owre you authority there now resonance now jimmy preece said im not going to elaborate on this isnt the time so dont none of you ask me im speaking to you as your first citizen but im also speaking as a preece and most of youll know what im saying yere the mayors eyes flickered to one side for all the newcomers id ask you to accept my word that that we are in well he stopped his jaw quivered in serious mortal danger he let this sink in fay looked around to see how they were taking it some of the crybbe people looked at each other with anxiety and varying amounts of understanding serious mortal danger jimmy preece intoned again almost to himself looking down at his boots the lawyer said oh for heavens sake man and its more than us whats in danger and its more than our children and and their children the doctor stood up flecks of blood on his glasses no somebody shouted oh god no and the new age quarter erupted jimmy preece held up a hand i his voice slumped im sorry hes dead through the oesophagus id imagine the doctor told col croston quietly but not quietly enough i mean it the mayor said i wished im no harm i only wished im gone from yere fay glanced at guy his face sagged his blond hair disarranged revealed a hitherto secret bald patch catrin jones was several yards away looking past him to where larry ember was walking up the aisle camera on his shoulder who let you in jimmy preece said wearily switch that thing off sir or itll be taken from you guy turned tapped larrys arm and shook his head to the side of guy the newsomes mutely held hands im going now jimmy preece said to see to the bell i urge you all and this is vital to stay absolutely calm come with you jim somebody said no you wont youll stay yere youll all stay yere ah look col croston said mr mayor theres been a murder here its not a normal situation no colonel its not normal and thats why nobody goes from yere till i sees to the bell i dont say this lightly nobody is to leave see nobody whos to say col came close to the mayor whoever did this isnt still in the room no e isnt yere colin you can wynford wiley pleaded let me radio for assistance jim least let me do that leave it wynford youre a local man near enough this is not a police matter but its a murder col croston protested its a crybbe matter sir jim wynford whined its more than my your job a blue vein throbbed in the mayors forehead your piffling little job youll take out your radio wynford wiley and youll put im on that table wynford stood for a moment his small features seeming to chase each other around his edam cheese of a face i cant he hung his head turned away and trudged back towards the main door but when he reached it he found his way barred by four large quiet men of an unmistakably agricultural demeanour dont be a bigger fool than you look wynford said the mayor walking slowly down the aisle just give me that radio wynford sighed took out the pocket radio in the black rubber case with the short rubber aerial and placed it in jimmy preeces bony outstretched hand its for the best wynford now the mayor turned and looked around him wheres mrs morrison oh christ im here mr preece his deeply scored lips shambled into something that might have become a smile youre not very big mrs morrison but you been stirring up a lot o trouble isnt it whats that supposed to mean one of the men opened a door for him another handed him a lamp a farmers lambing light means i dont want you left in yere said jimmy preece christ alone knows what ole rubbish youd be spoutin he pushed her out of the door in front of him outside it was fully dark it was only oh my god my god oh its only a dead body mr preece said it cant hurt you any more than that goff can hurt anyone now its horrible fay said its perverse you knew it was here didnt you like like this she was shaking she couldnt help it no said the mayor i didnt think it was gonner be like this but it dont surprise me but mr preece its your own grandson how can you bear it i can bear it cause i got no choice said mr preece simply he turned the light away from the coffin and pulled her back but she could still see the image of jonathon showcased like a grotesque christmas doll glad the power was off only wished somebody would disconnect the atmosphere was she imagining this or was it jonathon she could smell sweet corruption bacteria stimulated by exposure to the dense churchy air would you mind if i waited outside youll stay yere its im sorry mr preece its the smell aye we should lay him flat and put the lid back on dont ask me to help please dont ask me to help gonner give me a hand then no but he was taking her arm we ave time ten minutes yet see guiding her into the body of the church she held fingers over her nose mr preece what she took her hand away from her face why me whyd you really bring me along the question resounded from invisible walls and rafters just hold that giving her the lambing light fay stayed where she was well back and shone the light on the coffin looking away closer girl shine it closer she felt him watching her she moved a little closer the smell was appalling she imagined bloated white maggots at work inside jonathon preece although she knew that was ludicrous wasnt it fay pushed knuckles into her mouth to stifle the rising panic mr preece was on his knees beneath the coffin its top propped against the pulpit never get im back on that trolley lay im flat on the ground all we can do he pushed at the coffin until it was almost upright and the body began sag and belly out like a drunk in a shop doorway jesus mr preece hes slipping hes going to fall out hes going to fall on me push him back in girl put the light down i cant do it woman she did she touched him she pushed his chest felt the ruched line of the postmortem scar he was cold but far from stiff now and she remembered him on the riverbank soaked and leaking tongue out and the froth and his skin all crimped she closed her eyes and pretended the stink was coming from elsewhere until the coffin with its sickening cargo was flat on the stones and jimmy preece was fitting the lid on then she was bending over a pew retching nothing coming up but bile like sour liquid terror dead poor boy jimmy preece said she stood up wiped her mouth on her sleeve the smell was still in the air sweetly putrid would she ever get away from that smell heard herself saying who was it mr preece who did this who made a sideshow out of him dead he said cant hurt you now can e he came close wont hurt that dog neither will e oh no something had been whispering to her that it was going to be this but shed kept pushing it back thats why you brought me isnt it thats why you made me touch him he stood there recovering from the exertion his breathing like coins rattling in a biscuit tin max goff stabbed to death something unspeakably vile seeping into crybbe but it was the death by drowning of one jonathon preece young farmer of this parish family thing he said voice as dry as wood ash something i ave to know before i die jack sent jonathon out to make away with that animal of yours and why she said but he didnt answer that and he never came back ok ill tell you fay said in a rush ill tell you what happened ok his words of a moment long ago lurched back at her before i die have to know before i die she didnt even want to think what he meant by this so she told him everything everything except for the feelings joe powys had said hed experienced on the riverbank with the gun in his hands and the urge to kill mr preece went on breathing like a dying man when shed finished he said theres more to it than that no there isnt i swear jonathon was a strong boy and a good swimmer e also unlike that brother of is e had a bit o common sense im sorry fay said i cant tell you what happened when hed gone perhaps i mean with hindsight we should have stayed with hindsight we should never have thrown the gun in the river in the first place im sorry i really am desperately sorry mr preece she was aware of her voice becoming very small and a bit pathetic he was moving away towards the entrance pulling out a pocket watch the size of a travel alarmclock it had big luminous hands right he said you can wait in the porch by yere but you dont go out you dont open that door until the bells finished you understand i want to come up with you we goes up alone he snapped now you remember what i said you keep that door shut understand yes look mr preece make it quick miss make it very quick she was remembering how controlled hed been in the hall how sure that the killer had left the building you know who did this to jonathon dont you you know who killed max goff when the lights were out he turned his back on her and mounted the first step dont you he didnt look back and a turn in the spiral staircase took the light away is that a crybbe matter as well she yelled or is it god she thought as the darkness in the church became for a while absolute i can still smell it still smell jonathon and she put her hands over her face is it a family matter was what shed almost said because it ought to be warren he was bringing up here tonight it ought to be warren she heard the mayor stumble on the steps are you all right mr preece she heard another footstep and his ratchet breathing starting up again like a very old lawnmower quietly she began to ascend the steps until she could see his wavering torch beam reflecting from the curved stonework and then the beam was no longer visible and she climbed two or three steps until the stairway curved round and she could see the weakening glimmer once more the footsteps above her stopped there was a long silence and then get back you he began to cough and she could hear the fluid gathering in his lungs and throat like thick oil slurping in the bottom a rusty old can all right im sorry im going back all right clattering back to the foot of the stairway thinking anything happens to him now am i going to have the guts to go up there drag him out of the way or climb over him and pull on the rope a hundred times have i the strength to pull a bellrope a hundred times theres a kind of recoil isnt there like a gun and the rope shoots back up and sometimes pulls large men off their feet god almighty will i have the strength to pull it once leave him he knows what hes doing he wont stumble and break his ankle he wont have a stroke he wont have a heart attack hes a preece like jack mangled by his own tractor under intensive care in hereford like jonathon putrefying in his coffin just a few yards away but was there at the heart of the preece family something even more putrid she stood at the bottom of the steps waiting for the blessed first peal which only a few nights ago walking arnold in the old streets of this crippled town shed dreaded presently she saw the light hazing the stones again and heard his footsteps dont understand hes coming down she heard his rattling breath then there was a clatter and the light was all over the place as she heard the lamp rolling down from step to step it went out as she caught it mr preece are you he stood before her breathing roughly breathing as though he didnt care if each breath was his last fay flicked frantically at the switch and beat the lamp against the palm of her left hand until it hurt it relit and she shone it at him and reeled back almost dropping the thing in her shock and the beam splashed across the nave she held the lambing light with both hands to stop it shaking and shone it at the wall to the side of mr preece so it wouldnt find him and terrify her with the obscenity of it it was wrapped around him like a thick snake what is it fay whispered and as the whisper dried in her throat she knew perhaps it was winding itself around his neck choking out of him what little life remained mr preece let it fall to the stone floor he said hoarsely its the bellrope girl somebody cut the bellrope and even jonathon with his putrid perfume and his postmortem scar hadnt scared her half so much as the s face of his grandfather an electric puzzle of pulsing vessels veins and furrows chapter x grace peters ii beloved wife of canon a l peters white letters cold black marble pressing his forehead against it he thought a l peters thats me isnt it but it isnt my grave not yet anyway only one of us is dead grace what am i doing here he remembered now walking in a dignified fashion through the darkened streets arm in a crook parallel to his chest in his best suit of course with his dogcollar she would not be seen out with him if he were attired in anything less certainly not a faded tshirt with the flaking remains of kate bush across his chest peered down at it too dark to read the words not white and gleaming like the letters on the grave but he remembered the name kate bush who the hell was kate bush anyway ought to know that or maybe not he could hear somebody a woman saying theres a chance youll lapse quite soon into the old confusion and youll have that to contend with too im sorry sorry well arent we all hmmph cold black marble cool hands what was all that about alex shook his head well here i am sitting on graces grave at the lessfashionable end of crybbe churchyard at god knows what time of night havent the faintest idea how the bloody hell i got here not exactly a cold night but this is no place to spend it wonder if i simply got pissed and a bit maudlin the way i do stagger along to pay your respects to the little woman sorry if i dislodged some of these dinky chippings that your will was so insistent we should use to make this end of the churchyard look like a bloody crazygolf course no wonder murray had you shoved out here probably hoping the wood would overgrow the thing and the sooner the better stupid cow no taste at all god knows how i ever got entangled with you guilty me bloody hell you ensnared me you conniving creature alex clambered to his feet chuckled dont take any notice of me old girl im rambling again must have been on the sauce i could certainly do with a pee he stumbled into the wood and relieved himself with much enjoyment there were times he thought when a good pee could be more satisfying than sex consideration for the finer feelings of his late wife who lets get this in proportion once and for all did not deserve it had taken him deeper into the wood than hed intended and it took him a while to find his way back to the blasted churchyard emerging in fact several yards away from graces grave catching a foot on something stumbling feeling himself going into a nosedive damn alex threw out both hands to break his fall bad news at his age a fall brittle bones etc and worst of all a geriatric ward something unexpectedly soft broke his fall one hand felt cloth a jacket perhaps oh gosh terribly sorry thinking at first he must have tripped over some old tramp trying to get an early night this was before he felt all the wet patches oh dear oh hell it was all very sticky indeed and his hands felt as if they were covered in it already tweedy sort of jacket shirt and blood no question of what the sticky stuff was hello are you all right bloody fool of course the chap wasnt all right wished he had a flashlight couldnt see a damn thing tentatively he put out a hand and found a face it was very wet horribly sticky and unpleasantly cold poor beggar must be slashed to ribbons he lowered his head listening for breathing none at all there wasnt a clergyman in the world who didnt recognise the presence of death oh hell alexs sticky fingers moved shakily down over the blood caked lips over the chin down to the neck where he felt oh god oh jesus ive ive stumbled over my own body i was wrong i am dead i think ive been murdered grace you stupid bitch why didnt you tell me is this how it is is this what happens oh lord somebody get me away from here beam me up god for christs sake for the body wore a stiff clerical collar crybbe court in view again uh humble had prodded him in the small of the back presumably with the butt of the crossbow they were on the edge of the tump field facing the courtyard as powys looked up at the black house its ancient frame seemed to tense against the pressure of the night there was a small sparkling under the eaves like the friction of flints and the air was faintly tainted with sulphur powys felt his anger rekindle in the moment of the sparks hed seen the hole in the eaves that was the prospect chamber below it slivers of light had figured the edge of a piece of furniture halfway up the pile of rubbish which had broken rachel wades fall and her neck were going in humble said picking up the lamp from the grass you might be going in said powys its too spooky for me quite honestly humble laughed you must think im fucking stupid powys said you want me to go up to the prospect chamber and kind of lose my balance right it would he knew make perfect sense to the police since you ask humble said that would be quite tidy yeah and it would save me a bit of trouble but if you say no i get to use this thing on you whichll be a giggle anyway so you can please yourself mate i aint fussy how would you get rid of the body not a problem really trust me none of this scares you none of what like we just saw a light flaring under the roof it wasnt what youd call natural did we i didnt humble stood with his back to the broken wall around the tump a hard skinny sinewy ageless man powys could run away and humble would run faster he could go for humble maybe try and kick him in the balls and humble would damage him quickly and efficiently before his shoe could connect he could sit down and refuse to move and humble would put a crossbow bolt into his brain powys said you dont feel a tension in the air a gathering in the atmosphere i thought you were supposed to be a countryman humble snorted leaning on the butt of his crossbow there are countrymen he said and there are hippies im fit ive got good hearing and ace eyesight im not a bad shot i can snare rabbits and skin em and i can work at night and aint scared ghosts evil spirits magic stones its all shit if the people who employ me wanna believe in it thats fine no skin off my nose blessed are the sceptics powys thought rachel was a sceptic and i get paid very well see i can go in that house any time of the day or night i dont give a shit i can piss up the side of a standing stone in the full moon so what countrymen arent hippies mr powys he was telling powys indirectly who it was whod locked the door when rachel was in the court and maybe who had pushed her out he got paid very well andy pays you powys realised humble said im in the employ of the epidemic group a security consultant and andys been paying you as well humble lifted his crossbow lets go wheres andy i said lets move no fair enough humble said fair enough he moved backwards a few paces into the field until he was almost invisible against the night ok you made your decision i got to get this over wiv in a couple of minutes so you got a choice you can run or you can turn around and walk away just keep walking fast or slow as you like and youll never know some people like to run oh jesus powys thought for the past twelve years he hadnt really cared too much about life and how long it would last i thought youd never shot anybody not wiv a crossbow on the two other occasions said humble i used a gun fay he thought obliquely caught an image of the elf with the rainbow eye im going to lose fay or of course said humble reasonably you can just stand there and watch he brought up the crossbow powys instinctively ducked and went down on his knees his arms around his head through his arms he heard a familiar lopsided semiscampering no he screamed no arnold get back get away he saw the black and white dog limping towards him from the darkness and out of the corner of his eye watched the crossbow swivel a couple of inches to the right beautiful humble said and fired she ran at the door and snatched at the bolts throwing one of them back before mr preece grabbed her from behind and pulled her away she struggled frantically and vainly he might look like a stretcher case but his arms were like bands of iron she felt her feet leave the floor and he hauled her back from the porch and set her down under the stone font the lambing light was in her eyes but it didnt blind her because it was losing strength going dimmer what the fuck are you doing mr preece what bloody use is this place as protection all she could hear from behind the dying light was his dreadful breathing something out of intensive care at the chest clinic theres no spirituality here any more all there was was the bell and now you cant reach that theres no way you can resist him in this place a church is only a church because the stones are steeped in centuries of worship human hopes and dreams all that stuff all youve got here is a bloody warehouse stay quiet jimmy preece hissed keep calm keep oh sure keep your head down its what this pisspoor place is all about dont make waves dont take sides we dont want no clever people oh she beat her head into her arms and sobbed with anger and frustration needing the rage and the bitterness because if you could keep them stoked keep the heat high it would burn out the fear she looked into the light not white any more but yellow her leastfavourite colour the yellow of disease of embalming fluid the yellow of grace legge how would he come would he come like grace flailing and writhing with whiteeyed malevolence how would he come whats going to happen mr preece she said it was the small voice and she was ashamed i dont know girl there was a wheezing under it that she hadnt heard before god help me i dont know she thought about her dad at least hed be safe he was with jean and jean was smart jean knew about these things she cant talk to you she cant see you theres no brain activity there entirely harmless no she doesnt she isnt smart at all a little knowledge and a little intuition nothing more dangerous jean only thinks shes smart and now powys had gone to jean saying help us wise one get us out of this save crybbe save us all oh powys whatever happened to the old golden land it began with a rustling up at the front of the church near the coffin and then the sound of something rolling on stone whats that but mr preece just breathed at her she clutched at the side of the font all the hot healthy anger and the frustration and bitterness drenched in cold stagnant fear she couldnt move she imagined jonathon preece stirring in his coffin cracking his knuckles as his hands opened out washerwomans hands fay felt a pain in her chest oh god the nearest she could produce to a prayer not too wonderful for a clergymans daughter and then came the smell of burning and little flames a row of little yellow smoky flames burning in the air four or five feet from the floor fay watched transfixed still sitting under the font as though both her legs were broken heeeeeeee she heard highpitched a yellow noise flecked with insanity jimmy preece moved he picked up the light and walked into the nave and shone what remained of the light up the aisle aye he said and his breathing was so loud and his voice so hoarse that they were inseparable now down the aisle into the lambing light a feeble beam a figure walked fay saw cadaverous arms hanging from sawnoff sleeves eyes that were as yellowwhite as the eyes of a ghost but still just human eyes the arms hanging loosely something in one hand something stubby bluewhite metal still gleaming through the redbrown stains behind him the yellow flames rose higher a foot kicked idly at something on the stone floor and it rolled towards fay it was a small tin tube with a red nozzle lighter fuel warren had opened up the bible on its lectern and set light to the pages owre you grandad warren said chapter xi there were too many people in here dont touch him please col said there was quite a wide semicircle around goffs body into which nobody apart from this girl had been inclined to intrude thered be sufficient explanations to make after tonight as it was and col was determined nobody was going to disturb or cover up the evidence however unpleasant it became whatever obnoxious substances it happened to discharge the girl peered down trying to see goffs face i paint she explained casually i like to remember these things oh its tessa isnt it tessa byford col watched her with a kind of appalled admiration so cool so controlled how young women had changed he couldnt remember seeing her earlier but then there were a few hundred people here tonight and right now he rather wished there hadnt been such a commendable turnout he was angry with himself that he should allow someone to creep in under cover of darkness and slash the throat of the guest of honour obviously ok the last thing one would expect in a place like crybbe and yet rural areas were no longer immune from sudden explosions of savage violence think of the hungerford massacre he should knowing of underlying trepidation about goffs plans have been ready to react to the kind of situation for which hed been training half his life he remembered not too happily telling guy morrison how the crybbe audience would ask goff a couple of polite questions before drifting quietly away and then just as quietly theyll shaft the blighter shafted him all right whoever it was had come and gone through the small back door the one the town councillors used it had been unlocked throughout that had been a mistake too couldnt get away from it hed been bloody lax and now he was blindly following the orders of a possibly crazy old man whod decreed that nobody was permitted to depart which if the police were on their way would have been perfectly sensible but under the circumstances he didnt even know the circumstances all he knew was that jimmy preece had the blind support of an appreciable number of large uncompromising tough looking men and if anybody made an attempt to leave the situation was likely to turn ugly not looking at max goff sprawled in his own blood that it was particularly attractive as things stood every so often people would wander over to col some angry others quite sheepish it doesnt make a lot of sense now does it colonel graham jarrett argued sweatpatches appearing under the arms of his safari suit a mans been murdered and all were doing is giving his murderer time to get clean away not if hes in this room we arent said col very quickly jarretts eyes widened thats not likely is it who knows mr jarrett who knows graham jarrett looked around nervously as if wondering which of the two or three hundred people it might be safest to stand close to the main exit was still guarded by large uncommunicative farmers cant be long now anyway col said id guess the mayors already been in touch with the police no chance this is a crybbe matter madness it didnt even have the logic of a street riot and col croston whod served six terms in belfast was beginning to detect signs of something worryingly akin to sectarianism new age versus old crybbe the crybbe people scarcely moved if they went to the toilets they went silently and returned to their seats they did not converse among themselves they seemed to know what this was about or at least they appeared satisfied that jimmy preece knew what it was about and there seemed to be this unspoken understanding that they should remain calm restrain their emotions bloody eerie just as they behaved in church admirable selfcontrol or mindless apathy beggared belief either way and col croston knew he couldnt allow the situation to continue much longer he was under pressure from the new age delegates who while in a minority of about twenty to one were making virtually all the noise so much for relaxation techniques and meditative calm struck him there was a lot they might learn from the indigenous population a man in a suit one of the epidemic lawyers said look let us out of here now and well say no more about it but if this goes on im warning you youre all going to be in very serious trouble impeding the course of justicell be the very least of it ive found col told him very clipped that in a situation like this telling people what serious trouble theyre going to be in is the fastest way to inflame what could be a highly combustible situation i estimate there are more than three hundred adults in this room and the fact that one of them happens to be dead could just turn out to be the very least of our worries now please sit down aware of a sudden commotion by the main doors he yelled into the new age quarter will somebody please restrain that lady the feminist astrologer was threatening to damage the genitals of one of the farmers if he didnt get out of her way it was catrin jones physically stronger than the astrologer and also a woman who was finally able to lead her back to her seat theyre not real these people the astrologer shook her spiky head theyre bloody zombies everythings freaky the cock being empty and denzil looking at a bit of a loose end gomer parry thought it was only reasonable to have two pints aware this could conceivably put him over the limit but what kind of copper stopped a digger driver trundling along a country lane at mph it was after ten when he drove out of the square in the yellow tractor with the big shovel raised up out of the way the roads were about as quiet as you could get fact everywhere was a bit on the quiet side this goff was obviously a big attraction not a soul on the streets and with all the lights out crybbe looked like one of them filmsets when everybodyd gone home pulling out on to the ludlow road something else struck gomer he hadnt heard the bell they never didnt ring that bell used to be said that old jimmy preece well young jimmy preece as hed have been then had even rung the curfew the day he got married a hundred bongs on his wedding night mrs preece wouldnt be that lucky poor old devil back on the nightshift now then talk about bad luck you wouldnt credit it even if jack pulled through with both legs still attached didnt seem likely hed be in any state to make it up them old steps for a good long while have to be putting the arm on that young tearaway warren gomer was never sorry to leave crybbe miserable old place miserable buildings miserable folk but he was never that happy about going home neither not since his old lady had handed in her mop and bucket hed work every hour of daylight to put off that terrible moment when he had to get his own keys out instead of seeing the door opening as he tramped across the yard and hearing the old kettle whistling on the rayburn when midsummer was past and the working days started getting shorter gomers spirits started to droop and tonight had been a freak foretaste of autumn black clouds crowding in for a storm that never came and dark by nine now there was mist as well that came down bloody quick gomer snapped on the full beams only to discover his left headlight bulb had gone bollocks no copperd be able to resist pulling him in to point this out and then hed get a good whiff of gomers breath mind just blowing in this yere nozzle sir oh dear afraid ill have to ask you to accompany me to the station well gomer could already see the smile cracking up the fat features of that bastard wynford wiley and he couldnt stick that what hed have to do then was switch off the headlights and try and get through the mist on the itsybitsy sidelights which were buggerall use on these roads on the best of nights so he flicked off the heads and slowed down to about twenty and it was still like skindiving in a cesspit and he had to drop down to second gear bloody crybbe didnt know why he said that you couldnt blame everything on crybbe well you could gomer hit the brakes what the ells that bloody hell fire its the old tump whered he come from hang on a bit boy you done something a bit wrong yere isnt usual to see that thing straight up ahead looming out of the mist so sudden like that enough to scare the life out of you hello not on the road now are we we surely are not bloody teach you to go over the limit thought you could handle a couple of pints no problem but the thing is youre getting older boy your reactions isnt what they was see and now look what you done you gone clean off the road over the verge and youre on the bloody common now and if you keep on like this youll be knocking down that goffs wall for him after all and buggering up your digger like they did the bulldozer gomer was about to pull up sharp when the front end took a dip and he realized that if he didnt go with it he was likely to turn this thing over and he thought about jack preece talk about lightning striking twice well he didnt like this not one bit i cant stand it hilary ivory shrieked suddenly this room so black and negative its oppressing me ive got to have out and i cant stand to look at him any more well im sorry but im not going to cover him up col told her really darent risk disturbing anything isnt that right sergeant wynford wiley nodded vaguely his cheese face sliced clean of expression hed given up he should be directing this situation and look at him jacket off tie around his ear glazedeyed and sweating like a pig all i can suggest is you look the other way mrs ivory im sorry its your fault hilary turned furiously on her husband you knew it was coming you should have warned him what use is a seer who sees and doesnt tell me hitherto gloomily silent adam ivory was stunned into speech you didnt want me to say a word you bloody hypocritical cow halfway out of his seat gripping his knees you didnt want to throw a shadow over things you didnt want to lose your cosy little flat in your cosy little town in in just a minute col croston jumped down from the platform and strode over to where the couple were sitting amidst jarrett a bunch of healers the newsomes and larry ember standing up smoking a cigarette his camera held between his ankles whats this about what are you saying guy morrison said wearily adam reads tarot cards he saw disaster looming oh said col disappointed i see no you dont said guy dont knock it col this is a very weird setup guy morrison used to think he knew everything there was to know about the supernatural ie that the whole thing was a lame excuse for not milking real life for everything one could get guy made a steeple out of the fingers of both hands and pushed them together hard but for once he said guy morrison was wrong what dyou mean exactly col looked for somewhere to sit down there wasnt a spare chair so he squatted hands on thighs whats the score here as you see it guy i mean christ ive been around been in some pretty odd places among some pretty primitive people but well we dont notice things under our noses sometimes we think its what you might call what rural eccentricity i suppose no look guy had taken off his expensive olive leather jacket he didnt seem to notice it was lying on the floor now entangled in dusty shoes which is mrs byford ask her if she knows her granddaughters some kind of witch that girl the artist ask her about the expoliceman who cut his throat in her bathroom go on ask her oh hell col croston thought bit barmy he decided not to tell guy the girl was here displaying an anatomical interest in the corpse you think im crazy dont you ask her shut up jocasta newsome hissed just shut up guy just for once guy whirled on her eyes alight you know im not crazy you of all people you showed me the drawings you sent me to talk to the bloody girl you uuurh hereward newsomes thin sensitive artistic hands were around his throat you smooth selfopinionated bastard col croston leapt up as guys chair crashed over into the aisle the chairs and guys legs both in the air hereward teeth clenched trying to smash guys head into the boarded floor no wonder she wanted you to open the fucking exhibition col croston gripping herewards shoulder wrenching him off as catrin jones guy fell down heavily beside her producer are you all right lifting his head into her lap guy staring up appalled at the madman with the thinning hair and the greying goatee beard held back by his collar like a snarling dog hands clawing at the air hes only been screwing my wife the madman spat and catrin froze maybe he was not so mad after all allowing guys head to fall to the floor with an audible thump larry ember was cradling his camera ostensibly to save it from being kicked the lens pointed casually at the scene before him one for the christmas tape he murmured to tom the soundman got to keep the old spirits up aintcha on the same tape were the pictures hed surreptitiously shot of max goffs body while carrying the camera under his arm at waist level youll put that thing away sharpfeatured mrs byford the council clerk was on her feet back arched wasnt aware it was out darlin larry inspecting his trousers colonel come on old boy please leave the thing under the table hmm i dont think so squire larry raising the camera to his shoulder aiming it at col adjusting the focus guy would you mind exerting your but guy still sprawled halfstunned in the aisle was staring over the colonels shoulder eyes widening she shes there jocasta tell them the girl stood on the edge of the platform she wore black jeans and a black top even her lipstick was black her skin in the blue fluorescence was like a grim cloudy day a small greyfaced man perhaps the husband snatched ineffectually at mrs byfords arm as she stepped out screeching tessa what you doing in yere get out no i nobody gets out tessa said sweetly guy was up staggering one hand massaging the back of his head the other groping for the cameramans arm the girl shoot her i want the girl as larry advanced slowly towards the girl camera on his shoulder eye hard to the projecting viewfinder mrs byford launched herself at him from behind pummelling his back clawing at his neck nettie the greyfaced man shouted no dont cause no col pulled her off with one hand getting his face scratched mrs byford guy cant you stop this stupid bastard before so guy was panting this is mrs byford is it perhaps she can tell us all about handel roberts who topped himself in her bathroom and yet was in this room tonight now listen mr clever tv man guy turned slowly and painfully and looked into tiny round eyes and a small fleshy mouth set into a face too big for them handel roberts is dead said wynford wiley exactly said guy cols feelings about newcomers who tried to take over assuming a more elevated intellect and an understanding of the rural psyche were warning him to take it easy but there was an iceball forming in the pit of his stomach stop it jocasta newsome rising like a fury stop it stop it stop it what are you all trying to do aye a mans voice said cant you none of you control yourselves at least were not brain dead the feminist astrologer with the ring through her nose look at you all youre fucking pathetic somebody tells you to sit there and dont move again until they tell you you can stand up and leave a mans been brutally murdered you dont even react what kind of fucking morons a girl in her twenties built like catrin jones only more muscular stamped across the room youll shut your mouth lady or im gonner shut it for you oh yeah well all shut our mouths and turn a blind eye and ask no questions and where has that got you all these years max goff was the only promising thing that ever happened to this shithole and what do you do you kill him like like the bloody savages did to the missionaries except they werent savages really at least they had this ethnic sit down the pair of you mrs byfords husband was quaking cant you see this is what it wants jimmy preece said be calm he knows its what it wants rowing and and conflict everybody all worked up like mr byford is absolutely right col said wondering what the hell mr byford was on about im going to go out and find the mayor call the police and get this no youre not colonel look and then there was a crash from the front of the hall larry ember hadnt exactly dropped his camera which col suspected no selfrespecting tv cameraman ever did even if hed been shot but hed certainly put it down quite heavily and he was stumbling back along the centre aisle moaning in some distress with both hands over his face col croston looked up at the platform there was no sign of tessa byford whats wrong man you ok guy grabbed larrys arm larry shook him off the way a child does in a kind of frenzy hed abandoned the camera in the middle of the floor unheard of in guys experience and was threshing towards the entrance sorry pal a tweeded arm in his way larry took his hands away from his face oh lord the man said and larrys knee went up into a corduroy crotch right the cameraman shouted im out of here hitting the doors with his shoulder and they burst open and the night came in and guy strove for the exit followed by the ivorys and the men in suits and catrin jones was dragged along too stop them somebody screamed shut them doors for just a moment larry ember turned around in the doorway hilary ivory screamed and guy nearly fell back into the room larrys right eye his viewfinder eye just get me away from that girl i think its a blood vessel guy said nervously im going in tight on her larry recalled voice unsteady and her eyes are actually fucking zooming back giving me daggers guy and then shes in the bleedn camera daggers guy know what i mean larrys eye looked like a squashed tomato maybe maybe several blood vessels guy said i dont know look you get some air ill get catrin to fetch your camera leave it larry screamed i dont wanna see the bleedn tape all right i wan it destroyed two of the farmers on the doors were struggling to close them again but now there was a wild crush of people fighting to get out larry and guy were pushed out into the square let them go col shouted or somebodys going to get hurt there was hysterical laughter from behind him theyll be hurt all right colonel shrilled mrs byford and col croston heard what seemed at first to be a very encouraging noise the curfew bell was ringing the familiar steady clangs its the mayor he called back into the room panic over he said itd be ok to leave when the curfew began everybody just sit down for a moment and well file out in an orderly fashion you fool somebody said quietly few among the crybbe people had even moved and he knew why quite soon as a second bell began a hollow discordant counterpoint and then a third came in and a fourth and then they were all going col stood and looked at the rows of stricken frightened faces whats going on never in this town had he seen such obvious reaction on so many faces he wanted to cover his eyes his ears it was like being violently awoken in the dead of night by the sudden shattering clamour of a roomful of alarmclocks only louder the loudest noise thered ever been in crybbe a blitz of bells hard and blindingly bright bells to break windows and loosen teeth and the foundations of ancient buildings bells to burst the sky and burn up the air for the first time in his life col croston the only qualified bellringer in the town was stilled by a most basic primitive terror like a cold thin wire winding around his spinal cord because there was no way it could be happening with one single exception all the bellropes had been taken down years and years ago tonight in some unholy celebration the bells of crybbe were ringing themselves chapter xii the first bell had begun at the moment warren preece cut his grandfather you mr preece had said deadvoiced as the bible burned no surprise there fay noticed no horror at the reptilian thing prancing whiteeyed in the firelight the thing for which fay had at first felt only revulsion becoming aware soon afterwards that revulsion was actually one of the lower forms of fear mr preece said i oped to eaven it wouldnt be but at the heart of me i always knew it was tipped up his brother in the coffin slashed the shroud not much left in warren preece fay concluded numbly that you could call human you dont even know it all yet grandad warren grinned meaningfully got a bit to learn yet see ow long you been in yere warren long time grandad warren put on a whining oldman voice oh e was a strong boy jonathon good swimmer shadows leapt with the flames from the blazing bible scorched scraps of pages flew into the air billowing black snowflakes smart boy jonathon warren said bit o sense not like that brother of is see oh warren the old man said sorrowfully you never once tried to warren smiled slyly e wasnt that good a swimmer though grandad the bible began to crackle not with somebody sittin on is head anyway fay wanted to reach out to mr preece and hold him back but she couldnt get her body to shift and god knew the poor old bloke was moving slowly enough fragmented motion like battered clockwork toy winding down mr preece dont do anything the old man was advertising his uncontainable anger as clearly as if it were written on sandwichboards and lunging for his grandson as awkwardly as he would if he were wearing them come on then grandad warren lounged against the carved wooden side of a back pew lets get this over owed you one for a couple o days since you knocked me down like shouldnt ave done that grandad bad move see mr preece lurched ineffectually forward as warrens right hand described a lazy arc and then he stopped unsure what had happened fays hand went to her mouth there was another fine line on the contour map of the mayors face five inches long neatly dividing the withered left cheek into two then warren was jumping back the silver skull bouncing from his ear the hand which held the knife leaping and twirling as though given life by the touch of fresh blood oh christ fay was barely aware of backing off her mind was distancing itself too not wanting to cope with this heeee you wouldnt expect fay thought remotely almost callously as the curfew bell began to toll that mr preece would bleed so normally in such quantity through skin like wornout driedup leather as she watched him bleed a question rolled into her head and lay there innocuously for a few seconds before starting to sizzle like a hot coal listen warren preece hissed in excitement who was ringing the curfew yeah warren leapt on to a pew looking up to the rafters both fists clenched one around the knife and shaking a droplet of jimmy preeces blood fell from the blade and landed on a prayer book and then the other bells began and fay clapped her hands to her ears although it was not so loud in here nothing to what it would be in the streets it just could not be happening the mayor of crybbe stood very still he did not raise a hand to his cheek and the blood poured down his face copious as bitter tears by his feet the lambing light expired but the fire from the bible was enough to show her the crazed warren dancing on a pew to the discordance of bells blood glistening on the knuckles of the fist that held the knife the smoke made her cough and warren seemed to notice for the first time that he and his grandfather were not alone he leapt seemed to float in the smoky air over the back the pew and put himself between fay and the porch bouncing on the balls of his feet grinning at her slackjawed vacant jimmy preece sagged against the font unmoving she couldnt even hear his breathing any more who whos ringing the bells that could not be her speaking nobody sounding like that could ever have passed bbc voicetest well cant be me warren said conversationally an it cant be grandad can it grandad mr preece fay thought bleakly might have died heart failure blood pressure a stroke respiratory congestion e sez no warren said sez its not im neither an ive been in yere ages an nobody come in with me see wonder what that means is that what crybbe does is this the kind of rebel produced by a sick old town from which all unfurtive abandoned pleasure has been bled maybe ole jonathon warren suggested maybe e come crawlin out of is coffin bleeeaagh he hunched his shoulders tossed the knife from the right hand to the left and then back again tell you what whynt you go up an ave a look lady go on when she didnt move he suddenly lurched at her the knife creating whingeing sounds as he made crisscross slashes in the yellow smoky air hey its you fay began to back away coughing in the opposite direction up the nave until she could feel the heat from the petrolsoaked bible on her back warren produced a highpitched trumpeting noise this is offas dyke radio he slashed the air again twice voice of the marches he said yeah thats right fay said cheerfully hysterical voice of the marches thats me warren stopped reflected a moment we done a good job on your ole tape recorder didnt we oh my god yes she said weakly very impressive his face went cold should have kept her mouth shut he opened the hand which held the stanley knife looked down at it the hand and the knifes long metal handle both splattered with crisscross layers of blood bright fresh blood on brown dried blood hand of glory warren said and the fingers clenched again as he advanced on her up the aisle she saw almost hypnotized that his eyes were altering shed never seen warren preece closeup before only oh my god his spidery shape scurrying across a field at sunset and she was sure that she wasnt seeing him now something in the eyes the eyes were no longer vacant someone in residence aaah the heat at her back was acutely painful she couldnt go any further fire behind her the knife coming at her she went rigid looked back towards the door saw jimmy preece had slipped to the floor by the font black michael she said as the savage heat at her back became too much to bear and she was sure her clothing was about to catch fire youre black michael warren preece obviously took this as a huge compliment he grinned lavishly and the bloodstained stanley knife trembled in his hand as he closed in say hello he said to the hand of glory and lunged fay threw herself sideways landing hard on the stone crawled coughing wretchedly to the top of the altar step where the firelight was reflected in jonathon preeces closed coffin a storm of shrivelled scraps of burning paper wafted from the bible she saw an orange core of fire eating through to the spine and the varnish bubbling on the wooden lectern as she rolled over drew back her foot and stabbed out once sharply the lectern shook it was made of carved oak caked in layer upon layer of badly applied varnish which dripped an blistered and popped it moved when she hit it with her foot but not enough and she fell on her back beside the coffin her face stinging from the heat and sparks as warren preece sprang up the steps and the short reddened blade of the stanley knife came down at her clasped in a fist gloved in smoke she curled up and the bells clanged like wild drunken laughter the bells he thought the bells of hell ringing to welcome old alex he stood in the graveyard looked up at the church tower and saw the windowslits outlined in light glowing a feeble yellow at first and then intensifying to pure white as the clangour grew louder until it seemed the walls would crumble and there would only be these bright bells hanging in the night welcome to hell no one more welcome in hell than a unfrocked priest except except a priest who ought to have been unfrocked and escaped the dishonour through devious means oh lord yes no one more welcome in hell the bells rang randomly as one might expect a mocking parody of the joyful sunday peal the bells of hell hurt his ears as they were meant to do and would continue to do he assumed forever and ever he brushed against the bible and it set light to the black vest he was wearing little flames swarmed up his chest he seemed absolutely delighted looking proudly down at himself dropping down a couple of steps grinning hugely as the petrolsoaked spine of the heavy old bible collapsed into redhot ash and the two halves toppled from the lectern fay rammed both feet into the wooden stem very slowly it began to fall towards him and warren didnt move he opened his arms wide as the lectern fell like a tree and he embraced it hugging the blistering stem to his chest yeah roaring and blazing fay didnt move watched in hypnotized awe until she felt and smelt something burning very very close and found a single charring page wrapped around her arm book of david she read the page curling sepia reminding her of the opening credits of some dreadful old american civil war movie and she found that her lungs were full of smoke chapter xiii his body jerked in the grass a convulsion the crashing bells he accepted as the death vibrations of a brain cleaved by a steel bolt mr powys oh christ he thought at once it wasnt me it was arnold he wants me to see what hes done to arnold before he puts one into me hed flung himself at the dog just as fay had done in the field by the river when jonathon preece had been strolling nonchalantly across with his gun but powys had missed and arnold had kept on running towards humble and his crossbow leaving powys sprawled helplessly arms spread waiting for the end the way you did mr powys he rolled very slowly on to his back pain prodding whatever was between his shoulderblades the place where humble had hit him with the butt of the crossbow it is you isnt it joe he focused on a face in the middle of a palecoloured head scarf he saw a woolly jumper below that some kind of kilt campbell tartan memory told him ridiculously mmmm couldnt get the name out its minnie seagrove she said clearly i want you to speak to me please say something im ever so confused tonight ive been seeing frank and now its bells bells everywhere powys came slowly to his feet he didnt know about seeing frank but they couldnt both be hallucinating bells mrs seagrove gazed anxiously up at him although she looked rather calmer than he felt behind her the tump swelled like a tumour that grew by night from out of the town can the wild pealing powys was disoriented he looked rapidly from side to side and then behind him wheres thats another thing im afraid minnie seagrove said i think ive killed the man with the what do you call it what thank god its your voice here she pushed something into his hand his lamp i cant switch it on its got a funny switch on it powys switched it on and the first thing it showed him on the ground was the crossbow and then an outstretched naked arm now just dont ask me how i got here mrs seagrove said because i dont know its been a very funny night all told but there you were on the ground and this man with the thingy crossbow pointing it down at you he had the lamp on taking aim like i thought oh god what can i do and i came up behind him when the bells started and it put him off sort of thing the bells starting up like that so sudden put him off just for a second and i still wasnt sure any of it was really happening do you understand i thought well if its a dream no harm done sort of thing so i hit him is he dead joe can you tell i shouldnt think so minnie powys kicked the crossbow out of the way and bent over humble with the lamp nervous of getting too close ready to smash the lamp down in humbles face if he moved he stood up finally er what exactly was it you hit him with hes dead isnt he joe come on now i dont want any flimflam well yes he is actually the back of humbles head was like soft turkish delight bring the light over here please joe it was like an iron bar only hollow like a pipe i threw it down somewhere here powys crouched down it was indeed a piece of pipe with jagged rust at one end and blood at the other he didnt touch it it seemed likely that humble for all his strength and his spectacular night vision was one of those people with a particularly thin skull it isnt a dream is it joe well not in the accepted sense no but really i mean dont worry about it he put his hands on her shoulders you did save my life he wasnt exactly what anybody would call a nice man in fact offhand i can only think of one person whos actually nastier no maybe two now he thought of something else and played the beam over the weapon again experienced a moment of pure liquid euphoria wanted to laugh aloud it looked like the tip of henry kettles exhaust pipe he kept quiet about it all the same dont tie this thing down too hard to reality shes keeping herself together because she isnt yet fully convinced its not part of the dream like frank look minnie you didnt see a dog did you he he might have been hit i dont know he ran off said mrs seagrove he was off like the clappers over that way she pointed at the gap where the stone wall had been broken down the one i mean is a black and white dog powys said gently escaped from my car left the window open too wide but he couldnt have been going like the clappers hes only got three legs now you remember he was shot yes it was the same dog fay morrisons dog joe what going on whats up with the bells god knows be nice to think it was a few of the townsfolk up in the tower ringing every bell theyve got as a sign theyve finally woken up to something after a few centuries he looked over his shoulder towards crybbe court remembered the sparking under the eaves like flints could see nothing now which didnt mean a thing joe mmm whats that there was a ray of light playing among the trees on the tump flickering erratically and then a dog began to bark stay here powys said with him not likely the dog was barking fiercely powys watched the light moving among the trees who is it joe i think its one of those other people i mentioned who are even nastier than humble mrs seagrove said youre frightened arent you joe alex had remembered who kate bush was now dark hair and sort of slinky seen her on the box once a few years ago at young fays flat made the usual comments if i was forty years younger etc and the next day fay had presented him with this tshirt as a bit of a joke and hed become quite attached to the garment made him feel youthful having kate bush next to the skin even tried to listen to the music going up that hill make a deal with god alex was going down the hill towards the river he stood on the bridge and stared down at the dark water rather funny really he mused aloud to the river thought i was dead can you believe that always been able to talk to rivers sometimes they even burbled back not this one this being a crybbe river must have gone out for a breath of air wound up in the sodding boneyard mooning over old graces plot went for a jimmy in the woods came back and couldve sworn i found my own body no honest to god i remember tripping over something about to fall flat on my face and it broke the fall it wore a dogcollar and there was blood got it on my hands fell awfully sticky jolly convincing really alex rubbed his hands together and they felt strangely stiff he held them out and couldnt see them at all youre an old humbug alex who was it said that not grace not fay not wendy how could he have forgotten wendy so soon only left her house when was it tonight or was it last night or was it last week she said something like go back out there and you might start losing your marbles again but youve got to do it alex got to go back why why had he got to go back because wendy knows best wendy has cool hands actually he thought suddenly for the first time theyre quite cold hands and they all think they know best dont they the doctors your relatives suddenly alex felt quite angry you start to lose your mind and everybody wants a bit even if you could get it back it wouldnt be worth having shopsoiled messed about he said a civil goodnight to the river and began to walk back up the hill towards the square deal with god why after sixty years looking after his best interests doesnt the bugger ever want to talk business with me the street had been quiet when he was walking down to the river now he could hear people moving about up over the brow of the hill around the square alex came to a house with a paraffin lamp burning in the window he stopped and held up his hands they were covered with dried blood oh lord alex said and it didnt start out as a prayer frightened well how could you not be but it was no bad thing most of the time the worst thing was a belief that you were in some way protected if you did what somebody else said was right like walking into the humble situation because jean wendle had told him he needed to go back to the source but he always did what he was told max goff theres a place for you here think about it andy boultontrow i think joe ought to present himself to the earth spirit in the timehonoured fashion i mean go round the bottle stone thirteen times even dear old henry kettle my house is to be left to you consider it as a token of my confidence sod them all but then he thought about fay with her rainbow eye no he told minnie seagrove im not frightened and its too dark to see me shaking he was scared for instance to set foot on the tump even humble had said you couldnt always trust your reactions up there so theyd stay on the ground and where possible outside the wall hed briefly considered taking humbles crossbow but he didnt know how to work it and this was no time to learn that was another problem what was he going to do about humble there was no way this one could be suicide or an accident and while the police would never suspect minnie seagrove theyd be hauling joe powys in within half an hour of the body being found minnie would of course explain the circumstances but circumstances like these would sound more than a little suspect in court they began to walk around the perimeter of the tump towards the light quietly powys said and slowly the dog wasnt barking any more if andy had done anything to arnold hed kill him ok im full of shit but im not going to obey instructions any more not from you not from goff and especially not from jean jean of course it made appalling sense was not protecting him she was protecting andy and andy typically had wanted him to know that before he died humble had said im empowered to answer just one of your questions ill tell you the answer shall i then you can work out the question at your leisure the answer is you ready the answer is his mother he would trace the wort family tree later if he ever got out of this meanwhile it had a dispiriting logic and it cleared up a few questions about jean that hed never even thought to ask the idea of an experienced barrister giving it all up to act as the unpaid earthly intermediary for dr chi had never sounded too likely jeans professional life had been built on ambition power and manipulation dark magic but shes cured people that cant be dark magic what about fays dad oh jesus whats wrong mrs seagrove whispered fay had started pulling at jimmy preeces clothing and slapping at his face and screaming at him through the smoke please mr preece please you cant be just a sign of life anything a blink a twitch where do you keep a pulse in a neck like an old wornout concertina mr preece she pulled him down from the font and he collapsed onto her deadweight and she had to let him slide to the floor managing to get both hands under his head before it hit the stone but she could do no more because the appallingly blackened smokeshrouded scarecrow thing was dancing down the aisle its clothes smouldering and its eyes all too alight her own eyes weeping with the smoke with pity for jimmy preece and with fear for herself she ran through the porch and began now to wrestle with the bolts throwing herself coughing and sobbing against the doors when she was out she didnt look back but she carried inside her head the image of the blackened monster and the scorched smell of him knowing that if she stopped to breathe he would be on her she ran gasping through the churchyard and out of the lychgate her lungs feeling like burst balloons the bells crashing around her like bombs she could hear voices in the square and she ran towards them eyes straining looking for lights but the nearer she got to the square and the louder the voices became the darker it got as if there was not only night to contend with but fog she thought at first it was her eyes damaged by the smoke but quite soon the bells stopped and fay began to realize there was something about the square that was unaccountably wrong chapter xiv first off anybody got a torch yes no the bells had stopped and the silence ought to have glistened col croston thought but it didnt the silence after the bells was the ominous silence you could hear when the phone rang and you picked it up and there was apparently nobody on the other end but you knew there was it was too dark to see who was with him on the square but he could guess or rather he could guess who was not on the square ie anybody born and bred within the precincts of the ancient town of crybbe graham jarrett said a torch is not normally considered essential for a public meeting even in crybbe besides even when the powers off its not usually as dark as this no quite the townhall doors had been slammed and barred behind the last of them and then minutes later col had watched as they were opened again just briefly and a bloated figure had emerged stood grotesquely silhouetted between two men and then tumbled without a word down the six steps to the pavement the late max goff had rejoined his new age community well let him lie where he fell somebody would have to explain this to the police and he didnt see why it had to be him around the square tiny jewels of light appeared people striking matches but almost as soon as a match was struck it seemed to go out as if there was a fierce wind which there wasnt not any kind of wind there werent even any lamps alight in the windows of the town houses tonight ok listen col shouted we need some lights anybody with a house near here would they please go home and bring whatever torches or lamps or even candles they can find i also need a telephone who lives closest we have a flat hilary ivory said over the crybbe pottery hereward newsome said theres a phone in the gallery thatd probably be quickest good ill come with you stay where you are and keep talking so i can find you mrs ivory if you could find your way to your flat and bring out any torches et cetera i dont think we have torches as such when the electricity goes out we use this rather interesting reproduction etruscan oil lamp would that do im sure it looks most attractive but one of those heavy duty motoring lanterns with a light each end might be a little more practical we havent got a car col whistled tunelessly through his teeth colin im over here yes ok got you hereward now listen everybody i dont know any more than you do what the hells going on tonight what i do know is that none of us should attempt to leave the scene until after the police arrive im going with hereward to his gallery to ring headquarters and acquaint them fully with the situation any questions oh lots graham jarrett said dreamily and i may spend the rest of my life trying to find the answers just hurry it up a woman said theres an awful smell i cant smell anything actually he could but didnt want to draw attention to it it rather smelled as if a couple of people had lost control their bowels and frankly that wouldnt be too surprising under the circumstances god yes its vile sounded like the woman who ran the craft shop magenta something well obnoxious as it might be try not to move too far away lead on hereward keep talking strange hereward said how when anyone asks you to keep talking you can never think of anything to say good grief colin she was right about that smell its dreadful in certain periods of his sas career col had been exposed long hours to various deeply unpleasant bodily odours but he had to admit if only to himself this was the most sickening it was more than simply faeces though there was certainly that there was also a dustbin kind of pungency and all manner of meaty smells newly killed to faintly putrid no power and now the drains are blocked youll probably turn on the tap when you get home hereward and find the bloody waters off too i really do think its about time i put a bomb under my esteemed colleagues on the council not that they can actually do anything except talk about it you can certainly count on my support for as long as im here anyway look im sorry about what happened in there i overreacted i suppose wouldnt any of us old chap some of these tv types do tend to think they have a kind of droit de seigneur wherever they happen to be hanging up their is it far hereward no that is im sorry one gets disoriented in the dark especially as dark as this ive never known it this dark i it really should be about here colin can you feel the wall i can feel some kind of surface is there a timberframed bit next to your place actually there is and it goes straight from that to the large window but maybe were on the wrong side of the square pretty easy to do even when youre on what you think of as familiar ground no i dont think oh hell i seem to be way out isnt there a pavement in front of your gallery because were still on the cobbles you know i thought there was a pavement all around the square actually shows how you a few yards away col heard a woman scream its gone its gone i tell you hilary the whole bloody front all i can feel is this urrrgh its filthy colonel croston can you help us please it sounds terribly stupid but celias lost her pottery look col took a step back lets calm down and get this in proportion funny how you live in a place for years but never quite notice what order the shops are in right between the crybbe pottery and the gallery weve got the lamb ok and that whats it called middle marches crafts hereward said right and then after the pottery the road starts sloping down to the bridge and across from there weve got the cock hereward he paused confused the cocks got its generator hasnt it yes it has so why isnt it on colin a brittle panic crumbling from herewards voice somethings horribly wrong dont you feel that its all wrong hilarys companion wailed nothing is the same if we only had light col said i know cars if someone has a car parked on the square they can open it up and switch on the headlights then we can see where were at look hereward breathing rapidly i dont want to start a panic but there were cars parked on three sides of the square when i went into the meeting we havent bumped into a single one have we well they cant all have been nicked just spread the word were looking for anybody with a car parked on the square just do it hereward please col walked to the side of the building felt wood and some type of chalky plaster and the cobbles under his feet knowing full well that the pavement around the square had been replaced two years ago and thered already been one there for years before that and now there were cobbles again he steadied his breathing face facts it was true everything was different road surface buildings even the atmosphere itself what would it look like what would it look like if they could actually see any of it mass hallucination col decided logically some kind of gas perhaps why had the townsfolk refused to come out of the town hall and indeed locked themselves in because they knew what was happening they knew it was too dangerous to go into the square were the bells some form of alarm had somebody actually hung all the ropes for this occasion and why didnt the locals warn everybody else because they only suspected what it might be and were afraid of being laughed at or because they wanted the newcomers to be exposed to it it was insane any way you looked at it it was all utterly insane concentrate col dug the nails of his left hand into the back of his right just for a few moments there completely forgot this was not so far the nights most appalling development max goff savagely killed in front of all of them and that was no hallucination something touched his arm and such was the state of his nerves he almost swung round and struck out with the side of his hand colonel croston whos that its fay morrison keep your voice down mrs morrison christ colonel im sorry he whispered where the hells jim you left with him the mayor hes hes in the church listen ive been following you around for the last ten minutes i couldnt approach you until you knew at least i dont know anything mrs morrison ive never been more in the dark excuse the humour it isnt felt but you know everythings changed i heard you talking to hereward you realize this is not in any sense the crybbe we know and love oh now look im trying to keep calm colonel im sorry this is beyond me some kind of gas i suspect colonel col col forget about gas please listen first of all i think preece is dead stroke heart attack maybe i dont know about these things but i do know max goff was killed by warren preece you know who i mean the grandson punkish type where is he hes hurt hes badly burned there was a fire in the church are you serious yes i know you cant see any flames but you cant see anything else either can you col gripped her arm he wanted to feel she was real please dont she said ive got a burn im sorry but this jesus just listen if you think this is mad dont say anything just walk away and keep it to yourself he tried to see her eyes but all he could make out was the white of her face ok he said on this night fay morrison said and i mean this night this actual night exactly four hundred years ago a large number of people gathered in the square where we are now trying to decide what to do about the high sheriff whod taken to hanging men and compelling their wives to have sex with him and there were various other alleged examples of antisocial behaviour even by sixteenthcentury standards that i wont go into now but the bottom line is the people of this town decided theyd taken enough he would have stopped her he was in no mood for a long history lecture but he supposed hed given his word hed listen to what she had to say you can imagine the scene she said a bit of a rabble not exactly organized not much imagination but angry and scared too only finding courage in numbers you know the kind of thing so they march on crybbe court flaming torches the full bit and there are a lot of them and it really wasnt something this sheriff would have expected not the border way keep your heads down right dont make waves but they did for once they made waves they surrounded the court and they said to the servants menatarms whatever you send this bastard out or were going to burn this place down maybe they set light to a barn or something to reinforce the threat but anyway it was pretty clear to the sheriff by now that he was in deep shit from somewhere close to what he imagined was the centre of the square col could hear graham jarrett the hypnotist guy shouting youre taking absolutely the wrong attitude you know he seems to have gone into the attic fay said and topped himself hear him out will you a woman bawled sounded like that astrologer oona jopson shorn head ring through nose whod threatened to emasculate the doormen fay said what you have to remember about this particular sheriff is that he was skilled in what im afraid we have to call the black arts except he thought it was science she paused do you want me to stop im not laughing col said am i ill carry on then before he hanged himself or while he was hanging himself i mean dont think im an expert on this stuff im not but anyway he left something of himself behind its called a haunting col still with me open mind col said go on it wasnt a spurofthemoment job hed been planning this for a long time dropped hints to his women expect more of the same when im gone look graham jarrett was shouting if youll all just quieten down a minute well do a bit of reasoning out but i think weve been selected as participants in a wonderful shared experience thats really at the core of what most of us have been striving for over many years and here we are panicking the jopson woman piped up well im not panicking ive never been so excited guy morrison shouted what about poor bloody goff he didnt look too excited he looked a bit bloody dead to me yeah but was he jopson is he i mean how much of that was for real how much of what we perceive is actual reality col croston said jesus christ it smells so awful the woman from the crafts shop which now sold mainly greetings cards said it smells awful to us thats all or only to you maybe to me its a wonderful smell it smells of reality not as it is to us these days with our dull senses and our tired tastebuds and our generally limited perception of everything what were feeling right now is the essence of this place i mean shit it is this is higher consciousness and is she right col asked fay morrison in a low voice what do you think i think shes nuts guy said has anybody tried just walking away from here in any direction just carrying on walking until they find an open door or somebody with a torch or a lamp my there was the sound of some struggling give me some space it was jocasta newsome my husband he said he was going to get help hes i cant find him dont worry graham jarrett said hell be around i dont think he can go anywhere you see i dont think anyone can i dont think theres any light to be found i think there is graham a new voice said a cool dark voice lazy whos that is that andy col croston heard fay morrison inhale very sharply through her mouth i think the dark voice said that we should consider how we can find our own light whos that col whispered boultontrow i dont think i know him i mentioned him during the meeting you havent forgotten that have you oh said col that her outburst it occurred lo col that there was something personal at the back of this that fay morrison had some old probably sexual score to settle with boultontrow anyway it was all rather too much for a practical man to take he had to reassemble his wits and get to a phone well thank you mrs morrison col said youve given me a lot of food for thought col it has to be food for action or something unbelievably awfuls going to happen look col said ill come back to you ok no dont go but hed gone oh please fay morrison breathed into the foulsmelling dark please chapter xv the dog was in a pool of light on the side of the tump where the grass looked almost white and the dog was barking nonstop wait joe powys whispered to minnie seagrove dont go any closer stay out of the light he moved quietly around the base of the tump to see what was happening who it was dont look at me arnold im not here ignore me there was a single spotlight directed at the mound from the field on the side facing the road the side from which henry kettle had come on his last ride in his clappedout old volkswagen variant the light went out the dog stopped barking powys waited he heard a vehicle door slam moved closer saw a match flare and then the red glow on the end of a cigarette well a voice said you buggered yourself yere all right boy gomer mrs seagrove had appeared at powyss side its gomer parry oh christ they heard and an orange firefly crashlanded in the field gomer its minnie seagrove you replaced my drains flaming hell woman what you tryin to do scare the life out of me ruddy dog was bad enough hang on a second two small lights appeared in the front of what proved to be a tractor with an unwieldy digger contraption overhanging the cab powys had last seen it parked in the square he whispered ask him if hes alone course im bloody alone who you got there with you mrs seagrove its a friend of mine choose some places to bring your boyfriends all i can say you mind your manners gomer parry were coming down he was scrabbling in the grass when they reached him dropped my ciggy somewhere the diggers sidelights were reflected in his glasses sod it wont set a fire grass is bloody wet he peered at powys i seen you before isnt it you was with that radio lady mrs morris hour or so ago get yourself about dont you boy gomer mrs seagrove snapped aye all right nice lady that mrs morris very nice indeed pardon me for asking mr parry powys sad deadpan but somebody wouldnt by any chance be paying you to take out the rest of the wall now just a minute you wanner watch what youre saying my friend only its er kind of outside normal working hours aye well said gomer parry bit of an accident like got a bit confused what with the ole power bein off no streetlights and i come clean off the road dunno what come over me i never done nothin like that before see never dont worry about it powys said not as if youre the first whats that said gomer suspicious oh bugger me enry kettle is this where enry kettle you knew henry course i knew im enry kettle oh hell aye wells see wells ed find em id dig em talk about a tragic loss friend o yours too was e he nodded and put out his hand joe powys gomer shook it gomer parry plant hire powys did some rapid thinking gomer had gone off the road probably at the same spot as henry and yet gomer had survived what happened when you came off the road bloody strange gomer said thought i muster been pissed like sorry mrs s but id only ad a couple see anyway it was just like id blacked out and come round in the bloody field only i never did and then it was like well it was like goin downhill with a hell of a strong wind up your arse sorry mrs you see anything oh er gomer scratched his face got in a bit of a panic like tell the truth see all sortser things isnt it thought id seen a feller one second up there top o the tump mong the ole trees like but natrally i was more bothered bout not turnin the ole digger over see best one i got this customized fixed im myself big david brown tractor an half of this ole jcb i got off my mate over llandod way bloody cracker this ole thing managed to stop im fore i reached the ole wall if e ad gone into it idve been pretty bloody sore about it i can tell you word has it said powys that you were pretty bloody sore when somebody borrowed your bulldozer dont you talk to me bout that said gomer in disgust bloody vandals you were warned off werent you you couldve had this wall down no problem but they warned you off owd you know that demanded gomer made sense oh aye you know anythin else makes sense going back to this figure on the top of the tump where exactly were you when you saw him youre askin a lot o questions mister you with the radio too although he didnt sound as if hed mind if this were the case no see i said i thought i seen im e was probly another tree with the light catchin im funny like your headlights are that powerful that you could see a man standing on top of the tump when youre coming down and the lights are pointing down light only got one eadlight workin joe so when you said a tree caught in the light aye gomer said thoughtfully youre right not possible is it see ill tell you what it was like you know kids when they gets a torch and they wants to frighten other kids and flashes it under their chin and their face lights up really well on account of half its in shadow well it was like that only it was like his whole body was lit up that way scary only im strugglin with the wheel i thinks get off its only an tree minnie seagrove looked at powys i used to think like that when i first saw the hound you do you look for explanations sort of thing the hound said gomer arnold began to bark right said gomer opening the door of the cab if theres anybody else up there im gonner bloody find out this time the single headlight spotlit the tump again and powys watched as arnold ran into the white circle ran arnold ran into the light hed lost a leg just a few days ago and he was running was this arnold arnold powys shouted come on the dog trotted down to the foot of the mound and ambled across powys bent down and the dog snuffled up at him and licked his hands gently powys slid one hand underneath he could actually feel the stitching arnold squirmed free and made off back across the field towards the tump looking back at powys every few yards and barking hes found something minnie seagrove said he wants to show you something i cant believe this powys thought this is seriously weird he isnt even limping arnolds tail started to wave when he saw powys was following him he ran a few yards up the side of the tump and then sat down he sat down the dog with only one back leg sat down arnold barked he turned around and put his nose into the side of the tump and snuffled about then he turned round again and started to bark at powys powys thought the words springing into his mind in henry kettles voice hes a dowsers dog he wandered back to the digger rubbing his forehead gomer what are the chances of you doing a spot of excavation what gomer said in there be a public service powys said that tumps a liability if it wasnt for that tump henry kettle would be alive today and locating wells protected ancient monument though isnt it gomer said thats an offence unauthorized excavation of a protected ancient monument certainly is said powys thats all right then said gomer glasses twinkling where you want the ole chapter xvi the acoustic in the square was tight and intimate like a studio and the voice was deep and resonant strong and melancholy music wonderful broadcasting voice fay thought trying to be cynical radio three fm when you think about it the voice said any town centres an intensely powerful place its where energy gathers from all directions thoughts and feelings pouring in its where we go to tap into a town to feel its life rhythm pure radio fay thought the purest radio of all because we cant see anything no distractions he can design his pictures in our minds the town centre is where the centuries are stored andy said smell them smell the centuries all i can smell fay thought is shit four hundred years of shit and all i can hear is bullshit had to keep telling herself that this was andy boultontrow of bottle stone farm descendant of sheriff wort scourge of crybbe black magician the most hated man in what you can smell andy boultontrow said and she felt most uncomfortably that he was speaking directly to her is many centuries of human life there havent always been sewerage systems and hot water and fresh vegetables this town lived on the border of two often hostile countries and it had to live within itself it ground its own flour killed its own meat and kept its own counsel he paused and its secrets it kept its secrets fay thought drab secrets densely woven into a faded dim old tapestry boultontrows voice was the only sound in the square the only sound in the world for this square was the world none of them could leave it except perhaps by dying should have been a terrifying thought wasnt she couldnt remember for the moment quite what he looked like this boultontrow only that he was tall and dark and bearded like christ that was how people saw him but she couldnt see boultontrow she couldnt see anybody youd have thought your eyes would have adjusted by now so that youd be able to make our at least the shapes of men and women but unless they were very close to you you could see nothing this darkness was unnatural not however to andy she could feel that he knew his way around the darkness if anybody could lead them out of here it would be him and that would be comforting to these people perhaps it was comforting to her but there was no immediate comfort in andys message and now you come here and you want crybbe to give up its secrets to you to lay open its soul to you you want to feel its spirit inside you isnt that right we want to help it rediscover its own spirit someone said surely thats what this is about this experiment this experiment andy laughed and whos the subject of this experiment is it crybbe or is it us maybe were here to let the town experiment on us its an interesting idea isnt it maybe crybbe can work its own alchemy if youre prepared to put yourselves into the crucible perhaps what youre experiencing now is a taster can you handle this are you strong enough talk about a captive audience fay thought it was an uneasy thought she was a captive too would she not also go along with anything this man suggested if he could lead her out of here back into where there were lights sense of place andy said you want to feel that sense of place that finds an echo in your own hearts you want to belong you want to lay yourself down in a field on a summers evening and you want the mysteries to come to you whispered in your ears drifting on the air and smelling of honeysuckle yes a woman said faintly yes andy paused and the night held its breath thais not how it works he said you know that really dont you this is how it works this is sense of place feel it smell it secrets come out like babies writhing and covered in blood and slime and all of us genteel new age people we turn up our noses and we start to scream let me out of here i cant bear it give me my picturesque halftimbered cottage and my chintzy sofa and my books give me my incense and my crystals and my immersion tank give me my illusions back yeah nobody spoke i cant give you your illusions back andy said gently the silence was total radio fay thought desperately its only radio you know the techniques you know the tricks hes standing there at the mixing desk the presenter and also the engineer playing with the effects adjusting the atmos but if you trust me andy said i can give you the true secrets of crybbe think about this ill be back and the voice was gone andy jarrett shouted into the pungent night dont go he cant go oona jopson said can he stop powys shouted the mechanical digger groaned arnold barked take it slowly ok we could be coming to something gomers customized digger had an extra spotlight mounted on the cab it wasnt as strong as the single headlight but least you could focus it on the target powys had been worried the wall would be a problem but gomer had done some skilled manoeuvring putting on a show riding the digger like a trickcyclist planthire choreographer tapping the wall with the edge of the shovel in exactly the right places until the stones crumbled apart like breezeblocks powys asking him out of interest how long would it have taken you to take this wall apart with the bulldozer gomer had leaned out of his cab his cigarette pointing upwards from his mouth so the red end was reflected in his glasses you what joe this ole wall gimme hour or so youd never know thered been a wall yere tell you what it bloody hurt me that did havin to say i couldnt andle it without a bigger dozer afterwards it had just been a question of removing enough rubble to get the digger to the tump and after that piece o piss gomer said sorry minnie mrs seagrove sat on a broken section of the wall dust all over her kilt arnold lying across her knees watchful both of them watching the action isnt he good though joe she said as gomer went into the tump like a surgeon isnt he a marvel powys smiled she was loving it he wondered if she remembered killing edgar humble or if she still halfthought that was all a dream no more real now than frank her dead husband hold it a minute gomer weve got gomer backed up raised the shovel powys slid under it lumps of earth falling on him from its great metal teeth minnie can you pass me the handlamp it looked like an opening no more than five feet in and they could be into some kind of tunnel he shone the light inside and he could see a roof of solid stone like the capstone of a dolmen gomer weve cracked it course we ave boy want me to widen the ole ok he stepped back and the shovel adjusted itself then went in again he couldnt believe this theyd gone in at precisely the spot where arnold had been sitting sitting a leg short and he was sitting and after no more than twenty minutes they were into the heart of this thing powys looked up towards the sky black and starless henry he said is this you you old bugger fay moved among them listening but speaking to no one it was obvious by now that col croston was not coming back to her perhaps like hereward hed gone to try and find a way out of the square were not in a different time zone graham jarrett was saying its not as simplistic as that were in what you might call a timeless zone a place where the past and present exist in the same continuum what he was saying about the town centre adam ivory said i think thats literally central to this experience the town centres this kind of energy vortex fay moved on they were creating a dream within a dream the way new age people tended to do moving around scattering meaningless jargon making themselves comfortable inside the experience but jean wendle the most experienced of them all was not here or was she fay moved around in the darkness almost floating coming to sense the nearness of other bodies and the emotions emanating from them fear and exhilaration in equal quantities now but she doubled there was one of them who would not prefer this experience in retrospect returning to the square by daylight yes this was where it happened just about here yes you can still feel the essence of it yes itll never be the same again for me this place always be special yes it was like an initiation becoming a part of this town and now i feel i can tap into it whenever i want to and i can really work here effectively now because i belong because ive felt the spirit of crybbe fay moved on through the radio world and now he was inside the tump hed been inside them before burial chambers passage graves it was suggested that many of the stone dolmens cromlechs around the country had once been covered over like this with earth the passageway was perhaps three and a half feet wide and was low and he had to walk painfully bent over he directed the beam at the walls and the ceiling the structure appeared to be a series of cromlechs joined up like vertebrae wide slabs of greybrown stone overhead a floor of closepacked earth he turned around with difficulty and he couldnt see the entrance any more he wasnt naturally claustrophobic but he shuddered briefly at the thought of the opening being sealed behind him great bucketloads of earth dumped back and rubble from the wall heaped across so that nobody would ever know there was a passageway so that he slowly suffocated in here and became one more wellpreserved pile of bones in forgotten bronze age burial chamber he stopped his chest tightened gomer could he really trust gomer parry so many old allegiances never spoken of in crybbe and new ones too could you ever know exactly who belonged to whom maybe he should have asked gomer to come with him but he couldnt leave mrs seagrove outside on her own look dont think about it ok too much at stake to go back now concentrate on where you are what it can tell you keep going it would probably be an actual bronze age grave although he doubted he was the first person since then to enter this mound you couldnt excavate a prehistoric burial chamber in under an hour but was he the first to get inside since michael wort abruptly it ended out of the passage and into the chamber itself wider maybe eight feet in diameter but not quite circular any more it was cold in here the air smelled old and rank in the centre of the chamber was a single flat stone on the stone was a wooden box powys stopped at the entrance to the chamber put the lamp on the ground stood blocking the entrance head bowed they didnt have boxes in the bronze age not carved oak boxes anyway with iron bands and locks he stood staring at the box in the lamps beam and his breathing tightened the box was about twelve inches deep and eighteen inches square it sang to him and it sang of ancient evil oh come on he walked across the chamber to the box and found he couldnt touch it there is no evil only degrees of negativity powys started to laugh and then quite deliberately he bent down and switched off the lamp what is this about well he couldnt see the box any more or the inside of the stone chamber he could be anywhere no visual images no impressions coming in now just me and it this is a real fairy hill and im in the middle of it and ive come here of my own free will and theres no andy and no jean and im scared ive put out the light to induce a state of fear and the nerveends are bristling with it and im ready im ready hereward yes thank god why why are you thanking god because i thought i thought you werent going to come back hereward im so desperately sorry i was only trying to get away all ive ever wanted is to get away from here and you thought guy morrison would take you away no yes oh god i dont know what i thought i was just so lonely and messed up he guy was passing through he wasnt part of crybbe he was going somewhere and i was stuck fast i was like someone just dashing outside and thumbing a lift and he stopped im sorry thats all mixed up im not very clear tonight not very articulate dont cry im sorry im sorry about the picture too but you dont know what pictures can do oh i do im not talking about aesthetics i know do you pictures are doorways yes artists put elements of themselves into pictures and also elements of other things the man in that picture of tessas hes her teacher you know he has a studio in the woods and shes been going down there and hes been teaching her how to paint and what to paint how to make a picture into doorway how do you know that because in the picture hes standing in a doorway like the light of the world in reverse because hes so dark but darkness and light its all the same when you cant see isnt it i dont im going through the doorway jocasta hereward it really is the only way out of here through the doorway the only way out for me anyway hereward im getting very scared theres no need to be scared come here darling there no no please there there aaaugh there hereward felt the woman go limp and his hands fell away from her throat he felt himself smiling into the dark as he walked away the lamp was alight and the door was ajar when he pushed it swung open at once and hereward found himself in the comfortingly familiar setting of his own workshop next to the gallery a candle glowed on the workbench where hed made frames do you know in the early days we used actually to make our own frames fragments of frames were scattered over the bench and the floor a corner section was still wedged in the woodvice he wouldnt need to make frames any more that phase was over perhaps hed employ someone to do it dont suppose youd be interested in a job would you he said to the shadow sitting on the bench next to the candle the shadow stopped whittling at a piece of framingwood with its stanley knife and slipped to the floor hereward saw it wasnt really a shadow it was just black chapter xvii laughter in the dark laughter like icecrystals forming in the air andy who did you think it was going to be joe did you think you were finally about to meet sir michael himself andy but he wasnt here he was mainly grey shimmering to nearly white at his fingertips the extremities of him andy but he wasnt there powys heard the voice in his head he spoke aloud but heard the replies in his head he wasnt thinking about this too hard analysis was useless couldnt play new games by old rules dont touch him he cant harm you but dont touch him the box whats in the box andy why dont you open it joe the locks no big deal ornament as much as anything also its very old pick up a stone break the lock i dont think so no youre still very much full of shit joe you know that you go to all this trouble to get into here and you wont face up to the final challenge whats the problem not got the guts joe not got the bottle think about this think hard whats it been worth if you dont open it maybe i will powys said youll find a couple of stones behind you near where you left your lamp ones narrow and thin it used to be a spearhead the others chunky like a hammer you can slide the spearhead into the crack below the lid but not here the eyes were white though the eyes were alight incandescent andy but he wasnt here im not going to open it here you can piss off mate im going to pick up the box and im going to take it away you dont want to do that joe you might awaken the guardian you dont want that no you dont want that but you can piss off powys felt a trickle of euphoria bright and slippery as mercury and very quickly he covered it up smothered it with fear stay frightened at all costs stay frightened a rapid pattering on the closepacked earthern floor and something warm against his leg arnie stay frightened it might not be he bent down and the growling began he felt arnolds fur stiffen and harden under his hand and the growling went on a hollow and penetrating sound that came from far back in the dogs throat maybe further back than that maybe much further back the growl was continuous and seemed to alter the vibration of the night youre not growling at me are you arnie the grey thing hung in the air like an old raincoat but he was fairly sure that andy was not there any more powys switched on the lamp and the grey thing vanished he walked over to the stone in the centre of the chamber and he picked up the wooden box warm cosy just as before the deep georgian windows the chinese firescreen the victorian lamp with the paleblue shade burning perfumed oil i wondered she said if you would come back hullo wendy alex said she was dressed for bed and how black nightdress sort of shiftthing filigree type of pattern so you could see through it in all the right places alex couldnt take his eyes off her sit down jean said wendy theres something awfully funny happening out there did you know funny well id been down to the river and came back up the hill and when i got to near the top just at the entrance to the square it all went very dark i mean i know its obviously dark without the electricity supply but this really was extra dark as if there was a thick fog lots of people about the square i could hear them talking but i couldnt see any of them oh my and hard to explain this but it was as if there was a sort of screen between all these people and me now i know what youre going to say the only reason theres a screen between me and the rest of the world is because ive erected it myself but it wasnt like that not at all this was really well physical but not how do you explain it i think you should come and sit down alex and not get yourself get too worked up about this thats what you think is it i think you need to calm down alex slumped into the sofa and she came down next to him as light as a bird perching on the edge of the cushion and the shiftthing riding up her legs pretty remarkable legs had to admit that and i heard fay alex said id walked back couldnt seem to make progress you see kept on walking and wasnt getting anywhere you know that feeling happens in dreams sometimes anyway im coming up the hill again and this time its fay i can hear talking to some chap telling him about how all the people had gathered in this very square exactly four hundred years ago to the night to get up a posse to go along and lynch old whatsisname sheriff wort i see jean said she leaned over and picked up his left hand one of her nipples was poking through the black filigree shift alex swallowed then this chap she was talking to he must have drifted away i said listen fay i said why dont you tell me tell me what all this is about but she couldnt hear me why couldnt she hear me wendy jean said whats this on your hands blood he said quickly its murray beech hes been stabbed to death only realized as i was walking up the hill stabbed to death jean said neutrally i see dont you believe me alex i believe you believe that murray beech has been stabbed to death and what about grace she took me to her grave we walked together i think we came to an agreement i see but you dont really believe any of this do you wendy jean smiled or do you alex said jean would you like to sleep with me alexs throat went dry well she said gently oh gosh alex said do you think i could manage it jean smiled perhaps we should find out thats what you think is it the answer burned quietly like a kind of incense in her eyes alex stood up he felt very calm calmer than ever he could remember feeling before he did not know the meaning of the word dementia his heart was strong his eyes he knew were twinkling quite dramatically the aromatic oil from the lamp was exquisite jean unwound from the sofa and he took her in his arms his breathing rate quickened at once she tilted her face to kiss him but he ran a hand into her soft short hair and pressed her face to his chest bent his head and whispered into her ear you cunning bitch her body went rigid and he let her go what a waste he thought what a tragic bloody waste when jean wendle faced him from across the room her eyes were in deep shadow her lips were drawn back and the inside of her mouth looked so black that she seemed momentarily to have no teeth at all the aromatic oil from the lamp smelt like the floor of a urinal oh my youve blown it now alex jean whispered voice like tinder alex shook his head youd had it you were finished you were going very rapidly into the final decline a bed in the bottom comer of the geriatric ward to where the naughty boys are consigned the nurses treating you like a difficult child when you try to pinch their bottoms poor old man he used to be a priest nothing more welcome in hell than an unfrocked priest alex mused except perhaps a priest who ought to have been unfrocked but never was because he was too damned plausible all his life so plausible right up to the end shafting ladies i brought you back jean said i fed you energy but what kind of energy och jean turned away with a dismissive wave of the hand you blew it i dont think so alex said i made a deal i went up the hill and i made a deal he smiled his heart was strong and his eyes still twinkled jean wendle turned her head and peered at him curious he saw in her face a pinched look ravaged and not the ravage of years made a deal alex said after a period of protracted and considered negotiation the management and i formulated the basis of an agreement nothing binding either party retaining the right to pull out at any given time if the second party should happen to lose his bottle alex walked out of the room good night wendy bloody waste he thought sadly joe powys came out of the passage into the night into a blinding light and the face of edgar humble he didnt have to force the fear hold it dont move powys half out of the hole in the side of the tump the wooden box in his arms arnold at his ankles humbles eyes were fully open his lips apart youre dead powys said from a throat full of hairline cracks course hes fucking dead gomer parry said leaning out of his cab sorry minnie humble lay across the jaw of the digger quite stiff now one arm still flung out and his crossbow on his chest the big shovel was almost blocking the entrance to the passage minnie seagrove wasnt looking gomer said what you got there then joe buried treasure said powys is that thing safe gimme a second gomer raised the shovel so powys could climb out from underneath it right then the little man climbed out of his cab rubbing his hands on his overalls we got a bit o talkin to do yere joe first off you finished in there got what you want i think so safe to block im up again then dont see why not good mind out then he climbed back into his cab cigarette end waggling lowered the shovel started to tip humbles body over the entrance of the hole what the hell are you doing gomer minnie seagrove turned away as humbles remains tumbled into the soil and rock nicked that box did you gomer shouted what treasure trove that boy i wont say nothin if you dont i had to tell him joe minnie seagrove said i said ill go to the police and admit everything and youll speak up for me wont you joe youre a famous writer thatll count for quite a lot but he wouldnt hear of it bollocks said gomer could be centuries before they finds im if ever and if they does turn im up ow could it possibly have anythin at all to do with a sweet little old lady sorry minnie i didnt mean old the more powys thought about it the less difficult it became to fault you cant leave him near the entrance i shall drag im in just as far as ell go then ill fill this ole up and pack im tight see and pile up them stones so it looks like the wall collapsed on it like i cant stop to help you gomer im sorry ive got to go somewhere and i dont think theres much time no problem ill take minnie ome and could you do me another favour take arnold too ill take him mrs seagrove said ill come back for him i hope or fay will thanks arnie said powys pulling the box down and sinking his hands into arnolds fur rubbing his face at the dogs encouragingly cold nose arnold licked him once and thank henry for me powys said if you see him around he picked up the box it was quite heavy but not too unwieldy he balanced the lamp on top youre sure this is going to be all right i have the awful feeling itll look like a excavation site joe said gomer patiently this yere is gomer parry plant hire youre dealin with i already got the reputation of havin fucked up once on this site sorry minnie and im not gonner risk avin myself pulled in by that wiley if i can elp it am i gomer lit another cigarette lowered his voice wynford wiley he said wouldnt give im the satisfaction fat bastard powys nodded minnie i she never did nothin gomer parry said gruffly so you got nothin to thank er for is it bugger off good luck chapter xviii if anything it was stronger now she thought shed get used to it like when you were staying on a farm during the manurespreading season but this wasnt manure and it was getting stronger in it there was human waste and animal waste raw meat blood perhaps body odours rancid fats and now smoke woodsmoke maybe or was it the church could she smell the fire in the church because the church was on the line linking the centre of the square with the court and the tump joe powys would know or he wouldnt either way it would be good to have him here not such a worldclass crank after all not when you listened to this bunch fay walked among them the night still alive with natural radio hell come back graham jarrett what if he doesnt hilary ivory i tried walking one of the lawyers in tones of defeat i kept on walking looking for a light i kept walking and i just felt like i was fading out fading away losing my physical resistance to the air becoming absorbed in the atmosphere i mean it was very soporific in a way i think itd be good to die like that but not yet i got scared i thought ive got to go back and when i thought that i was back like i hadnt been anywhere theres nowhere to go oona jopson accept it relish it its not likely to happen to you again good or maybe it will maybe were being opened up to a permanent kind of cosmic consciousness you know she wondered what was happening outside the square was the church alight was jimmy preece alive and what about warren were the crybbe people attending the meeting still inside the town hall and what of their relatives in the town had they any idea what was happening perhaps it had happened before the town square sealing itself off in the past a past which was always close to the surface of this town not for the first time tonight fay genuinely wondered if this was some long and tortured dream and if it was not a dream whether when if it was over it would have no more significance than if it had been somebody was coughing very weakly a thin scraping sound wheres colonel croston im here whos that its dan osborne colonel im a homeopathic practitioner but i have a medical qualification theres a woman here in a bad way over here just come towards my voice im bending across her you wont walk into her ok im on my way do you know who she is shes wearing what feels like a silk blouse and a fairly light skirt shes got thick hair quite long i suppose guy said is she wearing a thickish sort of necklace thing a torque i think dear god whats this jocasta whats happened where are you shes the bloody torques been twisted into her neck please christ just hold still ok mr osborne im here is she ok i dont know she didnt bloody well do this to herself did she somebodys tried to garrote her with her own oh god get me out of this the woman from the crafts shop hurling herself about the crybbe vacuum bouncing off people somebody had to crack up sooner or later have one for me fay thought col croston sat down on the cobbles crosslegged and looked hard at the darkness held his own hand up in front of his face from six inches he could see it just could tell it was a hand or was that because he knew it was a hand the woman would live her throat would be a mess but shed be ok shed tried to speak who did this he asked but if shed identified her attacker he hadnt been able to make out the name wouldnt be much use anyway how could you go after anyone without light i am here col said silently letting his eyes halfclosed i can sense myself i can sense my toes flexing them and then letting them relax my calves trying to tighten the muscles in his leg and letting them relax my thighs my stomach an exercise as a soldier all his family were soldiers col had gravitated to the sas not because of a need for action and physical stress but because he wanted to feel life and for that hed decided one needed to be out on the edge of something always within sight of the abyss rather thought hed got over that stage now chest tighten breath in hold it relax shoulders mind control expansion of the senses spent two weeks with a meditation expert learning techniques for dominating the body in tight spots optional course for officers some of the chaps thought it was all crap not col hed actually taken it further after the course neck face tensing the muscles in his cheeks and jaw letting the tension go at the end of this exercise hed done it many times over the past twenty or thirty years there should be a moment of pure awareness awareness of oneself and ones situation and sometimes back of the head one emerged from it and everything looked clearer and one knew precisely what to do next probably elements of yoga and meditation in there so it was never wise to tell some of the chaps one was indulging in this sort of thing or theyd be putting it round the colonel talked to plants and things not a word to these new age characters either or theyd be recruiting him as an emblem gradually his breathing slowed and the voices around him in the void began to fade warm night isnt it hmm stuffy humid yes it is really old chap in a tshirt sitting in a doorway a few yards away colonel croston isnt it col hey just a minute he could see this chap it was still dark but he could see him could see his white beard and what it said on the front of his tshirt didnt make any sense halffaded but he could its canon peters isnt it seen you in the cock alex col turned around to look at the square he could see the shapes of buildings very dimly he could hear the sound of people talking and possibly screaming although there was nothing immediate about this no involvement more like the sound of someones tv set from a distance heard you talking to my daughter the old man said young fay fay morrison yes i was but you werent with us were you you werent in in look canon can you help me to understand this when you heard us talking could you you know see us no col sighed thought not started out thinking it was some sort of gas some leakage from somewhere or an mod experiment just the kind of place theyd choose and now im inclined to think its something psychological coming out some masspsychosis thing i cant begin to i mean what your daughter had to say was interesting in a purely academic sense but not frankly im lost canon where does one start question ive been asking most of my life kept putting off having to answer it keep cool col instructed himself keep your head and for gods sake dont go back in there in where and how did i get out canon alex do you know whats happening only the vaguest notion old chap but i believe im getting there it is something psychological isnt it damned if im going to use that other word good lord no old boy never say that well col levered himself to his feet he could actually see lamps in some of the houses on this side of the square you know a mans been murdered oh yes murray beech the vicar the vicar stabbed to death lying in the churchyard and the church is on fire look col looked up from the blackness of the square and this vague shapes of roofs and saw the sky blooming red and orange and you know the strangest thing said alex nobodyd come out to watch youve rung the fire brigade i take it no good god man it might burn down it might but if the fire brigade come theyll have to go in through the square wont they and they might just mow down a lot of innocent people who didnt appear to see them coming or not be able to get through i dont know dont know what could happen but i think on balance that its safest to let it burn dont you only a bloody church the old chap looked gloomy but col noted entirely in command of his faculties the word around town had been that canon peters was losing his marbles i think the canon said that were in the middle of what used to be known technically as a crybbe matter however on this occasion theres been outside interference and the locals are seriously out of their depth thats my feeling can we help thats a very interesting question alex peters said silly childrens game fay thought hilary ivory on one side of her the cameraman larry ember on the other or perhaps only their voices their voices and their hands silly childrens game new age nonsense wheres the harm no harm were all going to pool our energy andys voice making soft chords in the night air were going to bring down the night silly childrens game no harm in it make a circle everybody hold hands dance gaily stop hold out hands to the sky as if in welcome wasnt there something like this at the end of close encounters and something else wasnt it in something else very silly got him just about bit stiff bit of rigor col heaved the corpse across his shoulder firemans lift job behind him flames were coming through the church roof he followed alex the body over his shoulder i am here im walking through a churchyard with a dead vicar over my shoulder and the church is on fire this is not like belfast after a bomb blast there are no spectators no fire brigade no police no army only the huge flames chewing up the night i trust alex said that when we get to the town hall youll have no difficulty getting us in count on it col croston said through gritted teeth the box became unaccountably heavy and joe powys had to put it down in the courtyard open it the mini was still parked up by the stableblock it had been his intention to load the box into the boot and then drive it out of crybbe but there was some uncertainty what did you do with these things open it you could take in into a church a real functioning church outside of crybbe and place it on the altar but you never knew with churches in the border country what other forces might be at work what damage you might be inflicting on some other quiet and vulnerable community while the people slept or open it or you could throw it into a deep lake this had been done in numerous legends to calm an excitable spirit in a ceremony normally involving about twelve priests he didnt have twelve priests to hand also this was not a whole unquiet spirit not the whole thing but unquiet yes walking back to the court holding the box with both hands the lamp balanced on top hed had the illusion of something moving inside open it psychological trickery mind games im not listening open it chapter xix somehow they had formed a circle in the dark when you moved around in this formation you couldnt of course see the individual people comprising the circle but soon you began to see the collective thing the movement the circle itself a ring of pure golden light hilary ivory breathed isnt it beautiful and weve made it ourselves weve made it yes fay thought remotely it is rather beautiful but its not quite golden more a darkish yellow the yellow of of what hilary held her right hand larry ember her left hilary breathed and sighed as if she was making love while larry chuckled to himself not in a cynical or ironic way but a chuckle of pleasure pleasure in selfdiscovery round and round they went in a slow circle mindlessly innocently round and round like children in the schoolyard the air was still pungent but the pungency was fortifying and compelling now tobacco could seem noxious and nauseous the first time you inhaled it but when you were accustomed to it it was deeply satisfying so it was with the scent of shit and blood and rotting vegetables as the human circle revolved quite slowly at first anticlockwise in the opposite direction to the sun which was ok fay reasoned dreamily because there was no sun anyway at night every face was bluelit anxious and staring bleakly at alex without enmity but without any hope either a quarantine situation nobody was to go outside nobody from outside was to come in because of what else might enter but col croston had got them into the hall without too much difficulty he knew both men on the rear door paul gwatkin one of the three gwatkin brothers who between them farmed upper cwm and lower cwm and bill davies the butcher decent chaps both of them paul col had said very reasonably its essential that my friend the canon and i come in and i have to tell you if you dont get out of the way i may hurt you quite badly problem is i was never trained to hurt people only slightly you see my problem and i hope colonel said bill davies standing aside that you might be startin to see ours col had laid a sympathetic hand on the butchers should were here to help bill wastin your time im afraid colonel its i know col said a crybbe matter now standing on the platform with its table and two empty chairs alex addressed the assembly quite cordially good evening some of you know me some of you dont some of you might have seen me around peters my name for what its worth i appear to be the only living priest in town and you i take it are what one might call the backbone of crybbe he looked carefully at his audience perhaps three hundred of them men outnumbering women by about two to one the majority of them older people over fifty anyway such was the ageratio in crybbe the scene reminded him of the works of some painter was it stanley spencer those airraid shelter scenes people like halfwrapped mummies strange sort of evening alex said i expect youve noticed that otherwise what are you all doing penned up like sheep overnight in the market hmm no response nobody did anything to dispel the general ambience of the stockroom as a mortuary the bluefaced refrigerated dead what would it take to move these people and more to the point had he got it as alex stood there and watched them he saw himself as they must be seeing him bumbling old cleric woolly haired and woolly headed mind known to be increasingly on the blink but hed made a deal if only with his inner self he thought about the possible implications of the deal and a suitably dramatic quote occurred to him from the book of revelations his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire right alex said stoking the fire summoning it into his eyes if thats the way you want it colonel would you ask murray to step inside huh col croston glanced sharply at alex who merely nodded oh col said and walked out alex said bluntly i understand max goff was slaughtered like a pig in here tonight some of the women looked away nobody spoke alex let the silence simmer for over a minute observing finally you seem to have thrown the body out out of sight out of mind i suppose didnt know the chap myself however i did know this poor boy col croston had returned with his arms full paul gwatkin and bill davies didnt try to stop him but neither seemed anxious to help him with his bloody burden hes sorry he was late alex said he was obliged to stop on the way to get murdered col carried the corpse around the table where the blotter was brown with dried blood and curling alex said you remember murray young murray beech col dropped the body like a sack of coal and it rolled over once on to its back a stiff bloody hand coming to rest against the knee of a woman on the front row mrs byford clerk to crybbe town council she did not move except to shrink back in her chair as if retracting the essential mrs byford so that the dead hand was only touching her shell thats right alex said pretend hes not there but then you never noticed he was here did you he was only another vicar from off and now hes dead but ill tell you one thing he isnt as bloody dead as any of you he saw murray beechs body in the light for the first time the front of his black clerical shirt had been slashed neatly from neck to navel the shirt was soaked and stiff mrs byford delicately removed the hand from her knee her mouth beginning to quiver murrays own mouth was widened from one corner like a clowns it continued almost to an ear or what remained of an ear alex lowered himself into the chair where another body had slumped it was sticky he looked down into a blotter thick with blood and lumps and clots talk to me he said tell me about what happened four hundred years ago when your ancestors went out to lynch this chap wort what had they got in the way of incentive that you havent hmm he noticed the police sergeant wiley near the back in full if disarranged uniform not exactly rushing to open an investigation into the killing of murray beech col croston back in the chairmans chair next to alex called out no need for inhibition consider the issue thrown open to the floor well come on said alex in exasperation whos the old bat in the front row trying to avoid murray what about you mrs byford isnt it mrs byford spoke with brittle clarity like an icicle cracking tell this rude old gentleman colonel that we have no intention of moving from yere nor of entering into any discussion on the subject alex said did you have much to do with murray mrs byford your granddaughter did she sought his assistance as a priest she wanted him to exorcise a ghost from your house no mrs byford pushed her chair back into the pair of knees behind her and stood up murrays hand appeared to reach for her ankle and she gave a shrill cry its lies poor old murray was quite thrown at first alex said not every day youre recruited to cast out a malevolent spirit anyhow he came to me for advice and i said go along and play it by ear old boy nothing lost so off he goes to the old police house dont suppose you were around at the time were you alex could see a number of people beginning to look worried not least wynford wiley the copper and where do you think he found the evil spirit mrs byford e wasnt evil wynford spluttered out e was where do you think he found this malignant entity her back arched stop this you go no right to you know dont you keep calm woman an old man said from behind you got to keep calm isnt it alex stood up he found the evil mrs byford he found it in her eyes ironic isnt it mrs byfords hands halfclawed began to tremble she stumbled into the aisle and stood there shaking now alex sat down no please mrs byford im not trying to bully you look sit in one of the empty chairs on the other side thank you right now did that gentleman mention the necessity of keeping calm keeping the low profile avoiding direct confrontation lets discuss this but very quickly please times running out ah mr davies what can we do the butcher bill davies had left his post by the door and was approaching the platform a big man with a sparse sprinkling of grey curls we got lo live yere isnt it the mayor said paul gwatkin wheres the mayor hes probably dead col croston said flatly you dont know that said wynford wiley and the church is on fire col said dont suppose you know that aye we know that the clerks husband little billy byford said tiredly and sighed his wife gave him a glance like a harpoon these yere hippy types said bill davies this goff if they adnt arrived with their experimentin and their meddlin they think its a wonderful game see they think the countrysides a great big adventure playground do what you like long as you shuts the odd gate they wouldnt think of strollin across their motorways climbin all over their power stations oh no you andles all that with care and if you dont know nothin about it you stays out of it sit down mr davies said mrs byford theres nothing to explain im gonna say this nettie citytype dangers is something they takes for granted never questions it but they never thinks there might be risks in the country too as they dont understand well we dont understand em properly neither but at least at least we knows theres risks the inference being said col that crybbe is an area with a particularly high riskfactor you live yere said bill davies you learn theres things you can do and things you cant do maybe some peoples more careful than others maybe some people takes it more serious like but thats same as with a lot o things anywhere you goes isnt it mr davies we dont have to explain nothing mrs byford said bill davies ignored her and its not like you can get elp neither cant write to your mp about it can you you as to live with it just like your parents and your grandparents and you accepts the constraints like the butcher sat down two seats away from mrs byford to the left of the central aisle and crossed his legs defiantly thank you said col im very grateful to you bill canon yes indeed i think mr davies has put his finger on it i can understand entirely that there are certain prevailing phenomena in this particular town which the residents have long felt unable to discuss with outsiders problems which i suspect first er materialized during the reign of james i when anyone found displaying an interest in matters of a a shall we say supernormal nature was in serious danger of being strung up for witchcraft he looked down at the bloodspattered blotter saw that nothing at all had changed outside the church was burning and a gullible crowd was suspended in the thrall of something even the devilfearing james i would have been hardpressed to envisage and one can see said alex how this quiteunderstandable reticence would given the comparative remoteness of the town become in tune more or less endemic yes i can understand why its been allowed to fester but by god alex stood up his hands either side of the bloodstained blotter summoning the flames if you dont take some action tonight youll regret it for the rest of your small little lives chapter xx the box was making a strange noise a rolling creaking sound suggesting that the item inside had been dislodged from whatever secured it open it not a chance joe powys said aloud attempting to sound confident in control but for whose benefit the box lay in the centre of the courtyard the lamp on topo f it its beam directed at the court no more the derelict warehouse the disused factory without echoes of laughter or the residue of sorrow periodically powys would look up towards the eaves but there were no flickerings any more no ignition sparks the court was fully alive now and crackling and hissing at him open it the appalling temptation of course was to break open the box to confirm that it did in fact contain what he suspected which was the mummified head of sir michael wort or at least a head but powys was scared to look into the eyes of black michael even if only the sockets remained there was too much heavy magic here andy the shaman the heir was projecting himself at will along the spirit path able to manifest a disembodied presence in the tump and probably elsewhere while his physical body was where the old leyline which progressed from the tump to the square and beyond had been reopened a dark artery to the heart of crybbe reopened for the ancestor black michael whose head now lay in an oak box at powyss feet the head was a crucial part of the process and as long as he had the head he was part of it too until the pressure became unbearable so what am i going to do with it he thought as hed thought so many times i could out of this situation i could leave the box lying on the ground leap into the car and accelerate back into what passes for the real world i could simply stop believing in all of this because if you dont invite it into your life it simply doesnt occur blessed are the sceptics for they shall they shall die with a broken neck on a convenient rubbish heap powys closed his eyes to ambush renegade tears you daft bastard this is crybbe where normal rules dont apply where once youre in the game you have to go on playing because fay is down there in that sick little town with jean wendle and probably andy trow and the twisted essence of something four centuries old at the door and fay could go snap like rachel like rose but you wouldnt die powys youd go on living with the knowledge of what you failed prevent even though you were fully aware at last of what was happening because you were scared and because you thought it expedient at this stage of the game to take the sceptics way out all right all right ill play deal me in he tried to envisage the layout the tump was the head the church was the centre of the breast the town square was the solar plexus and the cock was the genitalia he realized he must be standing on black michaels throat the throat chakra influencing the nervous system controlling stress anxiety there came another noise from the box like the head rolling from side to side and his eyes were wrenched open the breath catching in his chest like a stone ive got to get rid of it he snatched the lamp bent down and examined the box it was bound not with iron as hed imagined but with strips of lead it occurred to him that it was probably not locked at all and all he had to do was raise the lid and no he sprang to his feet and backed away god help me ive got the fourhundredoddyearold head of michael wort in a box and i dont know what the hell to do with it the court wanted it he could tell that the court squatted in its hollow with the vengeful violated tump bunched over it glowering the court throbbed with an ancient need and powys knew that it wanted him inside it so that it could digest his spirit and spit him out like poor rachel like tiddles the mummified cat which had been stuck for centuries a tiny constricting hairball in its throat the throat had been blocked the court had coughed and the blockage had come out of the mouth the open mouth was the prospect chamber what he had to do the clear bright certainty of it went through him like a fork of cold and jagged lightning i cant he told the night i dont have the strength i dont have the courage i cant it still made no sense of course according to what was accepted as normal but it answered to the logic of the place it extended the rules of the game to put him in with a chance what he had to do was enter the court and carry the box up the stone stairs to the prospect chamber and then he had to stand in the opening lift the box above his head and cast it out into the night so that it fell on to the rubbish heap and smashed symbolically to pieces a ritualistic shamanistic act which would sever the connection between black michael and the court leave a meaningful crater a great pothole in the middle of the spirit path and well he knew that the ritual would be more perfect more complete if he went out of the prospect chamber too his arms wrapped around the box sacrifice always more energy with a sacrifice perhaps also because he was hijacking andys ritual hed be releasing and recycling the energy created by roses fall and rachels he stood with one foot on the box and thought about this it was a complete load of new age crap but if he believed in it it might work if he was prepared to give up his life hed be creating so much energy that christ he kicked the box along the cobbles god save us new age philosophy energy the life force mothersodding earth not got the bottle for it joe powys gave the court a baleful glare yeah ok you can play it that way if you want he told the house you can spit me out like rachel and tiddles the cat but when i go he goes he picked up the box put the lamp on top and followed the beam towards the main door it would he knew open alex simply walked out of the town hall down the steps and the few yards to the end of the street leading to the square he glanced behind him once at the blue light from a high window listened to the noise of the generator from the basement looked above the buildings to the orange glow in the sky from the church reality or as much of it as a bumbling old cleric might perceive he thought about the deal if he walked into the square he doubted hed get out of it so easily if at all this would be it it was like one of those experiments you did at school in your very first physics lesson fay couldnt recall the technicalities of it but it was all to do with making your own electricity and you did something like turning a handle really couldnt remember the details never any good at science and this little bulb lit up just faintly at first but the faster you did whatever it was you did the brighter the bulb became the more sustained was the light there they all were moving round in the circle backwards anti clockwise the thin golden ring or not gold it was yellow the yellow of of and there it was in the centre of the circle new age schoolchildren dancing around a lamppost and making the lamp light up like the bulb in the physics lesson through the power they were helping to generate faster please the teacher saying in that wonderfully smooth voice like an old cello and they were able without much effort to move faster fay beginning to tingle with the excitement of what they were doing making light an incandescent blob in the air yellow and fuzzed at the edges but filaments of hard white light forming at the centre extending out like branches or veins bloodvessels light vessels the whole thing pulsing with it hilary ivory beginning to quiver and moan as if reaching orgasm larry ember on the other side giggling wildly never heard a cameraman giggle before dour bastards in general this must really be something coming all my life she heard a woman probably that loopy jopson woman cry in ecstasy all my life ive waited for you michael a man the teacher said simply that nothing more and a woman said yes michael the archangel michael slayer of dragons no fay thought confused not him thats wrong but what did it matter couldnt very well contradict them could she not all of them everybody shouting in unison now a great chant michael michael michael michael the being of light was responding to the summons the filaments forming into a complexity of vibrating muscles pipes and organs rippling into arms and legs and between the legs bloody hell fay thought realizing she was chanting too michael michael the bells erupted again a huge joyful clangour cracking the night into splinters the sound of bells in a blazing church the rational explanation col croston thought was that the flames had been funnelled into the tower creating a huge jet which exploded into the belfry he stood in the townhall doorway and peered into the street above him the night sky was frying if jimmy preece was indeed dead this made him the first citizen of crybbe an auspicious start to his year of office at this rate hed be mayor of a burnedout ghosttown before morning he looked for alex but the end of the street still dropped off the edge of the world and alex was gone and cols sorrowful feeling was that he would never see the old man again chapter xxi before the last and only time hed been inside crybbe court it had been very much henrys dead place now it was repellently alive it had been cold and dry now it was warm and moist and going into it was disturbingly perversely sexual the court was a very old woman grotesquely aroused and she wanted him the main door had not been locked he ventured quietly in the box under his arm stone floor low ceiling and slits of windows set high in the walls and the walls leaked joe powys ran a cautious finger along the stone and found it warm and slimy under the light he saw dead insects on the walls all of them quite recently dead not husks moths flies and bluebottles trapped in a layer of fat it smelled like fat or tallow maybe grease from candles made of animal fat crybbe court was alive and sweating he moved towards the stone stairs thinking inevitably of rachel what had it taken to make her so hot and feverish and desperate to get out of here that but you dont know what happened you dont know though youll soon find out as you retrace her steps up these stone steps butchers shop slippery now like the walls coming to the first floor the big family livingroom and the bedchambers off in one of these fay had told him tiddles the mummified cat had slept most recently in a chest that was not very old tiddles had come down from the rafters but had never left the house presumably until she and rachel had been hurled out of the prospect chamber fay picturing her standing in the field overlooking crybbe the blue cagoule streaming from under her arm her rainbow eye watering in the wind it made him so sad this image that he had a wild urge to dump the box and race out of the court filthy clammy raddled old hag and run back to crybbe to find fay and hold her even if they only had a few minutes before before whatever was to happen happened he wore his sense of foreboding like the black bag over a condemned mans head yet he was still halfamazed at what he was planning to do black comedy a bizarre piece of alternative theatre verdict took his own life while the balance of mind was disturbed the voice of the police inspector hughes landed in his head are you sure he didnt say anything to you mrs morrison by way of suicide note so to speak or did he assume do you think that his method of taking his own life would be selfexplanatory well he was a crank wasnt he you only had to read his book he wondered if the day would ever come when an inquest would concede that the balance of mind might be affected by prevailing psychic conditions bloody new age crap there was a stench of rancid fat he felt sick it would be good in a way to be out in the fresh air as col turned the corner of the back street linking the town hall with the churchyard there was an enormous splintering roar and a belch that shook the ground and then as if massive furnace doors had been flung wide huge muscular arms of flame reached out for the heavens go easy col said i think the church roofs collapsed there were about twenty men with him the youngest and strongest of them bill davies the butcher was there and the three burly gwatkin brothers god preserve us one of them said and then turned away embarrassed his face already reddened in the glare from the church its down to you now col said he hoped to god the stone walls of the church would contain the fire so that it wouldnt spread into the town but the heat was unbelievable anything could happen crackling splinters in fact great burning brands were being thrown off and every so often thered be a chaotic clanging of the bells what were going to do col said all over the churchyard youll see pieces of wood ablaze i want six of you to get the ones you can handle at one end and bring them out this is bloody dangerous so be damned careful but weve got to have light where were going why cant we just go ome and get torches a young lad of seventeen or eighteen said do as he says boy bill davies grunted nobody goes out of this street you step into that square youll wish youd stayed and burned as a handful of men climbed over the churchyard wall bill davies took col aside im not wrong am i colonel look be a good chap tell me colonel i ave to know see is it in that square oh hell is it the year over there or is it an illusion is this town living an illusion do you know joe powys went up the stairs past a small landing with an oak door four inches thick which was open revealing the stairs up to the attic walking up the steps towards the deathchamber of michael wort with what he believed to be the head of michael wort in a wooden box under his arm people like me would no more come up here alone he remembered thinking than pop into a working abattoir to shelter from the rain but you arent alone are you the box was heavy trying to avoid touching the walls because the stone was slick with something that felt like mucous suspecting that if he switched off the lamp it would glow on the stones luminous and so he came at last to the alcove leading to the prospect chamber when he put down the box to open the door he felt rachel was standing at his side remembering being here with her how two wafers of light from holes in the roof had crossed just above her head and hed recalled her standing by the window of the room at the cock naked and pale and ethereal now he could almost see her calm silvery shade theyd go hand in hand into the prospect chamber this is the only part of the house i really like and together theyd take the head of michael wort back into the night he turned the metal handle and put his shoulder to the old oak door new age heaven blissful blissful blissful i want to touch him the woman next to her cried i want to bathe in him michael michael michael michael the being of light lifted his head and spread his arms to embrace his town bright people were gathering around him both sexes shimmering all shapes and sizes from the large smiling man in the incandescent white suit to the tiny little lady mouth opening in delight to reveal small sharp white teeth like a fishs like like couldnt remember but she didnt want to remember shed never fell so warm and yet so free she saw herself soaring above crybbe and the town was decked out in ribbons of soft coloured light anchored by icebright luminescent standing stones floating over square she saw the old buildings in a lambent christmascard glow but some of them were not so old their timbers looked sturdy and neatly dovetailed especially the inn which had a simple strength and a sign with a large rough beast upon it and indeed there were farm animals in the square around a cart with wooden wheels and sacks of grain on it there was a cow three horses a pig and a dog black and white like like couldnt remember fay who was fay listen to me yes she sang yes yes yes im listening but she had no intention of listening this was the wrong voice it didnt sound like a cello it sounded old and frail an ancient banjo cracked and out of tune she laughed everyone was laughing new age heaven fay alex said into her ear listen to me please yes yes yes she sang but youll have to come with me can you float can you float like me she wasnt floating she was part of a group of thirty or forty people hands linked slowly and gloomily moving around in an untidy irregular circle alex could see most of them now in the spluttering amber of the blazing church in the centre of the square where in many towns there was a cross a man stood a tall man stripped to the waist he had dark closeshaven hair and a black beard his eyes were closed he was sweating his arms hung by his side but slightly apart from his body the palms of his hands upturned the ragged circle of people moved around him anticlockwise the old buildings seemed to be leaning out of their foundations and into the firelight like starved tramps at a brazier the buildings had never looked more decrepit or as close to collapse similarly the people alex followed fay around walking behind her peering into the faces of the men and women in the circle horrified at how weak and drained they looked some of them obviously ill on one side of his daughter was a stocky man with a sagging belly and one eye badly bloodshot he was moaning faintly and saliva dribbled down his chin fays other hand lay limply in a flabby hand full of rings obviously not very expensive ones for they looked tarnished now and the joints of the fingers were swollen around them the womans hair was in wild white corkscrews her lips were drawn back into a frozen rictus she was breathing in spurts through clenched teeth diametrically opposite this woman alex saw fays exhusband guy morrison his blond hair mattflat exposing a large white bald patch his mouth downturned forming pouches of slack skin from his cheek to his onceproud jawline next to him a fat girl was sobbing inconsolably to herself as she moved sluggishly over the cobbles on the other side of this girl a thin woman with shorn hair was breathing with difficulty in snorts blood sparkling on her upper lip and around her nose from which a small ring hung messily from a torn flap of skin and every time she took a breath part of the ring disappeared into a nostril she didnt seem aware of her physical distress nor did any of the others fay alex whispered fays skin was taut and pallid her green eyes frozen open her lips stretched in anguish which made the words issuing from them all the more pathetic flying away high into the light cant keep up with me can you he didnt even try he stood in the shadows and watched her drift away hed had to stop himself from pulling her out of the circle he had the awful feeling that he would simply detach her body that her mind would remain in the ring and she would never get it back would be a vegetable which was the very worst thing of all alex knew this he stood and watched her for two more circuits of the square a lurid flaring of amber from the dying church picked out that woman from the gallery ugly blue bruises around her throat dried vomit on her chin coughing weakly couldnt see her husband very gently he separated fays fingers from those of the woman next to her and slipped her small cold right hand into his left with his right hand he found the damp fleshy finger of the whitehaired woman and so alex slipped into the circle and began to move slowly round he realized at once that hed made a terrible terrible mistake his legs began to feel heavy and cumbersome at first he felt as if hed stepped into a pair of wellingtons several sizes too big and was wading in them through thick muddy water and then the weight spread up to his thighs he was in the middle of a river in cumbersome waders and finally it was as though both legs had been set in concrete how he managed to move he didnt know but he kept on at funereal pace his arms feeling limp as though the blood were draining away into the other hands his life energy passed along the chain progressive torpor this was how it happened initiation ceremony they were always saying the newcomers how much they wanted to fit in become part of the community now here they were all these bright clever new age folk achieving overnight what some people waited years to attain all moving at last to the rhythm of crybbe part nine in actuality of course dowsing as an activity is no more spiritual than riding a bicycle spirituality is in the person compared to this rich matrix of mystery the new age energy ideas are conceptually bankrupt paul devereux earth memory the holistic earth mysteries approach to decoding ancient sacred sites chapter the digger was crunching through the wood like a rhino on heat gomer parry at the wheel grinning like a maniac dead cigarette burned to the filter clenched between his teeth minnie seagrove holding on to the makeshift passenger seat which didnt have a working safetybelt a threelegged black and white dog balancing just about on her knee and glaring out of the window barking away this had all come about after they arrived back at minnies bungalow and gomer spotting the flames coming out of the town reckoning it had to be the church raced to minnies phone to summon the fire brigade and found the bloody old phone lines were down or something anyway the phone was off and so was the one in the kiosk by the layby something bloody funny yere theyd climbed back into the digger gomer heading back towards the town foot down headlight blasting at the night and then oh my god gomer look out bloody great wall of metal minnies hands over her eyes the dog going berserk and gomer flattening the brakes and damn near wrenching the ole wheel out of its socket flaming great articulated lorry had jackknifed across the road at precisely the spot gomer himself went adrift earlier on was this a coincidence like hell it was no sign of the driver no blood in the cab couldnt have been hurt mustve buggered off for help so gomer did this dynamite threepoint turn and they were thundering off again gonna find out what the bloody ells afoot ang on to your knickers sorry minnie but ive ad enough o this mystery you can push gomer parry just so far see where are we going gomer back way into crybbe tradesmans entrance never done it all the way on four wheels before and gomer lit up a ciggy onehanded and spun the digger off the road and into the field keeping well away from the tump this lime although he could tell itd taken a hammering tonight that ole thing not got the power it had see just massive great lump of ole horseshit now sorry minnie so it was round the back of the tump back to the court and into the wood ole bridle path see but we cant get through here gomer minnie no doubt wondering by this time why he didnt drop her off home but it wasnt safe for a woman alone tonight besides he liked an audience did gomer parry not been the same since the wife snuffed it if a orse can make it up here he told minnie gomer parry can do it in the best oneoff customized digger ever built so now the digger was flattening bushes either side and ripping off branches five minutes gets us out the back bottom end of the churchyard and we can see what the score is fuckin nora what the ells this for the second time in ten minutes gomer was on top of the brakes and minnie was pulling her nails off on the lumpy vinyl passenger seat the headlightd found a bloody great stone right in the middle of the flaming road who the put that thing there gomer was out of his cab sizing up the stone seven or eight feet tall but not too thick arnold out of the cab too standing next to gomer barking at the stone looking up at gomer barking at the stone again what you reckon to this then boy woof arnold went smart dog dead right boy said gomer looking up at the bright orange sky like an early dawn cept for the sparks dead right back in the cab gomer lit up another ciggy grinned like a potentially violent mental patient and started to lower the big shovel and fay soaring above the town far above the opalescent stones and the soft pastel ribbons felt a momentary lurch of nausea as the tallest the brightest of the stones shivered its radiance shaken its magnesiumwhite core dying back to a feebly palpitating yellow the yellow of fay the yellow of please f the yellow of disease the yellow of embalming fluid the yellow of pus from an infected wound the yellow of grace legge fay dad she turned and saw his face and his skin looked as white as his hair and his beard she saw him against what looked like the flames of hell and his old blue eyes were full of so much mute pleading that they were almost shouting down this sick dreadful chant michael michael michael michael screamed the poor stricken gullible bastards in the circle and she could see them now she could see them she was gripping her dads hand and she could see them all in the light of hell and hell was what they looked like hell also was what fay felt like her lips were like parchment and when she tried to wet them she found her tongue was a lump of asbestos michael she wanted to say its michael wort but she couldnt even make it to a croak her eyes found the centre of the square where the being of light was formed pulsing with vibrant liquid life energy platinumwhite pulsing with energy all right their energy but it was the very darkest thing she had ever seen in all of her life andy boultontrow a tall bearded man just an ordinary man once had been fitted for a black halo it shimmered around him like the sun in a monochrome photo negative the halo was the shadow of black michael there were pinpoints of it in trows eyes which had flicked open and were looking steadily curiously into hers she put all the strength she had into squeezing her dads hand it felt as cold as her own trow did not move his gaze like black velvet playing with her who are you the eyes were asking have we met the complete charismatic black evangelist somehow fay had milked a little strength from her poor father enough to observe and to make simple deductions youve had us all going around your bottle stone havent you children of the new age follow anybody wont they look at them now look at the jopson woman led by the ring in her nose and then gentle tweak you tear through her flesh and she doesnt know or care look at bloody guy show him his own reflection in a mirror shaped like a tv screen and watch him slash his wrists look at graham jarrett away in the ultimate hypnotic trance lost his toupee and his nose needs wiping look at them look at what youve done arteriosclerotic dementia you have good days sometimes you have two or three good days together and you realize what a hopeless old bugger you were the other day when the lift failed to make it to the penthouse and then one night along comes a very cunning lady with an amorphous chinese blob on a lead which as you thought does not exist but why else would she be trailing a lead and all the time youre with her youre fine youre wonderful youre on top of the situation until it becomes apparent that the lady is a prominent member of the opposition planning a startling little coup in this deadend backwater where surely nothing that happens can be of any significance in the great scheme of things but old habits die hard once a priest yes all right guv i confess ive never exactly been up there with mother theresa and pope john the twentythird ive cut a few corners ive coveted my neighbours wife ok several wives of several neighbours and it wouldnt be half so bad if it had only stopped at the coveting stage i was weak i used to think it was ok as long as you left the choirboys alone but i was never attracted to choirboys anyway obnoxious little sods here boss scrap of prayer for you thisll bring back a few memories oh god merciful father that despisest not the sighing of a contrite heart got the message im sorry i really am sorry listen i know about the sins of the fathers i know all about that but not fay please look at her what has she ever done to you thing is look dont take this the wrong way but no god of mine ever took it out on the kids thats more his gods style can you see him there he represents everything youre supposed to abhor and hes winning damn it the bastards winning ok heres another bit how much do you want for christs sake listen this this is the essence of it lighten our darkness we beseech thee o lord and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night lighten our darkness geddit come on guvnor we had a deal the stone actually broke cracked in two split off a couple of feet from the base just as gomer was getting underneath raised the shovel to ground level to have another go and gave it a bit of a clonk accidentallike and off it came like a thumb in a baconslicer gomer backed up smartish but luckily the big bugger fell the other way straight flat across the road whump teach me to rush ihe job minnie ang on to your er hat slipping down to low gear he drove right over the thing bit of a bump but not much worse than one of them ramps they call a sleeping policeman a big fat sleeping policeman gomer burst out laughing call it wynford wiley there were big fat tyremarks across the middle of the stone gomer accelerated past keepers cottage with a disparaging sideways glance that could do with knocking down too there was the merest tremor in trows gaze enough for her to pull her eyes away turned to her father and found that hilary ivory on the other side had also turned her face with faint confusion towards the old man in the kate bush tshirt alex tried to smile he couldnt speak hilary looked at fay her eyes troubled she didnt understand the first step to recovery the moment when quite suddenly you dont understand but alexs hands were warm dad a deep warmth seeped into fays right hand and rippled up her arm and into her breast she could feel her heart drumming alexs eyes were vibrantly blue they made the fire in the sky look cheap and lurid he turned his head towards hilary lvory and she started to smile like people smile when theyre coming out of anaesthetic alexs hand tightened around fays fay grinned you old bugger she said quite easily on the other side larry ember recipient of the warmth from her own left hand demanded gruffly what the bleedin hells this alexs lips were white almost as white as the beard around them first they tried to smile then they were trying to shape a word c his hands hot now but his lips were white dad fay squeezed his hand almost too hot to hold she felt strong enough to risk a glance to the centre of the square where trow was no longer still but moving within his own darkness squirming trow screamed once michael the cello grotesquely offkey alex found his word colonel he said mildly and the piercing blue faded from his eyes clouds were in them now he dropped hilarys hand held on to fays for an extra moment and then let that go too there was a gap now between fay and her dad a clear gap in the circle and the backcloth the screen of false reality was torn away and the flames in the sky were no longer phantasmal but a source of savage heat and acrid fumes now col crostons crisp voice and the crybbe hordes poured through the gap bearing their flaming torches farmers in tweed trousers and sleeveless bodywarmers over their vests bill davies incongruously clad in his butchers apron wynford wiley ludicrously wielding his truncheon faces shed seen on the streets owre you owre you now hard with determination below the blazing brands the circle in disarray lights appearing in windows from somewhere in the innards of the cock the sound of a generator starting up col croston bringing up the rear scanning the square over there thats the man the sheriff dont let him the sheriff right fav was screaming the sheriff hes in the cen but she couldnt in fact see the man they were looking for andy boultontrow had gone from the square hes taken his darkness back into the night larry camera guy was in a mess hed lost his jacket lost his cool lost his hair larry we have to get this piss off guy larry ember shouted happily from somewhere fay found she was giggling hysterics absurd dad alex managed a smile dad we did it you did it alex touched her arm stumbled sat down quietly on the cobbles fay went down beside him taking his hand which was not so hot any more not very hot at all the blue in his eyes had drifted away far away gently and discreetly alex slid over on to his side he was breading just hilary ivory crouched down next to fay is he ok i used be a a nurse well sort of alternative nurse really fay didnt reply she pulled off her cotton top rolled it into a ball slid it between alexs head and the cobbles dad softly fairly sure he couldnt hear her she picked up his hand very little warmth remained alexs lips moved and she put an ear to his mouth one word came out intact deal he said alexs breathing ended almost imperceptibly fay sat for a long time on the cobbles holding her fathers cooling hand under the hot red sky chapter ii a single candle burned in the attic at crybbe court it was two inches thick and sat in a blackened pewter candleholder with a tray laid on the topmost stone step it was a tallow candle and it stank it filled the roofspace with a pungent organic stench it reeked somehow of death or perhaps this was because of the wan and waxy aura it gave to the rope the old frayed rope which had hung from the central joist in the attic was gone its replacement was probably just as old but was oily and strong an inch thick it dangled four feet from the apex of the roof and at the end was a noose a very traditional hangmans noose secured with ten rings of rope it was into this noose that andy boultontrow fitted his head he had it would emerge studied hanging the original shortdrop method with the rope only a few feet long and the condemned persons feet almost touching the ground resulted in a rather prolonged death by slow strangulation whereas the longdrop system introduced in britain in the late nineteenth century by which the subject fell about ten feet perhaps through a trapdoor brought about a swifter and more merciful death by fracturing neck vertebrae in the sixteenth century it appeared sir michael wort had experimented with both techniques and others besides a trapdoor had been constructed in the attic floor originally to dispose of bodies after execution by dropping them into a narrow windowless welllike chamber directly underneath in later years more squeamish owners of the house had boarded over the trapdoor space but the floor remained weak at this point the boards had rotted there were cracks when andy boultontrow stood on the beam nearly two feet thick from which the executees and sir michael himself had taken a final step he could see a few jagged black holes below his feet first he had taken off his shoes and his trousers so that he stood naked now in the candlelight with the noose loosely around his neck for the purposes of magical projection a modification of the shortdrop method was the most appropriate that it had worked to a significant extent for michael had been amply demonstrated to andy tonight andy who had spent twice as many years as michael in study and preparation was warm after his sprint through the wood still angry at the damage to the stone and the debacle in the square but the night was churning with chaos and out of chaos there was little time to waste he was hot inside with excitement and anticipation to make sure everything was still in working order he and humble had once hanged a fisherman humble had chanced upon casting alone into the upper reaches of the river it had not really been necessary but humble had enjoyed it just as humble would enjoy watching andy hang so why wasnt he here perhaps he was humble could be quite discreet andy put both hands behind his head and tightened and adjusted the noose under his chin it was so easy to make a mistake he stood on the floorjoist in the candlelight and began to visualize to bring himself to the necessary state of arousal he visualized the woman whod looked at him across the square telling him with her eyes that she was slipping out of the enchantment andy smiled he would return for her one night quite soon perhaps a small wind drifted through the holes in the slates there was no wind tonight good evening michael andy said again he closed his eyes and michael was within him once more a now familiar sensation in his solar plexus he felt a stillness which was also a stirring and there was the familiar small tug at the base of his spine in time the walls of the court evaporated and he saw the town at his feet he held back and the vapours rose within him he felt the blazing chaos that was crybbe the dissolution of barriers the merging of the layers one with another the lower levels open to the higher levels the atmosphere awash with spirit he felt his destination and when the time was right he stepped lightly from the beam there was a bright light a widening carpet of light and something rolling along it towards him this was the first thing he was really aware of after he stepped into space and the noose tightened above his adams apple there was no pain only darkness and then the carpet of night and the thing that was rolling rolling very slowly at first but its momentum was increasing and then he was staring into the face of michael wort the eyes had gone the lips had gone there was some hair but not much most of the beard had disappeared there were gaps in the ghastly brown and yellow grin few people in michaels day had kept their teeth beyond middle age michael he said eventually the noose was still around his neck but it was slack there was no pain in speech behind the lamp he saw a pair of sneakers and legs in muddy jeans he came with me joe powys said he couldnt manage the steps on his own andy had smashed through the floor spinning and twisting hed screamed once but it had sounded more like triumph than terror suggesting he was unaware of anything having gone wrong well you wouldnt be if this was the first time youd hanged yourself the way he was lying in the centre of the windowless stone chamber was bent unnatural powys said with little concern can you move i dont know andy said his feelings sheathed what did you do i saved your life thanks andy said you fucker powys said nothing he was shaking humble andy said after a while he was supposed to have killed you yeah he will cant see it powys said somehow he had the feeling both of them were in shock he put a hand out to the wall it was dry again and dusty the court was a dead place again the room was narrow enough for there to be an enforced intimacy and yet there was a distance too because the court was dead i nearly killed myself though he said still appalled enough at what might have happened to want to hear himself talk about it seems absolutely bloody insane when i look back but i had this idea that the only way i could straighten this out was to take the head up to the prospect chamber and hurl us both out i couldnt have been thinking straight well obviously but you dont do you in these situations and what stopped you andy asked him from killing yourself powys smiled weakly couldnt get in the door in the alcove was locked and there was a sign that said danger keep out the final bitter irony rachel had saved his life hed stood outside the door on the greasy stairs and felt her there again cool and silvery you really can do better than this jm so then i saw the light in the attic thought maybe you were up there but there was only one rope hate nooses went back outside and broke into the stableblock through window with a brick i pinched a bread knife brought it up to the attic and sawed through most of the rope until it was just hanging together by a few threads where id cut it i covered it up with the coils of the noose he saw that andy was thinking very hard the muscles in his face working i figured it out powys said it came clear when i saw the noose you were going to do he pointed a foot at the head what he did on the fourhundredth anniversary of his death i couldnt believe it at first i cant understand that level of obsession of course you cant andy glanced up at him eyes heavy with contempt you puny little cunt were talking sex magic arent we i was once at a signing session for golden land some regional book fair and one of the other writers there was this retired pathologist he said apropos of something that a remarkable number of hangings which look like suicide are actually accidents blokes or teenage kids in a lot of cases trying for this uniquely mindblowing sexual buzz youre supposed to get from hanging by the neck like when the rope jerks you jerk off down there too that it andy said nothing powys could see him trying surreptitiously to move different muscles and with sex magic you use the build up of sexual tension to harden and focus your will and then at the moment of orgasm whoosh max goff used to play about with it who taught him you andy was stretching his neck easing it from side to side sex and death hell of a powerful combination this was how black michael pro dont call him that andy snapped this was how sir michael wort bloody hell joe powys always does what hes told this was how black fucking michael projected himself into crybbe fused his spirit with the spirit of the town so that the town is the man is the town is the andy stopped trying to flex muscles and stared at powys in the electric lamplight and his eyes were so strange that powys wasnt sure any more which of them he was talking to andy or michael but clearly the stage andy had been striving to reach was something that went beyond personalities what did it really mean though powys said was it simply a quest for eternal power some kind of semiphysical immortally you have to fracture the cool he remembered telling himself to damage this guy you have to tip his balance dislodge him from his mental lotus position even lying there with unknown injuries he can maybe still take you unawares or is it powys said casually just the ultimate egotrip getting your end away from beyond the grave he had to look away the blackness from andys eyes came out like iron spikes iron spikes images of rose cruelly speared his own cool and he stared back into the eyes of the thing that had dispassionately manipulated their fate i cant move andy said suddenly the first sign of human panic i cant fucking move joe i cant move my arms or legs im fucking paralysed what i think powys remembered conversations with barry the osteopath his neighbour in the trackways building is your back was broken in the fall you can obviously move your neck what about your shoulders try shrugging your shoulders andys shoulders convulsed there was a sudden sheen of sweat on his body hows your breathing i can breathe in that case powys said slowly and callously youll probably be whats known as a tetraplegic it wont be much fun but no doubt a lot of innocent peoplell be saved a lot of grief by your confinement in stoke mandeville or wherever you wind up youre a worthless piece of shit joe me im shit you couldnt even kill me youre safer like this dead you could be a problem andy turned his head and looked into the eyesockets of black michael as an exercise in mummification powys thought michael had turned out to be rather less impressive than tiddles he said where are the other bits buried why should i tell you that the head naturally was in the tump did you ever go into the tump physically i mean no and the genitals are under the cock walled up somewhere in the cellars id guess somewhere directly beneath that passageway leading to the studio the heart under the church is there a crypt andy didnt reply and who would have buried your bits andy after the hanging humble where is humble occurring to andy perhaps that there might be more wrong than he knew powys said whats happening down in the town whats on fire not my problem andy said youre beyond me he was getting impatient and nervous he was face to face with the man whod smashed his life and all he wanted to do was get out of here call an ambulance anonymously man with a broken back tried to hang himself take him away yet there were things he had to know look i mean for christs sake why is your mother behind this what jean wendle andy laughed it wasnt a very strong laugh suggesting his breathing was not after all unaffected theres no blood link between jean and me shes my spiritual mother if you like its a concept you wouldnt understand which of you is the descendant then listen jean had been studying wort for years right theres almost this kind of michael wort society very exclusive joe not for the new age morons not for the wankers not for the authors of popular trash books not for the the fucking popularisers for the few and now andy began to cough i cant feel that he said i cant feel it in my guts you know and now what the new age he gave a short wheeze of a laugh suddenly this worldwide movement dedicated to throwing esoteric knowledge at the masses max goff millions of pounds to so you hijacked goff well put yeah i hijacked goff he loved me in all kinds of ways to provide the money and the psychic energy you needed to condition crybbe for the second coming of black michael andy grimaced lets get this right there was no second coming we were just completing michaels plan ive had access to all his papers since i was sixteen and to the people who could explain what it all meant and then it got to the stage where i knew more than any of them we were completing the plan patching up the damage john dee did also removing the preece problem and altering the psychic climate stirring things up emotional conflict anger bitterness and confusion we awoke the place andy said from centuries of sleep an unhealthy drugged sort of sleep psychic mogadon self administered ive been planting little time bombs like ok i took a job for a few months teaching art at the local high school i wanted a girl i wanted to take a girl living in crybbe and turn her there was a perfect one i mean this happens joe theres always somebody there who fits and she was entirely perfect i worked with this kid over a year i taught her to paint i mean really paint in your studio in the wood sure i taught her the arts the real arts you give them a little at that age they become quite insatiable she was a natural she can make paintings that become doorways but thats something else also i used her to penetrate the preece clan and in the heart of the crybbe household i well michael and i we created the most wonderful little monster a creature entirely without heart dedicated to destruction in the heart of the preece household again ripe for it warren preece maybe youll meet him everybody ought to meet warren youre a scumbag andy powys said so kill me andy said quietly there was silence in the little welllike cell its ceiling jaggedly open to the attic you still got that bread knife kill me cut my throat its that easy even warren managed to cut max goffs throat tonight with a stanley knife what you didnt know about max he was killed in the public meeting during a power cut it was quite beautiful and perhaps the most beautiful thing of all is that when this is all over whos going to get the blame for this orgy of destruction the new age movement youve got to laugh warren says that got to laugh powys said coldly youre insane your brains have turned to shit ill get you an ambulance no youll kill me joe like i said i wouldnt trust you dead youll kill me look youre squeamish about knives use the rope strangle me no hassle im weak ill go easy itll just look like i hanged myself and the rope broke hed almost forgotten the noose still hanging loosely around andys neck hesitantly he walked across began to remove the rope trying not to touch andys skin just in case youre lying about not being able to move your arms hate you to try and do it yourself andy grinned white teeth exploding through the beard do it no ok something you didnt know rose right poor spiked little rosie and the baby was spiked too yeah your baby joe powys shook his head ive got past that i dont want to kill you for that im happy youre going to be a paraplegic or a tetraplegic i hope your breathing degenerates youll be even safer in an iron lung it wasnt your baby joe his hands froze on the rope id been fucking rose quite intensively for several months ive always found i can get any woman any man i want part of the wort legacy if you will also it was my understanding that come bedtime the great visionary writers creative imagination would tend to go into abeyance and so powys wrenched down the noose jerked andys head back slammed the knot tight into the back of the neck andy grinned up at him even the whites of his eyes were almost black abruptly joe powys let the rope go slack and pulled the noose over andys head ill get you an ambulance he said chapter iii gomer couldnt get near the church least not within thirtyyards not much he could have done though anyway be a long time before that ole place saw another service if ever roof mostly gone windows long gone still some flames plenty of wood in the nave pews and stuff to keep them wellnourished for some hours yet but the worst was over the stone walls would stay up and so would the tower even it wasnt much more than a thick chimney by now buggerall use fetchin the fire brigade gomer concluded burned imself out see he turned to his companion no way of hedging round any of this pardon me askin this but your jonathon was e gonner be cremated anyway like cause if e ad to gonner be buried and he still will be whatevers left theyd come upon jimmy preece sitting on the low part of the churchyard wall watching the fire the digger had crunched out of the wood and there the old feller was hunched up knotted and frazzled like a rotting tree stump sounding like it was gonner take dynorod to clear his lungs and it was clear straight off to gomer that nothing happening tonight would have been a mystery to jimmy preece who done this jim he asked bluntly and dont give me no bull arnold the dog limped over to jimmy preece and stood there watchful jimmy preece leaned down hesitated for several seconds and then patted him arnold wagged his tail only twice and just as hesitant and then plodded off gomer had the feeling this was a very strange thing momentouslike and patting a dog was only pan of what it was about im glad the mayor said to nobody in particularly wish i was dead but im glad couldnt go on see what couldnt youre not a crybbe man gomer is the problem well hell jim im only a few miles up the valley born an bred not a crybbe man jimmy preece said firmly gomer was near fuming who done it jim too late for all that ole crap just bloody spit it out something gave jims grimy face wobbled and what had looked like a smear of thick oil down one side of it gleamed in the firelight and didnt look like oil any more when he opened his mouth the words oozed out in a steady stream same one as run your bulldozer in the wall same one as slashed my face same one as left me to suffocate same one as as done for jonathon the mayor looked away pretended i was dead see didnt take a lot o pretendin wanted to close the ole door to the tower keep the fire out last duty see then i was gonner lie down next to jonathon gomer saw minnie seagrove trying to climb out of the digger and held up a hand to tell her to stay where she was couldnt do it jimmy preece said studying his boots now not got the guts fire too hot ole body sayin get me out o yere ole body allus wins where is e jim gomer had no doubts who they were talking about any more where is e dead thats all i got left to hope for said jimmy preece but i reckon weve long ago given up all rights to hope in crybbe jim gomer feeling sorry for him now town falling apart family collapsing round his ears id like to elp the mayor stared for a long time into the ruined church before he replied you reallv wanner do someing gomer what i said then get rid of all these bloody stones for me do it before morning while every buggers otherwise engaged like whip em out make it like sos they was never yere know what im askin tall order said gomer still only i dont know where they all are seen a couple around like ill tell you where they are every one of em might mean goin on peoples property though isnt it trespassin depends on what you thinks of as other peoples property isnt it course if it was an official council contract like consider it an official council contract said jimmy preece wearily they carried alex into the gallery joe powys and the capable looking guy whod introduced himself as col croston he was quite a weight obviously too much for his heart col said and it was a hell of a big heart how old was he old fay said distantly pushing ninety she sniffed pushed too hard alex had still been lying on the cobbles when powys had stumbled uncertainly into the square seemingly bringing the lights with him the power was back hed walked past wynford wiley and wiley had hardly glanced at him guy morrison had nodded and said nothing hed gone directly to where fay sat close to the steps of the cock guarding her fathers body like a mute terrier i thought you were going to be dead too was all shed said and then had laughed unnaturally he thought and he wasnt entirely surprised they put alex on the only flat raised surface in the gallery the display window under minispotlights he looked peaceful laid out with pictures hed hate that fay mumbled looking peaceful dont suppose col croston said that theres much i can say is there the awful thing is nobody will ever know what he achieved in the last few minutes of his life even i cant begin to explain it and i was there and i know he broke off looking uncharacteristically lost i dont know what i know really im sorry he wont mind fay said it was quick and he never became a vegetable did he that was all he was scared of the geriatric ward he might have done something silly like half a bottle of malt whisky and some pills or a last train to soho or somewhere with a view to departing in the arms of some ageing harlot shes rambling powys thought shes blocking it out her bodys producing natural valium everybody has a breaking point from behind them a small raw cry after letting them in the woman who ran the gallery mrs newsome had remained silently in the doorway leaving powys wondering about the weals and bruising on her throat now she was pointing at a door to the left of the glass counter it was a white door but there were marks and smears all over it now in red col saw the blood flung out an arm to hold everyone back snapped whats behind there he it wasnt easy for her to talk and her voice when it emerged was like a crows herewards workroom anybody in there col called out harshly will get back against the wall and keep very still understood the marks on the door included smeared fingerprints and one whole palmprint mrs newsome have you any idea the act of shaking her head looked as painful as talking col shrugged and nodded everybody keep back then he said and hit the door with a hard flat foot directly under the handle powys wondered why he didnt simply open it shock value he supposed as the door splintered open and col jumped back and went into a crouch oh christ powys stared into the shadowed face of the man hed left fifteen minutes earlier lying crippled in the centre of a little stone chamber remembered thinking as hed run out of the court that andy might not be so badly injured as he appeared that someone practised in yoga and similar disciplines might be able to contort his body sufficiently to simulate a broken spine but powys hadnt gone back hed kept on running all the way to the car and then driven to the phone box on the edge of town which worked thank god ambulance yes and police i suppose and the fire brigade in fact send the lot jesus in force god in heaven col croston was saying dont come in mrs newsome the face powys saw with shortlived relief was only in a very large painting andy dressed in the kind of sombre clothing michael wort might have worn standing by a door meaningfully ajar powys remembered andy talking about the girl the artist who could create doorways with that in mind he didnt look at it again but what was beneath it was worse the unframed canvas was hanging on the wall above a wooden workbench with sections of frames strewn across it and fastened to the side a large woodvice with a metal handle and wooden jaws the vice would hold a piece of soft timber firmly without damaging it unless you really leaned on the handle in which case it would probably squash anything softer than iron powys nearly choked he didnt go in blood was still dripping to the sawdusted floor and there were deltas down the walls made by highpressure crimson jets the dead man was on his knees the jaws of the vice clamped like the hands of a faithhealer either side of this giant red pepper his head once powyss stomach lurched like a car doing an emergency stop col croston emerged expressionless pulling the door closed behind him mrs newsome lets get some air shall we her face began to warp col croston took her arm and steered her into the square powys quickly closed the door behind them and stood with his back to it he didnt want to hear this whats in there fay said from far away a body is it hereward hereward newsome hard to say hes been damaged and i dont know him and if i did it wouldnt help look fay can we warren preece fay said as if this explained everything i expect warren preece did it she took a last disbelieving look at her dad and watched powys flick off the lights she didnt move he took her hand and towed her into the street she went with him easily like one of those toy dogs on wheels from down the hill across the river blue emergency beacons were strobing towards the town with a warble of sirens powys pulled fay into a sidestreet itd be a bit daft to leave town but id rather not be the first in line to make a police statement would you where shall we go my cottage they were in a street of narrow terraces and no lights or your house i suppose it is my house now fay said still sounding completely disconnected unless dads left it to some mysterious totty i mean i dont want it ill take the cats but im not having grace can you give a house to charity he took hold of her upper arms gently fay please she looked at him in mild enquiry her green eyes calm as rock pools at low tide i need you powys said and he hadnt meant to say that fay said do vou from several miles away he nodded they seemed to have been through years of experience together in about two days hed tried to explain briefly what had happened about the tump the head in the box about andy not about jean wendle it wasnt the time what he wanted to tell her now was that something had been resolved he wanted to say reassuring things about her dad but as he reached out for her he felt his body breaking up into awful seismic shivers its not over the words squeezed into his brain like the fragmented skull of the man in the vice its not over chapter iv joe had left the candle behind taken the lamp but brought the candle down from the attic and left it on the floor in the open doorway well out of the reach of andy boultontrow the candlelight would guide the paramedics with their stretcher to the room where andy lay feeling no pain only frigid fury which he knew he had to contain if he were to preserve the legacy andy fancied he could hear distant sirens didnt have much time he picked up the head of michael wort and held it above him oh yes he could use his arms hed lied about that but not his legs he couldnt feel his legs or his lower body only the bubbling acid of rage which he would have to control and channel michael he hissed and his lungs fell very small and also oddly detached as though they were part of some ancillary organism the head of michael won had no eyes his remaining teeth were bare its skin reduced to pickled brown flakes but the skull was hard andy looked deep into the dark sockets and summoned the spirit of the man who four hundred years ago this night had dared to seize the infinite dewch he whispered tyrd i lawr michael he lay back and balancing the head on his solar plexus closed his eyes slowed his breathing began to visualise with an intensity hed never known tyrd i lawr the first police car arrived as they approached the bridge joe didnt want to cross at first in case they were stopped joe was a worrier fay didnt see any problem and the car didnt stop as the police car warbled away she remembered something wheres arnold mrs seagroves looking after him hes well ill tell you some time some time fay looked at him curiously then said to herself my fathers dead every time she thought of something else she was going to make herself repeat this with emphasis what she wanted was to be suddenly overcome with immeasurable grief to sob bitterly throw a wobbly in the street no parents at all any more no barrier in the firing line now stand up fay morrison bang bang bang fay stopped my dads dead yes but that wasnt the whole point this was crybbe in crybbe death wasnt necessarily the worst thing that could happen to you hed looked peaceful under the gallery spotlights with the paintings but was he at peace or was he going to bang around like grace as some kind of psychic detritus was this the destiny of the dead of crybbe to moulder on like the town psychic pollution she said suddenly what can you do about psychic pollution she peered over the bridge parapet down to where the dark water loitered indolently around the stone buttresses nuclear waste you can just about bury she said hundreds of feet underground in immovable granite and maybe after four hundred yearsshe straightened up you know i really underestimated the the toxicity of this town joe was staring at her i need you hed said the words sounding strange probably because nobody had actually said that to her before not her dad not offas dyke radio not even her old boss at radio four certainly not guy we could be good for each other fay no nobody she looked at joe in the light of the streetlamp at the end of the bridge she thought he was a nice guy she could in better circumstances be quite seriously attracted to him he still looked sort of wary though maybe they were right he was saying with their curfew and their crybbe mentality maybe it was the best they could do maybe they just hadnt got the knowledge or the resources to handle it handle what exactly joe i dont know i dont suppose well ever know whatever properties it has to amplify things the old golden land where psychic doorways are easy to open and pretty near impossible to close john dee knew it joe said wort knew it just goes a lot deeper than either of them probably imagined when you think about it the great michael wort was probably just another loony like andy he didnt know what the fuck he was doing either they were approaching the cottage which overlooked the river fay said without thinking about it is that the bottle stone i can hear what thin drone like the hum from a pylon i cant hear anything probably nothing probably he said uncertainly funny isnt it we build up this big theory about black michael and because he was four hundred years ago we think hes some kind of god but he was just another just another pollutant out of the night came a slow clapping of hands ironic essentially mocking applause persuasively argued joe jean wendle said joe powys froze jean wendle was leaning against the cottage wall she was wearing a pink velour tracksuit she looked elegant and relaxed two police cars went rapidly past followed by a fireengine joe froze and fay sensed it wasnt because of the police cars not this time but quite wrong said jean and you know it he didnt say anything michael wort said jean had one of the finest of the renaissance minds scientist philosopher these terms simply cannot encompass michaels abilities we no longer like to use words like magus but thats what he was and the reason he isnt as famous as francis bacon and giordano bruno and even god forbid john dee is that he realized the futility of books and so never wrote any and also of course he lived not in florence or rome or even london but in crybbe fay could see joe trying to say something trying to frame words if he never wrote anything he said how do you know he was so great because said jean like all great teachers he passed on his knowledge through training and through experience another police car went past followed by another fireengine theres a michael wort tradition jean said it began with his own family and then was passed to selected scholars what kind of tradition fascinating stuff jean said all to do with the spirit landscape and the interpenetration of planes knowledge we are only now beginning to approach they called him black michael fay said as they would in crybbe he hanged people he studied death and he utilized his period as high sheriff to pursue that study that was all how bizarre fay thought all hell breaking loose up in the town and here we are three uncommitted observers from off calmly discussing the background as if its a piece of theatre knowledge said jean isnt evil and what about what happened on the square what about the killing of max goff what about you know as i do my dear that there are some very misguided and unbalanced people in crybbe and there always have been people michael was trying to help i didnt know fay said that you knew so much about michael wort you didnt ask said jean her short grey hair shone like a helmet in the street light fay joe said joes trying to tell you to come away jean said he doesnt want to end what he began which is the bottle stone jean said gently come and see the bottle stone no joe backed away he blames it for everything jean said for all his problems all his failed relationships the deaths of his women fay joe sounded suddenly alarmed i dont know what shes doing but dont fall for it i meant to tell you jean and andy are in this together she sent me up to the tump tonight she set me up for humble did he tell you said jean how the bottle stone followed him here yes fay said her throat suddenly quite dry he told me that come and see the bottle stone fay come on fay come along said jean she rose from the wall and picked her way carefully to the gate of the cottage come on fay glanced at joe dont he said quietly please i meant to tell you she turned and followed jean wendle they went around the side of the cottage and across the damp lawn to the piece of land at the rear jean had produced a small torch and they followed its thin beam fay could hear the river idly fumbling at its banks jean stopped she directed the beam a short way across the grass until it found the thick grey base of a standing stone then jean casually flipped the torch up so that they could see the top of the stone it doesnae look awfully like a bottle does it jean said the stone appeared no more than three and half feet tall it was fairly wide but slim like a blade fay said it doesnt look anything like a bottle andy boultontrow lay on his back holding the head above him with both hands the hands didnt ache now michael he said forgive me it was a shambles i was using weak stupid people i failed you in the doorway the candle was burning very low hed thought he could hear sirens a while back he couldnt hear anything now joe powys hadnt rung for an ambulance joe powys had lied chapter v one more i make it gomer said a short trail of recumbent stones in his destructive wake then thats the lot you know gomer minnie seagrove said sitting quite placidly next to him in the cab the threelegged dog on her lap youve surprised me tonight surprised myself gomer said gruffly ill be very surprised if i collect a penny for all this no what i mean is well id come to the conclusion and im sorry if this sounds insulting id come to the conclusion that there werent any really decent men in crybbe like men we used to say would do anything for you nothing too much trouble sort of thing if it was the right thing done a few bloody wrong things tonight minnie my love gomer said plunging the digger halfway down the riverbank thats for certain no they werent they werent wrong things at all youve saved me from being arrested for murder youre working overtime at a minutes notice to help that poor old chap who looks like hes on his last legs and youve been no end of help to young joe gomer ploughed through an unstablelooking fence and up into the field that served as a narrow floodplain for the river i got no regrets about gettin you out of a bit o bother he said an id stand up in court an say so but that joe well id like to think that young fellerll keep is mouth shut see thats all you know much about im not a lot said minnie but im sure hes all right its rather sad really jean said theyre all bottle stones to joe fay started to feel faint to pull herself together she said screamed it out inside her head like biting on something hard to fight extreme pain my father is dead and wondered if jean knew about that yet jean whod given him a new lease of life which hed expended in whst appeared at this moment to be a distressingly futile way fay felt sick i dont know precisely what happened jean was saying over this girl of joes rose i mean whether it was an accident or suicide or murder fay said jean put a hand on fays arm look my dear its over its all in the past whatever happened theres nothing we can change now nobody we can bring back to life no fay said numbly something white in places caught her eye over to the right of the bottle stone joe powyss muddy tshirt he was standing on the other side if the perimeter wall watching them silently like an abandoned scarecrow about andy jean said andys not a bad boy a little wild perhaps in his younger days a little headstrong his lineage is not a direct one to michael but he developed a very strong interest in the tradition from his early teens and give him his due he didnt deviate in his resolve to discover things for himself and the bottle stone ritual exists not at all said jean sadly outside the head of j m powys he showed me the field fay said where it happened and was there a bottle stone there and a fairy mound with a fairy on it what about henry kettle he was there too there was nothing wrong with henry kettle oh henry told you did he he said he was there a police car howled a long way away no fay said bleakly oh my dear fay was bent over gripping her thighs with both hands she felt a stabbing stomachcramp coming on oh god she breathed oh god and as andys breathing shallow as it was began to regulate he looked into the dark sockets and saw within them pinpricks of distant light he watched the lights as they came closer or rather as he moved closer to them his consciousness was focused and drawn into the sockets now as wide as caverns he felt the familiar tug at the base of his spine and never before had it felt so good so strong so positive so indicative of freedom for while imprisoned within his twisted body andy could no longer feel anything at all at the base of his spine when it happened and hed been far from certain that it would under such conditions there was an enormous burst of raw energy o michael o mother and he was out of his body and soaring towards the lights its a shame about crybbe jean said but its no different in any of these places you ask the ordinary man in the street in glastonbury how he feels about the holy grail how many miracles hes seen theyre not the least bit interested and indeed often quite antagonistic looking beyond the stone fay could no longer see joe perhaps hed crept away so you can imagine how they reacted in crybbe jean went on a place so remote and yet so conducive to psychic activity can one blame the peasantry i dont know the knowledge has always been for the few not everyone has the spiritual metabolism to absorb it not everyone has the will to see through the dark barriers to the light all at once as if to illustrate jeans point the stone which bore no resemblance at all to a bottle was lit up from its grassy base to its sharp fanglike tip goodness jean said whatevers that beyond the stone there was a kind of parapet overlooking the river and to one side dropping down to the floodplain a narrow muddy track its entire width now taken up by a crawling grunting monster with it single bright eye focused on the stone fay saw a wiry figure leap from the creature and advance upon the stone jean flashed her torch at it and the light was reflected in a pair of oldfashioned wirerimmed national health glasses evening ladies gomer parry plant hire i realize its a bit late like but i got official instructions to remove that stone see jean stiffened i do beg your pardon official council operation now why is it jean asked smoothly that i rather doubt that madam i got special authorization yere from the town mayor isself oh gomer fay blurted out the mayors dead miss morris isnt it sad said jean isnt it primitive there was once a notorious farmer you know in wiltshire known as stonebreaker robinson who devoted his energies to eradicating megalithic remains from the face of the countryside its been popularly thought that such philistine ignorance was dead she turned to gomer parry do yourself a big favour little man go home to bed do me a favour joe powys scrambled down from the perimeter wall flatten the bloody thing he stood next to gomer jean switched off her torch now both gomer and powys existed only as wavy silhouettes in the headlights blast but the stone was fully illuminated what are you afraid of joe afraid of what youll do to fay he didnt say anything he seemed to be shaking his head i shouldnt worry my dear jean said to fay you can stay at my house tonight flatten it powys said lay one finger on that stone little man said jean and i promise you youll regret it for what passes for the rest of your life its not an old stone gomer powys said if it was a genuine prehistoric monument i wouldnt let you touch it there was a flurrying then in the track of the headlight it was so fast that fay thought at first it was an owl until it veered out of the light at which point it ought to have disappeared but it didnt it carried its own luminescence something of the willothewisp oh my g fay gasped as with a small delighted whimper it landed on her feet arnold the dog jumped up at her she felt his tongue on her legs oh god arnold she pushed her hands deep into his fur felt him stiffen the air above the standing stone seemed to contract and to draw into it the headlight beam the headlamp itself grew dim fading to a bleary yellow the yellow of fay felt arnolds hackles rise under her hands he growled from so far back in his throat that it seemed to come not from him at all but from somewhere behind him bloody battery gomer parry ran for his cab of disease embalming fluid grace legge the stone glowed feebly at its base rising in intensity until its tip was hit with a magnesium radiance and fay felt an intense cold emanating from it a cold that you could almost see like steam from a deepfreeze the yellow and the cold and the aura of steam around the stone formed into an unmistakable shape of a beerbottle but it was the one word that did it yesssss drawn from jean wendles throat like a pale ribbon of gauze and fay flew at her she smashed her open palm so hard into jeans face that jean caught unawares was thrown back off her feet and fay heard a small crack and felt wetness in her hand and pain too as if it had been broken heard joe powys crying gomer go for it now saw the lights in the stone shiver and shrink and the diggers lone headlight brighten and the metal beast heaving about its shovel raised high like a wrecking hammer for several icywhite agonizing seconds andy boultontrow once again experienced his whole body a savage searing sensation a long physical scream the experience came as the lights exploded and he was tossed contemptuously back into his body like a roll of old carpet he was still staring from a place beyond the boundaries of despair into the sockets in the head of michael wort the sockets were just as black but no longer empty the eyes of michael wort swirled like oil the smile made by the exposed chipped brown teeth was malign the head felt heavy gomer was not proud of what happened there was no control no precision no finesse with a wild hydraulic wrench the castiron shovel came down several feet too quickly and simply smashed in the lop of the stone he leaned out of his cab and heard the uppity scotch woman shrieking there was a sudden unnatural strength in andys arms he raised the head he brought it down the skull smashed into his own michael he felt his nose shatter in a cloud of blood michael he felt his teeth splinter into fragments he raised the head again his fingers splayed around shrivelled skin and wisps of hair michael michael michael the blows continued with a vengeful intensity long after andy was dead from the doorway warren preece looked on fascinated by the head clutched in the two hands the arms moving ferociously up and down until the other head on the floor was red pulp the ole candle was near burnt to nothing when warren picked it up but then so was warren stripped to the waist and his chest was black like charcoal he could smell his own scorched skin he figured his lips had been burnt away too so that his teeth were stuck in this permanent grin like the head that was now rolling across the dusty boarded floor towards him got to laugh he didnt have to tell the head the ole head was laughing already at what itd done warren picked it up and stuck it under his arm like one of them ghosts two heads are better than one got to laugh with his other hand he picked up the candle just melted wax now but he picked it up squeezed it tight so the boiling hot wax bubbled up between his fingers feeling painful as hell feeling good he held up his hand and there was wax dripping down the clenched fist so it was like the hand had become the candle the wick sticking up through his knuckles with a little white flame on the end hand of glory he went over to the teacher brought his hand down to get some light on the face the face looked good all smashed one eye hanging out wished he could take this head too bung it under his other arm but cutting off a head with a stanley knife would take too long thought about it with the other feller before deciding on the vice never mind warren walked out of the room by the light of his own hand he felt really full of power now like hed just done a oneman gig in front of thousands of his fans with the head under his arm he walked down the ole steps in a sprightly kind of way felt like he owned the place probably did least he owned the farm now with every bugger else dead or crippled like strolled through the ole baronial halltype place straight to the front door his hand held out before him he could smell the skin smouldering now pretty soon itd all start frizzling off and thered be nothing left but wax and bones the real thing the authentic hand of glory the front door of crybbe court was open wide and warren preece walked out into the spotlights just like hed always known itd be one day the courtyard was lined with people silent awestruck like warren recognized a few of them local farmers and shopkeepers and such but also there were two ambulances and five cop cars all the headlights trained on the door hed just come out of all right warren yelled didnt seem much point to the candle with all these spotlights so he squashed it out between his legs then he held up the head with both hands way up over his own head like the fa cup yeah warren screeched about half a dozen coppers were coming towards him in a semicircle warren stuck the head under his arm and fished out his stanley knife come on son one of the coppers said lets not do this the hard way warren flicked out the blade and grinned owre you wynford he said chapter vi i always imagined said fay leaving crybbe for the last time and driving off into the sunset there was a peachcoloured glow in the eastern sky over the english side of offas dyke but it must be better she said driving into the dawn powys drove they were in his mini all of them arnold halfasleep on her knee two resentful black cats with russian names in a laundry basket on the back seat fay would probably have brought her dad as well if the body wouldve fitted in the boot but shed get him out he wasnt going to be buried in crybbe once theyd crossed the town boundary past the signpost at the top of the hill joe stopped the car he took her hand the other one not the one that was nearly broken rupturing jean wendles nose and led her out to the famous viewpoint near the stile below them crybbe was a sombre smoky little town which had sometimes been in wales and sometimes in england but had never belonged to either the real owners of crybbe were hidden in its own shadows and werent apparent at dawn for crybbes time as fay long ago realized was dusk she could see smoke still rising from the ruins of the church the nave had collapsed but the belltower remained col croston had told her a few minutes ago and one bell still hung the seventh bell which i intend to ring myself col said every night in the ruins these picturesque old traditions he said with a tight smile shouldnt be allowed to lapse when the stone was down they hadnt even looked for jean wendle what could they do about her anyway shed committed no crimes nobody had seen her since i didnt believe her of course fay said now you bloody did said joe she had me going for a while fay said however as i did try to tell you at one point yesterday i checked out the bottle stone it was in that field in radnor forest and it was shaped like a bottle and he did take it away powys reeled im a reporter fay said i came back that way from the library and went to the nearest farm took a while you know what farmers are but i got it out of them that land about eighteen acres still belongs to the trows it was funny the farmer actually called them worts sort of contemptuously he rents the grazing but they wouldnt sell the land andy andy showed up there about ten years ago the guy said but it was probably twelve with a stone on the back of a lorry and he had the stone planted in the middle of the field which annoyed the farmer but he couldnt do anything about it andy promised to come back and take it away and he did last week why didnt you you kept saying you didnt want to talk about the bottle stone and anyway and there was i thinking you had faith in me oh i did joe thats the point i didnt need to have the bottle stone bit confirmed it was a formality powys said your eye looks better lets not start lying to each other at this stage fay said of course chief inspector hughes hands in pockets was pacing the square there are still things we dont understand really col croston was trying to sound surprised a slow dawn drizzle glazed the square there was the acrid dispiriting smell of fire and water oh ive got most of it hughes said quickly and i think i grasp the social pressures which caused it col had forgotten that hughes was one of the new policemen with a degree in something appropriate you look at the background hughes said the kids stifled by it rural decline brought up in this crumbling farm and lets face it this towns a good halfcentury behind everywhere else at least said col so young preece listens to rock music and he dreams without much hope and then along comes salvation with a capital s in the shape of our late friend mr goff he sends goff a tape of his band and goff no doubt conscious of the politics of the situation responds favourably how do you know this letter from epidemic in warrens pocket charred but readable we can only assume he made another approach to goff and goff told him to clear off im telling you all this colonel in the hope you can throw a bit of light all new to me chief inspector so were assuming this is what pushed warren over the edge given all the other pressures losing his only brother and then his fathers tractor accident the boy seems to be of limited intellect must have thought the whole world was against him psychiatrists will have a field day said col where is he now hospital id like to think he was going to be fit to plead one day but i wouldnt put money on it he took most of wileys nose off with that stanley knife before we disarmed him lovable little chap im furious with myself i was just yards away when he killed goff who would have expected it i was trained to expect the unexpected for gods sake do you know how many hes killed i make it four goff the vicar poor old hereward newsome and of course that chap trow tie things up nicely if he put his hand up to the rachel wade business too her signature was on the letter suggesting warrens music wasnt half bad but what i was going to ask you colonel the trow killings somewhat different in style i cant go into details but warren seems to have finished him off by bludgeoning him with this other skull we thought we had another murder when he came out of the old house with that thing but its obviously of some age so where did it come from have any graves been disturbed locally col thought this over well he was obviously in the church and there are a couple of tombs in there might be worth sifting through the ruins oh well do that all right obviously its not a major issue but its something we have to clear up well i have to congratulate you chief inspector you seem to be putting it all together very nicely hughes nodded open and shut really he said fay said i could be making a fortune at this very moment therell be a hundred reporters here before breakfast like a flock of pigeons scrabbling for crumbs even poor bloody ashpole seems to have missed it all and what are they all going to say hard to say precisely how theyll work it but i can guarantee that by tonight warren preece will be very famous and michael wort whos michael wort said fay more to the point joe powys thought where is michael wort back hopefully in his own carefully constructed limbo he was still unsure what had happened over the bottle stone whether it had been installed at the riverside cottage and then replaced with another stone or whether the power of suggestion had made him see the bottle stone in the tense burgeoning atmosphere before rachels death in that case where was the original bottle stone now powys looked over his shoulder halfexpecting to see the thing sprouting from the earth behind him fay said i have to say it didnt occur to me for quite a while that what she what jean was doing at the stone was trying to generate in me enough negative energy for him andy wort whatever to make some kind of final leap to save himself itself it occurred to me powys said well it would wouldnt it youre a clever person and you know what we thinks about clever people yereabouts arnold limped towards them and fell over he stood again and shook himself exasperated fay morrison and joe powys looked at each other eyebrows were raised neither of them had said a word about arnolds remarkable turns of speed at critical moments one day fay thought shed dare to mention that strange glowing phantom fourth leg but not yet hes a dowsers dog joe said laconically as she bent down to pick up the dog a disturbing thought struck her what about the girl tessa she should really be taken away joe said and put through some kind of psychic readjustment programme except they probably dont exist so shell go on causing minor havoc until she grows up and turns into something even nastier like jean is there nothing anyone can do worlds full of them powys said crybbell always attract them and sometimes itll manufacture its own we cant just leave it we bloody can yes fay said i suppose we can and she turned her back on the town albeit with an uncomfortable feeling that one day they might feel they had to come back they got into the car they were going to titley to henry kettles cottage which joe had said was the best sanctuary he could think of for a few weeks at least he said thered be danger of residual nasties from crybbe clinging to them grace type things fay said can we handle that count on it joe powys said grimly from the back seat rasputin the cat mewed in protest at his confinement in the laundry basket fay said when you said you er needed me what did you mean exactly i dont know it just came out heat of the moment he turned on the engine however joe said looking straight ahead through the windscreen i know what id mean if i were to say it now fay smiled what did the police say to you they said dont leave town joe powys grinned and floored the accelerator
