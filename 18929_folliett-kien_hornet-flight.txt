ken follett hornet flight prologue a man with a wooden leg walked along a hospital corridor he was a short vigorous type with an athletic build thirty years old dressed in a plain charcoal gray suit and black toecapped shoes he walked briskly but you could tell he was lame by the slight irregularity in his step taptap taptap his face was fixed in a grim expression as if he were suppressing some profound emotion he reached the end of the corridor and stopped at the nurses desk flight lieutenant hoare he said the nurse looked up from a register she was a pretty girl with black hair and she spoke with the soft accent of county cork youll be a relation im thinking she said with a friendly smile her charm had no effect brother said the visitor which bed last on the left he turned on his heel and strode along the aisle to the end of the ward in a chair beside the bed a figure in a brown dressing gown sat with his back to the room looking out of the window smoking the visitor hesitated bart the man in the chair stood up and turned around there was a bandage on his head and his left arm was in a sling but he was smiling he was younger and taller than the visitor hello digby digby put his arms around his brother and hugged him hard i thought you were dead he said then he began to cry i was flying a whitley bart said the armstrong whitworth whitley was a cumbersome longtailed bomber that flew in an odd nosedown attitude in the spring of bomber command had a hundred of them out of a total strength of about seven hundred aircraft a messerschmitt fired on us and we took several hits bart continued but he must have been running out of fuel because he peeled off without finishing us i thought it was my lucky day then we started to lose altitude the messerschmitt must have damaged both engines we chucked out everything that wasnt bolted down to reduce our weight but it was no good and i realized wed have to ditch in the north sea digby sat on the edge of the hospital bed dryeyed now watching his brothers face seeing the thousandyardstare as bart remembered i told the crew to jettison the rear hatch then get into ditching position braced against the bulkhead the whitley had a crew of five digby recalled when we reached zero altitude i heaved back on the stick and opened the throttles but the aircraft refused to level out and we hit the water with a terrific smash i was knocked out they were step brothers eight years apart digbys mother had died when he was thirteen and his father had married a widow with a boy of her own from the start digby had looked after his little brother protecting him from bullies and helping him with his schoolwork they had both been mad about airplanes and dreamed of being pilots digby lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident studied engineering and went into aircraft design but bart lived the dream when i came to i could smell smoke the aircraft was floating and the starboard wing was on fire the night was dark as the grave but i could see by the light of the flames i crawled along the fuselage and found the dinghy pack i bunged it through the hatch and jumped jesus that water was cold his voice was low and calm but he took hard pulls on his cigarette drawing the smoke deep into his lungs and blowing it out between tightpursed lips in a long jet i was wearing a life jacket and i came to the surface like a cork there was quite a swell and i was going up and down like a tarts knickers luckily the dinghy pack was in front of my nose i pulled the string and it inflated itself but i couldnt get in i didnt have the strength to heave myself out of the water i couldnt understand itdidnt realize i had a dislocated shoulder and a broken wrist and three cracked ribs and all that so i just stayed there holding on freezing to death there had been a time digby recalled when he thought bart had been the lucky one eventually jones and croft appeared theyd held on to the tail until it went down neither could swim but their mae wests saved them and they managed to scramble into the dinghy and pull me in he lit a fresh cigarette i never saw pickering i dont know what happened to him but i assume hes at the bottom of the sea he fell silent there was one crew member unaccounted for digby realized after a pause he said what about the fifth man john rowley the bombaimer was alive we heard him call out i was in a bit of a daze but jones and croft tried to row toward the voice he shook his head in a gesture of hopelessness you cant imagine how difficult it was the swell must have been three or four feet the flames were dying down so we couldnt see much and the wind was howling like a bloody banshee jones yelled and hes got a strong voice rowley would shout back then the dinghy would go up one side of a wave and down the other and spin around at the same time and when he called out again his voice seemed to come from a completely different direction i dont know how long it went on rowley kept shouting but his voice became weaker as the cold got to him barts face stiffened he started to sound a bit pathetic calling to god and his mother and that sort of rot eventually he went quiet digby found he was holding his breath as if the mere sound of breathing would be an intrusion on such a dreadful memory we were found soon after dawn by a destroyer on uboat patrol they dropped a cutter and hauled us in bart looked out of the window blind to the green hertfordshire landscape seeing a different scene far away bloody lucky really he said they sat in silence for a while then bart said was the raid a success no one will tell me how many came home disastrous digby said what about my squadron sergeant jenkins and his crew got back safely digby drew a slip of paper from his pocket so did pilot officer arasaratnam wheres he from ceylon and sergeant rileys aircraft took a hit but made it back luck of the irish said bart what about the rest digby just shook his head but there were six aircraft from my squadron on that raid bart protested i know as well as you two more were shot down no apparent survivors so creightonsmith is dead and billy shaw and oh god he turned away im sorry barts mood changed from despair to anger its not enough to be sorry he said were being sent out there to die i know for christs sake digby youre part of the bloody government i work for the prime minister yes churchill liked to bring people from private industry into the government and digby a successful aircraft designer before the war was one of his troubleshooters then this is your fault as much as anyones you shouldnt be wasting your time visiting the sick get the hell out of here and do something about it i am doing something digby said calmly ive been given the task of finding out why this is happening we lost fifty percent of the aircraft on that raid bloody treachery at the top i suspect or some fool air marshal boasting in his club about tomorrows raid and a nazi barman taking notes behind the beer pumps thats one possibility bart sighed im sorry diggers he said using a childhood nickname its not your fault im just blowing my top seriously have you any idea why so many are being shot down youve flown more than a dozen missions whats your hunch bart looked thoughtful i wasnt just sounding off about spies when we get to germany theyre ready for us they know were coming what makes you say that their fighters are in the air waiting for us you know how difficult it is for defensive forces to time that right the fighter squadron has to be scrambled at just the right moment they must navigate from their airfield to the area where they think we might be then they have to climb above our ceiling and when theyve done all that they have to find us in the moonlight the whole process takes so much time that we should be able to drop our ordnance and get clear before they catch us but it isnt happening that way digby nodded barts experience matched that of other pilots he had questioned he was about to say so when bart looked up and smiled over digbys shoulder digby turned to see a negro in the uniform of a squadron leader like bart he was young for his rank and digby guessed he had received the automatic promotions that came with combat experienceflight lieutenant after twelve sorties squadron leader after fifteen bart said hello charles you had us all worried bartlett how are you the newcomers accent was caribbean overlaid with an oxbridge drawl i may live they say with a fingertip charles touched the back of barts hand where it emerged from his sling it was a curiously affectionate gesture digby thought im jolly glad to hear it charles said charles meet my brother digby digby this is charles ford we were together at trinity until we left to join the air force it was the only way to avoid taking our exams charles said shaking digbys hand bart said how are the africans treating you charles smiled and explained to digby theres a squadron of rhodesians at our airfield first class flyers but they find it difficult to deal with an officer of my color we call them the africans which seems to irritate them slightly i cant think why digby said obviously youre not letting it get you down i believe that with patience and improved education we may eventually be able to civilize such people primitive though they seem now charles looked away and digby caught a glimpse of the anger beneath his good humor i was just asking bart why he thinks were losing so many bombers digby said whats your opinion i wasnt on this raid charles said by all accounts i was lucky to miss it but other recent operations have been pretty bad i get the feeling the luftwaffe can follow us through cloud might they have some kind of equipment on board that enables them to locate us even when were not visible digby shook his head every crashed enemy aircraft is minutely examined and weve never seen anything like what youre talking about were working hard to invent that kind of device and im sure the enemy are too but were a long way from success and were pretty sure theyre well behind us i dont think thats it well thats what it feels like i still think there are spies bart said interesting digby stood up i have to get back to whitehall thanks for your opinions it helps to talk to the men at the sharp end he shook hands with charles and squeezed barts uninjured shoulder sit still and get well they say ill be flying again in a few weeks i cant say im glad as digby turned to go charles said may i ask you a question of course on a raid like this one the cost to us of replacing lost aircraft must be more than the cost to the enemy of repairing the damage done by our bombs undoubtedly then charles spread his arms in a sign of incomprehension why do we do it whats the point of bombing yes bart said id like to know that what else can we do digby said the nazis control europe austria czechoslovakia holland belgium france denmark norway italy is an ally spain is sympathetic sweden is neutral and they have a pact with the soviet union we have no military forces on the continent we have no other way of fighting back charles nodded so were all youve got exactly digby said if the bombing stops the war is overand hitler has won the prime minister was watching the maltese falcon a private cinema had recently been built in the old kitchens of admiralty house it had fifty or sixty plush seats and a red velvet curtain but it was usually used to show film of bombing raids and to screen propaganda pieces before they were shown to the public late at night after all the memoranda had been dictated the cables sent the reports annotated and the minutes initialed when he was too worried and angry and tense to sleep churchill would sit in one of the large vip seats in the front row with a glass of brandy and lose himself in the latest enchantment from hollywood as digby walked in humphrey bogart was explaining to mary astor that when a mans partner is killed hes supposed to do something about it the air was thick with cigar smoke churchill pointed to a seat digby sat down and watched the last few minutes of the movie as the credits appeared over the statuette of a black falcon digby told his boss that the luftwaffe seemed to have advance notice when bomber command was coming when he had finished churchill stared at the screen for a few moments as if he were waiting to find out who had played bryan there were times when he was charming with an engaging smile and a twinkle in his blue eyes but tonight he seemed sunk in gloom at last he said what does the raf think they blame poor formation flying in theory if the bombers fly in close formation their armament should cover the entire sky so any enemy fighter that appears should be shot down immediately and what do you say to that rubbish formation flying has never worked some new factor has entered the equation i agree but what my brother blames spies all the spies weve caught have been amateurishbut thats why they were caught of course it may be that the competent ones have slipped through the net perhaps the germans have made a technical breakthrough the secret intelligence service tell me the enemy are far behind us in the development of radar do you trust their judgment no the ceiling lights came on churchill was in evening dress he always looked dapper but his face was lined with weariness he took from his waistcoat pocket a folded sheet of flimsy paper heres a clue he said and he handed it to digby digby studied the sheet it appeared to be a decrypt of a luftwaffe radio signal in german and english it said that the luftwaffes new strategy of dark nightfightingdunkle nachtjagdhad scored a great triumph thanks to the excellent information from freya digby read the message in english then again in german freya was not a word in either language what does this mean he said thats what i want you to find out churchill stood up and shrugged into his jacket walk back with me he said as he left he called out thank you a voice from the projectionists booth replied my pleasure sir as they passed through the building two men fell in behind them inspector thompson from scotland yard and churchills private bodyguard they emerged on the parade ground passed a team operating a barrage balloon and went through a gate in the barbedwire fence to the street london was blacked out but a crescent moon gave enough light for them to find their way they walked side by side a few yards along horse guards parade to number one storeys gate a bomb had damaged the rear of number ten downing street the traditional residence of the prime minister so churchill was living at the nearby annex over the cabinet war rooms the entrance was protected by a bombproof wall the barrel of a machine gun poked through a hole in the wall digby said good night sir it cant go on said churchill at this rate bomber command will be finished by christmas i need to know who or what freya is ill find out do so with the utmost dispatch yes sir good night said the prime minister and he went inside part one on the last day of may a strange vehicle was seen on the streets of morlunde a city on the west coast of denmark it was a danishmade nimbus motorcycle with a sidecar that in itself was an unusual sight because there was no petrol for anyone except doctors and the police and of course the german troops occupying the country but this nimbus had been modified the fourcylinder petrol engine had been replaced by a steam engine taken from a scrapped river launch the seat had been removed from the sidecar to make room for a boiler firebox and chimney stack the substitute engine was low in power and the bike had a top speed of about twentytwo miles per hour instead of the customary roar of a motorcycle exhaust there was only the gentle hiss of steam the eerie quiet and the slow pace gave the vehicle a stately air in the saddle was harald olufsen a tall youth of eighteen with clear skin and fair hair brushed back from a high forehead he looked like a viking in a school blazer he had saved for a year to buy the nimbus which had cost him six hundred crownsthen the day after he got it the germans had imposed the petrol restrictions harald had been furious what right did they have but he had been brought up to act rather than complain it had taken him another year to modify the bike working on school holidays fitting it in with revision for his university entrance exams today home from his boarding school for the whitsun break he had spent the morning memorizing physics equations and the afternoon attaching a sprocket from a rusted lawn mower to the back wheel now with the motorcycle working perfectly he was heading for a bar where he hoped to hear some jazz and perhaps even meet some girls he loved jazz after physics it was the most interesting thing that had ever happened to him the american musicians were the best of course but even their danish imitators were worth listening to you could sometimes hear good jazz in morlunde perhaps because it was an international port visited by sailors from all over the world but when harald drove up outside the club hot in the heart of the dockside district its door was closed and its windows shuttered he was mystified it was eight oclock on a saturday evening and this was one of the most popular spots in town it should be swinging as he sat staring at the silent building a passerby stopped and looked at his vehicle whats that contraption a nimbus with a steam engine do you know anything about this club i own it what does the bike use for fuel anything that burns i use peat he pointed to the pile in the back of the sidecar peat the man laughed why are the doors shut the nazis closed me down harald was dismayed why employing negro musicians harald had never seen a colored musician in the flesh but he knew from records that they were the best the nazis are ignorant swine he said angrily his evening had been ruined the club owner looked up and down the street to make sure no one had heard the occupying power ruled denmark with a light hand but all the same few people openly insulted the nazis however there was no one else in sight he returned his gaze to the motorcycle does it work of course it does who converted it for you i did it myself the mans amusement was turning to admiration thats pretty clever thank you harald opened the tap that admitted steam into the engine im sorry about your club im hoping theyll let me open again in a few weeks but ill have to promise to employ white musicians jazz without negroes harald shook his head in disgust its like banning french cooks from restaurants he took his foot off the brake and the bike moved slowly away he thought of heading for the town center to see if there was anyone he knew in the cafes and bars around the square but he felt so disappointed about the jazz club that he decided it would be depressing to hang around harald steered for the harbor his father was pastor of the church on sande a small island a couple of miles offshore the little ferry that shuttled to and from the island was in dock and he drove straight on it was crowded with people most of whom he knew there was a merry gang of fishermen who had been to a football match and had a few drinks afterward two welloff women in hats and gloves with a pony and trap and a stack of shopping and a family of five who had been visiting relations in town a welldressed couple he did not recognize were probably going to dine at the islands hotel which had a highclass restaurant his motorcycle attracted everyones interest and he had to explain the steam engine again at the last minute a germanbuilt ford sedan drove on harald knew the car it belonged to axel flemming owner of the islands hotel the flemmings were hostile to haralds family axel flemming felt he was the natural leader of the island community a role which pastor olufsen believed to be his own and the friction between the rival patriarchs affected all other family members harald wondered how flemming had managed to get petrol for his car he supposed anything was possible to the rich the sea was choppy and there were dark clouds in the western sky a storm was coming in but the fishermen said they would be home before it arrived just harald took out a newspaper he had picked up in the town entitled reality it was an illegal publication printed in defiance of the occupying power and given away free the danish police had not attempted to suppress it and the germans seemed to regard it as beneath contempt in copenhagen people read it openly on trains and streetcars here people were more discreet and harald folded it to hide the masthead while he read a report about the shortage of butter denmark produced millions of pounds of butter every year but almost all of it was now sent to germany and danes had trouble getting any it was the kind of story that never appeared in the censored legitimate press the familiar flat shape of the island came closer it was twelve miles long and a mile wide with a village at each end the fishermens cottages and the church with its parsonage constituted the older village at the south end also at the south end a school of navigation long disused had been taken over by the germans and turned into a military base the hotel and the larger homes were at the north end in between the island was mostly sand dunes and scrub with a few trees and no hills but all along the seaward side was a magnificent tenmile beach harald felt a few drops of rain as the ferry approached its dock at the north end of the island the hotels horsedrawn taxi was waiting for the welldressed couple the fishermen were met by the wife of one of them driving a horse and cart harald decided to cross the island and drive home along the beach which had hardpacked sandin fact it had been used for speed trials of racing cars he was halfway from the dock to the hotel when he ran out of steam he was using the bikes petrol tank as a water reserve and he realized now that it was not big enough he would have to get a fivegallon oil drum and put it in the sidecar meanwhile he needed water to get him home there was only one house within sight and unfortunately it was axel flemmings despite their rivalry the olufsens and the flemmings were on speaking terms all members of the flemming family came to church every sunday and sat together at the front indeed axel was a deacon all the same harald did not relish the thought of asking the antagonistic flemmings for help he considered walking a quarter of a mile to the next nearest house then decided that would be foolish with a sigh he set off up the long drive rather than knock at the front door he went around the side of the house to the stables he was pleased to see a manservant putting the ford in the garage hello gunnar said harald can i have some water the man was friendly help yourself he said theres a tap in the yard harald found a bucket beside the tap and filled it he went back to the road and poured the water into the tank it looked as if he might manage to avoid meeting any of the family but when he returned the bucket to the yard peter flemming was there a tall haughty man of thirty in a wellcut suit of oatmeal tweed peter was axels son before the quarrel between the families he had been best friends with haralds brother arne and in their teens they had been known as ladykillers arne seducing girls with his wicked charm and peter by his cool sophistication peter now lived in copenhagen but had come home for the holiday weekend harald assumed peter was reading reality he looked up from the paper to see harald what are you doing here he said hello peter i came to get some water i suppose this rag is yours harald touched his pocket and realized with consternation that the newspaper must have fallen out when he reached down for the bucket peter saw the movement and understood its meaning obviously it is he said are you aware that you could go to jail just for having it in your possession the talk of jail was not an empty threat peter was a police detective harald said everyone reads it in the city he made himself sound defiant but in fact he was a little scared peter was mean enough to arrest him this is not copenhagen peter intoned solemnly harald knew that peter would love the chance to disgrace an olufsen yet he was hesitating harald thought he knew why youll look a fool if you arrest a schoolboy on sande for doing something half the population does openly especially when everyone finds out youve got a grudge against my father peter was visibly torn between the desire to humiliate harald and the fear of being laughed at no one is entitled to break the law he said whose lawours or the germans the law is the law harald felt more confident peter would not be arguing so defensively if he intended to make an arrest you only say that because your father makes so much money giving nazis a good time at his hotel that hit home the hotel was popular with german officers who had more to spend than the danes peter flushed with anger while your father gives inflammatory sermons he retorted it was true the pastor had preached against the nazis his theme being jesus was a jew peter continued does he realize how much trouble will be caused if he stirs people up im sure he does the founder of the christian religion was something of a troublemaker himself dont talk to me about religion i have to keep order down here on earth to hell with order weve been invaded haralds frustration over his blighted evening out boiled over what right have the nazis got to tell us what to do we should kick the whole evil pack of them out of our country you mustnt hate the germans theyre our friends peter said with an air of pious selfrighteousness that maddened harald i dont hate germans you damn fool ive got german cousins the pastors sister had married a successful young hamburg dentist who came to sande on holiday back in the twenties their daughter monika was the first girl harald had kissed theyve suffered more from the nazis than we have harald added uncle joachim was jewish and although he was a baptized christian and an elder of his church the nazis had ruled that he could only treat jews thereby ruining his practice a year ago he had been arrested on suspicion of hoarding gold and sent to a special kind of prison called a konzentrazionslager in the small bavarian town of dachau people bring trouble on themselves peter said with a worldlywise air your father should never have allowed his sister to marry a jew he threw the newspaper to the ground and walked away at first harald was too taken aback to reply he bent and picked up the newspaper then he said to peters retreating back youre starting to sound like a nazi yourself ignoring him peter went in by a kitchen entrance and slammed the door harald felt he had lost the argument which was infuriating because he knew that what peter had said was outrageous it started to rain heavily as he headed back toward the road when he returned to his bike he found that the fire under the boiler had gone out he tried to relight it he crumpled up his copy of reality for kindling and he had a box of goodquality wood matches in his pocket but he had not brought with him the bellows he had used to start the fire earlier in the day after twenty frustrating minutes bent over the firebox in the rain he gave up he would have to walk home he turned up the collar of his blazer he pushed the bike half a mile to the hotel and left it in the small car park then set off along the beach at this time of year three weeks from the summer solstice the scandinavian evenings lasted until eleven oclock but tonight clouds darkened the sky and the pouring rain further restricted visibility harald followed the edge of dunes finding his way by the feel of the ground underfoot and the sound of the sea in his right ear before long his clothes were so soaked that he could have swum home without getting any wetter he was a strong young man and as fit as a greyhound but two hours later he was tired cold and miserable when he came up against the fence around the new german base and realized he would have to walk two miles around it in order to reach his home a few hundred yards away if the tide had been out he would have continued along the beach for although that stretch of sand was officially off limits the guards would not have been able to see him in this weather however the tide was in and the fence reached into the water it crossed his mind to swim the last stretch but he dismissed the idea immediately like everyone in this fishing community harald had a wary respect for the sea and it would be dangerous to swim at night in this weather when he was already exhausted but he could climb the fence the rain had eased and a quarter moon showed fitfully through racing clouds intermittently shedding an uncertain light over the drenched landscape harald could see the chickenwire fence six feet high with two strands of barbed wire at the top formidable enough but no great obstacle to a determined person in good physical shape fifty yards inland it passed through a copse of scrubby trees and bushes that hid it from view that would be the place to get over he knew what lay beyond the fence last summer he had worked as a laborer on the building site at that time he had not known it was destined to be a military base the builders a copenhagen firm had told everyone it was to be a new coastguard station they might have had trouble recruiting staff if they had told the truthharald for one would not knowingly have worked for the nazis then when the buildings were up and the fence had been completed all the danes had been sent away and germans had been brought in to install the equipment but harald knew the layout the disused navigation school had been refurbished and two new buildings put up either side of it all the buildings were set back from the beach so he could cross the base without going near them in addition much of the ground at this end of the site was covered with low bushes that would help conceal him he would just have to keep an eye out for patrolling guards he found his way to the copse climbed the fence eased himself gingerly over the barbed wire at the top and jumped down the other side landing softly on the wet dunes he looked around peering through the gloom seeing only the vague shapes of trees the buildings were out of sight but he could hear distant music and an occasional shout of laughter it was saturday night perhaps the soldiers were having a few beers while their officers dined at axel flemmings hotel he headed across the base moving as fast as he dared in the shifting moonlight staying close to bushes when he could orienting himself by the waves on his right and the faint music to the left he passed a tall structure and recognized it in the dimness as a searchlight tower the whole area could be lit up in an emergency but otherwise the base was blacked out a sudden burst of sound to his left startled him and he crouched down his heart beating faster he looked over toward the buildings a door stood open spilling light as he watched a soldier came out and ran across the compound then another door opened in a different building and the soldier ran in haralds heartbeat eased he passed through a stand of conifers and went down into a dip as he came to the bottom of the declivity he saw a structure of some kind looming up in the murk he could not make it out clearly but he did not recall anything being built in this location coming closer he saw a curved concrete wall about as high as his head above the wall something moved and he heard a low hum like an electric motor this must have been erected by the germans after the local workers had been laid off he wondered why he had never seen the structure from outside the fence then realized that the trees and the dip in the ground would hide it from most viewpoints except perhaps the beachwhich was out of bounds where it passed the base when he looked up and tried to make out the details rain drove into his face stinging his eyes but he was too curious to pass by the moon shone bright for a moment squinting he looked again above the circular wall he made out a grid of metal or wire like an oversize mattress twelve feet on a side the whole contraption was rotating like a merrygoround completing a revolution every few seconds harald was fascinated it was a machine of a kind he had never seen before and the engineer in him was spellbound what did it do why did it revolve the sound told him littlethat was just the motor that turned the thing he felt sure it was not a gun at least not the conventional kind for there was no barrel his best guess was that it was something to do with radio nearby someone coughed harald reacted instinctively he jumped got his arms over the edge of the wall and hauled himself up he lay for a second on the narrow top feeling dangerously conspicuous then eased himself down on the inside he worried that his feet might encounter moving machinery but he felt almost sure there would be a walkway around the mechanism to allow engineers to service it and after a tense moment he touched a concrete floor the hum was louder and he could smell engine oil on his tongue was the peculiar taste of static electricity who had coughed he presumed a sentry was passing by the mans footsteps must have been lost in the wind and rain fortunately the same noises had muffled the sound harald made scrambling over the wall but had the sentry seen him he flattened himself against the curved inside of the wall breathing hard waiting for the beam of a powerful flashlight to betray him he wondered what would happen if he were caught the germans were amiable out here in the countryside most of them did not strut around like conquerors but seemed almost embarrassed at being in charge they would probably hand him over to the danish police he was not sure what line the cops would take if peter flemming were part of the local force he would make sure harald suffered as much as possible but he was based in copenhagen fortunately what harald dreaded more than any official punishment was his fathers anger he could already hear the pastors sarcastic interrogation you climbed the fence and entered the secret military compound at night and used it as a shortcut home because it was raining but no light shone on harald he waited and stared at the dark bulk of the apparatus in front of him he thought he could see heavy cables coming from the lower edge of the grid and disappearing into the gloom on the far side of the pit this had to be a means of sending radio signals or receiving them he thought when a few slow minutes had passed he felt sure the guard had moved on he clambered to the top of the wall and tried to see through the rain on either side of the structure he could make out two smaller dark shapes but they were static and he decided they must be part of the machinery no sentry was visible he slid down the outside of the wall and set off once again across the dunes in a dark moment when the moon was behind a thick cloud he walked smack into a wooden wall shocked and momentarily scared he let out a muffled curse a second later he realized he had run into an old boathouse that had been used by the navigation school it was derelict and the germans had not repaired it apparently having no use for it he stood still for a moment listening but all he could hear was his heart pounding he walked on he reached the far fence without further incident he scrambled over and headed for his home he came first to the church light glowed from the long row of small square windows in its seaward wall surprised that anyone should be in the building at this hour on a saturday night he looked inside the church was long and lowroofed on special occasions it could hold the islands resident population of four hundred but only just rows of seats faced a wooden lectern there was no altar the walls were bare except for some framed texts danes were undogmatic about religion and most of the nation subscribed to evangelical lutheranism however the fishing folk of sande had been converted a hundred years ago to a harsher creed for the last thirty years haralds father had kept their faith alight setting an example of uncompromising puritanism in his own life stiffening the resolve of his congregation in weekly brimstone sermons and confronting backsliders personally with the irresistible holiness of his blueeyed gaze despite the example of this blazing conviction his son was not a believer harald went to services whenever he was at home not wanting to hurt his fathers feelings but in his heart he dissented he had not yet made up his mind about religion in general but he knew he did not believe in a god of petty rules and vengeful punishments as he looked through the window he heard music his brother arne was at the piano playing a jazz tune with a delicate touch harald smiled with pleasure arne had come home for the holiday he was amusing and sophisticated and he would enliven the long weekend at the parsonage harald walked to the entrance and stepped inside without looking around arne changed the music seamlessly to a hymn tune harald grinned arne had heard the door open and thought their father might be coming in the pastor disapproved of jazz and certainly would not permit it to be played in his church its only me harald said arne turned around he was wearing his brown army uniform ten years older than harald he was a flying instructor with the army aviation troops based at the flying school near copenhagen the germans had halted all danish military activity and the aircraft were grounded most of the time but the instructors were allowed to give lessons in gliders seeing you out of the corner of my eye i thought you were the old man arne looked harald up and down fondly you look more and more like him does that mean ill go bald probably and you i dont think so i take after mother it was true arne had their mothers thick dark hair and hazel eyes harald was fair like their father and had also inherited the penetrating blueeyed stare with which the pastor intimidated his flock both harald and their father were formidably tall making arne seem short at an inch under six feet ive got something to play you harald said arne got off the stool and harald sat at the piano i learned this from a record someone brought to school you know mads kirke cousin of my colleague poul right he discovered this american pianist called clarence pine top smith harald hesitated whats the old man doing at this moment writing tomorrows sermon good the piano could not be heard from the parsonage fifty yards away and it was unlikely that the pastor would interrupt his preparation to take an idle stroll across to the church especially in this weather harald began to play pine tops boogiewoogie and the room filled with the sexy harmonies of the american south he was an enthusiastic pianist though his mother said he had a heavy hand he could not sit still to play so he stood up kicking the stool back knocking it over and played standing bending his long frame over the keyboard he made more mistakes this way but they did not seem to matter as long as he kept up the compulsive rhythm he banged out the last chord and said in english thats what im talkin about just as pine top did on the record arne laughed not bad you should hear the original come and stand in the porch i want to smoke harald stood up the old man wont like that im twentyeight arne said im too old to be told what to do by my father i agreebut does he are you afraid of him of course so is mother and just about every other person on this islandeven you arne grinned all right maybe just a little bit they stood outside the church door sheltered from the rain by a little porch on the far side of a patch of sandy ground they could see the dark shape of the parsonage light shone through the diamondshaped window set into the kitchen door arne took out his cigarettes have you heard from hermia harald asked him arne was engaged to an english girl whom he had not seen for more than a year since the germans had occupied denmark arne shook his head i tried to write to her i found an address for the british consulate in gothenburg danes were allowed to send letters to sweden which was neutral i addressed it to her at that house not mentioning the consulate on the envelope i thought id been quite clever but the censors arent so easily fooled my commanding officer brought the letter back to me and said that if i ever tried anything like that again id be courtmartialed harald liked hermia some of arnes girlfriends had been well dumb blondes but hermia had brains and guts she was a little scary on first acquaintance with her dramatic dark looks and her direct manner of speech but she had endeared herself to harald by treating him like a man not just someones kid brother and she was sensationally voluptuous in a swimsuit do you still want to marry her god yesif shes alive she might have been killed by a bomb in london it must be hard not knowing arne nodded then said how about you any action harald shrugged girls my age arent interested in schoolboys he said it lightly but he was hiding real resentment he had suffered a couple of wounding rejections i suppose they want to date a guy who can spend some money on them exactly and younger girls i met a girl at easter birgit claussen claussen the boatbuilding family in morlunde yes shes pretty but shes only sixteen and she was so boring to talk to its just as well the family are catholics the old man wouldnt approve i know harald frowned hes strange though at easter he preached about tolerance hes about as tolerant as vlad the impaler arne threw away the stub of his cigarette lets go and talk to the old tyrant before we go in what how are things in the army grim we cant defend our country and most of the time im not allowed to fly how long can this go on who knows maybe forever the nazis have won everything theres no opposition left but the british and theyre hanging on by a thread harald lowered his voice although there was no one to listen surely someone in copenhagen must be starting a resistance movement arne shrugged if they were and i knew about it i couldnt tell you could i then before harald could say more arne dashed through the rain toward the light shining from the kitchen hermia mount looked with dismay at her lunchtwo charred sausages a dollop of runny mashed potato and a mound of overcooked cabbageand she thought with longing of a bar on the copenhagen waterfront that served three kinds of herring with salad pickles warm bread and lager beer she had been brought up in denmark her father had been a british diplomat who spent most of his career in scandinavian countries hermia had worked in the british embassy in copenhagen first as a secretary later as assistant to a naval attache who was in fact with mi the secret intelligence service when her father died and her mother returned to london hermia stayed on partly because of her job but mainly because she was engaged to a danish pilot arne olufsen then on april hitler invaded denmark four anxious days later hermia and a group of british officials had left in a special diplomatic train that brought them through germany to the dutch frontier from where they traveled through neutral holland and on to london now at the age of thirty hermia was an intelligence analyst in charge of mis denmark desk along with most of the service she had been evacuated from its london headquarters at broadway near buckingham palace to bletchley park a large country house on the edge of a village fifty miles north of the capital a nissen hut hastily erected in the grounds served as canteen hermia was glad to be escaping the blitz but she wished that by some miracle they could also have evacuated one of londons charming little italian or french restaurants so that she would have something to eat she forked a little mash into her mouth and forced herself to swallow to take her mind off the taste of the food she put todays daily express beside her plate the british had just lost the mediterranean island of crete the express tried to put a brave face on it claiming the battle had cost hitler eighteen thousand men but the depressing truth was that this was another in a long line of triumphs for the nazis glancing up she saw a short man of about her own age coming toward her carrying a cup of tea walking briskly but with a noticeable limp may i join you he said cheerfully and sat opposite her without waiting for an answer im digby hoare i know who you are she raised an eyebrow and said make yourself at home the note of irony in her voice made no apparent impact he just said thanks she had seen him around once or twice he had an energetic air despite his limp he was no matinee idol with his unruly dark hair but he had nice blue eyes and his features were pleasantly craggy in a humphrey bogart way she asked him what department are you with i work in london actually that was not an answer to her question she noted she pushed her plate aside he said you dont like the food do you ill tell you something ive debriefed pilots who have been shot down over france and made their way home we think were experiencing austerity but we dont know the meaning of the word the frogs are starving to death after hearing those stories everything tastes good to me austerity is no excuse for vile cooking hermia said crisply he grinned they told me you were a bit waspish what else did they tell you that youre bilingual in english and danishwhich is why youre head of the denmark desk i presume no the war is the reason for that before no woman ever rose above the level of secretaryassistant in mi we didnt have analytical minds you see we were more suited to homemaking and childrearing but since war broke out womens brains have undergone a remarkable change and we have become capable of work that previously could only be accomplished by the masculine mentality he took her sarcasm with easy good humor ive noticed that too he said wonders never cease why have you been checking up on me two reasons first because youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen this time he was not grinning he had succeeded in surprising her men did not often say she was beautiful handsome perhaps striking sometimes imposing often her face was a long oval perfectly regular but with severe dark hair hooded eyes and a nose too big to be pretty she could not think of a witty rejoinder whats the other reason he glanced sideways two older women were sharing their table and although they were chatting to each other they were probably also halflistening to digby and hermia ill tell you in a minute he said would you like to go out on the tiles he had surprised her again what will you go out with me certainly not for a moment he seemed nonplussed then his grin returned and he said dont sugar the pill give it to me straight she could not help smiling we could go to the pictures he persisted or to the shoulder of mutton pub in old bletchley or both she shook her head no thank you she said firmly oh he seemed crestfallen did he think she was turning him down because of his disability she hastened to put that right im engaged she said she showed him the ring on her left hand i didnt notice men never do whos the lucky fellow a pilot in the danish army over there i presume as far as i know i havent heard from him for a year the two ladies left the table and digbys manner changed his face turned serious and his voice became quiet but urgent take a look at this please he drew from his pocket a sheet of flimsy paper and handed it to her she had seen such flimsy sheets before here at bletchley park as she expected it was a decrypt of an enemy radio signal i imagine ive no need to tell you how desperately secret this is digby said no need i believe you speak german as well as danish she nodded in denmark all schoolchildren learn german and english and latin as well she studied the signal for a moment information from freya thats whats puzzling us its not a word in german i thought it might mean something in one of the scandinavian languages it does in a way she said freya is a norse goddessin fact shes the viking venus the goddess of love ah digby looked thoughtful well thats something but it doesnt get us far whats this all about were losing too many bombers hermia frowned i read about the last big raid in the newspapersthey said it was a great success digby just looked at her oh i see she said you dont tell the newspapers the truth he remained silent in fact my entire picture of the bombing campaign is mere propaganda she went on the truth is that its a complete disaster to her dismay he still did not contradict her for heavens sake how many aircraft did we lose fifty percent dear god hermia looked away some of those pilots had fiancees she thought but if this goes on exactly she looked again at the decrypt is freya a spy its my job to find out what can i do tell me more about the goddess hermia dug back into her memory she had learned the norse myths at school but that was a long time ago freya has a gold necklace that is very precious it was given to her by four dwarves its guarded by the watchman of the gods heimdal i think his name is a watchman that makes sense freya could be a spy with access to advance information about air raids she could also be a machine for detecting approaching aircraft before they come within sight ive heard that we have such machines but ive no idea how they work three possible ways infrared lidar and radar infrared detectors would pick up the rays emitted by a hot aircraft engine or possibly its exhaust lidar is a system of optical pulses sent out by the detection apparatus and reflected back off the aircraft radar is the same thing with radio pulses ive just remembered something else heimdal can see for a hundred miles by day or night that makes it sound more like a machine thats what i was thinking digby finished his tea and stood up if you have any more thoughts will you let me know of course where do i find you number ten downing street oh she was impressed goodbye goodbye she said and watched him walk away she sat there for a few moments it had been an interesting conversation in more ways than one digby hoare was very highpowered the prime minister himself must be worried about the loss of bombers was the use of the code name freya mere coincidence or was there a scandinavian connection she had enjoyed digbys asking her out although she was not interested in dating another man it was nice to be asked after a while the sight of her uneaten lunch began to get her down she took her tray to the slops table and scraped her plate into the pigbin then she went to the ladies room while she was in a cubicle she heard a group of young women come in chattering animatedly she was about to emerge when one of them said that digby hoare doesnt waste timetalk about a fast worker hermia froze with her hand on the doorknob i saw him move in on miss mount said an older voice he must be a tit man the others giggled in the cubicle hermia frowned at this reference to her generous figure i think she gave him the brushoff though said the first girl wouldnt you i couldnt fancy a man with a wooden leg a third girl spoke with a scots accent i wonder if he takes it off when he shags you she said and they all laughed hermia had heard enough she opened the door stepped out and said if i find out ill let you know the three girls were shocked into silence and hermia left before they had time to recover she stepped out of the wooden building the wide green lawn with its cedar trees and swan pond had been disfigured by huts thrown up in haste to accommodate the hundreds of staff from london she crossed the park to the house an ornate victorian mansion built of red brick she passed through the grand porch and made her way to her office in the old servants quarters a tiny lshaped space that had probably been the boot room it had one small window too high to see out of so she worked with the light on all day there was a phone on her desk and a typewriter on a side table her predecessor had had a secretary but women were expected to do their own typing on her desk she found a package from copenhagen after hitlers invasion of poland she had laid the foundations of a small spy network in denmark its leader was her fiances friend poul kirke he had put together a group of young men who believed that their small country was going to be overrun by its larger neighbor and the only way to fight for freedom was to cooperate with the british poul had declared that the group who called themselves the nightwatchmen would not be saboteurs or assassins but would pass military information to british intelligence this achievement by hermiaunique for a womanhad won her promotion to head of the denmark desk the package contained some of the fruits of her foresight there was a batch of reports already decrypted for her by the code room on german military dispositions in denmark army bases on the central island of fyn naval traffic in the kattegat the sea that separated denmark from sweden and the names of senior german officers in copenhagen also in the package was a copy of an underground newspaper called reality the underground press was so far the only sign of resistance to the nazis in denmark she glanced through it reading an indignant article which claimed there was a shortage of butter because all of it was sent to germany the package had been smuggled out of denmark to a gobetween in sweden who passed it to the mi man at the british legation in stockholm with the package was a note from the gobetween saying he had also passed a copy of reality to the reuters wire service in stockholm hermia frowned at that on the surface it seemed a good idea to publicize news of conditions under the occupation but she did not like agents mixing espionage with other work resistance action could attract the attention of the authorities to a spy who might otherwise work unnoticed for years thinking about the nightwatchmen reminded her painfully of her fiance arne was not one of the group his character was all wrong she loved him for his careless joie de vivre he made her relax especially in bed but a happygolucky man with no head for mundane detail was not the type for secret work in her more honest moments she admitted to herself that she was not sure he had the courage he was a daredevil on the ski slopesthey had met on a norwegian mountain where arne had been the only skier more proficient than hermiabut she was not sure how he would face the more subtle terrors of undercover operations she had considered trying to send him a message via the nightwatchmen poul kirke worked at the flying school and if arne was still there they must see one another every day it would have been shamefully unprofessional to use the spy network for a personal communication but that did not stop her she would have been found out for sure because her messages had to be encrypted by the code room but even that might not have deterred her it was the danger to arne that held her back secret messages could fall into enemy hands the ciphers used by mi were unsophisticated poem codes left over from peacetime and could be broken easily if arnes name appeared in a message from british intelligence to danish spies he would probably lose his life hermias inquiry about him could turn into his death warrant so she sat in her boot room with acid anxiety burning inside her she composed a message to the swedish gobetween telling him to keep out of the propaganda war and stick to his job as courier then she typed a report to her boss containing all the military information in the package with carbon copies to other departments at four oclock she left she had more work to do and she would return for a couple of hours this evening but now she had to meet her mother for tea margaret mount lived in a small house in chelsea after hermias father had died of cancer in his late forties her mother had set up home with an unmarried school friend elizabeth they called each other mags and bets their adolescent nicknames today the two had come by train to bletchley to inspect hermias lodgings she walked quickly through the village to the street where she rented a room she found mags and bets in the parlor talking to her landlady mrs bevan hermias mother was wearing her ambulance drivers uniform with trousers and a cap bets was a pretty woman of fifty in a flowered dress with short sleeves hermia hugged her mother and gave bets a kiss on the cheek she and bets had never become close and hermia sometimes suspected bets was jealous of her closeness to her mother hermia took them upstairs bets looked askance at the drab little room with its single bed but hermias mother said heartily well this isnt bad for wartime i dont spend much time here hermia lied in fact she spent long lonely evenings reading and listening to the radio she lit the gas ring to make tea and sliced up a small cake she had bought for the occasion mother said i dont suppose youve heard from arne no i wrote to him via the british legation in stockholm and they forwarded the letter but i never heard back so i dont know whether he got it oh dear bets said i wish id met him whats he like falling in love with arne had been like skiing downhill hermia thought a little push to get started a sudden increase in speed and then before she was quite ready the exhilarating feeling of hurtling down the piste at a breakneck pace unable to stop but how to explain that he looks like a movie star hes a wonderful athlete and he has the charm of an irishman but thats not it hermia said its just so easy to be with him whatever happens he just laughs i get angry sometimesthough never at himand he smiles at me and says theres no one like you hermia i swear dear god i do miss him she fought back tears her mother said briskly plenty of men have fallen in love with you but there arent many who can put up with you magss conversational style was as unadorned as hermias own you should have nailed his foot to the floor while you had the chance hermia changed the subject and asked them about the blitz bets spent air raids under the kitchen table but mags drove her ambulance through the bombs hermias mother had always been a formidable woman somewhat too direct and tactless for a diplomats wife but war had brought out her strength and courage just as a secret service suddenly short of men had allowed hermia to flourish the luftwaffe cant keep this up indefinitely said mags they dont have an unending supply of aircraft and pilots if our bombers keep pounding german industry it must have an effect eventually bets said meanwhile innocent german women and children are suffering just as we do i know but thats what war is about said mags hermia recalled her conversation with digby hoare people like mags and bets imagined that the british bombing campaign was undermining the nazis it was a good thing they had no inkling that half the bombers were being shot down if people knew the truth they might give up mags began to tell a long story about rescuing a dog from a burning building and hermia listened with half an ear thinking about digby if freya was a machine and the germans were using it to defend their borders it might well be in denmark was there anything she could do to investigate digby had said the machine might emit some kind of beam either optical pulses or radio waves such emissions ought to be detectable perhaps her nightwatchmen could do something she began to feel excited about the idea she could send a message to the nightwatchmen but first she needed more information she would start work on it tonight she decided as soon as she had seen mags and bets back onto their train she began to feel impatient for them to go more cake mother she said jansborg skole was three hundred years old and proud of it originally the school had consisted of a church and one house where the boys ate slept and had lessons now it was a complex of old and new redbrick buildings the library at one time the finest in denmark was a separate building as large as the church there were science laboratories modern dormitories an infirmary and a gym in a converted barn harald olufsen was walking from the refectory to the gym it was twelve noon and the boys had just finished luncha makeityourself open sandwich with cold pork and pickles the same meal that had been served every wednesday throughout the seven years he had attended the school he thought it was stupid to be proud that the institution was old when teachers spoke reverently of the schools history he was reminded of old fishermens wives on sande who liked to say im over seventy now with a coy smile as if it were some kind of achievement as he passed the headmasters house the heads wife came out and smiled at him good morning mia he said politely the head was always called heis the ancient greek word for the number one so his wife was mia the feminine form of the same greek word the school had stopped teaching greek five years ago but traditions died hard any news harald she asked harald had a homemade radio that could pick up the bbc the iraqi rebels have been defeated he said the british have entered baghdad a british victory she said that makes a change mia was a plain woman with a homely face and lifeless brown hair always dressed in shapeless clothes but she was one of only two women at the school and the boys constantly speculated about what she looked like naked harald wondered if he would ever stop being obsessed with sex theoretically he believed that after sleeping with your wife every night for years you must get used to it and even become bored but he just could not imagine it the next lesson should have been two hours of maths but today there was a visitor he was svend agger an old boy of the school who now represented his hometown in the rigsdag the nations parliament the entire school was to hear him speak in the gym the only room big enough to hold all boys harald would have preferred to do maths he could not remember the precise moment when schoolwork had become interesting as a small boy he had regarded every lesson as an infuriating distraction from important business such as damming streams and building tree houses around the age of fourteen almost without noticing it he had begun to find physics and chemistry more exciting than playing in the woods he had been thrilled to discover that the inventor of quantum physics was a danish scientist niels bohr bohrs interpretation of the periodic table of the elements explaining chemical reactions by the atomic structure of the elements involved seemed to harald a divine revelation a fundamental and deeply satisfying account of what the universe was made of he worshipped bohr the way other boys adored kaj hansenlittle kajthe soccer hero who played inside forward for the team known as b kobenhavn harald had applied to study physics at the university of copenhagen where bohr was director of the institute of theoretical physics education cost money fortunately haralds grandfather seeing his own son enter a profession that would keep him poor all his life had provided for his grandsons his legacy had paid for arne and harald to go to jansborg skole it would also finance haralds time at university he entered the gym the younger boys had put out benches in neat rows harald sat at the back next to josef duchwitz josef was very small and his surname sounded like the english word duck so he had been nicknamed anaticula the latin word for a duckling over the years it had got shortened to tik the two boys had very different backgroundstik was from a wealthy jewish familyyet they had been close friends all through school a few moments later mads kirke sat next to harald mads was in the same year he came from a distinguished military family his grandfather a general his late father a defense minister in the thirties his cousin poul was a pilot with arne at the flying school the three friends were science students they were usually together and they looked comically differentharald tall and blond tik small and dark mads a freckled redheadso that when a witty english master had referred to them as the three stooges the nickname had stuck heis the head teacher came in with the visitor and the boys stood up politely heis was tall and thin with glasses perched on the bridge of a beaky nose he had spent ten years in the army but it was easy to see why he had switched to school teaching a mildmannered man he seemed apologetic about being in authority he was liked rather than feared the boys obeyed him because they did not want to hurt his feelings when they had sat down again heis introduced the parliamentary deputy a small man so unimpressive that anyone would have thought he was the schoolteacher and heis the distinguished guest agger began to talk about the german occupation harald remembered the day it had begun fourteen months ago he had been woken up in the middle of the night by aircraft roaring overhead the three stooges had gone up on the roof of the dormitory to watch but after a dozen or so aircraft had passed over nothing else happened so they went back to bed he had learned no more until morning he had been brushing his teeth in the communal bathroom when a teacher had rushed in and said the germans have landed after breakfast at eight oclock when the boys assembled in the gym for the morning song and announcements the head had told them the news go to your rooms and destroy anything that might indicate opposition to the nazis or sympathy with britain he had said harald had taken down his favorite poster a picture of a tiger moth biplane with raf roundels on its wings later that daya tuesdaythe older boys had been detailed to fill sandbags and carry them to the church to cover the priceless ancient carvings and sarcophagi behind the altar was the tomb of the schools founder his stone likeness lying in state dressed in medieval armor with an eyecatchingly large codpiece harald had caused great amusement by mounting a sandbag endup on the protrusion heis had not appreciated the joke and haralds punishment had been to spend the afternoon moving paintings to the crypt for safety all the precautions had been unnecessary the school was in a village outside copenhagen and it was a year before they saw any germans there had never been any bombing or even gunfire denmark had surrendered within twentyfour hours subsequent events have shown the wisdom of that decision said the speaker with irritating smugness and there was a susurration of dissent as the boys shifted uncomfortably in their seats and muttered comments our king continues on his throne agger went on next to harald mads grunted disgustedly harald shared madss annoyance king christian x rode out on horseback most days showing himself to the people on the streets of copenhagen but it seemed an empty gesture the german presence has been on the whole benign the speaker went on denmark has proved that a partial loss of independence due to the exigencies of war need not necessarily lead to undue hardship and strife the lesson for boys such as yourselves is that there may be more honor in submission and obedience than in illconsidered rebellion he sat down heis clapped politely and the boys followed suit though without enthusiasm if the head had been a shrewder judge of an audiences mood he would have ended the session then but instead he smiled and said well boys any questions for our guest mads was on his feet in an instant sir norway was invaded on the same day as denmark but the norwegians fought for two months doesnt that make us cowards his tone was scrupulously polite but the question was challenging and there was a rumble of agreement from the boys a naive view agger said his dismissive tone angered harald heis intervened norway is a land of mountains and fjords difficult to conquer he said bringing his military expertise to bear denmark is a flat country with a good road systemimpossible to defend against a large motorized army agger added to put up a fight would have caused unnecessary bloodshed and the end result would have been no different mads said rudely except that we would have been able to walk around with our heads held high instead of hanging them in shame it sounded to harald like something he might have heard at home from his military relations agger colored the better part of valor is discretion as shakespeare wrote mads said in fact sir that was said by falstaff the most famous coward in world literature the boys laughed and clapped now now kirke said heis mildly i know you feel strongly about this but theres no need for discourtesy he looked around the room and pointed to one of the younger boys yes borr sir dont you think herr hitlers philosophy of national pride and racial purity could be beneficial if adopted here in denmark woldemar borr was the son of a prominent danish nazi elements of it perhaps agger said but germany and denmark are different countries that was plain prevarication harald thought angrily couldnt the man find the guts to say that racial persecution was wrong heis said plaintively would any boy like to ask mr agger about his everyday work as a member of the rigsdag perhaps tik stood up aggers selfsatisfied tone had irritated him too dont you feel like a puppet he said after all its the germans who really rule us youre just pretending our nation continues to be governed by our danish parliament agger replied tik muttered yes so you get to keep your job the boys nearby heard him and laughed the political parties remaineven the communists agger went on we have our own police and our armed forces but the minute the rigsdag does something the germans disapprove of it will be closed down and the police and the military will be disarmed tik argued so youre acting in a farce heis began to look annoyed remember your manners please duchwitz he said peevishly thats all right heis said agger i like a lively discussion if duchwitz thinks our parliament is useless he should compare our circumstances with those prevailing in france because of our policy of cooperation with the germans life is a great deal better for ordinary danish people than it might be harald had heard enough he stood up and spoke without waiting for permission from heis and what if the nazis come for duchwitz he said will you advise friendly cooperation then and why should they come for duchwitz the same reason they came for my uncle in hamburgbecause hes a jew some of the boys looked around with interest they probably had not realized tik was jewish the duchwitz family were not religious and tik went along to services in the ancient redbrick church just like everyone else agger showed irritation for the first time the occupying forces have demonstrated complete tolerance toward danish jews so far harald argued but what if they change their minds suppose they decide that tik is just as jewish as my uncle joachim what is your advice to us then shall we stand aside while they march in and seize him or should we now be organizing a resistance movement in preparation for that day your best plan is to make sure you are never faced with such a decision by supporting the policy of cooperation with the occupying power the smooth evasiveness of the answer maddened harald but what if that doesnt work he persisted why wont you answer the question what do we do when the nazis come for our friends heis put in youre asking whats called a hypothetical question olufsen he said men in public life prefer not to meet trouble halfway the question is how far his policy of cooperation will go harald said hotly and there wont be time for debate when they bang on your door in the middle of the night heis for a moment heis looked ready to reprimand harald for rudeness but in the end he answered mildly youve made an interesting point and mr agger has answered it quite thoroughly he said now i think weve had a good discussion and its time to go back to our lessons but first lets thank our guest for taking the time out of his busy life to come and visit us he raised his hands to lead a round of applause harald stopped him make him answer the question he shouted should we have a resistance movement or will we let the nazis do anything they like for gods sake what lessons could be more important than this the room went quiet arguing with the staff was permitted within reason but harald had crossed the line into defiance i think youd better leave us heis said off you go and ill see you afterward this made harald furious boiling with frustration he stood up the room remained silent as all the boys watched him walk to the door he knew he should leave quietly but he could not bring himself to do it he turned at the door and pointed an accusing finger at heis you wont be able to tell the gestapo to leave the damn room he said then he went out and slammed the door peter flemmings alarm clock went off at half past five in the morning he silenced it turned on the light and sat upright in bed inge was lying on her back eyes open staring at the ceiling as expressionless as a corpse he looked at her for a moment then got up he went into the little kitchen of their copenhagen apartment and turned on the radio a danish reporter was reading a sentimental statement by the germans about the death of admiral lutjens who had gone down with the bismarck ten days ago peter put a small pot of oatmeal on the stove then laid a tray he buttered a slice of rye bread and made ersatz coffee he felt optimistic and after a moment he recalled why yesterday there had been a break in the case he was working on he was a detectiveinspector in the security unit a section of the copenhagen criminal investigation department whose job was to keep tabs on union organizers communists foreigners and other potential troublemakers his boss the head of the department was superintendent frederik juel clever but lazy educated at the famous jansborg skole juel was fond of the latin proverb quieta non movere let sleeping dogs lie he was descended from a hero of danish naval history but the aggression had long been bred out of his line in the past fourteen months their work had expanded as opponents of german rule had been added to the departments watch list so far the only outward sign of resistance had been the appearance of underground newspapers such as reality the one the olufsen boy had dropped juel believed the illegal newspapers were harmless if not actually beneficial as a safety valve and refused to pursue the publishers this attitude infuriated peter leaving criminals at large to continue their offenses seemed madness to him the germans did not really like juels laissezfaire attitude but so far they had not pushed the matter to a confrontation juels liaison with the occupying power was general walter braun a career soldier who had lost a lung in the battle of france brauns aim was to keep denmark tranquil at all costs he would not overrule juel unless forced to recently peter had learned that copies of reality were being smuggled to sweden until now he had been obliged to abide by his bosss handsoff rule but he hoped juels complacency would be shaken by the news that the papers were finding their way out of the country last night a swedish detective who was a personal friend of peters had called to say he thought the paper was being carried on a lufthansa flight from berlin to stockholm that stopped at copenhagen that was the breakthrough that accounted for peters feeling of excitement when he woke up he could be on the brink of a triumph when the oatmeal was ready he added milk and sugar then took the tray into the bedroom he helped inge sit upright he tasted the oatmeal to make sure it was not too hot then began to feed her with a spoon a year ago just before petrol restrictions came in peter and inge had been driving to the beach when a young man in a new sports car had crashed into them peter had broken both his legs and recovered rapidly inge had smashed her skull and she would never be the same the other driver finn jonk the son of a wellknown university professor had been thrown clear and landed in a bush unharmed he had no driving licenseit had been taken from him by the courts after a previous accidentand he had been drunk but the jonk family had hired a top lawyer who had succeeded in delaying the trial for a year so finn still had not been punished for destroying inges mind the personal tragedy for inge and peter was also an example of the disgraceful way crimes could go unpunished in modern society whatever you might say against the nazis they were gratifyingly tough on criminals when inge had eaten her breakfast peter took her to the toilet then bathed her she had always been scrupulously neat and clean it was one of the things he had loved about her she was especially clean about sex always washing carefully afterwardsomething he appreciated not all girls were like that one woman he had slept with a nightclub singer he had met during a raid and had a brief affair with had objected to his washing himself after sex saying it was unromantic inge showed no reaction as he bathed her he had learned to be equally unmoved even when he touched the most intimate parts of her body he dried her soft skin with a big towel then dressed her the most difficult part was putting her stockings on first he rolled the stocking leaving only the toe sticking out then he carefully eased it over her foot and unrolled it up her calf and over her knee finally fastening the top to the clips of the garter belt when he started doing this he had put runs in them every time but he was a persistent man and could be very patient when he had his mind set on achieving something and now he was expert he helped her into a cheerful yellow cotton dress then added a gold wristwatch and bracelet she could not tell the time but he sometimes thought she came near to smiling when she saw jewelry glinting on her wrists when he had brushed her hair they both looked at her reflection in the mirror she was a pretty pale blonde and before the accident she had had a flirtatious smile and a coy way of fluttering her eyelashes now her face was blank on their whitsun visit to sande peters father had tried to persuade him to put inge into a private nursing home peter could not afford the fees but axel was willing to pay he said he wanted peter to be free though the truth was he was desperate for a grandson to bear his name however peter felt it was his duty to take care of his wife for him duty was the most important of a mans obligations if he shirked it he would lose his selfrespect he took inge to the living room and sat her by the window he left the radio playing music at low volume then returned to the bathroom the face in his shaving mirror was regular and well proportioned inge had used to say he looked like a film star since the accident he had noticed a few gray hairs in his red morning stubble and there were lines of weariness around the orangebrown eyes but there was a proud look in the set of his head and an immovable rectitude in the straight line of his lips when he had shaved he tied his tie and strapped on his shoulder holster with the standard issue walther mm pistol the smaller sevenround ppk version designed as a concealed weapon for detectives then he stood in the kitchen and ate three slices of dry bread saving the scarce butter for inge the nurse was supposed to come at eight oclock between eight and five past peters mood changed he began to pace up and down the little hallway of the apartment he lit a cigarette then crushed it out impatiently he looked at his wristwatch every few seconds between five and ten past he became angry did he not have enough to cope with he combined caring for his helpless wife with a taxing and highly responsible job as a police detective the nurse had no right to let him down when she rang the doorbell at eightfifteen he threw open the door and shouted how dare you be late she was a plump girl of nineteen wearing a carefully pressed uniform her hair neatly arranged under her nurses cap her round face lightly made up she was shocked by his anger im sorry she said he stood aside to let her in he felt a strong temptation to strike her and she obviously sensed this for she hurried past him nervously he followed her into the living room you had time to do your hair and makeup he said angrily i said im sorry dont you realize that i have a very demanding job youve got nothing on your mind more important than walking with boys in the tivoli gardenyet you cant even get to work on time she looked nervously at his gun in the shoulder holster as if she was afraid he was going to shoot her the bus was late she said in a shaky voice get an earlier bus you lazy cow oh she looked about to cry peter turned away fighting an urge to slap her fat face if she walked out he would be in worse trouble he put on his jacket and went to the door dont you ever be late again he shouted then he left the apartment outside the building he jumped onto a tram heading for the city center he lit a cigarette and smoked in rapid puffs trying to calm himself he was still angry when he got off outside the politigaarden the daringly modern police headquarters but the sight of the building soothed him its squat shape gave a reassuring impression of strength its blindingly white stone spoke of purity and its rows of identical windows symbolized order and the predictability of justice he passed through the dark vestibule hidden in the center of the building was a large open courtyard circular with a ring of double pillars marking a sheltered walkway like the cloisters of a monastery peter crossed the courtyard and entered his section he was greeted by detective constable tilde jespersen one of a handful of women in the copenhagen force the young widow of a policeman she was as tough and smart as any cop in the department peter often used her for surveillance work a role in which a woman was less likely to arouse suspicion she was rather attractive with blue eyes and fair curly hair and the kind of small curvy figure that women would call too fat but men thought just right bus delayed she said sympathetically no inges nurse turned up a quarter of an hour late emptyheaded flibbertigibbet oh dear anything happening im afraid so general braun is with juel they want to see you as soon as you get here that was bad luck a visit from braun on the day peter was late damn nurse he muttered and headed for juels office juels upright carriage and piercing blue eyes would have suited his naval namesake he spoke german as a courtesy to braun all educated danes could get by in german and english as well where have you been flemming he said to peter we are waiting i apologize peter replied in the same language he did not give the reason for his lateness excuses were undignified general braun was in his forties he had probably been handsome once but the explosion that destroyed his lung had also taken away part of his jaw and the right side of his face was deformed perhaps because of his damaged appearance he always wore an immaculate field service uniform complete with high boots and holstered pistol he was courteous and reasonable in conversation his voice was a soft nearwhisper take a look at this if you would inspector flemming he said he had spread several newspapers on juels desk all folded open to show a particular report it was the same story in each newspaper peter saw an account of the butter shortage in denmark blaming the germans for taking it all the newspapers were the toronto globe and mail the washington post and the los angeles times also on the table was the danish underground newspaper reality badly printed and amateurlooking beside the legitimate publications but containing the original story the others had copied it was a small triumph of propaganda juel said we know most of the people who produce these homemade newspapers he spoke in a tone of languid assurance that irritated peter you might imagine from his manner that it was he not his famous ancestor who had defeated the swedish navy at the battle of koge bay we could pick them all up of course but id rather leave them alone and keep an eye on them then if they do something serious like blowing up a bridge well know who to arrest peter thought that was stupid they should be arrested now to stop them blowing up bridges but he had had this argument with juel before so he clamped his teeth together and said nothing braun said that might have been acceptable when their activities were confined to denmark but this story has gone all over the world berlin is furious and the last thing we need is a clampdown well have the damned gestapo stamping all over town in their jackboots stirring up trouble and throwing people in jail and god knows where it will end peter was gratified the news was having the effect he wanted im already working on this he said all these american newspapers got the story from the reuters wire service which picked it up in stockholm i believe the reality newspaper is being smuggled out to sweden good work said braun peter stole a glance at juel who looked angry so he should peter was a better detective than his boss and incidents such as this proved it two years ago when the post of head of the security unit had fallen vacant peter had applied for the job but juel had got it peter was a few years younger than juel but had more successful cases to his credit however juel belonged to a smug metropolitan elite who had all gone to the same schools and peter was sure they conspired to keep the best jobs for themselves and hold back talented outsiders now juel said but how could the newspaper be smuggled out all packages are inspected by the censors peter hesitated he had wanted to get confirmation before revealing what he suspected his information from sweden could be wrong however braun was right here in front of him pawing the earth and champing at the bit and this was not the moment to equivocate ive had a tip last night i spoke to a detective friend in stockholm who has been discreetly asking questions at the wire service office he thinks the newspaper comes on the lufthansa flight from berlin to stockholm that stops here braun nodded excitedly so if we search every passenger boarding the flight here in copenhagen we should find the latest edition yes does the flight go today peters heart sank this was not the way he worked he preferred to verify information before rushing into a raid but he was grateful for brauns aggressive attitudea pleasing contrast with juels laziness and caution anyway he could not hold back the avalanche of brauns eagerness yes in a few hours he said hiding his misgivings then lets get moving haste could ruin everything peter could not let braun take charge of the operation may i make a suggestion general of course we must act discreetly to avoid forewarning our culprit lets assemble a team of detectives and german officers but keep them here at headquarters until the last minute allow the passengers to assemble for the flight before we move in ill go alone to kastrup aerodrome to make arrangements quietly when the passengers have checked their baggage the aircraft has landed and refueled and theyre about to board it will be too late for anyone to slip away unnoticedand then we can pounce braun smiled knowingly youre afraid that a lot of germans marching around would give the game away not at all sir peter said with a straight face when the occupiers made fun of themselves it was not wise to join in it will be important for you and your men to accompany us in case there is any need to question german citizens brauns face stiffened his selfdeprecating sally rebuffed quite so he said he went to the door call me at my office when your team is ready to depart he left peter was relieved at least he had regained control his only worry was that brauns enthusiasm might have forced him to move too soon well done for tracing the smuggling route juel said condescendingly good detective work but it would have been tactful to tell me before you told braun im sorry sir peter said in fact it would not have been possible juel had already left for the day when the swedish detective had called last night but peter did not make the excuse all right juel said put together a squad and send them to me for briefing then go to the aerodrome and phone me when the passengers are ready to board peter left juels room and returned to tildes desk in the main office she was wearing a jacket blouse and skirt in different shades of light blue like a girl in a french painting how did it go she asked i was late but i made up for it good theres a raid on at the aerodrome this morning he told her he knew which detectives he wanted with him ill take bent conrad peder dresler and knut ellegard detective sergeant conrad was enthusiastically progerman detective constables dresler and ellegard had no strong political or patriotic feelings but were conscientious policemen who took orders and did a thorough job and id like you to come along too if you would in case there are female suspects to be searched of course juel will brief you all im going ahead to kastrup peter went to the door then turned back hows little stig tilde had a son six years old looked after by his grandmother during the working day she smiled hes fine his reading is coming along fast hell be chief of police one day her face darkened i dont want him to be a cop peter nodded tildes husband had been killed in a shootout with a gang of smugglers i understand she added defensively would you want your son to do this job he shrugged i dont have any children and im not likely to she gave him an enigmatic look you dont know what the future holds true he turned away he did not want to start that discussion on a busy day ill call in okay peter took one of the police departments unmarked black buicks recently equipped with twoway radio he drove out of the city and across a bridge to the island of amager where kastrup aerodrome was located it was a sunny day and from the road he could see people on the beach he looked like a businessman or lawyer in his conservative chalkstripe suit and discreetly patterned tie he did not have a briefcase but for verisimilitude he had brought with him a file folder filled with papers taken from a wastebasket he felt anxious as he approached the aerodrome if he could have had another day or two he might have been able to establish whether every flight carried illegal packages or only some there was a maddening possibility that today he might find nothing but his raid would alert the subversive group and they might change to a different route then he would have to start again the aerodrome was a scatter of low buildings on one side of a single runway it was heavily guarded by german troops but civilian flights continued to be operated by the danish airline ddl and the swedish aba as well as lufthansa peter parked outside the office of the airport controller he told the secretary he was from the governments aviation safety department and was admitted instantly the controller christian varde was a small man with a salesmans ready smile peter showed his police card there will be a special security check on the lufthansa flight to stockholm today he said it has been authorized by general braun who will be arriving shortly we must get everything ready a frightened look came over the face of the manager he reached for the phone on his desk but peter covered the instrument with his own hand no he said please do not forewarn anyone do you have a list of passengers expected to board the flight here my secretary does ask her to bring it in varde called his secretary and she brought a sheet of paper he gave it to peter peter said is the flight coming in on time from berlin yes varde checked his watch it should land in fortyfive minutes that was enough time just it would simplify peters task if he had to search only those passengers joining the flight in denmark i want you to call the pilot and say that no one will be permitted to deplane at kastrup today that includes passengers and crew very good he looked at the list the secretary had brought there were four names two danish men a danish woman and a german man where are the passengers now they should be checking in take their baggage but do not load it onto the aircraft until it has been searched by my men very well the passengers too will be searched before they board is anything else loaded here in addition to passengers and their luggage coffee and sandwiches for the flight and a bag of mail and the fuel of course the food and drink must be examined and the mailbag one of my men will observe the refueling fine go now and send the message to the pilot when all the passengers have checked in come and find me in the departure lounge but pleasetry to give the impression that nothing special is happening varde went out peter made his way to the departure area racking his brains to make sure he had thought of everything he sat in the lounge and discreetly studied the other passengers wondering which of them would end up in jail today instead of on a plane this morning there were scheduled flights to berlin hamburg the norwegian capital of oslo the southern swedish city of malmo and the danish holiday island of bornholm so he could not be sure which of the passengers were destined for stockholm there were only two women in the room a young mother with two children and a beautifully dressed older woman with white hair the older woman could be the smuggler peter thought her appearance might be intended to allay suspicion three of the passengers wore german uniforms peter checked his list his man was a colonel von schwarzkopf only one of the soldiers was a colonel but it was wildly unlikely that a german officer would smuggle danish underground newspapers all the others were men just like peter wearing suits and ties holding their hats in their laps trying to appear bored but patient as if waiting for a flight he watched everyone carefully alert for signs that someone had sensed the imminent security check some passengers looked nervous but that could just be fear of flying peter was most concerned to make sure no one tried to throw away a package or conceal papers somewhere in the lounge varde reappeared beaming as if delighted to see peter again he said all four passengers have checked in good it was time to begin tell them that lufthansa would like to offer them some special hospitality then take them to your office ill follow varde nodded and went to the lufthansa desk while he was asking the stockholm passengers to come forward peter went to a pay phone called tilde and told her all was ready for the raid varde led the group of four passengers away and peter tagged on to the little procession when they were assembled in vardes office peter revealed his identity he showed his police badge to the german colonel im acting under orders from general braun he said to forestall protests he is on his way here and will explain everything the colonel looked annoyed but sat down without comment and the other three passengersthe whitehaired lady and two danish businessmendid the same peter leaned against the wall watching them alert for guilty behavior each had a bag of some kind the old lady a large handbag the officer a slim document case the businessmen briefcases any of them could be carrying copies of an illegal newspaper varde said brightly may i offer you tea or coffee while youre waiting peter checked his watch the flight from berlin was due now he looked out of vardes window and saw it coming in to land the aircraft was a junkers ju trimotoran ugly machine he thought its surface was corrugated like a shed roof and the third engine protruding from the nose looked like the snout of a pig but it approached at a remarkably low speed for such a heavy aircraft and the effect was quite majestic it touched down and taxied to the terminal the door opened and the crew threw down the chocks that secured the wheels when the aircraft was parked braun and juel arrived with the four detectives peter had chosen while the waiting passengers were drinking the airports ersatz coffee peter watched keenly while his detectives emptied out the mens briefcases and the whitehaired ladys handbag it was quite possible the spy would have the illegal newspaper in hand baggage he thought then the traitor could claim he had brought it to read on the plane not that it would do him any good but the contents of the bags were innocent tilde took the lady into another room to be searched while the three male suspects removed their outer clothing braun patted down the colonel and sergeant conrad did the danes nothing was found peter was disappointed but he told himself it was much more likely that the contraband would be in checked baggage the passengers were allowed to return to the lounge but not to board the aircraft their luggage was lined up on the apron outside the terminal building two newlooking crocodile cases that undoubtedly belonged to the old lady a duffel bag that was probably the colonels a tan leather suitcase and a cheap cardboard one peter felt confident he would find a copy of reality in one of them bent conrad got the keys from the passengers i bet its the old woman he murmured to peter she looks like a jew to me just unlock the luggage peter said conrad opened all the bags and peter began to search them with juel and braun looking over his shoulders and a crowd of people watching through the window of the departure lounge he imagined the moment when he would triumphantly produce the newspaper and flourish it in front of everyone the crocodile cases were stuffed with expensive oldfashioned clothing which he dumped on the ground the duffel bag contained shaving tackle a change of underwear and a perfectly pressed uniform shirt the businessmans tan leather case held papers as well as clothing and peter looked through them all carefully but there were no newspapers or anything suspicious he had left the cheap cardboard suitcase until last figuring the less affluent businessman was the likeliest of the four passengers to be a spy the case was halfempty it held a white shirt and a black tie supporting the mans story that he was going to a funeral there was also a wellworn black bible but no newspaper peter began to wonder despairingly if his fears had been well founded and this was the wrong day for the raid he felt angry that he had let himself be pushed into acting prematurely he controlled his fury he was not finished yet he took a penknife from his pocket he pushed its point into the lining of the old ladys expensive luggage and tore a ragged gash in the white silk he heard juel grunt with surprise at the sudden violence of the gesture peter ran his hand beneath the ripped lining to his dismay nothing was hidden there he did the same to the businessmans leather case with the same result the second businessmens cardboard suitcase had no lining and peter could see nothing in its structure that might serve as a hiding place feeling his face redden with frustration and embarrassment he cut the stitching on the leather base of the colonels canvas duffel and felt inside for concealed papers there was nothing he looked up to see braun juel and the detectives staring at him their faces showed fascination and a hint of fear his behavior was beginning to look a little crazy he realized to hell with that juel said languidly perhaps your information was wrong flemming and wouldnt that please you peter thought resentfully but he was not finished yet he saw varde watching from the departure lounge and beckoned him the mans smile looked strained as he contemplated the wreckage of his customers luggage where is the mailbag peter said in the baggage office well what are you waiting for bring it here idiot varde went off peter pointed at the luggage with a disgusted gesture and said to his detectives get rid of this stuff dresler and ellegard repacked the suitcases roughly a baggage handler came to take them to the junkers wait peter said as the man began to pick up the cases search him sergeant conrad searched the man and found nothing varde brought the mailbag and peter emptied the letters on the ground they all bore the stamp of the censor there were two envelopes large enough to hold a newspaper one white and one brown he ripped open the white one it held six copies of a legal document some kind of contract the brown envelope contained the catalogue of a copenhagen glassware factory peter cursed aloud a trolley bearing a tray of sandwiches and several coffeepots was wheeled out for peters inspection this was peters last hope he opened each pot and poured the coffee out on the ground juel muttered something about this being unnecessary but peter was too desperate to care he pulled away the linen napkins covering the tray and poked about among the sandwiches to his horror there was nothing in a rage he picked up the tray and dumped the sandwiches on the ground hoping to find a newspaper underneath but there was only another linen napkin he realized he was going to be completely humiliated and that made him madder begin refueling he said ill watch a tanker was driven out to the junkers the detectives put out their cigarettes and looked on as aviation fuel was pumped into the wings of the aircraft peter knew this was useless but he persevered stubbornly wearing a wooden expression because he could not think what else to do passengers watched curiously through the rectangular windows of the junkers no doubt wondering why a german general and six civilians needed to observe the refueling the tanks were filled and the caps closed peter could not think of any way to delay the takeoff he had been wrong and now he looked a fool let the passengers board he said with suppressed fury he returned to the departure lounge his humiliation complete he wanted to strangle someone he had made a complete mess of things in front of general braun as well as superintendent juel the appointments board would feel justified in having picked juel instead of peter for the top job juel might even use this fiasco as an excuse for having peter shunted sideways to some lowprofile department such as traffic he stopped in the lounge to watch the takeoff juel braun and the detectives waited with him varde was standing nearby trying hard to look as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened they watched while the four angry passengers boarded the chocks were removed from the wheels by the ground crew and thrown on board then the door was closed as the aircraft moved off its stand peter was struck by inspiration stop the plane he said to varde juel said for gods sake varde looked as if he might cry he turned to general braun sir my passengers stop the plane peter repeated varde continued to look pleadingly at braun after a moment braun nodded do as he says varde picked up a phone juel said my god flemming this had better be good the aircraft rolled onto the runway turned a full circle and came back to its stand the door opened and the chocks were thrown down to the ground crew peter led the rest of the detectives out onto the apron the propellers slowed and stopped two men in overalls were wedging the chocks in front of the main wheels peter addressed one of them hand me that chock the man looked scared but did as he was told peter took the chock from him it was a simple triangular block of wood about a foot highdirty heavy and solid and the other one peter said ducking under the fuselage the mechanic picked up the other and handed it over it looked the same but felt lighter turning it over in his hands peter found that one face was a sliding lid he opened it inside was a package carefully wrapped in oilcloth peter gave a sigh of profound satisfaction the mechanic turned and ran stop him peter cried but it was unnecessary the man veered away from the men and tried to run past tilde no doubt imagining he could easily push her aside she turned like a dancer letting him pass then stuck out a foot and tripped him he went flying dresler jumped on him hauled him to his feet and twisted his arm behind his back peter nodded to ellegard arrest the other mechanic he must have known what was going on peter turned his attention to the package he unwrapped the oilcloth inside were two copies of reality he handed them to juel juel looked at the papers then up at peter peter stared at him expectantly saying nothing waiting juel said reluctantly well done flemming peter smiled just doing my job sir juel turned away peter said to his detectives handcuff both mechanics and take them to headquarters for questioning there was something else in the package peter pulled out a sheaf of papers clipped together they were covered with typed characters in fiveletter groups that made no sense he stared at them in puzzlement for a moment then enlightenment dawned and he realized this was a triumph greater than he had dreamed the papers he was holding bore a message in code peter handed the papers to braun i think we have uncovered a spy ring general braun looked at the papers and paled my god youre right perhaps the german military has a department that specializes in breaking enemy ciphers it certainly does good said peter hermia mount was about to get the sack this had never happened to her before she was bright and conscientious and her employers had always regarded her as a treasure despite her sharp tongue but her current boss herbert woodie was going to tell her she was fired as soon as he worked up the courage two danes working for mi had been arrested at kastrup aerodrome they were now in custody and undoubtedly being interrogated it was a bad blow to the nightwatchmen network woodie was a peacetime mi man a longserving bureaucrat he needed someone to blame and hermia was a suitable candidate hermia understood this she had worked for the british civil service for a decade and she knew its ways if woodie were forced to accept that the blame lay with his department he would pin it on the most junior person available woodie had never been comfortable working with a woman anyway and he would be happy to see her replaced by a man at first hermia was inclined to offer herself up as the sacrificial victim she had never met the two aircraft mechanicsthey had been recruited by poul kirkebut the network was her creation and she was responsible for the fate of the arrested men she was as upset as if they had already died and she did not want to go on after all she thought how much had she actually done to help the war effort she was just accumulating information none of it had ever been used men were risking their lives to send her photographs of copenhagen harbor with nothing much happening it seemed foolish but in fact she knew the importance of this laborious routine work at some future date a reconnaissance plane would photograph the harbor full of ships and military planners would need to know whether this represented normal traffic or the sudden buildup of an invasion forceand at that point hermias photographs would become crucial furthermore the visit of digby hoare had given an immediate urgency to her work the germans aircraft detection system could be the weapon that would win the war the more she thought about it the more likely it seemed that the key to the problem could lie in denmark the danish west coast seemed the ideal location for a warning station designed to detect bombers approaching germany and there was no one else in mi who had her groundlevel knowledge of denmark she knew poul kirke personally and he trusted her it could be disastrous if a stranger took over she had to keep her job and that meant outwitting her boss this is bad news woodie said sententiously as she stood in front of his desk his office was a bedroom in the old house of bletchley park flowered wallpaper and silkshaded wall lights suggested it had been occupied by a lady before the war now it had filing cabinets instead of wardrobes full of dresses and a steel map table where once there might have been a dressing table with spindly legs and a triple mirror and instead of a glamorous woman in a priceless silk negligee the room was occupied by a small selfimportant man in a gray suit and glasses hermia faked the appearance of calm theres always danger when an operative is interrogated of course she said however she thought of the two brave men being interrogated and tortured and her breath caught in her throat for a moment then she recovered however in this case i feel the risk is slight woodie grunted skeptically we may need to set up an inquiry her heart sank an inquiry meant an investigator from outside the department he would have to come up with a scapegoat and she was the obvious choice she began the defense she had prepared the two men arrested dont have any secrets to betray she said they were ground crew at the aerodrome one of the nightwatchmen would give them papers to be smuggled out and they would stow the contraband in a hollow wheel chock even so she knew they might reveal apparently innocent details about how they were recruited and run details which a clever spycatcher could use to track down other agents who passed them the papers matthies hertz a lieutenant in the army hes gone into hiding and the mechanics dont know anyone else in the network so our tight security has limited the damage to the organization hermia guessed that woodie was rehearsing a line he might speak to his superiors and she forced herself to flatter him exactly sir thats a good way of putting it but how did the danish police get to your people in the first place hermia had anticipated this question and her answer was carefully prepared i think the problem is at the swedish end ah woodie brightened sweden being a neutral country was not under his control he would welcome the chance of shifting the blame to another department take a seat miss mount thank you hermia felt encouraged woodie was reacting as she had hoped she crossed her legs and went on i think the swedish gobetween has been passing copies of the illegal newspapers to reuters in stockholm and this may have alerted the germans you have always had a strict rule that our agents stick to information gathering and avoid ancillary activities such as propaganda work this was more flattery she had never heard woodie say any such thing though it was a general rule in espionage however he nodded sagely indeed i reminded the swedes of your ruling as soon as i found out what was happening but i fear the damage had been done woodie looked thoughtful he would be happy if he could claim that his advice had been ignored he did not really like people to do as he suggested because when things went well they just took the credit themselves he preferred it if they ignored his counsel and things went wrong then he could say i told you so hermia said shall i do you a memo mentioning your rule and quoting my signal to the swedish legation good idea woodie liked this even better he would not be allocating blame himself merely quoting an underling who would incidentally be giving him credit for sounding the alarm then well need a new way of getting information out of denmark we cant use radio for this kind of material it takes too long to broadcast woodie had no idea how to organize an alternative smuggling route ah thats a problem he said with a touch of panic fortunately we have set up a fallback option using the boat train that crosses from elsinore in denmark to helsingborg in sweden woodie was relieved splendid he said perhaps i should say in my memo that youve authorized me to action that fine she hesitated and the inquiry you know im not sure that will be necessary your memo should serve to answer any questions she concealed her relief she was not going to be fired after all she knew she should quit while she was ahead but there was another problem she was desperate to raise with him this seemed like an ideal opportunity there is one thing we could do that would improve our security enormously sir indeed woodies expression said that if there were such a procedure he would already have thought of it we could use more sophisticated codes whats wrong with our poem and book codes agents of mi have been using them for years i fear the germans may have figured out how to break them woodie smiled knowingly i dont think so my dear hermia decided to take the risk of contradicting him may i show you what i mean without waiting for his answer she went on take a look at this coded message she quickly scribbled on her pad gsff cffs jo uif dbouffo she said the commonest letter is f obviously in the english language the letter used most commonly is e so the first thing a codebreaker would do is assume that f stands for e which gives you this gsee cees jo uie dboueeo it could still mean anything woodie said not quite how many fourletter words are there ending in double e im sure ive no idea only a few common ones flee free glee thee and tree now look at the second group miss mount i dont really have time just another few seconds sir there are many fourletter words with a double e in the middle what could the first letter be not a certainly but it could be b so think of words beginning bee that might logically come next flee been makes no sense free bees sounds odd although tree bees might be right woodie interrupted free beer he said triumphantly lets try that the next group is two letters and there arent many twoletter words an at in if it on of or and up are the commonest the fourth group is a threeletter word ending in e of which there are many but the commonest is the woodie was getting interested despite himself free beer at the something or in the something and that something is a sevenletter word with a double e in it so it ends eed eef eek eel eem een eep free beer in the canteen said woodie triumphantly yes hermia said she sat in silence looking at woodie letting the implications of what had just happened sink in after a few moments she said thats how easy our codes are to break sir she looked at her watch it took you three minutes he grunted a good party trick miss mount but the old hands at mi know more about this sort of thing than you take it from me it was no good she thought despairingly he would not be moved on this today she would have to try again later she forced herself to give in gracefully very good sir concentrate on your own responsibilities what are the rest of your nightwatchmen up to im about to ask them to keep their eyes open for any indications that the germans have developed longdistance aircraft detection good lord dont do that why not if the enemy finds out were asking that question hell guess weve got it but sirwhat if he does have it he doesnt you can rest assured the gentleman who came here from downing street last week seemed to think otherwise in strict confidence miss mount an mi committee looked into the whole radar question quite recently and concluded that it would be another eighteen months before the enemy developed such a system so hermia thought it was called radar she smiled thats so reassuring she lied i expect you were on the committee yourself sir woodie nodded in fact i chaired it thank you for setting my mind at rest ill get on with that memo jolly good hermia went out her face ached with smiling and she was exhausted by the effort of constantly deferring to woodie she had saved her job and she permitted herself a moment of satisfaction as she walked back to her own office but she had failed with the codes she had found out the name of the longdistance aircraft detection systemradarbut it was clear woodie would not let her investigate whether the germans had such a system in denmark she longed to do something of immediate value to the war effort all this routine work made her impatient and frustrated it would be so satisfying to see some real results and it might even justify what had happened to those two poor aircraft mechanics at kastrup she could investigate enemy radar without woodies permission of course he might find out but she was willing to take that risk however she did not know what to tell her nightwatchmen what should they be looking for and where she needed more information before she could brief poul kirke and woodie was not going to give it to her but he was not her only hope she sat down at her desk picked up the phone and said please connect me with number ten downing street she met digby hoare in trafalgar square she stood at the foot of nelsons column and watched him cross the road from whitehall she smiled at the energetic lopsided stride that already seemed to her characteristic of him they shook hands then walked toward soho it was a warm summer evening and the west end of london was busy its pavements thronged with people heading for theaters cinemas bars and restaurants the happy scene was marred only by bomb damage the occasional blackened ruin in a row of buildings standing out like a rotten tooth in a smile she had thought they were going for a drink in a pub but digby led her to a small french restaurant the tables either side of them were empty so they could talk without being overheard digby was wearing the same dark gray suit but this evening he had on a light blue shirt that set off his blue eyes hermia was pleased she had decided to wear her favorite piece of jewelry a panther brooch with emerald eyes she was keen to get down to business she had refused to go on a date with digby and she did not want him to get the idea that she might have changed her mind as soon as they had ordered she said i want to use my agents in denmark to find out whether the germans have radar he looked at her through narrowed eyes the question is more complicated than that its now beyond doubt that they have radar as we do but theirs is more effective than oursdevastatingly so oh she was taken aback woodie told me never mind were desperate to find out why their system is so good either they have invented something better than weve got or theyve devised a way of using it more effectivelyor both all right she rapidly readjusted her ideas in the light of this new information just the same it seems likely that some of this machinery is in denmark it would be a logical placeand the code name freya suggests scandinavia so what are my people looking for thats difficult he frowned we dont know what their machinery looks likethats the point isnt it i presume it gives out radio waves yes of course and presumably the signals travel a good distanceotherwise the warning wouldnt be early enough yes it would be useless unless the signals traveled at least say fifty miles probably more could we listen for them he raised his eyebrows in surprise yes with a radio receiver clever notioni dont know why no one else thought of it can the signals be distinguished from other transmissions such as normal broadcasts the news and so on he nodded youd be listening for a series of pulses probably very rapid say a thousand per second youd hear it as a continuous musical note so youd know it wasnt the bbc and it would be quite different from the dots and dashes of military traffic youre an engineer could you put together a radio receiver suitable for picking up such signals he looked thoughtful its got to be portable presumably it should pack into a suitcase and work off a battery so it can be used anywhere yes it might be possible theres a team of boffins in welwyn who do this stuff all day welwyn was a small town between bletchley and london exploding turnips radio transmitters concealed in bricks that sort of thing they could probably cobble something together their food came hermia had ordered a tomato salad it came with a sprinkling of chopped onion and a sprig of mint and she wondered why british cooks could not produce food that was simple and delicious like this instead of tinned sardines and boiled cabbage what made you set up the nightwatchmen digby asked her she was not sure what he meant it seemed like a good idea still not an idea that would occur to the average young woman if i may say so she thought back remembering the struggle she had had with another bureaucratic boss and asked herself why she had persisted i wanted to strike a blow against the nazis theres something about them that i find absolutely loathsome fascism blames problems on a false causepeople of other races i know but its not that its the uniforms the strutting and posturing and the way they howl out those hateful speeches it just makes me sick when did you experience all this there arent many nazis in denmark i spent a year in berlin in the thirties i watched them marching and saluting and spitting on people and smashing the windows of jewish shopkeepers i remember thinking these people have to be stopped before they spoil the whole world i still think so im more sure of that than anything he smiled me too hermia had a seafood fricassee and once again she was struck by what a french cook could do with common ingredients despite rationing the dish contained sliced eel some of the winkles beloved of londoners and flaked cod but it was all fresh and well seasoned and she tucked in with relish every now and again she caught digbys eye and he always had the same look a mixture of adoration and lust it alarmed her if he fell in love with her it could only lead to trouble and heartbreak but it was pleasing as well as embarrassing to have a man so obviously desire her at one point she felt herself flush and put her hand to her throat to hide her blushes she deliberately turned her thoughts to arne the first time she talked to him in the bar of a ski hotel in norway she knew she had found what was missing in her life now i understand why ive never had a satisfactory relationship with a man she had written to her mother its because i hadnt met arne when he proposed to her she had said if id known there were men like you id have married one years ago she said yes to everything he suggested she was normally so intent on having her own way that she had never been able to share an apartment with a girlfriend but with arne she lost her willpower every time he asked her to go out with him she accepted when he kissed her she kissed him back when he stroked her breasts under her ski sweater she just sighed with pleasure and when he knocked on the door of her hotel room at midnight she said im so glad youre here thinking of arne helped her to feel cooler toward digby and as they finished their meal she turned the conversation to the war an allied army including british commonwealth and free french forces had invaded syria it was a skirmish on the far fringes and they both found it hard to see the outcome as important the conflict in europe was all that really counted and here it was a war of bombers when they left the restaurant it was dark but there was a full moon they walked south heading for her mothers house in pimlico where hermia was going to spend the night as they were crossing st jamess park the moon went behind a cloud and digby turned to her and kissed her she could not help admiring the swift sureness of his moves his lips were on hers before she could turn away with a strong hand he pulled her body to his and her breasts pressed against his chest she knew she should be indignant but to her consternation she found herself responding she suddenly remembered what it was like to feel a mans hard body and hot skin and in a rush of desire she opened her mouth to him they kissed hungrily for a minute then his hand went to her breast and that broke the spell she was too old and respectable to be groped in a park she broke the clinch the thought of taking him home crossed her mind she imagined the pained disapproval of mags and bets and the picture made her laugh what is it he said she saw that he looked hurt he probably imagined her laughter had to do with his disability i must remember how vulnerable he is to mockery she thought she hastened to explain my mother is a widow who lives with a middleaged spinster i just thought how they would react if i told them i wanted to bring a man home for the night the hurt look went away i like your thinking he said and he tried to kiss her again she was tempted but thought of arne and put a resisting hand on digbys chest no more she said firmly walk me home they left the park the momentary euphoria faded and she began to feel troubled how could she enjoy kissing digby when she loved arne as they passed big ben and westminster abbey an airraid warning put all such thoughts out of her mind digby said do you want to find a shelter many londoners no longer took cover during air raids fed up with sleepless nights some had decided it was worth risking the bombs others had become fatalistic saying that a bomb either had your number on it or not and there was nothing you could do either way hermia was not quite so blase but on the other hand she had no intention of spending the night in an airraid shelter with the amorous digby she nervously twisted the engagement ring on her left hand were only a few minutes away she replied do you mind if we keep going i may be forced to spend the night at your mothers house after all at least ill be chaperoned they hurried through westminster into pimlico searchlights probed the scattered clouds then they heard the sinister low drone of heavy aircraft like a large beast growling hungrily deep in its throat an antiaircraft gun boomed somewhere and flak burst in the sky like fireworks hermia wondered whether her mother was out driving her ambulance tonight to hermias horror bombs started to fall nearby although it was normally the industrial east end that was hardest hit there was a deafening crump that seemed to come from the next street a minute later a fire engine roared by hermia walked on as fast as she could digby said youre so coolarent you scared of course im scared she said impatiently im just not panicking they turned a corner and saw a blazing building the fire engine was outside and the men were unrolling hoses how much farther digby asked next street hermia said panting when they rounded the next corner they saw another fire engine at the far end of the street near magss house oh god hermia said and she broke into a run her heart pounded with fear as she dashed along the pavement there was an ambulance she saw and at least one house in her mothers section had been hit no please she said aloud coming closer she was perplexed that she could not identify her mothers house though she saw clearly that the house next door was on fire she stopped and stared trying to understand what she was looking at then at last she realized that her mothers house was gone nothing was left of it but a gap in the terrace and a pile of debris she groaned in despair digby said is that the house hermia nodded unable to speak digby called to a fireman in an authoritative voice you he said any sign of the occupants of this building yes sir said the fireman one person was blown clear by the blast he pointed to the small front yard of the undamaged house on the far side there was a body on a stretcher lying on the ground the face was covered hermia felt digby take her arm together they entered the yard hermia knelt down and digby uncovered the face its bets hermia said with a sickeningly guilty feeling of relief digby was looking around whos that sitting on the wall hermia looked up and her heart lurched as she recognized the figure of her mother dressed in her ambulance uniform and tin hat slumped on the low wall as if all the life had gone out of her mother she said her mother looked up and hermia saw that tears were streaming down her face hermia went to her and put her arms around her bets is dead her mother said im sorry mother she loved me so much her mother sobbed i know do you do you know she waited all her life for me did you realize that all her life hermia hugged her mother hard im so sorry she said there had been about two hundred danish ships at sea on the morning of april when hitler invaded denmark all that day danishlanguage broadcasts by the bbc appealed to sailors to head for allied ports rather than return home to a conquered country in total about five thousand men accepted the offer of refuge most sought harbor on the east coast of england hoisted the union jack and continued to sail throughout the war under the british flag consequently by the middle of the following year small communities of danes had settled in several english ports hermia decided to go to the fishing town of stokeby she had visited the place twice previously to talk to the danes there on this occasion she told her boss herbert woodie that her mission was to check her somewhat outofdate plans of the main danish ports and make any alterations necessary he believed her she had a different story for digby hoare digby came to bletchley two days after the bomb destroyed her mothers house with a radio receiver and direction finder neatly packed into a usedlooking tan leather suitcase as he showed her how to use the equipment she thought guiltily of the kiss in the park and how much she had enjoyed it and wondered uneasily how she would be able to look arne in the eye her original plan had been to attempt to smuggle the radio receiver to the nightwatchmen but she had since thought of something simpler the signals from the radar apparatus could probably be picked up at sea just as easily as on land she told digby she was going to pass the suitcase to the captain of a fishing boat and teach him how to use it digby approved that plan might well have worked but in truth she did not want to hand such an important job over to someone else so she intended to go herself in the north sea between england and denmark there was a large sandbank known as dogger bank where the sea was as shallow as fifty feet in places and the fishing was good both british and danish ships trawled there strictly speaking denmarkbased vessels were banned from venturing so far from their coast but germany needed herrings so the ban was irregularly enforced and constantly defied for some time hermia had had it in the back of her mind that messagesor even peoplemight travel between the two countries on fishing boats transferring from danish to british or vice versa in the middle now however she had a better idea the far end of the dogger bank was only a hundred miles from the danish coast if all her guesswork turned out to be right the signals from the freya machine should be detectable from the fishing ground she took a train on friday afternoon she was dressed for the sea in trousers boots and a loose sweater with her hair pushed under a mans checked cap as the train rolled through the flat fen country of eastern england she worried whether her plan would work would she find a ship willing to take her would she pick up the signals she was expecting or was the whole thing a waste of time after a while her mind turned to her mother mags had been under control again yesterday at betss funeral appearing calmly sorrowful rather than stricken by grief and today she had gone to cornwall to stay with her sister hermias aunt bella but on the night of the bomb her soul had been laid bare the two women had been devoted friends but it was clearly more than that hermia did not really want to think what else could be involved but she could not help being intrigued setting aside the embarrassing thought of what physical relation there might have been between mags and bets hermia was shocked that her mother had nourished a passionate lifelong attachment that had remained carefully disguised all those years from hermia herself and presumably from magss husband hermias father she arrived in stokeby at eight oclock on a mild summer evening and went from the railway station straight to the shipwrights arms pub on the dockside it took her only a few minutes of asking around to learn that sten munch a danish captain she had met on her last visit here was due to sail in the morning in his vessel morganmand which meant early riser she found sten at his house on the hillside clipping the hedge in his front garden like a born englishman he invited her in he was a widower and lived with his son lars who had been on the boat with him on april lars had since married a local girl carol when hermia went inside carol was nursing a tiny baby a few days old lars made tea they all spoke english for carols sake hermia explained that she needed to get as close as possible to the danish coast in an attempt to listen to a german wireless transmissionshe did not say what kind sten did not question her story of course he said expansively anything to help defeat the nazis but my boat is not really suitable why not its very smallonly thirtyfive feetand well be away for about three days hermia had been expecting this she had told woodie she needed to get her mother settled in new accommodation and would be back sometime next week thats all right she told sten ive got time my boat has only three berths we sleep in shifts its not designed for ladies you should go in a larger vessel is there one leaving in the morning sten looked at lars who said no three set off yesterday wont return until next week peter gorning should be back tomorrow hell go out again about wednesday she shook her head too late carol looked up from her baby they sleep in their clothes you know thats why they stink when they get home its worse than the smell of the fish hermia immediately liked her for her downtoearth directness ill be fine she said i can sleep in my clothes in a bed still warm from the previous occupant it wont kill me sten said you know i want to help but the sea is not for women you were made for the gracious things in life carol snorted scornfully like giving birth hermia smiled grateful to have carol as an ally exactly we can put up with discomfort carol nodded vigorously think of what charlies going through in the desert she explained to hermia my brother charlies in the army somewhere in north africa sten looked cornered he did not want to take hermia but he was reluctant to say so wanting to appear patriotic and brave we leave at three oclock in the morning ill be there carol said you might as well stay here now weve got a spare room she looked at her fatherinlaw if thats all right with you pa he had run out of excuses of course he said thank you said hermia youre very kind they went to bed early hermia did not undress but sat up in her room with the light on she was afraid that if she overslept sten would leave without her the munch family were not great readers and the only book she could find was the bible in danish but it kept her awake at two oclock she went to the bathroom and washed quickly then tiptoed downstairs and put the kettle on sten appeared at half past two when he saw hermia in the kitchen he looked surprised and disappointed she poured tea into a big cup and he took it gratefully enough hermia sten and lars walked down the hill to the quay a few minutes before three oclock two more danish men were waiting at the dockside the morganmand was very small thirtyfive feet was about the length of a london bus the vessel was made of wood and had one mast and a diesel engine on deck was a small wheelhouse and a series of hatches over the hold from the wheelhouse a companionway led down to the living quarters at the stern end were the massive spars and the winding gear for the nets dawn was breaking as the little vessel threaded its way through the defensive minefield at the mouth of the harbor the weather was fine but they encountered a swell of five or six feet as soon as they left the shelter of the land fortunately hermia was never seasick throughout the day she tried to make herself useful around the boat she knew no seamanship so she kept the galley clean the men were used to preparing food for themselves but she washed their dishes and the frying pan in which they cooked almost everything they ate she made sure she talked to the two crewmen speaking danish getting on terms of respectful friendliness with each of them when she had nothing else to do she sat on the deck and enjoyed the sunshine toward midday they reached the outer silver pit on the southeast corner of the dogger bank and began to trawl the boat reduced speed and headed northeast at first they could not find the fish and the nets came up almost empty then toward the end of the afternoon the fish started running at nightfall hermia went below and lay on a bunk she thought she would not sleep but she had been up for thirtysix hours and tiredness got the better of tension she dropped off within minutes during the night she was awakened briefly by the volcanic rumble of a flight of bombers overhead she wondered vaguely whether it was the raf heading for germany or the luftwaffe going the other way then drifted off to sleep again the next thing she knew lars was shaking her were approaching our nearest point to denmark he said were about a hundred and twenty miles off morlunde hermia took her suitcase receiver up on deck it was already full daylight the men were hauling in a net full of flapping fish mainly herrings and mackerel and tipping them into the hold hermia found it a gruesome sight and looked away she connected the battery to the radio and was relieved to see the dials flicker she fixed the aerial to the mast with a length of wire thoughtfully provided by digby she let the set warm up then put on the headphones as the boat motored northeast hermia roamed up and down the wireless frequencies as well as the bbcs broadcasts in english she picked up french dutch german and danish radio programs plus a host of morse transmissions which she presumed were military signals from both sides at the first pass up and down she heard nothing that might have been radar she repeated the exercise more slowly making sure she missed nothing she had plenty of time but once again she did not hear what she was listening for she kept trying after two hours she noticed that the men had stopped fishing and were watching her she caught the eye of lars who said any luck she pulled off the headphones im not picking up the signal i was expecting she said in danish sten replied in the same language the fish were running all night weve done wellour hold is full were ready to go home would you motor north for a while i must try to find this signalits really important sten looked doubtful but his son said we can afford it weve had a good night sten was reluctant what if a german spotter plane flies overhead hermia said you could throw out nets and pretend to be fishing there are no fishing grounds where you want to go german pilots dont know that one of the crew put in if its to help free denmark the other hand nodded vigorously once again hermia was saved by stens reluctance to appear cowardly in front of others all right he said well head north keep a hundred miles off the coast hermia said as she put the headphones back on she continued to scan the frequencies as time went by she became less hopeful the likeliest place for a radar station was at the southern end of denmarks coast near the border with germany she had thought she would pick up the broadcast early but her hopes fell by the hour as the boat headed north she was not willing to leave the set alone for more than a minute or two so the fishermen brought her tea at intervals and a bowl of canned stew at suppertime while listening she gazed east she could not see denmark but she knew arne was there somewhere and she enjoyed feeling closer to him toward nightfall sten knelt on the deck beside her to talk and she took off the headphones were off the northern point of the jutland peninsula he said we have to turn back in desperation she said could we go closer maybe a hundred miles offshore is too far away to pick up the signal we need to head for home could we follow the coast southward retracing our course but fifty miles closer to land too dangerous its almost dark there are no spotter planes at night i dont like it please its very important she shot an appealing look at lars who was standing nearby listening he was bolder than his father perhaps because he saw his future in britain with his english wife as she was hoping lars joined in how about seventyfive miles offshore that would be great lars looked at his father we have to go south anyway it wont add more than a few hours to our voyage sten said angrily well be putting our crew in danger lars replied mildly think of carols brother in africa hes put himself in danger this is our chance to do something to help all right you take the wheel sten said sulkily im going to sleep he stepped into the wheelhouse and flung himself down the companionway hermia smiled at lars thanks we should thank you lars turned the boat around and hermia continued to scan the airwaves night fell they sailed without lights but the sky was clear and there was a threequarter moon which made hermia feel that the boat must be conspicuous however they saw no aircraft and no other shipping periodically lars checked their position with a sextant her mind drifted back to the air raid she and digby had been in a few days ago it was the first time she had been caught out of doors during a raid she had managed to remain calm but it had been a terrifying scene the drone of the aircraft the searchlights and the flak the crump of falling bombs and the hellish light of burning houses yet here she was doing her best to help the raf inflict the same horrors on german families it seemed madbut the only alternative was to let the nazis take over the world it was a short midsummer night and dawn broke early the sea was unusually calm a morning mist rose from the surface reducing visibility and making hermia feel safer as the boat continued south she became more anxious she must pick up the signal soonunless she and digby were wrong and herbert woodie right sten came on deck with a mug of tea in one hand and a bacon sandwich in the other well he said have you got what you wanted its most likely to come from the south of denmark she said or nowhere at all she nodded despondently im beginning to think youre right then she heard something wait she had been scanning upward through the frequencies and thought she had heard a musical note she reversed the knob and went down searching for the spot she got a lot of static then the note againa pure machinelike tone about an octave above middle c i think this could be it she said joyfully the wavelength was meters she made a note in the little book digby had tucked into the suitcase now she had to determine the direction incorporated into the receiver was a dial graduated from one to with a needle pointing to the source of the signal digby had emphasized that the dial had to be aligned precisely with the center line of the boat then the direction of the signal could be calculated from the heading of the boat and the needle on the dial lars she called whats our heading eastsoutheast he said no exactly well although the weather was fine and the sea was calm nevertheless the boat was moving all the time and the compass was never still as best you can she said one hundred and twenty degrees the needle on her dial pointed to adding to that brought the direction around to hermia made a note and what is our position wait a minute when i shot the stars we were crossing the fiftysixth parallel he looked at the log checked his wristwatch and called out their latitude and longitude hermia wrote down the numbers knowing they were only an estimate sten said are you satisfied now can we go home i need another reading so that i can triangulate the source of the broadcast he grunted in disgust and walked away lars winked at her she kept the receiver tuned to the note as they motored south the needle on the direction finder moved imperceptibly after half an hour she again asked lars for the boats heading still onetwenty the needle on her dial now pointed to the direction of the signal was therefore she asked him to estimate their position again and wrote the numbers down home he said yes and thank you he turned the wheel hermia was triumphant but she could not wait to find out where the signal was coming from she went into the wheelhouse and found a largescale chart with larss help she marked the two positions she had noted and drew lines for the bearing of the signal from each position correcting for true north the lines intersected off the coast near the island of sande my god hermia said thats where my fiance comes from sande i know iti went to watch the racing car speed trials there a few years back she was jubilant her guess had been right and her method had worked the signal she had been expecting was coming from the most logical place now she needed to send poul kirke or one of his team to sande to look around as soon as she returned to bletchley she would send a coded message a few minutes later she took another heading the signal was weak now but the third line on the map made a triangle with the other two and the island of sande lay mainly within that triangle all the calculations were approximate but the conclusion seemed clear the radio signal was coming from the island she could hardly wait to tell digby harald thought the tiger moth was the most beautiful machine he had ever seen it looked like a butterfly poised for flight its upper and lower wings spread wide its toycar wheels resting lightly on the grass it long tail tapering behind the weather was fine with gentle breezes and the little aircraft trembled in the wind as if eager to take off it had a single engine in the nose driving the big creampainted propeller behind the engine were two open cockpits one in front of the other it was cousin to the dilapidated hornet moth he had seen in the ruined monastery at kirstenslot and the two aircraft were mechanically similar except that the hornet moth had an enclosed cabin with seats side by side however the hornet moth had looked sorry for itself leaning to one side on its broken undercarriage its fabric torn and oilstained its upholstery bursting by contrast the tiger moth had a sprightly look with new paint bright on its fuselage and the sun glinting off its windscreen its tail rested on the ground and its nose pointed up as if it were sniffing the air youll notice that the wings are flat underneath but curved above said haralds brother arne olufsen when the aircraft is moving the air traveling over the top of the wing is forced to move faster than the air passing underneath he gave the engaging grin that made people forgive him anything for reasons i have never understood this lifts the aircraft off the ground it creates a pressure difference harald said indeed arne replied dryly the senior class at jansborg skole were spending the day at the army aviation school at vodal they were being shown around by arne and his friend poul kirke it was a recruiting exercise by the army who were having trouble persuading bright young men to join a military force that had nothing to do heis with his army background liked jansborg to send one or two pupils into the military each year for the boys the visit was a welcome break from exam revision the hinged surfaces on the lower wings are called ailerons arne told them they are connected by cables to the control column which is sometimes called the joystick for reasons you are too young to understand he grinned again when the stick is moved to the left the left aileron moves up and the right one down this causes the aircraft to tilt and turn left we call it banking harald was fascinated but he wanted to get in and fly youll observe that the rear half of the tailplane is also hinged arne said this is called the elevator and it points the aircraft up or down pull back on the stick and the elevator tilts up depressing the tail so that the aircraft climbs harald noticed that the upright part of the tail also had a flap whats that for he asked pointing at it this is the rudder controlled by a pair of pedals in the footwell of the cockpit it works in the same way as the rudder of a boat mads put in why do you need a rudder you use the ailerons to change direction good point arne said shows that youre listening but cant you figure it out why would we need a rudder as well as ailerons to steer the aircraft harald guessed you cant use the ailerons when youre on the runway because the wings would hit the ground correct we use the rudder while taxiing when we cant tilt the wings because they would hit the ground we also use the rudder in the air to control unwanted sideways movement of the aircraft which is called yaw the fifteen boys had toured the air base sat through a lectureon opportunities pay and training in the armyand had lunch with a group of young pupil pilots now they were eager for the individual flying lesson which had been promised to each of them as the climax of the day five tiger moths were lined up on the grass danish military aircraft had been officially grounded since the beginning of the occupation but there were exceptions the flying school was allowed to give lessons in gliders and special permission had been granted for todays exercise in tiger moths just in case anyone had the idea of flying a tiger moth all the way to sweden two messerschmitt me fighter aircraft stood on the runway ready to give chase and shoot down anyone who tried to escape poul kirke took over the commentary from arne i want you to look into the cockpit one at a time he said stand on the black walkway on the lower wing dont step anywhere else or your foot will go through the fabric and you wont be able to fly tik duchwitz went first poul said on the left side you see a silvercolored throttle lever which controls the speed of the engine and lower down a green trim lever which applies a spring loading to the elevator control if the trim is correctly set when cruising the aircraft should fly level when you take your hand off the stick harald went last he could not help being interested despite his resentment of the smoothly arrogant way poul had swept karen duchwitz off on her bicycle as he stepped down poul said so what do you think harald harald shrugged it seems straightforward then you can go first poul said with a grin the others laughed but harald was pleased lets all get kitted up poul said they returned to the hangar and put on flying suitsstepin overalls that buttoned in front helmets and goggles were also given out to haralds annoyance poul made a point of helping him last time we met was at kirstenslot poul said as he adjusted haralds goggles harald nodded curtly not wishing to be reminded still he could not help wondering exactly what pouls relationship with karen was were they just dating or something more did she kiss him passionately and let him touch her body did they talk of getting married had they had sexual intercourse he did not want to think about these things but he could not help it when they were ready the first five students returned to the field each with a pilot harald would have liked to go up with his brother but once again poul chose harald it was almost as if he wanted to get to know harald better an airman in oily overalls was refueling the aircraft standing with one foot in a toehold in the fuselage the tank was in the center of the upper wing where it passed above the front seata worrying position harald felt would he be able to forget the gallons of inflammable fluid over his head first the preflight inspection poul said he leaned into the cockpit we check that the magneto switches are off and the throttle is closed he looked at the wheels chocks in place he kicked the tires and wiggled the ailerons you mentioned that you had worked on the new german base at sande he said casually yes what sort of work just general laboringdigging holes mixing concrete carrying bricks poul moved to the back of the aircraft and checked the movement of the elevators did you find out what the place is for not then no as soon as the basic construction work was done the danish workers were dismissed and the germans took over but im pretty sure its a radio station of some kind i think you mentioned that last time but how do you know ive seen the equipment poul looked at him sharply and harald realized this was no casual inquiry is it visible from outside no the place is fenced and guarded and the radio equipment is screened by trees except on the side facing the sea and that part of the beach is off limits so how come you saw it i was in a hurry to get home so i took a shortcut across the base poul crouched down behind the rudder and checked the tail skid shoe so he said what did you see a large aerial the biggest ive ever come across maybe twelve feet square on a rotating base the airman who had been refueling the aircraft interrupted the conversation ready when you are sir poul said to harald ready to fly front or back the trainee always sits in the back harald climbed in he had to stand on the bucket seat then ease himself down the cockpit was narrow and he wondered how fat pilots managed then he realized there were no fat pilots because of the noseup angle at which the aircraft sat on the grass he could see nothing in front of him but the clear blue sky he had to lean out to one side to see the ground ahead he put his feet on the rudder pedals and his right hand on the control stick experimentally he moved the stick from side to side and saw the ailerons move up and down at his command with his left hand he touched the throttle and trim lever on the fuselage just outside his cockpit were two small knobs which he assumed were the twin magneto switches poul leaned in to adjust haralds safety harness these aircraft were designed for training so they have dual controls he said while im flying rest your hands and feet lightly on the controls and feel how im moving them ill tell you when to take over how will we talk poul pointed to a yshaped rubber pipe like a doctors stethoscope this works like the speaking tube on a ship he showed harald how to fix the ends to earpieces in his flying helmet the foot of the y was plugged into an aluminum pipe which undoubtedly led to the front cockpit another tube with a mouthpiece was used for speaking poul climbed into the front seat a moment later harald heard his voice through the speaking tube can you hear me loud and clear the airman stood by at the left front of the aircraft and a shouted dialogue ensued with the airman asking questions and poul answering ready to start sir ready to start fuel on switches off throttle closed fuel is on switches are off throttle is closed harald expected the airman to turn the propeller at that point but instead he moved to the right side of the aircraft opened the cowling panel in the fuselage and fiddled with the enginepriming it harald assumed then he closed the panel and returned to the nose of the aircraft sucking in sir he said then he reached up and pulled the propeller blade down he repeated the action three times and harald guessed this procedure drew fuel into the cylinders the airman reached over the lower wing and flicked the two little switches just outside haralds cockpit throttle set harald felt the throttle lever move forward half an inch under his hand then heard poul say throttle set contact poul reached out and flicked the switches forward of his cockpit once again the airman swung the propeller this time stepping back smartly immediately afterward the engine fired and the propeller turned there was a roar and the little aircraft trembled harald had a sudden vivid sense of how light and frail it was and remembered with a sense of shock that it was made not of metal but of wood and linen the vibration was not like that of a car or even a motorcycle which felt solid and firmly grounded by comparison this was more like climbing a young tree and feeling the wind shake its slender branches harald heard pouls voice over the speaking tube we have to let the engine warm up it takes a few minutes harald thought about pouls questions on the subject of the base at sande this was not idle curiosity he felt sure poul had a purpose he wanted to know the strategic importance of the base why was poul part of some secret resistance movement what else could it be the engine note rose and poul reached out and turned the magneto switches off and on again in turnperforming yet another safety check harald assumed then the note declined to idling pitch and at last poul signaled to the airman to remove the wheel chocks harald felt a lurch and the aircraft moved forward the pedals at his feet moved as poul used the rudder to steer the aircraft across the grass they taxied to the runway which was marked by little flags and turned into the wind then they stopped and poul said a few more checks before we take off for the first time it occurred to harald that what he was about to do was dangerous his brother had been flying for years without an accident but other pilots had crashed and some had died he told himself that people died in cars on motorcycles and aboard boatsbut somehow this felt different he made himself stop thinking about the dangers he was not about to panic and disgrace himself in front of the class suddenly the throttle lever beneath his hand moved smoothly forward the engine roared louder and the tiger moth eagerly moved along the runway after only a few seconds the control stick eased away from haralds knees and he felt himself tip forward slightly as the tail lifted behind him the little aircraft gathered speed rattling and shaking over the grass haralds blood seemed to thrill with excitement then the stick eased back under his hand the aircraft seemed to jump from the ground and they were airborne it was exhilarating they climbed steadily to one side harald could see a small village in crowded denmark there were not many places from which you could not see a village poul banked right feeling himself tipped sideways harald fought the panicky notion that he was going to fall out of the cockpit to calm himself he looked at the instruments the rev counter showed two thousand rpm and their speed was sixty miles per hour they were at an altitude of one thousand feet already the needle on the turnandslip indicator pointed straight up the aircraft straightened out and leveled off the throttle lever moved back the engine note dipped and the revs slipped back to nineteen hundred poul said are you holding the stick yes check the line of the horizon it probably goes through my head in one ear and out the other when i release the controls i want you to simply keep the wings level and the horizon in the same place relative to my ears feeling nervous harald said okay you have control harald felt the aircraft come alive in his hands as every slight movement he made affected its flight the line of the horizon fell to pouls shoulders showing that the nose had lifted and he realized that a barely conscious fear of diving to the ground was making him pull back on the stick he pushed it forward infinitesimally and had the satisfaction of seeing the horizon line slowly rise to pouls ears the aircraft lurched sideways and banked harald felt he had lost control and they were about to fall out of the sky what was that he cried just a gust of wind correct for it but not too much fighting back panic harald moved the stick against the direction of bank the aircraft lurched in the other direction but at least he felt he was controlling it and he corrected again with another small movement then he saw that he was climbing again and brought the nose down he found he had to concentrate fiercely on responding to the aircrafts slightest motion just to keep a steady course he felt that a mistake could send him crashing to the ground when poul spoke harald resented the interruption thats very good poul said youre getting the hang of it harald felt he just needed to practice for another year or two now press lightly on the rudder pedals with both feet poul said harald had not thought about his feet for a while all right he said brusquely look at the turnandslip indicator harald wanted to say for gods sake how can i do that and fly the aircraft at the same time he forced himself to take his eyes off the horizon for a second and look at the instrument panel the needle was still in the twelve noon position he looked back at the horizon and found that he had lifted the nose again he corrected when i take my feet off the rudder youll find the nose will yaw left and right with the turbulence in case youre not sure check the indicator when the aircraft yaws left the needle will move to the right telling you to press down with your right foot to correct all right harald felt no sideways movement but a few moments later when he managed to steal a glance at the dial he saw he was yawing left he pressed down on the rudder pedal with his right foot the needle did not move he pressed harder slowly the pointer edged back to the central position he looked up and saw that he was diving slightly he pulled the stick back he checked the turnandslip indicator again the needle was steady it would have seemed simple and easy if he had not been fifteen hundred feet up in the air poul said now lets try a turn oh shit said harald first look left to see if theres anything in the way harald glanced to the left in the far distance he could see another tiger moth presumably with one of his classmates aboard doing the same as he that was reassuring nothing nearby he said ease the stick to the left harald did so the aircraft banked left and he again experienced the sickening feeling that he was going to fall out but the aircraft began to swing around to the left and harald felt a surge of excitement as he realized he was actually steering the tiger moth in a turn the nose tends to dip poul said harald saw that indeed the aircraft was heading downward and he pulled back on the stick watch that turnandslip indicator poul said youre doing the equivalent of a skid harald checked the dial and saw that the needle had moved to the right he pressed the rudder pedal with his right foot once again it responded only slowly the aircraft had turned through ninety degrees and harald was eager to straighten up and feel safe again but poul seemed to read his mindor perhaps all pupils felt the same way at this pointand said keep turning youre doing fine the angle of bank seemed dangerously steep to harald but he held the turn keeping the nose up checking the slip indicator every few seconds out of the corner of his eye he noticed a bus driving along the road below just as if nothing in the least dramatic was happening in the sky and there was no danger of a jansborg schoolboy dropping out of the heavens to his death on its roof he had turned through threequarters of a circle before poul at last said straighten up with relief harald eased the stick right and the aircraft straightened watch that slip indicator the needle had moved left harald pressed the rudder pedal with his left foot can you see the airfield at first harald could not the countryside beneath him was a meaningless pattern of fields dotted with buildings he had no idea what the air base would look like from above poul helped him out a row of long white buildings beside a bright green field look to the left of the propeller i see it head that way keeping the airfield on the left of our nose until now harald had not thought about the course they were following it had been all he could manage to keep the aircraft steady now he had to do all the things he had previously learned and at the same time head for home there was always one thing too many to think about youre climbing poul said throttle back an inch and bring us down to a thousand feet as we approach the buildings harald checked the altimeter and saw that the aircraft was indeed at two thousand feet it had been fifteen hundred last time he looked he throttled back and eased the stick forward dip the nose a bit more said poul harald felt the aircraft was in danger of diving vertically to the ground but he forced himself to push the stick farther forward good said poul by the time they were at a thousand feet the base was below them turn left around the far side of that lake and bring us in line with the runway poul ordered harald leveled out and checked the slip indicator as he drew parallel with the end of the lake he moved the stick left this time the feeling that he was going to fall out was not so bad watch that slip indicator he had forgotten correcting with his foot he brought the aircraft around throttle back an inch harald brought the lever back and the engine note dipped sharply too much harald eased it forward again dip the nose harald pushed the control stick forward thats it but try to keep heading for the runway harald saw that he had wandered off course and was headed for the hangars he put the aircraft into a shallow turn correcting with the rudder then lined it up with the runway again but now he could see that he was too high ill take over from here poul said harald had thought poul might talk him through a landing but clearly he had not gained sufficient control for that he felt disappointed poul closed the throttle the engine note fell abruptly giving harald the worrying feeling that there was nothing to keep the aircraft from falling straight down but in fact it glided gradually to the runway a few seconds before touchdown poul eased the stick back the aircraft seemed to float along a few inches above the earth harald felt the footwell pedals moving constantly and realized poul was steering with the rudder now that they were too close to the ground to dip a wing at last there was a bump as the wheels and the tailskid touched earth poul turned off the runway and taxied toward their parking space harald was thrilled it had been even more exciting than he had imagined he was also exhausted from concentrating so hard it had only been a short time he thought then he glanced at his watch and saw to his astonishment that they had been airborne for fortyfive minutes it had felt like five poul shut down the engine and climbed out harald pushed back his goggles took off his helmet fumbled with his safety harness and struggled out of his seat he stepped onto the reinforced strip on the wing and jumped to the ground you did very well said poul showed quite a talent for it in factjust like your brother im sorry i couldnt bring it in to the runway i doubt if any of the other boys will even be allowed to try lets go and get changed when harald had got out of his flying suit poul said come to my office for a minute harald went with him to a door marked chief flying instructor and entered a small room with a filing cabinet a desk and a couple of chairs would you mind making a drawing of that radio equipment you were describing to me earlier pouls tone was casual but his body was stiff with tension harald had wondered whether that subject would come up again sure its quite important i wont go into the reasons why thats all right sit at the desk theres a box of pencils and some paper in the drawer take your time do it over until youre satisfied okay how long do you think you might need maybe a quarter of an hour it was dark so i cant draw details but i have a clear outline in my head ill leave you alone so you dont feel pressured ill come back in fifteen minutes poul left and harald began to draw he cast his mind back to that saturday night in the pouring rain there had been a circular concrete wall he recalled about six feet high the aerial had been a grid of wires looking like bedsprings its rotating base was inside the circular wall and cables had run from the back of the aerial into a duct first he drew the wall with the aerial above he vaguely recalled that there had been one or two similar structures nearby so he sketched them in lightly then he drew the machinery as if the wall were not there showing its base and the cables he was no artist but he could render machinery accurately probably because he liked it when he had finished he turned the sheet of paper over and made a plan of the island of sande showing the position of the base and the restricted area of beach poul came back after fifteen minutes he studied the drawings intently then said this is excellentthank you youre welcome he pointed to the ancillary structures harald had sketched what are these i really dont know i didnt look closely but i thought i should put them in quite right one more question this grid of wires which is presumably an aerial is it flat or dished harald racked his brains but could not remember im not sure he said sorry thats all right poul opened the filing cabinet all the files were labeled with names presumably of past and present pupils at the school he selected one marked andersen hc it was not an unusual name but hans christian andersen was denmarks most famous writer and harald guessed the file might be a hiding place sure enough poul put the drawings in the folder and returned the file to its place lets go back to the others he said he went to the door stopping with his hand on the doorknob he said making drawings of german military installations is a crime technically it would be best not to mention this to anyonenot even arne harald felt a pang of dismay his brother was not involved in this even arnes best friend did not think he had the nerve harald nodded ill agree to thaton one condition poul was surprised condition what that you tell me something honestly he shrugged all right ill try there is a resistance movement isnt there yes poul said looking serious after a moments pause he added and now youre in it tilde jespersen wore a light flowery perfume that wafted across the pavement table and teased peter flemmings nostrils never quite strong enough for him to identify it like an elusive memory he imagined how the fragrance would rise from her warm skin as he slipped off her blouse her skirt and her underwear what are you thinking about she said he was tempted to tell her she would pretend shock but secretly be pleased he could tell when a woman was ready for that kind of talk and he knew how do it lightly with a selfdeprecating smile but an underlying tone of sincerity then he thought of his wife and held back he took his marital vows seriously other people might think he had a good excuse for breaking them but he set himself higher standards so he said i was thinking about you tripping up the runaway mechanic at the aerodrome you showed great presence of mind i didnt even think about it just stuck out my foot you have good instincts i was never in favor of women police and to tell you the truth i still have my doubtsbut no one could deny youre a first class cop she shrugged i have doubts myself maybe women ought to stay home and look after babies but after oskar died oskar had been her husband a copenhagen detective and friend of peters i had to work and law enforcement is the only life i know anything about my father was a customs officer my older brother is a military police officer and my younger brother a uniformed policeman in aarhus ill tell you the great thing about you tildeyou never try to get men to do your work by playing the helpless female he intended his remark as a compliment but she did not look as pleased as he had hoped i never ask for help at all she said crisply probably a good policy she gave him a look he could not read puzzling over the sudden chill in the atmosphere he wondered whether she might be afraid to ask for assistance in case she was immediately classed as a helpless female he could see how she might resent that after all men asked one another for help all the time she said but why are you a cop your father has a successful businessdont you want to take it over one day he shook his head ruefully i used to work at the hotel in the school holidays i hated the guests with their demands and complaints this beef is overcooked my mattress is lumpy ive been waiting twenty minutes for a cup of coffee i couldnt stand it the waiter came peter resisted the temptation to have herrings and onions on his smorrebrod thinking vaguely that he might get close enough to tilde for her to smell his breath so he ordered soft cheese and cucumbers instead they handed their ration cards to the waiter tilde said any progress in the spy case not really the two men we arrested at the aerodrome told us nothing they were sent to hamburg for what the gestapo calls deep interrogation and they gave the name of their contactmatthies hertz an army officer but he has disappeared a dead end then yes the phrase made him think of another dead end he had run into do you know any jews she looked surprised one or two i should think none in the police force why im making a list a list of jews yes where in copenhagen in denmark why the usual reason its my job to keep tabs on troublemakers and jews are troublemakers the germans think so you can see why they might have problems with jewsbut do we he was taken aback he had expected her to see this from his point of view its as well to be prepared we have lists of union organizers communists foreign nationals and members of the danish nazi party and you think thats the same thing its all information now its easy to identify new jewish immigrants whove come here in the last fifty years they dress funny they speak with a peculiar accent and most of them live in the same few copenhagen streets but there are also jews whose families have been danish for centuries they look and talk the same as everyone else most of them eat roast pork and go to work on saturday mornings if we ever need to find them we could have trouble so im making a list how you cant just go round asking people if they know any jews its a problem i have two junior detectives going through the phone book and one or two other lists making notes of jewishsounding names thats not very reliable there are lots of people called isaksen who arent jewish and lots of jews with names like jan christiansen what id really like to do is raid the synagogue they probably have a membership list to his surprise she was looking disapproving but she said why dont you juel wont allow it i think hes right really why peter cant you see what use might your list be put to in the future isnt it obvious peter said irritably if jewish groups start to organize resistance to the germans well know where to look for suspects and what if the nazis just decide to round up all the jews and send them to those concentration camps they have in germany theyll use your list but why would they send the jews to camps because nazis hate jews but were not nazis were police officers we arrest people because theyve committed crimes not because we hate them i know that peter said angrily he was astonished to be attacked from this angle tilde should know that his motive was to uphold the law not subvert it theres always a risk that information will be misused so wouldnt it be better not to make the damn list how could she be so stupid it maddened him to be opposed by someone he thought of as a comrade in the war against lawbreakers no he shouted he lowered his voice with an effort if we thought that way we wouldnt have a security department at all tilde shook her head look peter the nazis have done a lot of good things we both know that theyre on the side of the police basically theyve clamped down on subversion they maintain law and order theyve reduced unemployment and so on but on the subject of jews theyre insane maybe but theyre making the rules now just look at the danish jewstheyre lawabiding hardworking they send their children to school its ludicrous to make a list of their names and addresses as if they were all part of some communist conspiracy he sat back and said accusingly so youd refuse to work on this with me it was her turn to be offended how can you say that im a professional police officer and youre my boss ill do what you say you ought to know that do you mean it look if you wanted to make a complete list of witches in denmark id tell you i didnt think witches were criminals or subversivesbut id help you make the list their food arrived there was an awkward silence as they began to eat after a few minutes tilde said how are things at home peter had a sudden memory of himself and inge a few days before the accident walking to church on sunday morning two healthy happy young people in their best clothes with all the scum and riffraff in the world why did it have to be his wife whose mind was destroyed by that drunken boy in his sports car inge is the same he said no improvement when the brain is damaged that badly it doesnt mend there will never be any improvement it must be hard for you im fortunate to have a generous father i couldnt afford a nurse on police wagesinge would have to go into an asylum once again tilde gave him a look that was hard to read it was almost as if she felt the asylum might not be a bad solution what about the driver of the sports car finn jonk his trial started yesterday it should be over in a day or two at last what do you think will happen hes pleading guilty i assume hell be jailed for five or ten years it doesnt seem enough for destroying someones mind what would be enough after lunch when they were walking back to the politigaarden tilde put her arm through peters it was an affectionate gesture and he felt she was telling him that she liked him despite their disagreement as they approached the ultramodern police headquarters building he said im sorry you disapprove of my jewish list she stopped and turned to him youre not a bad man peter to his surprise she seemed to be on the edge of tears your sense of duty is your great strength but doing your duty isnt the only law i dont really understand what you mean i know she turned away and went into the building alone making his way to his office he tried to see the issue from her point of view if the nazis imprisoned lawabiding jews that would be a crime and his list would help the criminals but you could say that about a gun or even a car the fact that something might be used by criminals did not mean it was wrong to have it as he was crossing the open central courtyard he was hailed by his boss frederik juel come with me juel said briskly weve been summoned by general braun he marched ahead his military bearing giving an impression of decisiveness and efficiency that peter knew to be quite false it was a short walk from the politigaarden to the town square where the germans had taken over a building called the dagmarhus it was surrounded by barbed wire and had cannons and antiaircraft guns on the flat roof they were shown to walter brauns office a corner room overlooking the square comfortably furnished with an antique desk and a leather couch there was a rather small picture of the fuhrer on the wall and a framed photograph on the desk of two small boys in school uniform braun wore his pistol even here peter noted as if to say that although he had a cozy office nevertheless he meant business braun was looking pleased with himself our people have decoded the message you found in the hollow airplane chock he said in his habitual nearwhisper peter was elated very impressive juel murmured apparently it was not difficult braun went on the british use simple codes often based on a poem or famous passage of prose once our cryptanalysts get a few words a professor of english can usually fill in the rest i have never before known the study of english literature to serve any useful purpose he laughed at his own wit peter said impatiently what was in the message braun opened a file on his desk it comes from a group calling themselves the nightwatchmen although they were speaking german he used the danish word natvaegterne does that mean anything to you peter was taken by surprise ill check the files of course but im pretty sure we havent come across this name before he frowned considering reallife nightwatchmen are usually police or soldiers arent they juel bridled i hardly think that danish police officers i didnt say they were danish peter interrupted the spies could be german traitors he shrugged or they may just aspire to military status he looked at braun whats the content of the message general details of our military dispositions in denmark take a look he passed a sheaf of papers across the desk locations of antiaircraft batteries in and around copenhagen german naval vessels in the harbor during the last month regiments stationed in aarhus odense and morlunde is the information accurate braun hesitated not precisely close to the truth but not exact peter nodded then the spies probably are not germans with inside information for such people would be able to get correct details from the files more likely they are danes who are careful observers making educated estimates braun nodded a shrewd deduction but can you find these people i certainly hope so brauns focus of attention had switched entirely to peter as if juel were not there or just an underling in attendance rather than the senior officer do you think the same people are putting out the illegal newspapers peter was pleased that braun recognized his expertise but frustrated that juel was nevertheless the boss he hoped that braun himself had noted this irony he shook his head we know the underground editors and we keep an eye on their activities if they had been making meticulous observations of german military dispositions we would have noticed noi believe this is a new organization we havent encountered then how will you catch them there is one group of potential subversives whom we have never properly investigatedthe jews peter heard a sharp intake of breath from juel braun said you had better take a look at them its not always easy to know who the jews are in this country then go to the synagogue good idea peter said they may have a membership list that would be a start juel gave peter a thunderous look but said nothing braun said my superiors in berlin are impressed with the loyalty and efficiency of the danish police in intercepting this message to british intelligence nevertheless they were keen to send in a team of gestapo investigators i have dissuaded them by promising that you will vigorously investigate the spy ring and bring the traitors to justice it was a long speech for a man with one lung and it left him breathless he paused looking from peter to juel and back again when he had caught his breath he finished for your own sakes and for the good of everyone in denmark youd better succeed juel and peter stood up and juel said tightly we will do everything possible they left as soon as they were outside the building juel rounded on peter with a blazing blueeyed stare you know perfectly well this has nothing to do with the synagogue damn you i know nothing of the kind youre just toadying to the nazis you disgusting creep why shouldnt we help them they represent the law now you think theyll help your career and why not peter said stung to retaliate the copenhagen elite are prejudiced against men from the provincesbut the germans may be more fairminded juel was incredulous is that what you believe at least theyre not blind to the abilities of boys who did not go to jansborg skole so you think you were passed over because of your background idiotyou didnt get the job because youre too extreme youve got no sense of proportion youd wipe crime out by arresting everyone who looked suspicious he made a disgusted sound if i have anything to do with it youll never get another promotion now get out of my sight he walked away peter burned with resentment who did juel think he was having a famous ancestor did not make him better than anyone else he was a cop just like peter and he had no right to talk as if he were a higher life form but peter had got his way he had defeated juel he had permission to raid the synagogue juel would hate him forever for that but did it matter braun not juel was the power now better to be brauns favorite and juels enemy than the other way around back at headquarters peter swiftly assembled his team choosing the same detectives he had used at kastrup conrad dresler and ellegard he said to tilde jespersen id like to take you along if you dont object why would i object she said testily after our conversation over lunch please im a professional i told you that good enough he said they drove to a street called krystalgade the yellowbrick synagogue stood sideon to the street as if hunching a shoulder against a hostile world peter stationed ellegard at the gate to make sure no one could sneak out an elderly man in a yarmulke appeared from the jewish old peoples home next door may i help you he said politely were police officers peter said who are you the mans face took on a look of such abject fear that peter almost felt sorry for him gorm rasmussen im the day manager of the home he said in a shaky voice you have keys to the synagogue yes let us in the man took a bunch of keys from his pocket and opened a door most of the building was taken up by the main hall a richly decorated room with gilded egyptian columns supporting galleries over the side aisles these jews have plenty of money conrad muttered peter said to rasmussen show me your membership list membership what do you mean you must have the names and addresses of your congregation noall jews are welcome peters instinct told him the man was telling the truth but he would search the place anyway are there any offices here no just small robing rooms for the rabbi and other officials and a cloakroom for the congregation to hang their coats peter nodded to dresler and conrad check them out he walked up the center of the room to the pulpit end and climbed a short flight of steps to a raised dais behind a curtain he found a concealed niche what have we here the torah scrolls said rasmussen there were six large heavylooking scrolls lovingly wrapped in velvet cloth providing perfect hiding places for secret documents unwrap them all he said spread them out on the floor so i can see theres nothing else inside yes right away while rasmussen was doing his bidding peter walked a short distance away with tilde and talked to her while keeping a suspicious eye on the manager are you okay i told you if we find something will you admit i was right she smiled if we dont will you admit you were wrong he nodded pleased that she was not angry with him rasmussen spread out the scrolls covered with hebrew script peter saw nothing suspicious he supposed it was possible they had no register of members more likely they used to have one but destroyed it as a precaution the day the germans invaded he felt frustrated he had gone to a lot of trouble for this raid and had made himself even more unpopular with his boss it would be maddening if it came to nothing dresler and conrad returned from opposite ends of the building dresler was emptyhanded but conrad was carrying a copy of the newspaper reality peter took the newspaper and showed it to rasmussen this is illegal im sorry the man said he looked as if he might cry they push them through the letter box the people who printed the newspaper were not being sought by the police so those who merely read it were in no danger at allbut rasmussen did not know that and peter pushed his moral advantage you must write to your people sometimes he said well of course to leading members of the jewish community but we dont have a list we know who they are he tried a weak smile so do you i imagine it was true peter knew the names of a dozen or more prominent jews a couple of bankers a judge several professors at the university some political figures a painter they were not who he was after they were too well known to be spies such people could not stand at the dockside counting ships without being noticed dont you send letters to the ordinary people asking them to donate to charities telling them of events youre organizing celebrations picnics concerts no said the man we just put up a notice at the community center ah said peter with a satisfied smile the community center and where is that near christiansborg in ny kongensgade it was about a mile away dresler said peter keep this guy here for fifteen minutes and make sure he doesnt warn anyone they drove to the street called ny kongensgade the jewish community center was a large eighteenthcentury building with an internal courtyard and an elegant staircase though it needed redecorating the cafeteria was closed and there was no one playing pingpong in the basement a welldressed young man with a disdainful air was in charge of the office he said they had no list of names and addresses but the detectives searched the place anyway the young mans name was ingemar gammel and something about him made peter thoughtful what was it unlike rasmussen gammel was not frightened but whereas peter had felt rasmussen was scared but innocent gammel gave him the opposite impression gammel sat at a desk wearing a waistcoat with a watch chain and looked on coolly while his office was ransacked his clothes seemed expensive why was a wealthy young man acting as secretary here this kind of work was normally done by underpaid girls or middleclass housewives whose children had flown the nest i think this is what were looking for boss said conrad passing peter a black ring binder a list of rat holes peter looked inside and saw page after page of names and addresses several hundred of them bang he said well done but instinct told him there was more to find here keep looking everyone in case something else turns up he flicked through the pages looking for anything odd or familiar or something he had that dissatisfied feeling but nothing caught his eye gammels jacket hung from a hook behind the door peter read the tailors label the suit had been made by anderson amp sheppard of savile row london in peter was jealous he bought his clothes from the best shops in copenhagen but he could never afford an english suit there was a silk handkerchief in the outside breast pocket he found a wellstuffed money clip in the left side pocket in the right pocket was a train ticket to aarhus return with a neat hole made by a ticket inspectors punch why did you go to aarhus to visit friends the decoded message had included the name of the german regiment stationed at aarhus peter recalled however aarhus was denmarks largest town after copenhagen and hundreds of people traveled between the two cities every day in the inside pocket of the jacket was a slim diary peter opened it gammel said with contempt do you enjoy your work peter looked up with a smile he did enjoy infuriating pompous rich men who thought they were superior to ordinary people but what he said was like a plumber i see a lot of shit he pointedly returned his gaze to gammels diary gammels handwriting was stylish like his suit with big capitals and full loops the entries in the diary all looked normal lunch dates theater mothers birthday phone jorgen about wilder who is jorgen peter asked my cousin jorgen lumpe we exchange books and wilder thornton wilder and he is the american writer the bridge of san luis rey you must have read it there was a sneer in that an implication that policemen were not sufficiently cultured to read foreign novels but peter ignored it and turned to the back of the diary as he expected he found a list of names and addresses some with phone numbers he glanced up at gammel and thought he saw the hint of a flush on his cleanshaven cheeks that was promising he scrutinized the address list with care he picked a name at random hilde bjergagerwho is she a lady friend gammel answered coolly peter tried another bertil bruun gammel remained unflustered we play tennis fred eskildsen my bank manager the other detectives had stopped searching and fallen silent sensing the tension poul kirke old friend preben klausen picture dealer for the first time gammel showed a hint of emotion but it was relief rather than guilt why did he think he had got away with something what was the significance of the picture dealer klausen or was the previous name the important one had gammel shown relief because peter had moved on to klausen poul kirke is an old friend we were at university together gammels voice was even but there was just the suggestion of fear in his eyes peter glanced at tilde and she gave a slight nod she too had seen something in gammels reaction peter looked again at the diary there was no address for kirke but beside the phone number was a capital n written uncharacteristically small what does this meanthe letter n peter said naestved its his number at naestved whats his other number he doesnt have another so why do you need the annotation to tell you the truth i dont remember gammel said showing irritation it might have been true on the other hand n might stand for nightwatchman peter said what does he do for a living pilot with whom the army ah peter had speculated that the nightwatchmen might be army people because of their name and because they were accurate observers of military details at which base vodal i thought you said he was at naestved its nearby its twenty miles away well thats how i remember it peter nodded thoughtfully then said to conrad arrest this lying prick the search of ingemar gammels apartment was disappointing peter found nothing of interest no code book no subversive literature no weapons he concluded that gammel must be a minor figure in the spy ring one whose role was simply to make observations and report them to a central contact that key man would compile the messages and send them to england but who was the pivotal figure peter hoped it might be poul kirke before driving the fifty miles to the flying school at vodal where poul kirke was stationed peter spent an hour at home with his wife inge as he fed her appleandhoney sandwiches in tiny squares he found himself daydreaming about domestic life with tilde jespersen he imagined himself watching tilde getting ready to go out in the eveningwashing her hair and drying it vigorously with a towel sitting at the dressing table in her underwear polishing her nails looking in the mirror as she tied a silk scarf around her neck he realized he was yearning to be with a woman who could do things for herself he had to stop thinking this way he was a married man the fact that a mans wife was sick did not provide an excuse for adultery tilde was a colleague and a friend and she should never be any more to him than that feeling restless and discontented he turned on the radio and listened to the news while he waited for the evening nurse to arrive the british had launched a new attack in north africa crossing the egyptian border into libya with a tank division in an attempt to relieve the besieged city of tobruk it sounded like a major operation though the censored danish radio station naturally predicted that german antitank guns would decimate the british forces the phone rang and peter crossed the room to pick it up allan forslund here traffic division forslund was the officer dealing with finn jonk the drunk driver who had crashed into peters car the trial has just ended what happened jonk got six months six months im sorry peters vision blurred he felt he was going to fall over and he put a hand on the wall to steady himself for destroying my wifes mind and ruining my life six months the judge said he had already suffered torment and he would have to live with the guilt for the rest of his life thats shit i know i thought the prosecution was going to ask for a severe sentence we did but jonks lawyer was very persuasive said the boy has stopped drinking rides around on a bicycle is studying to be an architect anyone can say that i know i dont accept this i refuse to accept it nothing we can do like hell there isnt peter dont take any hasty action peter tried to calm himself of course i wont are you alone im going back to work in a few minutes so long as you have someone to talk to yes thanks for calling allan im very sorry we didnt do better not your fault a slick lawyer and a stupid judge weve seen that before peter hung up he had forced himself to sound calm but he was boiling if jonk had been at large he might have sought him out and killed himbut the kid was safe in jail if only for a few months he thought of finding the lawyer arresting him on a pretext and beating the shit out of him but he knew he would not do it the lawyer had not broken any laws he looked at inge she was sitting where he had left her watching him blankfaced waiting for him to continue feeding her he noticed that some of the chewed apple had dribbled from her mouth onto the bodice of her dress she was not normally a messy eater despite her condition before the accident she had been extraordinarily fastidious about her appearance seeing her with food on her chin and stains on her clothing suddenly made him want to weep he was saved by the doorbell he pulled himself together rapidly and answered it the nurse had arrived at the same time as bent conrad who had come to pick him up for the journey to vodal he shrugged on his jacket and left the nurse to clean inge up they went in two cars standard black police buicks peter thought the army might put obstacles in his way so he had asked general braun to detail a german officer to impose authority if necessary and a major schwarz from brauns staff was in the lead car the journey took an hour and a half schwarz smoked a large cigar filling the car with fumes peter tried not to think about the outrageously light sentence on finn jonk he might need his wits about him at the air base and he did not want his judgment to be skewed by rage he tried to smother his blazing fury but it smoldered on under a blanket of false calm stinging his eyes with its smoke like schwarzs cigar vodal was a grass airfield with a scatter of low buildings along one side security was lightit was only a training school so nothing remotely secret went on hereand a single guard at the gate casually waved them through without asking their business half a dozen tiger moths were parked in a line like birds on a fence there were also some gliders and two messerschmitt mes as peter got out of the car he saw arne olufsen his boyhood rival from sande sauntering across the car park in his smart brown army uniform the sour taste of resentment came into peters mouth peter and arne had been friends all through childhood until the quarrel between their families twelve years ago it had started when axel flemming peters father had been accused of tax fraud axel felt the prosecution was outrageous he had only done what everyone else did and understated his profits by inflating his costs he had been convicted and had to pay a hefty fine on top of all the back tax he had persuaded his friends and neighbors to see the case as an argument about an accounting technicality rather than an accusation of dishonesty then pastor olufsen had intervened there was a church rule that any member who committed a crime should be read out or expelled from the congregation the offender could rejoin the following sunday if he wished but for one week he was an outsider the procedure was not invoked for trivial crimes such as speeding and axel had argued that his transgression fell into that category pastor olufsen thought otherwise this humiliation had been much worse for axel than the fine with which the court had punished him his name had been read to the congregation he had been obliged to leave his place and sit at the back of the church throughout the service and to complete his mortification the pastor had preached a sermon on the text render unto caesar that which is caesars peter winced every time he remembered it axel was proud of his position as a successful businessman and community leader and there could be no greater punishment for him than to lose the respect of his neighbors it had been torture to peter to see his father publicly reprimanded by a pompous selfrighteous prig like olufsen he believed his father had deserved the fine but not the humiliation in church he had sworn then that if any member of the olufsen family ever transgressed there would be no mercy he hardly dared to hope that arne was involved in the spy ring that would be a sweet revenge arne caught his eye peter he looked surprised but not afraid is this where you work peter said when theres any work to do arne was as debonair and relaxed as ever if he had anything to feel guilty about he was concealing it well of course youre a pilot this is a training school but we dont have many pupils more to the point what are you doing here arne glanced at the major in german uniform standing behind peter is there a dangerous outbreak of littering or has someone been cycling after dark without lights peter did not find arnes raillery very funny routine investigation he replied shortly where will i find your commanding officer arne pointed to one of the low buildings base headquarters you need squadron leader renthe peter left him and went into the building renthe was a lanky man with a bristly moustache and a sour expression peter introduced himself and said im here to interview one of your men a flight lieutenant poul kirke the squadron leader looked pointedly at major schwarz and said whats the problem the reply none of your damn business sprang to peters lips but he was resolved to be calm so he told a polite lie hes been dealing in stolen property when military personnel are suspected of crimes we prefer to investigate the matter ourselves of course you do however he moved a hand in the direction of schwarz our german friends want the police to deal with it so your preferences are irrelevant is kirke on the base at this moment he happens to be flying peter raised his eyebrows i thought your planes were grounded as a rule yes but there are exceptions were expecting a visit from a luftwaffe group tomorrow and they want to be taken up in our training aircraft so we have permission to do test flights today to make sure the aircraft are in readiness kirke should land in a few minutes ill search his quarters meanwhile where does he bed down renthe hesitated then answered reluctantly dormitory a at the far end of the runway does he have an office or a locker or anywhere else he might keep things he has a small office three doors along this corridor ill start there tilde come with me conrad go out to the airfield to meet kirke when he comes backi dont want him to slip away dresler and ellegard search dormitory a squadron leader thank you for your help peter saw the commanders eyes stray to the phone on the desk and added dont make any phone calls for the next few minutes if you were to warn anyone that were on our way that would constitute obstruction of justice id have to throw you in jail and that wouldnt do the armys reputation much good would it renthe made no reply peter tilde and schwarz went along the corridor to a door marked chief flying instructor a desk and a filing cabinet were squeezed into a small room with no windows peter and tilde began to search and schwarz lit another cigar the filing cabinet contained pupil records peter and tilde patiently looked at every sheet of paper the little room was airless and tildes elusive perfume was lost in schwarzs cigar smoke after fifteen minutes tilde made a surprised noise and said this is odd peter looked up from the exam results of a student called keld hansen who had failed his navigation test tilde handed him a sheet of paper peter studied it frowning it bore a careful sketch of a piece of apparatus that peter did not recognize a large square aerial on a stand surrounded by a wall a second drawing of the same apparatus without the wall showed more details of the stand which looked as if it might revolve tilde looked over his shoulder what do you think it can be he was intensely aware of how close she was ive never seen anything like it but id bet the farm its secret anything else in the file no she showed him a folder marked andersen hc peter grunted hans christian andersenthats suspicious in itself he turned the sheet over on its reverse was a sketch map of an island whose long thin shape was as familiar to peter as the map of denmark itself this is sande where my father lives he said looking more closely he saw that the map showed the new german base and the area of the beach that was off limits bang he said softly tildes blue eyes were shining with excitement weve caught a spy havent we not yet peter said but were about to they went outside followed by the silent schwarz the sun had set but they could see clearly in the soft twilight of the long scandinavian summer evening they walked onto the airfield and stood beside conrad near where the planes were parked the aircraft were being put away for the night one was being wheeled into the hangar two airmen pushing its wings and a third lifting its tail off the ground conrad pointed to an incoming aircraft downwind of the airfield and said i think this must be our man it was another tiger moth as it descended in a textbook circuit and turned into the wind for landing peter reflected that there was no doubt poul kirke was a spy the evidence found in the filing cabinet would be enough to hang him but before that happened peter had a lot of questions to ask him was he simply a reporter like ingemar gammel had kirke traveled to sande himself to check out the air base and sketch the mystery apparatus or did he play the more important role of coordinator assembling information and transmitting it to england in coded messages if kirke was the central contact who had gone to sande and made the sketch could it have been arne olufsen that was possible but arne had shown no sign of guilt an hour ago when peter had arrived unexpectedly at the base still it might be worthwhile to put arne under surveillance as the aircraft touched down and bumped along the grass one of the police buicks came from the upwind end of the runway in a tearing hurry it skidded to a stop and dresler jumped out carrying something bright yellow peter threw him a nervous look he did not want a kerfuffle that might forewarn poul kirke glancing around he realized that he had relaxed his guard for a moment and failed to notice that the group at the edge of the runway appeared somewhat out of place himself in a dark suit schwarz in german uniform smoking a cigar a woman and now a man jumping out of a car in an obvious hurry they looked like a reception committee and the setup might ring alarm bells in kirkes mind dresler came up to him excitedly waving the yellow object a book with a brightly colored dust jacket this is his code book he said that meant kirke was the key man peter looked at the little aircraft which had turned off the runway before drawing level with the waiting group and was now taxiing past them to the parking area put the book under your coat you damn fool he said to dresler if he sees you waving that about hell know were on to him he looked again at the tiger moth he could see kirke in the open cockpit but could not read the mans expression behind the goggles scarf and helmet however there was no room to misinterpret what happened next the engine suddenly roared louder as the throttle was opened wide the aircraft swung around turning into the wind but also heading straight for the little group around peter damn hes going to run for it peter cried the plane picked up speed and came directly at them peter drew his pistol he wanted to take kirke alive and interrogate himbut he would rather have him dead than let him get away holding the gun with both hands he pointed it at the oncoming aircraft it was virtually impossible to shoot down a plane with a handgun but perhaps he might hit the pilot with a lucky shot the tiger moths tail came up off the ground leveling the fuselage and bringing kirkes head and shoulders into view peter took careful aim at the flying helmet and pulled the trigger the aircraft lifted off the ground and peter raised his aim emptying the sevenshot magazine of the walther ppk he saw with bitter disappointment that he had shot too high for a series of small holes like ink blots appeared in the fuel tank over the pilots head and petrol was spurting into the cockpit in small jets the aircraft did not falter the others threw themselves flat a suicidal rage seized peter as the spinning propeller approached him at sixty miles per hour at the controls with poul kirke were all the criminals who had ever escaped justice including finn jonk the driver who had injured inge peter was going to stop kirke getting away if it killed him out of the corner of his eye he saw major schwarzs cigar smoldering on the grass and he was seized by inspiration as the biplane swept lethally toward him he stooped picked up the burning cigar and threw it at the pilot then he flung himself sideways he felt the rush of wind as the lower wing passed within inches of his head he hit the ground rolled over and looked up the tiger moth was climbing the bullets and the lighted cigar seemed to have had no effect peter had failed would kirke get away the luftwaffe would scramble the two messerschmitts to chase him but that would take a few minutes by which time the tiger moth would be out of sight kirkes fuel tank was damaged but the holes might not be at the lowest point of the tank in which case he might retain sufficient petrol to get him across the water to sweden which was only twenty miles away and darkness was falling kirke had a chance peter concluded bitterly then there was the whoosh of a sudden fire and a single big flame rose from the cockpit it spread with ghastly speed all over the visible head and shoulders of the pilot whose clothing must have been soaked with petrol the flames licked back along the fuselage rapidly consuming the linen fabric for a few seconds the aircraft continued to climb although the head of the pilot had turned to a charred stump then kirkes body slumped apparently pushing the control stick forward and the tiger moth turned nosedown and dived the short distance to earth plunging like an arrow into the ground the fuselage crumpled like a concertina there was a horrified silence the flames continued to lick around the wings and the tail stripping the fabric eating into the wooden wing spars and revealing the square steel tubes of the fuselage like the skeleton of a burned martyr tilde said my god how dreadfulthe poor man she was shaking peter put his arms around her yes he said and the worst of it is now he cant answer questions part two the sign outside the building read danish institute of folk song and country dancing but that was just to fool the authorities down the steps through the double curtain that served as a light trap and inside the windowless basement there was a jazz club the room was small and dim the damp concrete floor was littered with cigarette ends and sticky with spilled beer there were a few rickety tables and some wooden chairs but most of the audience was standing there were sailors and dockers shoulder to shoulder with welldressed young people and a sprinkling of german soldiers on the tiny stage a young woman sat at the piano crooning ballads into a microphone perhaps it was jazz but it was not the music harald was passionate about he was waiting for memphis johnny madison who was colored even though he had lived most of his life in copenhagen and had probably never seen memphis it was two oclock in the morning earlier this evening after lightsout at school the three stoogesharald mads and tikhad put their clothes back on sneaked out of the dormitory building and caught the last train into the city it was riskythey would be in deep trouble if they were found outbut it would be worth it to see memphis johnny the aquavit harald was drinking with draft beer chasers was making him even more euphoric in the back of his mind was the thrilling memory of his conversation with poul kirke and the frightening fact that he was now in the resistance he hardly dared to think about it for it was something he could not share even with mads and tik he had passed secret military information to a spy after poul had admitted that there was a secret organization harald had said he would do anything else he could to help poul had promised to use harald as one of his observers his task would be to collect information on the occupying forces and give it to poul for onward transmission to britain he was proud of himself and eager for his first assignment he was also frightened but he tried not to think about what might happen if he were caught he still hated poul for dating karen duchwitz he had the sour taste of jealousy in the pit of his stomach every time he thought about it but he suppressed the feeling for the sake of the resistance he wished karen were here now she would appreciate the music just as he was thinking that female company was lacking he noticed a new arrival a woman with curly dark hair wearing a red dress sitting on a stool at the bar he could not see her too clearlythe air was smoky or perhaps there was something wrong with his visionbut she seemed to be alone hey look he said to the others nice if you like older women said mads harald peered at her trying to focus better why how old is she shes got to be thirty at least harald shrugged thats not really old i wonder if shed like someone to talk to tik who was not as drunk as the other two said shell talk to you harald was not sure why tik was grinning like a fool ignoring him harald stood up and headed for the bar as he got closer he saw that the woman was quite plump and her round face was heavily made up hello schoolboy she said but her smile was friendly i noticed that you were alone for the moment i thought you might want someone to talk to thats not really what im here for ahyou prefer to listen to the music im a great jazz fan have been for years what do you think of the singer shes not american of course but i hate the music harald was nonplussed then why im a working girl she seemed to think that explained everything but he was mystified she continued to smile warmly at him but he had the sense they were talking at crosspurposes a working girl he repeated yes what did you think i was he was inclined to be nice to her so he said you look like a princess to me she laughed he asked her whats your name betsy it was an unlikely name for a workingclass danish girl and harald guessed it was assumed a man appeared at haralds elbow harald was taken aback by the newcomers appearance he was unshaven he had rotten teeth and one eye was half closed by a big bruise he wore a stained tuxedo and a collarless shirt despite being short and skinny he looked intimidating he said come on sonny make up your mind betsy said to harald this is luther leave the boy alone lou hes not doing anything wrong hes driving other customers away harald realized he had no idea what was going on and he decided he must be drunker than he had imagined luther said welldo you want to fuck her or not harald was astonished i dont even know her betsy burst out laughing its ten crowns you can pay me luther said enlightenment dawned harald turned to her and said in a voice loud with astonishment are you a prostitute all right dont shout she said with annoyance luther grabbed harald by the shirt front and pulled him forward his grip was strong and harald staggered i know you educated types luther spat you think this kind of thing is funny harald smelled the mans bad breath dont get upset he said i just wanted to talk to her a barman with a rag around his head leaned over the bar and said no trouble please lou the lad means no harm doesnt he i think hes laughing at me harald was beginning to wonder anxiously whether luther had a knife when the club manager picked up the microphone and announced memphis johnny madison and there was a burst of applause luther pushed harald away get out of my sight before i slit your fool throat he said harald went back to the others he knew he had been humiliated but he was too drunk to care i made an error of etiquette he said memphis johnny walked on stage and harald instantly forgot luther johnny sat at the piano and leaned toward the microphone speaking perfect danish with no trace of an accent he said thank you id like to open with a composition by the greatest boogiewoogie pianist of them all clarence pine top smith there was renewed applause and harald shouted in english play it johnny some kind of disturbance broke out near the door but harald took no notice johnny played four bars of introduction then stopped abruptly and said into the microphone heil hitler baby a german officer walked on stage harald looked around bewildered a group of military police had come into the club they were arresting the german soldiers but not the danish civilians the officer snatched the microphone from johnny and said in danish entertainers of inferior race are not permitted this club is closed no cried harald in dismay you cant do that you nazi peasant fortunately his voice was drowned in the general hubbub of protest lets get out before you make any more errors of etiquette said tik he took haralds arm harald resisted come on he yelled let johnny play the officer handcuffed johnny and walked him out harald was heartbroken it had been his first chance to hear a real boogie pianist and the nazis had stopped the show after a few bars they have no right he shouted of course not tik said soothingly and steered him to the door the three young men made their way up the steps to the street it was midsummer and the short scandinavian night was already over dawn had broken the club was on the waterfront and the broad channel of water gleamed in the halflight sleeping ships floated motionless at their moorings a cool salty breeze blew in from the sea harald breathed deeply then felt momentarily dizzy we might as well go to the railway station and wait for the first train home tik said their plan was to be in bed pretending to sleep before anyone at school got up they headed for the town center at the main intersections the germans had erected concrete guard posts octagonal in plan and about four feet high with room in the middle for a soldier to stand visible from the chest up they were not manned at night harald was still furious about the closure of the club and he was further enraged by these ugly symbols of nazi domination passing one he gave it a futile kick mads said they say the sentries at these posts wear lederhosen because no one can see their legs harald and tik laughed a moment later they passed a pile of builders rubble outside a shop that had been newly refitted and harald happened to notice a cluster of paint cans on top of the pilewhereupon he was struck by an idea he leaned across the rubbish and picked up a can what the hell are you doing tik said there was a little black paint left in the bottom still liquid from among the odd bits of timber on the pile harald selected a piece of wooden slat an inch wide that would serve as a brush ignoring bemused questions from tik and mads he walked back to the guard post he knelt in front of it with the paint and the stick he heard tik say something in a warning voice but ignored him with great care he wrote in black paint on the concrete wall this nazi has no trousers on he stepped back to admire his work the letters were large and the words could be read at a distance later this morning thousands of copenhageners on their way to work would see the joke and smile what do you think of that he said he looked around tik and mads were nowhere to be seen but two uniformed danish policemen stood immediately behind him very amusing said one of them youre under arrest he spent the rest of the night in the politigaarden in the drunk tank with an old man who had urinated in his trousers and a boy his own age who vomited on the floor he was too disgusted with them and himself to sleep as the hours went by he developed a headache and a raging thirst but the hangover and the filth were not his worst worries he was more concerned about being interrogated about the resistance what if he were turned over to the gestapo and tortured he did not know how much pain he could stand eventually he might betray poul kirke and all for a stupid joke he could not believe how childish he had been he was bitterly ashamed at eight oclock in the morning a uniformed policeman brought a tray with three mugs of ersatz tea and a plate of black bread thinly smeared with a butter substitute harald ignored the breadhe could not eat in a place like a toiletbut he drank the tea greedily shortly afterward he was taken from the cell to an interview room he waited a few minutes then a sergeant came in carrying a folder and a typed sheet of paper stand up the sergeant barked and harald leaped to his feet the sergeant sat at the table and read the report a jansborg schoolboy eh he said yes sir you ought to know better lad yes sir where did you get the liquor at a jazz club he looked up from the typed sheet the danish institute yes you must have been there when the krauts closed it down yes harald was confused by his use of the mildly derogatory slang word kraut for german it jarred with his formal tone do you often get drunk no sir first time and then you saw the guard post and you happened to come across a can of paint im very sorry the cop grinned suddenly well dont be too sorry i thought it was pretty funny myself no trousers he laughed harald was bewildered the man had seemed hostile but now he was enjoying the joke harald said whats going to happen to me nothing were the police not the joke patrol the sergeant tore the report in half and dropped it in the wastepaper basket harald could hardly believe his luck was he really going to be let off what what should i do go back to jansborg thank you harald wondered if he could sneak back into school unnoticed even at this late stage he would have some time on the train to think of a story perhaps no would need ever find out about this the sergeant stood up but take a word of advice keep off the booze i will harald said fervently if he could get out of this scrape he would never drink alcohol again the sergeant opened the door and harald suffered a dreadful shock standing outside was peter flemming harald and peter stared at one another for a long moment the sergeant said can i help you inspector peter ignored him and spoke to harald well well he said in the satisfied tone of a man who has been proved right at last i wondered when i saw the name on the overnight arrest list could harald olufsen graffiti writer and drunk be harald olufsen son of the pastor of sande lo and behold they are one and the same harald was dismayed just when he had started to hope that this dreadful incident could be kept secret the truth had been discovered by one who had a grudge against his whole family peter turned to the sergeant and said dismissively all right ill deal with it now the sergeant looked resentful there are to be no charges sir the superintendent has decided well see about that harald felt he could weep he had been on the point of getting away with it this seemed so unfair the sergeant hesitated seeming disposed to argue and peter said firmly that will be all very good sir he left peter stared at harald saying nothing until at last harald said what are you going to do peter smiled then said i think ill take you back to school they entered the grounds of jansborg skole in a police buick driven by a uniformed officer with harald in the back like a prisoner the sun was shining on the old redbrick buildings and the lawns and harald felt a stab of regret for the simple safe life he had lived here over the last seven years whatever happened now this reassuringly familiar place was not going to be a home to him much longer the sight aroused different feelings in peter flemming who muttered sourly to the driver this is where they breed our future rulers yes sir the driver said neutrally it was the time of the midmorning sandwich and the boys were eating outside so most of the school was watching as the car drove up to the main office and harald got out peter showed his police badge to the school secretary and he and harald were immediately taken to heiss study harald did not know what to think it seemed peter was not going to hand him over to the gestapo his worst fear he was reluctant to let his hopes rise too soon but all the signs were that peter regarded him as a mischievous schoolboy not a member of the danish resistance for once he was grateful to be treated as a child rather than a man but in that case what was peter up to as they walked in heis unwound his lanky frame from behind his desk and stared at them with vague concern through the glasses perched on his beaky nose his voice was kindly but a tremor betrayed his nervousness olufsen whats all this peter did not give harald the chance to answer the question jerking a thumb in his direction he said to heis in a grating tone is this one of yours the gentle heis flinched as if he had been struck olufsen is a pupil here yes he was arrested last night for defacing a german military installation harald realized that peter was enjoying the humiliation of heis and was determined to make the most of it heis looked mortified im very sorry to hear that he was also drunk oh dear the police have to decide what to do about it im not sure i frankly wed rather not prosecute a schoolboy for a childish prank well im glad to hear that on the other hand he cant go unpunished indeed not apart from anything else our german friends will want to know that the perpetrator has been dealt with firmly of course of course harald felt sorry for heis but at the same time wished he were not such a weakling so far he had done nothing but agree with the bullying peter peter went on so the outcome depends on you oh in what way if we let him go will you expel him from school harald immediately saw what peter was up to he wanted to be sure that haralds transgression would become public knowledge he was only interested in the embarrassment of the olufsen family the arrest of a jansborg schoolboy would make headlines the shame of heis would be exceeded only by that of haralds parents his father would be volcanic and his mother suicidal but harald realized peters enmity toward the olufsen family had blunted his policemans instincts he was so happy to have caught an olufsen drunk that he had overlooked a greater crime he had not even considered whether haralds dislike of the nazis went beyond slogandaubing to espionage peters malice had saved haralds skin heis showed the first sign of opposition expulsion seems a bit harsh not as harsh as a prosecution and possible jail sentence no indeed harald did not enter the argument himself because he could see no way out of this that would enable him to keep the incident secret he consoled himself with the thought that he had escaped the gestapo any other punishment would seem minor heis said its almost the end of the academic year he wouldnt miss much schooling if he were expelled now then it will not permit him to avoid much work something of a technicality considering that he is only a couple of weeks away from leaving but it will satisfy the germans will it thats important of course if you can assure me that he will be expelled i can release him from custody otherwise ill have to take him back to the politigaarden heis threw a guilty look at harald it does seem as if the school has no real choice in the matter doesnt it yes sir heis looked at peter very well then i will expel him peter gave a satisfied smile im glad weve resolved this so sensibly he stood up try to keep out of trouble in future young harald he said pompously harald looked away peter shook hands with heis well thank you inspector heis said pleased to help peter went out harald felt all his muscles relax he had got away with it there would be hell to pay at home of course but the important thing was that his foolishness had not compromised poul kirke and the resistance heis said a dreadful thing has happened olufsen i know ive done wrong no not that i think you know mads kirkes cousin poul yes harald tensed again now what had heis somehow found out about haralds involvement with the resistance what about poul he has been in a plane crash my god i was flying with him a few days ago it happened last night at the flying school heis hesitated what im sorry to have to tell you that poul kirke is dead dead said herbert woodie with a squeak in his voice how can he be dead theyre saying he crashed his tiger moth hermia replied she was angry and distraught the damn fool woodie said callously this could ruin everything hermia stared at him in disgust she would have liked to slap his stupid face they were in woodies office at bletchley park with digby hoare hermia had sent a message to poul kirke instructing him to get an eyewitness description of the radar installation on the island of sande the reply came from jens toksvig one of pouls helpers she said making an effort to be calm and factual it was sent via the british legation in stockholm as usual but it wasnt even encipheredjens obviously doesnt know the code he said the crash was being passed off as an accident but in fact poul was trying to escape from the police and they shot at the aircraft the poor man said digby the message came in this morning hermia added i was about to come and tell you mr woodie when you sent for me in fact she had been in tears she did not cry often but her heart was touched by the death of poul so young handsome and full of energy she knew too that she was responsible for his being killed it was she who had asked him to spy for britain and his courageous assent had led directly to his death she thought of his parents and his cousin mads and she had wept for them too most of all she longed to finish the job he had started so that his killers would not prevail in the end im so sorry digby said and he put his arm around hermias shoulders in a sympathetic squeeze lots of men are dying but it hurts when its someone you know she nodded his words were simple and obvious but she was grateful for the thought what a good man he was she felt a surge of affection for him then remembered her fiance and felt guilty she wished she could see arne again talking to him and touching him would reinforce her love and make her immune to the appeal of digby but where does that leave us woodie asked hermia collected her thoughts rapidly according to jens the nightwatchmen have decided to lie low at least for a while and see how far the police carry their investigation so to answer your question it leaves us without any sources of information in denmark makes us appear damned incompetent woodie said never mind that digby said crisply the nazis have found a warwinning weapon we thought we were years ahead with radarnow we learn that they have it too and theirs is better than ours i dont give a fuck about how you appear the only question is how we find out more woodie looked outraged but said nothing hermia asked what about other sources of intelligence were trying them all of course and weve picked up one more clue the word himmelbett has appeared in luftwaffe decrypts woodie said himmelbett that means heaven bed what does it signify its their word for a fourposter bed hermia told him makes no sense woodie said grumpily as if it were her fault she asked digby any context not really it seems that their radar operates in a himmelbett we cant figure it out hermia reached a decision ill have to go to denmark myself she said dont be ridiculous woodie said we have no agents in country so someone has to be infiltrated she said i know the ground better than anyone else in mi thats why im chief of the denmark desk and i speak the language like a native ive got to go we dont send women on missions like that he said dismissively digby said yes we do he turned to hermia youll leave for stockholm tonight ill come with you why did you say that hermia asked digby the following day as they walked through the golden room in the stadhuset stockholms famous city hall digby paused to study a wall mosaic i knew the prime minister would want me to keep the closest possible watch on such an important mission i see and i wanted the chance to have you to myself this is the next best thing to a slow boat to china but you know i have to get in touch with my fiance hes the only person i can trust to help us yes and ill probably see him all the sooner in consequence that suits me fine i cant compete with a man who is trapped in a country hundreds of miles away heroically silent and unseen holding on to your affection by invisible cords of loyalty and guilt id rather have a fleshandblood rival with human failings someone who gets grumpy with you and has dandruff on his collar and scratches his bum this isnt a contest she said with exasperation i love arne im going to marry him but youre not married yet hermia shook her head as if to detach herself from this irrelevant talk previously she had enjoyed digbys romantic interest in heralbeit guiltilybut now it was a distraction she was here for a rendezvous she and digby were only pretending to be tourists with time to kill they left the golden room and went down the broad marble staircase and out into the cobbled courtyard they crossed an arcade of pink granite pillars and found themselves in a garden overlooking the gray water of lake malaren turning to look up at the threehundredfoot tower that rose over the redbrick building hermia checked that their shadow was with them a boredlooking man in a gray suit and wellworn shoes he made little effort to conceal his presence as digby and hermia had pulled away from the british legation in a chauffeurdriven volvo limousine that had been adapted to run on charcoal they had been followed by two men in a black mercedes when they stopped outside the stadhuset the man in the gray suit had followed them inside according to the british air attache a group of german agents kept all british citizens in sweden under constant surveillance they could be shaken off but it was unwise losing your tail was taken as proof of guilt men who evaded surveillance had been arrested and accused of espionage and the swedish authorities had been pressured to expel them therefore hermia had to escape without the shadow realizing it following a prearranged plan hermia and digby wandered across the garden and turned around the corner of the building to look at the cenotaph of the citys founder birger jarl the gilded sarcophagus lay in a canopied tomb with stone pillars at each corner like a himmelbett hermia said concealed from view on the far side of the cenotaph was a swedish woman of the same height and build as hermia with similar dark hair hermia looked inquiringly at the woman who nodded decisively hermia suffered an instant of fear until now she had done nothing illegal her visit to sweden had been as innocent as it seemed from this moment on she would be on the wrong side of the law for the first time in her life quickly the woman said in english hermia slipped off her light summer raincoat and red beret and the other woman put them on hermia took from her pocket a dull brown scarf and tied it around her head covering her distinctive hair and partly concealing her face the swedish woman took digbys arm and the two of them moved away from the cenotaph and sauntered back into the garden in full view hermia waited a few moments pretending to study the elaborate wroughtiron railing around the monument fearful that the tail would be suspicious and come to check but nothing happened she moved out from behind the cenotaph halfexpecting him to be lying in wait but there was no one nearby pulling the scarf a little farther over her face she walked around the corner into the garden she saw digby and the decoy heading for the gate at the far end the shadow was following them the plan was working hermia went in the same direction tailing the tail as arranged digby and the woman went straight to their car which was waiting in the square hermia saw them get into the volvo and drive away the tail followed in the mercedes they would lead him all the way back to the legation and he would report that the two visitors from britain had spent the afternoon as innocent tourists and hermia was free she crossed the stadhusbron bridge and headed for gustav adolf square the center of the city walking fast eager to get on with her task everything had happened with bewildering rapidity in the last twentyfour hours hermia had been given only a few minutes to throw a few clothes into a suitcase then she and digby had been driven in a fast car to dundee in scotland where they checked into a hotel a few minutes after midnight this morning at dawn they had been taken to leuchars aerodrome on the fife coast and an raf crew wearing civilian british overseas airways corporation uniforms had flown them to stockholm a threehour journey they had had lunch at the british legation then put into operation the plan they had devised in the car between bletchley and dundee as sweden was neutral it was possible to phone or write from here to people in denmark hermia was going to try to call her fiance arne at the danish end calls were monitored and letters opened by the censors so she would have to be extraordinarily careful in what she said she had to mount a deception that would sound innocent to an eavesdropper yet bring arne into the resistance back in when she had set up the nightwatchmen she had deliberately excluded arne it was not because of his convictions he was as antinazi as she was albeit in a less passionate wayhe thought they were stupid clowns in silly uniforms who wanted to stop people having fun no the problem was his careless happygolucky nature he was too open and friendly for clandestine work perhaps also she had been unwilling to put him in danger although poul had agreed with her about arnes unsuitability but now she was desperate arne was as happygolucky as ever but she had no one else besides everyone felt differently about danger today than at the outbreak of war thousands of fine young men had given their lives already arne was a military officer he was supposed to take risks for his country all the same her heart felt cold at the thought of what she was going to ask him to do she turned in to the vasagatan a busy street in which there were several hotels the central railway station and the main post office here in sweden telephone services had always been separate from the mail and there were special public phone bureaus hermia was headed for the one in the railway station she could have telephoned from the british legation but that would almost certainly have aroused suspicion at the phone bureau there would be nothing unusual about a woman who spoke hesitant swedish with a danish accent coming in to phone home she and digby had talked about whether the phone call would be listened to by the authorities in every telephone exchange in denmark there was at least one young german woman in uniform listening in they could not possibly eavesdrop on every phone call of course however they were more likely to pay attention to international calls and calls to military bases so there was a strong chance that hermias conversation with arne would be monitored she would have to communicate in hints and doubletalk but that should be possible she and arne had been lovers so she ought to be able to make him understand without being explicit the station was built like a french chateau the grand entrance lobby had a coffered ceiling and chandeliers she found the phone bureau and stood in line when she got to the counter she told the clerk that she wanted to make a persontoperson call to arne olufsen and gave the number of the flying school she waited impatiently full of apprehension while the operator tried to get arne on the line she did not even know whether he was at vodal today he might be flying or away from the base for the afternoon or on leave he might have been transferred to another base or have resigned from the army but she would try to track him down wherever he was she could speak to his commanding officer and ask where he had gone she could call his parents on sande and she had numbers for some of his friends in copenhagen she had all afternoon to spend and plenty of money for phone calls it would be strange to talk to him after more than a year she was thrilled but anxious the mission was the important thing but she could not help fretting about how arne would feel about her perhaps he no longer loved her as he once had what if he were cold to her it would break her heart but he might have met someone else after all she had enjoyed a flirtation with digby how much more easily might a man find his heart straying she remembered skiing with him racing down a sunlit slope the two of them leaning to one side then the other in perfect rhythm perspiring in the icy air laughing with the sheer joy of being alive would those days ever come back she was called to a booth she picked up the phone and said hello arne said who is it she had forgotten his voice it was low and warm and sounded as if it might break into laughter at any minute he spoke educated danish with a precise diction he had learned in the military and the hint of a jutland accent left over from his childhood she had planned her first sentence she intended to use the pet names they had for each other hoping this would alert arne to the need to speak discreetly but for a moment she could not speak at all hello he said is anyone there she swallowed and found her voice hello toothbrush this is your black cat she called him toothbrush because that was what his moustache felt like when he kissed her her nickname came from the color of her hair it was his turn to be dumbstruck there was a silence hermia said how are you im okay he said at last my god is it really you yes are you all right yes suddenly she could not stand any more small talk abruptly she said do you still love me he did not answer immediately that made her think his feelings had changed he would not say so directly she thought he would equivocate and say they needed to reassess their relationship after all this time but she would know i love you he said do you more than ever ive missed you terribly she closed her eyes feeling dizzy she leaned against the wall im so glad youre still alive he said im so happy to be talking to you i love you too she said whats been happening how are you where are you calling from she pulled herself together im not far away he noticed her guarded manner and responded in a similar tone okay i understand she had prepared the next part do you remember the castle there were many castles in denmark but one was special to them you mean the ruins how could i forget could you meet me there how could you get therenever mind do you mean it yes its a long way its really very important id go a lot farther to see you im just figuring out how ill ask for leave but if its a problem ill just go awol dont do that she did not want the military police looking for him whens your next day off saturday the operator came on the line to tell them they had ten seconds hastily hermia said ill be there on saturdayi hope if you dont make it ill come back every day for as long as i can ill do the same be careful i love you i love you the line went dead hermia kept the receiver pressed to her ear as if she could hold on to him a little longer that way then the operator asked her if she wanted to make another call and she declined and hung up she paid at the counter then went out dazed with happiness she stood in the station concourse under the high curved roof with people hurrying past her in all directions he still loved her in two days time she would see him someone bumped into her and she got out of the crowd into a cafe where she slumped in a chair two days the ruined castle to which they had both enigmatically referred was hammershus a tourist attraction on the danish holiday island of bornholm in the baltic sea they had spent a week on the island in posing as man and wife and had made love among the ruins one warm summer evening arne would take the ferry from copenhagen a trip of seven or eight hours or fly from kastrup which took about an hour the island was a hundred miles from mainland denmark but only twenty miles from the south coast of sweden hermia would have to find a fishing boat to take her across that short stretch of water illegally but it was the danger to arne not herself that she kept thinking about he was going to meet secretly with an agent of the british secret service she would ask him to become a spy if he were caught the punishment would be death on the second day after his arrest harald returned home heis had allowed him to stay at school another two days to take the last of his exams he would be permitted to graduate though not to attend the ceremony which was a week away but the important thing was that his university place was safe he would study physics under niels bohrif he lived that long during those two days he had learned from mads kirke that the death of poul had not been a straightforward crash the army was refusing to reveal details saying they were still investigating but other pilots had told the family that the police had been on the base at the time and shots had been fired harald was sure though he could not say this to mads that poul had been killed because of his resistance work nevertheless he was more afraid of his father than of the police as he made his way home it was a tediously familiar journey across the width of denmark from jansborg in the east to sande off the west coast he knew every smalltown railway station and fishsmelling ferry dock and all the flat green landscape in between the journey took the whole day because of multiple train delays but he wished it could be longer he spent the time anticipating his fathers wrath he composed indignant speeches of selfjustification which even he found unconvincing he tried out a variety of more or less groveling apologies unable to find a formula that was sincere but not abject he wondered whether to tell his parents to be grateful he was alive when he might have met the same fate as poul kirke but that seemed to make cheap use of a heroic death when he reached sande he further postponed his arrival by walking home along the beach the tide was out and the sea was barely visible a mile away a narrow strip of dark blue touched with inconstant smears of white surf sandwiched between the bright blue of the sky and the buffcolored sand it was evening and the sun was low a few holidaymakers strolled through the dunes and a group of boys around twelve or thirteen years old were playing football it would have been a happy scene but for the new gray concrete bunkers at intervals of a mile along the hightide mark bristling with artillery and manned by steelhelmeted soldiers he came to the new military base and left the beach to follow the long diversion around it welcoming the additional delay he wondered whether poul had managed to send off his sketch of the radio equipment to the british if not the police must have found it would they wonder who had drawn it fortunately there was nothing to connect it with harald all the same the thought was frightening the police still did not know he was a criminal but now they knew about his crime at last he came within sight of his home like the church the parsonage was built in the local style with redpainted bricks and a thatched roof that swept low over the windows like a hat pulled over the eyes to keep out the rain the lintel over the front door was painted in slanting stripes of black white and green a local tradition harald went to the back and looked through the diamondshaped pane of glass in the kitchen door his mother was alone he studied her for a moment wondering what she had been like when she was his age ever since he could remember she had looked tired but she must have been pretty once according to family legend haralds father bruno had been thought by everyone to be a confirmed bachelor at the age of thirtyseven wholly dedicated to the work of his little sect then he had met lisbeth ten years younger and lost his heart so madly in love was he that he had worn a colored tie to church in an attempt to appear romantic and the deacons had been obliged to reprimand him for inappropriate attire watching his mother as she bent over the sink scrubbing a pot harald tried to imagine the tired gray hair as it had once been jet black and gleaming and the hazel eyes twinkling with humor the lines of the face smoothed away and the weary body full of energy she must have been irresistibly sexy harald supposed to have turned his fathers remorselessly holy thoughts to the lusts of the flesh it was hard to imagine he went in put down his suitcase and kissed his mother your fathers out she said where has he gone ove borking is sick ove was an elderly fisherman and faithful member of the congregation harald was relieved any postponement of the confrontation was a reprieve his mother looked solemn and tearful her expression touched his heart he said im sorry to have caused you distress mother your father is mortified she said axel flemming has called an emergency meeting of the board of deacons to discuss the matter harald nodded he had anticipated that the flemmings would make the most of this but why did you do it his mother asked plaintively he had no answer she made him a ham sandwich for his supper is there any news of uncle joachim he asked nothing we get no answers to our letters haralds own troubles seemed nothing when he thought about his cousin monika penniless and persecuted not even knowing whether her father was dead or alive while harald was growing up the annual visit of the goldstein cousins had been the highlight of the year for two weeks the monastic atmosphere of the parsonage was transformed and the place was full of people and noise the pastor had for his sister and her family an indulgent fondness that he showed no one else certainly not his own children and he would smile benignly as they committed transgressions such as buying ice cream on a sunday for which he would have punished harald and arne for harald the sound of the german language meant laughter and pranks and fun now he wondered if the goldsteins would ever laugh again he turned on the radio to hear the war news it was bad the british assault in north africa had been abandoned a catastrophic failure half their tanks lost either crippled in the desert by mechanical failures or destroyed by experienced german antitank gunners the axis grip on north africa was unshaken danish radio and the bbc told essentially the same story at midnight a flight of bombers crossed overhead harald looked out and saw they were heading east that meant they were british the bombers were all the british had now when he went back inside his mother said your father could be out all night youd better go to bed he lay awake for a long time he asked himself why he was scared he was too big to be beaten his fathers wrath was formidable but how bad could a tonguelashing be harald was not easily intimidated rather the reverse he was inclined to resent authority and defy it out of sheer rebelliousness the short night came to an end and a rectangle of gray dawn light appeared around the curtain at his window like a picture frame he drifted into sleep his last thought was that perhaps what he really feared was not some hurt to himself but his fathers suffering he was awakened brusquely an hour later the door burst open the light came on and the pastor stood beside the bed fully dressed hands on his hips chin thrust forward how could you do it he shouted harald sat up blinking at his father tall bald dressed in black staring at harald with the blueeyed glare that terrified his congregation what were you thinking of his father raged what possessed you harald did not want to cower in his bed like a child he threw off the sheet and stood up because the weather was warm he had slept in his undershorts cover yourself boy his father said youre practically naked the unreasonableness of this criticism stung harald into a rejoinder if underwear offends you dont enter bedrooms without knocking knocking dont tell me to knock on doors in my own house harald suffered the familiar feeling that his father had an answer for everything very well he said sulkily what devil took hold of you how could you bring such disgrace upon yourself your family your school and your church harald pulled on his trousers and turned to face his father well the pastor raged are you going to answer me im sorry i thought you were asking rhetorical questions harald was surprised by his own cool sarcasm his father was infuriated dont try to use your education to fence with mei went to jansborg too im not fencing im asking whether theres any chance youll listen to anything i say the pastor raised his hand as if to strike it would have been a relief harald thought as his father hesitated whether he took the blow passively or hit back violence would have been some kind of resolution but his father was not going to make it that easy he dropped his hand and said well im listening what have you got to say for yourself harald gathered his thoughts on the train he had rehearsed many versions of this speech some of them most eloquent but now he forgot all his oratorical flourishes im sorry i daubed the guard post because it was an empty gesture a childish act of defiance at the least for a moment he considered whether to tell his father about his connection with the resistance but he quickly decided not to risk further ridicule besides now that poul was dead the resistance might no longer exist instead he concentrated on the personal im sorry to have brought disgrace on the school because heis is a kindly man im sorry i got drunk because it made me feel dreadful the next morning most of all im sorry to have caused my mother distress and your father harald shook his head youre upset because axel flemming knows all about this and hes going to rub your nose in it your pride has been hurt but im not sure youre worried about me at all pride his father roared what has pride to do with anything ive tried to bring up my sons to be decent sober godfearing menand youve let me down harald felt exasperated look its not that much of a disgrace most men get drunk not my sons once in their lives at least but you were arrested that was bad luck it was bad behavior and i wasnt chargedthe police sergeant actually thought that what i did was funny were not the joke patrol he said i wouldnt even have been expelled from school if peter flemming hadnt threatened heis dont you dare try to minimize this no member of this family has ever been to jail for any reason youve dragged us into the gutter the pastors face changed suddenly for the first time he showed sadness rather than anger and it would be shocking and tragic even if no one in the world knew of it but me harald saw that his father was sincere in this and the realization threw him off balance it was true that the old mans pride was wounded but that was not all he genuinely feared for his sons spiritual welfare harald was sorry he had been sarcastic but his father gave him no chance to be conciliatory there remains the question of what is to be done with you harald was not sure what this meant ive only missed a few days of school he said i can do the preliminary reading for my university course here at home no his father said youre not getting off so lightly harald had a dreadful foreboding what do you mean what are you planning youre not going to university what are you talking about of course i am suddenly harald felt very afraid im not going to send you to copenhagen to pollute your soul with strong drink and jazz music youve proved you arent mature enough for the city youll stay here where i can supervise your spiritual development but you cant phone the university and say dont teach this boy theyve given me a place they havent given you any money though harald was shocked my grandfather bequeathed money for my education but he left it to me to dispense and im not going to give it to you to spend in nightclubs its not your moneyyou dont have the right i most certainly do im your father harald was stunned he had not dreamed of this it was the only punishment that could really hurt him bewildered he said but youve always told me that education was so important education is not the same as godliness even so his father saw that he was genuinely shocked and his attitude softened a little an hour ago ove borking died he had no education worth speaking ofhe could barely write his name he spent his life working on other mens boats and never made enough to buy a carpet for his wife to put on the parlor floor but he raised three godfearing children and every week he gave a tenth of his meager wages to the church thats what god considers a good life harald knew and liked ove and was sorry he had died he was a simple man nothing wrong with simplicity yet if all men were like ove wed still be fishing from dugout canoes perhaps but youre going to learn to emulate him before you do anything else and what does that mean get dressed put on your school clothes and a clean shirt youre going to work he left the room harald stared at the closed door what next he washed and shaved in a daze he could hardly believe what was happening he might go to university without his fathers help of course he would have to get a job to support himself and he would not be able to afford the private tuition that most people considered essential to supplement the free lectures but could he achieve all he wanted in those circumstances he did not want merely to pass his exams he wanted to be a great physicist the successor to niels bohr how could he do that if he did not have the money to buy books he needed time to think and while he was thinking he had to go along with whatever his father was planning he went downstairs and ate without tasting the porridge his mother had made his father saddled the horse major a broadbacked irish gelding strong enough to carry them both the pastor mounted and harald got up behind they rode the length of the island the journey took major more than an hour when they reached the dock they watered the horse at the quayside trough and waited for the ferry the pastor still had not told harald where they were going when the boat docked the ferryman touched his cap to the pastor who said ove borking was called home early this morning i expected as much said the ferryman he was a good man rest his soul amen they crossed to the mainland and rode up the hill to the town square the stores were not yet open but the pastor knocked at the door of the haberdashery it was opened by the owner otto sejr a deacon of the sande church he seemed to be expecting them they stepped inside and harald looked around glass cases displayed balls of colored wool the shelves were stacked with lengths of material wool cloth and printed cotton and a few silks below the shelves were drawers each neatly marked ribbonwhite ribbonfancy elastic buttonsshirt buttonshorn pins knitting needles there was a dusty smell of mothballs and lavender like an old ladys wardrobe the odor brought to haralds mind a childhood memory suddenly vivid standing here as a small boy while his mother bought black satin for his fathers clerical shirts the shop had a rundown air now probably because of wartime austerity the higher shelves were empty and it seemed to him there was not the astonishing variety of colors of knitting wool he recalled from his childhood but what was he doing here today his father soon answered the question brother sejr has kindly agreed to give you a job he said youll be helping in the shop serving customers and doing anything else you can to make yourself useful he stared at his father speechless mrs sejr is in poor health and cant work any longer and their daughter has recently married and gone to live in odense so he needs an assistant the pastor went on as if that were what needed explaining sejr was a small man bald with a little moustache harald had known him all his life he was pompous mean and sly he wagged a fat finger and said work hard pay attention and be obedient and you may learn a valuable trade young harald harald was flabbergasted he had been thinking for two days about how his father would respond to his crime but nothing he anticipated had come close to this it was a life sentence his father shook hands with sejr and thanked him then said to harald in parting youll take your lunch with the family here and come straight home when you finish work ill see you tonight he waited a moment as if expecting an answer but when harald said nothing he went out right said sejr theres just time to sweep the floor before we open youll find a broom in the cupboard start at the back sweep towards the front and push the dust out through the door harald began his task seeing him brush onehanded sejr snapped put both hands on that broom boy harald obeyed at nine oclock sejr put the open sign in the door when i want you to deal with a customer ill say forward and you step forward he said you say good morning how may i serve you but watch me with one or two customers first harald watched sejr sell six needles on a card to an old woman who counted out her coins as carefully as if they were pieces of gold next was a smartly dressed woman of about forty who bought two yards of black braid then it was haralds turn to serve the third customer was a thinlipped woman who looked familiar she asked for a reel of white cotton thread sejr snapped on your left top drawer harald found the cotton the price was marked in pencil on the wooden end of the reel he took the money and made change then the woman said so harald olufsen youve been in the fleshpots of babylon i hear harald flushed he had not prepared himself for this did the whole town know what he had done he was not going to defend himself to gossipmongers he made no reply sejr said young harald will come under a more steady influence here mrs jensen im sure it will do him good they were thoroughly enjoying his humiliation harald realized he said will there be anything else then oh no thank you said mrs jensen but she made no move to leave so you wont be going to the university harald turned away and said wheres the toilet mr sejr through the back and upstairs as he left he heard sejr say apologetically hes embarrassed of course and no wonder the woman replied harald climbed the stairs to the apartment over the shop mrs sejr was in the kitchen dressed in a pink quilted housecoat washing breakfast cups at the sink ive only got a few herrings for lunch she said i hope you dont eat much he lingered in the bathroom and when he returned to the shop he was relieved to see that mrs jensen had gone sejr said people are bound to be curiousyou must be polite whatever they say my life is none of mrs jensens business he replied angrily but shes a customer and the customer is always right the morning wore on with painful slowness sejr checked stock wrote orders did his books and dealt with phone calls but harald was expected to stand waiting ready for the next person to come through the door it left him plenty of time to ponder was he really going to spend his life selling reels of cotton to housewives it was unthinkable by midmorning when mrs sejr brought him and sejr a cup of tea he had decided he could not even spend the rest of the summer working here by lunchtime he knew he was not going to last the day as sejr flipped the closed sign harald said im going for a walk sejr was startled but mrs sejr has prepared lunch she told me she doesnt have enough food harald opened the door youve only got an hour sejr called after him dont be late harald walked down the hill and got on the ferry he crossed to sande and walked along the beach toward the parsonage he felt a strange tight sensation in his chest when he looked at the dunes the miles of damp sand and the endless sea the view was as familiar as his own face in the mirror yet now it gave him an aching sense of loss he almost felt like crying and after a while he realized why he was going to leave this place today the rationale came after the realization he did not have to do the job selected for himbut he could not continue to live in the house after defying his father he would have to go the thought of disobeying his father was no longer frightening he realized as he strode along the sand the drama had gone out of it when had this change taken place it was when the pastor had said he would withhold the money grandpa had left harald decided that had been a shocking betrayal which could not possibly leave their relationship intact at that moment harald had understood that he could no longer trust his father to have his best interests at heart he had to look after himself now the conclusion was strangely anticlimactic of course he had to take responsibility for his own life it was like realizing that the bible was not infallible he found it hard to imagine how he had formerly been so trusting when he reached the parsonage the horse was not in the paddock harald guessed his father had returned to the borking house to make arrangements for oves funeral he went in by the kitchen door his mother was at the table peeling potatoes she looked frightened when she saw him he kissed her but gave no explanations he went to his room and packed his case as if he were going to school his mother came to the bedroom door and stood watching him wiping her hands in a towel he saw her face lined and sad and he looked quickly away after a while she said where will you go i dont know he thought of his brother he went into his fathers study picked up the telephone and placed a call to the flying school after a few minutes arne came on the line harald told him what had happened the old man overplayed his hand arne commented if hed put you into a tough job like cleaning fish at the canning plant youd have stuck it out just to prove your manhood i suppose i might but you were never going to stay long working in a damn shop our father can be a fool sometimes where will you go now harald had not decided until this moment but now he had a flash of inspiration kirstenslot he said tik duchwitzs place but dont tell father i dont want him coming after me old man duchwitz might tell him that was a good point harald reflected tiks respectable father would have little sympathy for a boogieplaying slogandaubing runaway but the ruined monastery was used as a dormitory by seasonal workers on the farm ill sleep in the old monastery he said tiks father wont even know im there how will you eat i may be able to get a job on the farm they employ students in summer tik is still at school i presume but his sister might help me i know her she went out with poul a couple of times karen only a couple of times yes whyare you interested in her shes out of my league i suppose she is what happened to poul exactly it was peter flemming peter mads kirke had not known that detail he came with a car full of cops looking for poul poul tried to escape in his tiger moth and peter shot at him the aircraft crashed and burned good god did you see it no but one of my airmen did mads told me some of this but he didnt know it all so peter flemming killed poul thats terrible dont talk about it too much you might get into trouble theyre trying to pass it off as an accident all right harald noticed that arne was not saying why the police had come after poul and arne must have noticed that harald did not ask let me know how you get on at kirstenslot phone if you need anything thanks good luck kid as harald hung up his father walked in and what do you think youre doing harald stood up if you want money for the phone call ask sejr for my mornings wages i dont want money i want to know why youre not at the shop its not my destiny to be a haberdasher you dont know what your destiny is perhaps not harald left the room he went outside to the workshop and lit the boiler of his motorcycle while he waited for it to build up steam he stacked peat in the sidecar he did not know how much he would need to get him to kirstenslot so he took it all he returned to the house and picked up his suitcase his father waylaid him in the kitchen where do you think youre going id rather not say i forbid you to leave you cant really forbid things anymore father harald said quietly youre no longer willing to support me youre doing your best to sabotage my education im afraid youve forfeited the right to tell me what to do the pastor looked stunned you have to tell me where youre going no why not if you dont know where i am you cant interfere with my plans the pastor looked mortally wounded harald felt regret like a sudden pain he had no desire for revenge and it gave him no satisfaction to see his fathers distress but he was afraid that if he showed remorse he would lose his strength of purpose and allow himself to be bullied into staying so he turned his face away and walked outside he strapped his suitcase to the back of the bike and drove it out of the workshop his mother came running across the yard and thrust a bundle into his hands food she said she was crying he stowed the food in the sidecar with the peat she threw her arms around him as he sat on the bike your father loves you harald do you understand that yes mother i think i do she kissed him let me know that youre all right telephone or send a postcard okay promise i promise she released him and he drove away peter flemming undressed his wife she stood passively in front of the mirror a warmblooded statue of a pale beautiful woman he took off her wristwatch and necklace then patiently undid the hooks and eyes of her dress his blunt fingers expert from hours of practice there was a smear on the side he noticed with a disapproving frown as if she touched something sticky then wiped her hand on her hip she was not normally dirty he pulled the dress over her head careful not to muss her hair inge was as lovely today as she had been the first time he had seen her in her underwear but then she had been smiling speaking fond words her expression showing eagerness and a trace of apprehension today her face was blank he hung her dress in the wardrobe then took off her brassiere her breasts were full and round the nipples so light in color they were almost invisible he swallowed hard and tried not to look at them he made her sit on the dressingtable stool then removed her shoes unfastened her stockings and rolled them down and took off her garter belt he stood her up again to pull down her underpants desire rose in him as he uncovered the blond curls between her legs he felt disgusted with himself he knew he could have sexual intercourse with her if he wished she would lie still and accept it with blank impassivity as she took everything that happened to her but he could not bring himself to do it he had tried one time not long after she came home from the hospital telling himself that perhaps this would rekindle in her the spark of awareness but he had been revolted by himself and had stopped after a few seconds now the desire came back and he had to fight it off even though he knew that giving in would bring no relief he threw her underwear into the linen basket with an angry gesture she did not move as he opened a drawer and took out a white cotton nightdress embroidered with small flowers a gift to inge from his mother she was innocent in her nakedness and to desire her seemed as wrong as to desire a child he drew the nightdress over her head put her arms into it and smoothed it down her back he looked over her shoulder into the mirror the flower pattern suited her and she looked pretty he thought he saw a faint smile touch her lips but it was probably his imagination he took her to the bathroom then put her to bed as he undressed himself he looked at his own body in the mirror there was a long scar across his belly souvenir of a saturdaynight street brawl he had broken up as a young policeman he no longer had the athletic physique of his youth but he was still fit he wondered how long it would be before a woman touched his skin with hungry hands he put on pajamas but he did not feel sleepy he decided to return to the living room and smoke another cigarette he looked at inge she lay still with her eyes open he would hear her if she moved he generally knew when she needed something she would simply stand up and wait as if she could not figure out what to do next and he would have to guess what she wanted a drink of water the toilet a shawl to keep her warm or something more complicated occasionally she would move about the apartment apparently at random but she would soon come to a halt perhaps at a window or staring helplessly at a closed door or just in the middle of the room he left the bedroom and crossed the little hallway to the living room leaving both doors open he found his cigarettes then on impulse took a halfempty bottle of aquavit from a cupboard and poured some into a glass sipping his drink and smoking he thought about the week past it had started well and finished badly he had begun by catching two spies ingemar gammel and poul kirke better still they were not like his usual targets union organizers who intimidated strikebreakers or communists who sent coded letters to moscow saying that jutland was ripe for revolution no gammel and kirke were real spies and the sketches tilde jespersen had found in kirkes office constituted important military intelligence peters star seemed in the ascendant some of his colleagues had begun to act coolly toward him disapproving of his enthusiastic cooperation with the german occupiers but they hardly mattered general braun had called him in to say that he thought peter should be head of the security department he did not say what would happen to frederik juel but he had made it clear that the job was peters if he could wrap this case up it was a pity poul kirke had died alive he might have revealed who his collaborators were where his orders came from and how he sent information to the british gammel was still alive and had been handed over to the gestapo for deep interrogation but he had revealed nothing further probably because he did not know any more peter had pursued the investigation with his usual energy and determination he had questioned pouls commanding officer the supercilious squadron leader renthe he had interviewed pouls parents his friends and even his cousin mads and had got nothing from any of them he had detectives tailing pouls girlfriend karen duchwitz but so far she appeared to be no more than a hardworking student at the ballet school peter also had pouls best friend arne olufsen under surveillance arne was the best prospect for he could easily have drawn the sketches of the military base on sande but arne had spent the week blamelessly going about his duties tonight friday he had taken the train into copenhagen but there was nothing unusual about that after a brilliant start the case seemed to have deadended the weeks minor triumph had been the humiliation of arnes brother harald however peter felt sure harald was not involved in espionage a man who was risking his life as a spy did not daub silly slogans peter was wondering where to go next with the investigation when there was a knock at the door he glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece it was tenthirty not outrageously late but still an unusual time for an unexpected visit the caller certainly could not be surprised to find him in pajamas he stepped into the hallway and opened the door tilde jespersen stood there a sky blue beret perched on her fair curly hair theres been a development she said i thought we should discuss it of course come in youll have to excuse my appearance she glanced at the pattern on his pajamas with a grin elephants she said as she walked into the living room i wouldnt have guessed he felt embarrassed and wished he had put on a robe although it was too warm tilde sat down wheres inge in bed would you like some aquavit thank you he got a fresh glass and poured for both of them she crossed her legs her knees were round and her calves plump quite different from inges slender legs she said arne olufsen bought a ticket for tomorrows ferry to bornholm peter froze with the glass halfway to his lips bornholm he said softly the danish holiday island was tantalizingly close to the swedish coast could this be the break he was waiting for she took out a cigarette and he lit it blowing out smoke she said of course he might simply be due for some leave and have decided to take a vacation quite so on the other hand he may be planning to escape to sweden thats what i thought peter swallowed his drink with a satisfying gulp whos with him now dresler he relieved me fifteen minutes ago i came straight here peter forced himself to be skeptical it was too easy in an investigation to let wishful thinking mislead you why would olufsen want to leave the country he might have been scared by what happened to poul kirke he hasnt been acting scared until today hes been doing his job apparently happily maybe hes just noticed the surveillance peter nodded they always do sooner or later alternatively he might be going to bornholm to spy the british could have ordered him there peter made a doubtful face whats on bornholm tilde shrugged maybe thats the question they want answered or perhaps its a rendezvous remember if he can get from bornholm to sweden the journey the other way is probably just as easy good point tilde was very clearthinking he reflected she kept all possibilities in view he looked at her intelligent face and clear blue eyes he watched her mouth as she spoke she seemed unaware of his scrutiny the death of kirke probably broke their normal line of communication this could be an emergency fallback plan im not convincedbut theres only one way to find out continue to shadow olufsen yes tell dresler to get on the ferry with him olufsen has a bicycle with him shall i tell dresler to take one yes then book yourself and me on tomorrows flight to bornholm well get there first tilde stubbed out her cigarette and stood up right peter did not want her to go the aquavit was warm in his belly he felt relaxed and he was enjoying having an attractive woman to talk to but he could not think of an excuse to detain her he followed her into the hallway she said ill see you at the airport yes he put his hand on the doorknob but did not open it tilde she looked at him with a neutral expression yes thanks for this good work she touched his cheek sleep well she said but she did not move away he looked at her the trace of a smile touched the corners of her mouth but he could not tell whether it was inviting or mocking he leaned forward and suddenly he was kissing her she kissed him back with fierce passion he was taken by surprise she pulled his head to hers thrust her tongue into his mouth after a moment of shock he responded he grabbed her soft breast and squeezed roughly she made a noise deep in her throat and thrust her hips against his body he saw a movement out of the corner of his eye he broke the kiss and turned his head inge stood in the bedroom doorway like a ghost in her pale nightdress her face wore its perpetual blank expression but she was looking straight at them peter heard himself make a sound like a sob tilde slipped from his embrace he turned to speak to her but no words came she opened the apartment door and stepped outside she was gone in a breath the door slammed shut the daily flight from copenhagen to bornholm was operated by the danish airline ddl it departed at nine am and took an hour the plane landed at an airstrip a mile or so outside bornholms main town ronne peter and tilde were met by the local police chief who gave them the loan of a car as if entrusting them with royal jewels they drove into the town it was a sleepy place with more horses than cars the halftimbered houses were painted in striking deep colors dark mustard terracotta pink forest green and rust red two german soldiers stood in the central square smoking and chatting to passersby from the square a cobbled street led downhill to the harbor there was a kriegsmarine torpedo boat in the dock with a group of small boys clustered on the quayside staring at it peter located the ferry port across from the brick custom house the largest building in town peter and tilde drove around to familiarize themselves with the streets then returned to the port in the afternoon to meet the ferry neither mentioned last nights kiss but peter was intensely aware of her physical presence that elusive flowery perfume her alert blue eyes the mouth that had kissed him with such urgent passion at the same time he kept remembering inge standing in the bedroom doorway her expressionless white face a more agonizing reproach than any explicit accusation as the ship came into the harbor tilde said i hope were right and arne is a spy you havent lost your enthusiasm for this work her reply was sharp whatever makes you say that our discussion about jews oh that she shrugged it off you were right werent you you proved it we raided the synagogue and it led us to gammel then i wondered if the death of kirke might have been too gruesome my husband died she said crisply i dont mind seeing criminals die she was even tougher than he had thought he hid a pleased smile so youll stay in the police i dont see any other future besides i might be the first woman to get promotion to sergeant peter doubted that would ever happen it would involve men taking orders from a woman and that seemed beyond the bounds of possibility but he did not say so braun virtually promised me promotion if i can round up this spy ring promotion to what head of the department juels job and a man who was head of the security department at thirty could well end up chief of the entire copenhagen police he thought his heart beat faster as he envisioned the crackdown he would impose with the backing of the nazis tilde smiled warmly putting a hand on his arm she said then wed better make sure we catch them all the ship docked and the passengers began to disembark as they watched tilde said youve known arne since childhoodis he the type for espionage id have to say no peter replied thoughtfully hes too happygolucky oh tilde looked glum in fact i might have dismissed him as a suspect but for his english fiancee she brightened that puts him right in the frame i dont know whether theyre still engaged she went back to england hotfoot when the germans came but the possibility is enough a hundred or so passengers got off some on foot a handful in cars many with bicycles the island was only twenty miles from end to end and cycling was the easiest way to get around there said tilde pointing peter saw arne olufsen disembarking wearing his army uniform pushing his bicycle but wheres dresler four people behind i see him peter put on sunglasses and pulled his hat low then started the engine arne cycled up the cobbled street toward the town center and dresler did the same peter and tilde followed slowly in the car arne headed out of town to the north peter began to feel conspicuous there were few other cars on the roads and he had to drive slowly to stay with the bikes soon he was obliged to fall behind and drop out of sight for fear of being noticed after a few minutes he speeded up until he caught sight of dresler then slowed again two german soldiers on a motorcycle with a sidecar passed them and peter wished he had borrowed a motorbike instead of a car a few miles out of town they were the only people on the road this is impossible tilde said in a high anxious voice hes bound to spot us peter nodded she was right but now a new thought occurred to him and when he does his reaction will be highly revealing she gave him an inquiring look but he did not explain he increased speed rounding a bend he saw dresler crouching in the woods at the side of the road and a hundred yards ahead arne sitting on a wall smoking a cigarette peter had no option but to drive past he continued another mile then reversed down a farm track was he checking on us or just taking a rest tilde said peter shrugged a few minutes later arne cycled past followed by dresler peter pulled onto the road again the daylight was fading three miles farther on they came to a crossroads dresler had stopped there and was looking perplexed there was no sign of arne dresler came up to the car window looking distraught im sorry boss he put on a burst of speed and got ahead of me i lost sight of him and i dont know which way he went at this crossroads tilde said hell he must have planned it he obviously knows the road im sorry dresler said again tilde said quietly there goes your promotionand mine dont be so gloomy peter said this is good news tilde was bewildered what do you mean if an innocent man thinks hes being followed what does he do he stops turns around and says who the hell do you think you are following me around only a guilty man deliberately shakes off a surveillance team dont you see this means we were right arne olufsen is a spy but weve lost him oh dont worry well find him again they spent the night at a seaside hotel with a bathroom at the end of each corridor at midnight peter put a robe over his pajamas and knocked on the door of tildes room she called come in he stepped inside she was sitting up in the single bed wearing a light blue silk nightdress reading an american novel called gone with the wind he said you didnt ask who it was at the door i knew his detectives mind noticed that she wore lipstick her hair was carefully brushed and the flowery perfume was in the air as if she had dressed for a date he kissed her lips and she stroked the back of his head after a moment he looked back to the door to make sure he had closed it shes not there tilde said who inge he kissed her again but after a few moments he realized he was not getting excited he broke the kiss and sat on the edge of the bed its the same for me tilde said what i keep thinking about oskar hes dead inge might as well be he winced she said im sorry but its true im thinking about my husband and youre thinking about your wife and neither of them cares it wasnt like this last night at my apartment we didnt give ourselves time to think then this was ridiculous he thought in his youth he had been a confident seducer able to persuade many women to yield to him and leaving most of them well satisfied was he just out of practice he shrugged off his robe and slipped into bed beside her she was warm and welcoming and her round body under the nightdress was soft to his touch she turned off the light he kissed her but he could not rekindle last nights passion they lay side by side in the dark its all right she said you have to leave the past behind its difficult for you he kissed her again briefly then he got up and returned to his own room haralds life was in ruins all his plans were canceled and he had no future yet instead of agonizing over his fate he was looking forward to renewing his acquaintance with karen duchwitz he recalled her white skin and vivid red hair and the way she walked across the room as if she were dancing and nothing seemed as important as seeing her again denmark was a small pretty country but at twenty miles per hour it seemed like the endless desert haralds peatburning motorcycle took a day and a half to get from his home on sande across the width of the country to kirstenslot the bikes progress over the monotonous undulating landscape was further slowed by breakdowns he suffered a puncture before he was thirty miles from home next on the long bridge that linked the jutland peninsula with the central island of fyn his chain broke the nimbus motorcycle originally had a shaft drive but that was difficult to connect to a steam engine so harald had taken a chain and sprockets from an old lawn mower now he had to push the bike miles to a garage and have a new link inserted by the time he had crossed fyn he had missed the last ferry to the main island of zealand he parked the bike ate the food his mother had given himthree thick slices of ham and a slab of cakeand spent a chill night waiting on the dockside when he relit the boiler the next morning the safety valve had developed a leak but he managed to plug it with chewing gum and sticking plaster he arrived at kirstenslot late on saturday afternoon although he was impatient to see karen he did not go immediately to the castle he drove past the ruined monastery and the entrance to the castle grounds passed through the village with its church and tavern and railway station and found the farm he had visited with tik he was confident he could get a job here it was the right time of year and he was young and strong there was a large farmhouse in a neat yard as he parked the bike he was watched by two little girlsgranddaughters he imagined of farmer nielsen the whitehaired man he had seen driving away from the church he found the farmer at the rear of the house dressed in muddy corduroys and a collarless shirt leaning on a fence and smoking a pipe good evening mr nielsen he said hello young man nielsen said guardedly what can i do for you my name is harald olufsen i need a job and josef duchwitz told me you hire summer laborers not this year son harald was dismayed he had not even considered the possibility of refusal im a hard worker i dont doubt it and you look strong enough but im not hiring why not nielsen raised an eyebrow i might say its none of your business my lad but i was a brash young man myself once so ill tell you that times are hard the germans buy most of what i produce at a price decided by them and theres no cash to pay casual laborers ill work for food harald said desperately he could not return to sande nielsen gave him a penetrating look you sound as if youre in some kind of trouble but i cant hire you on those terms id have trouble with the union it seemed hopeless harald cast about for an alternative he might find work in copenhagen but then where would he live he could not even go to his brother who lived on a military base where overnight guests were not permitted nielsen saw his distress and said sorry son he knocked his pipe out against the top rail of the fence come on ill see you off the premises the farmer probably thought he was desperate enough to steal harald thought the two of them walked around the house to the front yard what the hells that said nielsen when he saw the bike with its boiler gently puffing steam its just an ordinary motorcycle but ive rigged it to run on peat how far have you come on it from morlunde good god it looks ready to blow up any minute harald felt offended its perfectly safe he said indignantly i know about engines in fact i mended one of your tractors a few weeks ago for a moment harald wondered whether nielsen might hire him out of gratitude but then he told himself not to be foolish gratitude would not pay wages you had a leak in the fuel supply nielsen frowned what do you mean harald threw another slab of peat into the firebox i was staying at kirstenslot for the weekend josef and i came across one of your men frederik trying to start a tractor i remember so youre that lad yes he climbed on the bike wait a minute maybe i can hire you harald looked at him hardly daring to hope i cant afford laborers but a mechanic is a different matter do you know about all kinds of machinery this was no time for modesty harald decided i can usually fix anything with an engine ive got half a dozen machines lying idle for lack of spares do you think you could make them work yes nielsen looked at the motorcycle if you can do this maybe you can repair my seed drill i dont see why not all right the farmer said decisively ill give you a trial thank you mr nielsen tomorrows sunday so come here on monday morning at six oclock we farmers start early ill be here dont be late harald opened the regulator to let steam into the cylinder and drove off before nielsen could change his mind as soon as he was out of earshot he let out a triumphant yell he had a jobone much more interesting than serving customers in a haberdasheryand he had done it himself he felt full of confidence he was on his own but he was young and strong and smart he was going to be all right daylight was fading as he drove back through the village he almost failed to see a man in police uniform who stepped into the road and waved him down he braked hard at the last minute and the boiler sighed a cloud of steam through the safety valve he recognized the policeman as per hansen the local nazi what the hell is this hansen said pointing to the bike its a nimbus motorcycle converted to steam power harald told him it looks dangerous to me harald had little patience with this kind of officious busybody but he forced himself to answer politely i assure you officer its perfectly safe are you making official inquiries or just indulging your curiosity never mind the cheek lad ive seen you before havent i harald told himself not to get on the wrong side of the law he had already spent one night in jail this week my name is harald olufsen youre a friend of the jews at the castle harald lost his temper its none of your damn business who my friends are oho is it not hansen looked satisfied as if he had the result he wanted ive got the measure of you young man he said maliciously i shall keep a close eye on you off you go now harald pulled away he cursed his short temper he had now made an enemy of the local policeman just because of a throwaway remark about jews when would he learn to keep out of trouble a quarter of a mile from the gates of kirstenslot he turned off the road onto the cart track that led through the wood to the back of the monastery he could not be seen from the house and he was betting no one would be working in the garden on a saturday evening he stopped the bike at the west front of the disused church then walked through the cloisters and entered the church by a side door at first he could see only ghostly shapes in the dim evening light coming through the high windows as his eyesight adjusted he made out the long rollsroyce car under its tarpaulin the boxes of old toys and the hornet moth biplane with its folded wings he had the feeling that no one had entered the church since last time he was here he opened the large main door drove his bike inside and closed the door he permitted himself a moment of satisfaction as he shut down the steam engine he had crossed the country on his improvised motorcycle got himself a job and found a place to stay unless he was unlucky his father could not find out where he was but if there should be any important family news his brother knew how to get in touch with him best of all there was a good chance he would see karen duchwitz he recalled that she liked to smoke a cigarette on the terrace after dinner he decided to go and look out for her it was riskyhe might be seen by mr duchwitzbut he felt lucky today in a corner of the church next to the workbench and tool rack was a sink with a cold water tap harald had not washed for two days he stripped off his shirt and got cleaned up as best he could without soap he rinsed out the shirt hung it on a nail to dry and put on the spare one from his bag an arrowstraight drive half a mile long led from the main gates to the castle but it was too exposed and harald took a roundabout route to approach the place through the wood he passed the stables crossed the kitchen garden and studied the back of the house from the shelter of a cedar tree he was able to identify the drawing room by its french windows which were open to the terrace next to it was the dining room he recalled the blackout curtains were not yet drawn for the electric lights had not yet been switched on although he saw the flicker of a candle he guessed the family was having dinner tik would be at schooljansborg boys were allowed home once a fortnight and this was a school weekendso the dinner party would consist of karen and her parents unless there were guests he decided to risk a closer look he crossed the lawn and crept up to the house he heard the sound of a bbc announcer saying that vichy french forces had abandoned damascus to an army of british commonwealth and free french it made a pleasant change to hear of a british victory but he found it hard to see how good news from syria was going to help his cousin monika in hamburg peeping in through the dining room window he saw that dinner was over and a maid was clearing the table a moment later a voice behind him said what do you thinking youre doing he spun around karen was walking along the terrace toward him her pale skin was luminous in the evening light she wore a long silk dress in a watery shade of bluegreen her dancers carriage made it seem as if she were gliding she looked like a ghost hush he said she did not recognize him in the fading light hush she said indignantly there was nothing ghostly about her challenging tone i find an intruder peering through a window into my house and he tells me to hush there was a bark from inside harald could not decide whether karen was genuinely outraged or just amused i dont want your father to know im here he said in a low urgent voice you should worry about the police not my father the old red setter thor came bounding out ready to savage a burglar but he recognized harald and licked his hand im harald olufsen i was here two weeks ago ohthe boogiewoogie boy what are you doing skulking on the terrace have you come back to rob the place to haralds dismay mr duchwitz came to the french window and looked out karen he said is someone there harald held his breath if karen betrayed him now she could spoil everything after a moment she said its all right daddyjust a friend mr duchwitz peered at harald in the gloom but did not seem to recognize him and after a moment he grunted and went back inside thanks harald breathed karen sat on a low wall and lit a cigarette youre welcome but you have to tell me what this is all about the dress matched her green eyes which shone out of her face as if lit from within he sat on the wall facing her i quarreled with my father and left home why did you come here karen herself was half the reason but he decided not to say so ive got a job with farmer nielsen repairing his tractors and machines you are enterprising where are you living um in the old monastery presumptuous too i know i assume you brought blankets and things actually no it may be chilly at night ill survive hmm she smoked in silence for a while watching darkness fall like a mist over the garden harald studied her mesmerized by the twilight on the shapes of her face the wide mouth and the slightly crooked nose and the mass of wiry hair that somehow combined to be bewitchingly lovely he watched her full lips as she blew out smoke eventually she threw her cigarette into a flower bed stood up and said well good luck then she went back into the house and closed the french window behind her that was abrupt harald thought he felt deflated he stayed where he was for a minute he would have been happy to talk to her all night but she had got bored with him in five minutes he remembered now that she had made him feel alternately welcomed and rejected during his weekend visit perhaps it was a game she played or maybe it reflected her own vacillating feelings he liked the thought that she might have feelings about him even if they were unstable he walked back to the monastery the night air was already cooling karen was right it would be chilly the church had a tiled floor that looked cold he wished he had thought to bring a blanket from home he looked around for a bed the starlight that came through the windows faintly illuminated the interior of the church the east end had a curved wall that had once enclosed the altar to one side a broad ledge was incorporated into the wall a tiled canopy stood over it and harald guessed it had once framed some object of venerationa holy relic a jeweled chalice a painting of the virgin now however it looked more like a bed than anything else he could see and he lay down on the ledge through a glassless window he could see the tops of trees and a scatter of stars against a midnight blue sky he thought about karen he imagined her touching his hair with a fond gesture brushing his lips with hers putting her arms around him and hugging him these images were different from the scenes he had imagined with birgit claussen the morlunde girl he had dated at easter when birgit starred in his fantasies she was always taking off her brassiere or rolling on a bed or ripping his shirt in her haste to get at him karen played a subtler part more loving than lustful although there was always the promise of sex deep in her eyes he was cold he got up maybe he could sleep in the airplane fumbling in the dark he found the door handle but when he opened it he heard scuttling sounds and recalled that mice had nested in the upholstery he was not afraid of scuttling creatures but he could not quite bring himself to bed down with them he considered the rollsroyce he could curl up on the backseat it would be roomier than the hornet moth taking the canvas cover off in the dark might take a while but perhaps it would be worth it he wondered if the car doors were locked he was fumbling with the cover looking for some kind of fastening that he could undo when he heard light footsteps he froze a moment later the beam of an electric torch swept past the window did the duchwitzes have a security patrol at night he looked through the door that led to the cloisters the torch was approaching he stood with his back to the wall trying not to breathe then he heard a voice harald his heart leaped with pleasure karen where are you in the church her beam found him then she pointed it upward to shed a general light he saw that she was carrying a bundle i brought you some blankets he smiled he would be grateful for the warmth but he was even more happy that she cared i was just thinking of sleeping in the car youre too tall when he unfolded the blankets he found something inside i thought you might be hungry she explained in the light of her torch he saw half a loaf of bread a small basket of strawberries and a length of sausage there was also a flask he unscrewed the lid and smelled fresh coffee he realized he was ravenous he fell on the food trying not to eat like a starved jackal he heard a mew and a cat came into the circle of light it was the skinny blackandwhite tom he had seen the first time he entered the church he dropped a piece of sausage on the ground the cat sniffed it turned it over with a paw then began to eat it daintily whats the cat called harald asked karen i dont think it has a name its a stray at the back of its head it had a tuft of hair like a pyramid i think ill call him pinetop harald said after my favorite pianist good name he ate everything boy that was great thank you i should have brought more when was the last time you ate yesterday how did you get here motorcycle he pointed across the church to where he had parked the bike but its slow because it runs on peat so i took two days to get here from sande youre a determined character harald olufsen am i he was not sure whether this was a compliment yes in fact ive never met anyone quite like you on balance he thought this was good well to tell the truth i feel the same about you oh come on the world is full of spoiled rich girls who want to be ballet dancers but how many people have crossed denmark on a peatburning motorcycle he laughed pleased they were quiet for a minute i was very sorry about poul harald said eventually it must have been a terrible shock for you it was completely devastating i cried all day were you very close we only had three dates and i wasnt in love with him but all the same it was dreadful tears came to her eyes and she sniffed and swallowed harald was shamefully pleased to learn that she had not been in love with poul its very sad he said and felt hypocritical i was heartbroken when my grandma died but somehow this was worse gran was old and sick but poul was so full of energy and fun so goodlooking and fit do you know how it happened harald said tentatively nothe army has been ridiculously secretive about it she said her voice becoming angry they just say he crashed his plane and the details are classified perhaps theyre covering something up such as what she said sharply harald realized he could not tell her what he thought without revealing his own connection to the resistance their own incompetence he improvised perhaps the aircraft wasnt properly serviced they couldnt use the excuse of military secrecy to hide something like that of course they could who would know i dont believe our officers would be so dishonorable she said stiffly harald realized he had offended her as he had when he first met herand in the same way by being scornful about her credulity i expect youre right he said hastily that was insincere he felt sure she was wrong but he did not want to quarrel with her karen stood up i must get back before they lock up her voice was cold thanks for the food and blanketsyoure an angel of mercy not my usual role she said softening a little perhaps ill see you tomorrow maybe good night good night then she was gone hermia slept badly she had a dream in which she was talking to a danish policeman the conversation was amiable though she was anxious not to give herself away but she realized after a while that they were speaking english the man continued to talk as if nothing had happened while she trembled and waited for him to arrest her she woke up to find herself on a narrow bed in a lodging house on the island of bornholm she was relieved to find that the conversation with the policeman had been a dreambut there was nothing unreal about the danger that faced her now that she had woken up she was in occupied territory carrying forged papers pretending to be a secretary on vacation and if she were found out she would be hanged as a spy back in stockholm she and digby had again deceived their german followers with substitutes and having shaken them off had taken a train to the south coast in the tiny fishing village of kalvsby they had found a boatman willing to take her across the twenty miles or so of sea to bornholm she had said goodbye to digbywho could not possibly pass for danishand climbed aboard he was going to london for a day to report to churchill but he would fly back immediately and be waiting for her on the jetty in kalvsby when she returnedif she returned the fisherman had put her ashore with her bicycle on a lonely beach at dawn yesterday the man had promised to return to the same spot four days later at the same hour to make sure of him hermia had promised him double the fee for the return journey back she had cycled to hammershus the ruined castle that was her rendezvous with arne and had waited there for him all day he had not come she told herself not to be surprised arne had been working the previous day and she guessed he had not been able to get away early enough to catch the evening ferry he had probably taken the saturday morning boat and arrived on bornholm too late to reach hammershus before dark in those circumstances he would find somewhere to spend the night and come to the rendezvous first thing in the morning that was what she believed in her more cheerful moments but at the back of her mind was the constant thought that he might have been arrested it was useless to ask herself what he could have been arrested for or to argue that he had not yet committed a crime for that only led her to imagine fanciful scenarios in which he confided in a treacherous friend or wrote everything in a diary or confessed to a priest late in the day she had given up on arne and cycled to the nearest village in summer many of the islanders offered bed and breakfast to tourists and she found a place to stay without difficulty she fell into bed anxious and hungry and had bad dreams getting dressed she recalled the holiday she and arne had spent on this island registering at their hotel as mr and mrs olufsen that was when she had felt most intimate with him he loved to gamble and he would make bets with her for sexual favors if the red boat gets into harbor first you have to go around with no panties all day tomorrow and if the blue boat wins you can be on top tonight you can have anything you want my love she thought if you just show up today she decided to have breakfast this morning before cycling back to hammershus she might be waiting all day again and she did not want to faint from hunger she dressed in the cheap new clothes she had bought in stockholmenglish clothes might have given her awayand went downstairs she felt nervous as she walked into the family dining room it was more than a year since she had been in the habit of speaking danish daily after landing yesterday she had had only a few brief exchanges of words now she would have to make small talk there was one other guest in the room a middleaged man with a friendly smile who said good morning im sven fromer hermia forced herself to relax agnes ricks she said using the name on her false papers its a beautiful day she had nothing to fear she told herself she spoke danish with the accent of the metropolitan bourgeoisie and danes never knew she was english until she told them she helped herself to porridge poured cold milk over it and began to eat the tension she felt made it difficult for her to swallow sven smiled at her and said english style she stared at him appalled how had he found her out so fast what do you mean the way you eat porridge he had his milk in a glass and took sips from it between mouthfuls of porridge that was how danes ate porridge she knew perfectly well she cursed her carelessness and tried to bluff it out i prefer it this way she said as casually as she could the milk cools the porridge and you can eat it faster a girl in a hurry where are you from copenhagen me too hermia did not want to get into a conversation about exactly where in copenhagen they both lived that could too easily lead her into more errors her safest plan would be to ask him questions she had never met a man who did not like to talk about himself are you on holiday unfortunately not im a surveyor working for the government however the job is done and i dont have to be home until tomorrow so im going to spend today driving around and catch the overnight ferry this evening you have a car i need one for my work the landlady brought bacon and black bread when she had left the room sven said if youre on your own id be happy to take you around im engaged to be married hermia said firmly he smiled ruefully your fiance is a lucky man id still be glad of your company please dont be offended but i want to be alone i quite understand i hope you dont mind my asking she gave him her most charming smile on the contrary im flattered he poured himself another cup of ersatz coffe and seemed inclined to linger hermia began to relax so far she had aroused no suspicion another guest came in a man of about hermias age neatly dressed in a suit he bowed stiffly to them and spoke danish with a german accent good morning i am helmut mueller hermias heart raced good morning she said agnes ricks mueller turned expectantly to sven who stood up pointedly ignoring the newcomer and stalked out of the room mueller sat down looking hurt thank you for your courtesy he said to hermia hermia tried to behave normally she pressed her hands together to stop their shaking where are you from herr mueller i was born in luebeck she asked herself what a friendly dane might say to a german by way of small talk you speak our language well when i was a boy my family came often here to bornholm for holidays he was not suspicious hermia saw and she felt emboldened to ask a less superficial question tell me do many people refuse to speak to you such rudeness as our fellow guest has just displayed is unusual in the present circumstances germans and danes have to live together and most danes are polite he gave her a look of curiosity but you must have observed thisunless you have from another country recently arrived she realized she had made another slip no no she said hastily covering up im from copenhagen where as you say we live together as best we can i just wondered if things were different here on bornholm no much the same all conversation was dangerous she realized she stood up well i hope you enjoy your breakfast thank you and have a pleasant day here in our country i wish you the same she left the room wondering if she had been too nice overfriendliness might arouse suspicion as easily as hostility but he had shown no sign of mistrust as she was leaving on her bicycle she saw sven putting his luggage in his car it was a slopebacked volvo pv a popular swedish car often seen in denmark she saw that the rear seat had been removed to make room for his equipment tripods and a theodolite and other gear some in an assortment of leather cases some wrapped in blankets for protection i apologize for creating a scene he said i didnt wish to be rude to you thats all right she could see that he was still angry you obviously feel strongly i come from a military family its difficult for me to accept that we surrendered so quickly i believe we should have fought we should be fighting now he made a gesture of frustration as if throwing something away i shouldnt speak this way im embarrassing you she touched his arm you have nothing to apologize for thank you she rode off churchill was pacing the croquet lawn at chequers the official country residence of the british prime minister he was writing a speech in his head digby knew the signs his weekend guests were the american ambassador john winant and the foreign secretary anthony eden with their wives but none of them were to be seen digby sensed there was some crisis but no one had told him what churchills private secretary mr colville gestured toward the brooding premier digby approached churchill across the smooth grass the prime minister lifted his bent head ah hoare he said he stopped walking hitler has invaded the soviet union christ said digby hoare he wanted to sit down but there were no chairs christ he repeated yesterday hitler and stalin had been allies their friendship cemented by the nazisoviet pact of today they were at war when did that happen this morning churchill said grimly general dill has just been here to give me the details sir john dill was chief of the imperial general staff therefore the most senior man in the military early intelligence estimates put the size of the invading army at three million men three million they have attacked along a twothousandmile front there is a northern group heading for leningrad a central one making for moscow and a southern force on its way to the ukraine digby was dazed oh my god is this the end sir churchill drew on his cigar it may be most people believe the russians cant win they will be slow to mobilize with heavy air support from the luftwaffe hitlers tanks could wipe out the red army in a few weeks digby had never seen his boss look so defeated in the face of bad news churchill normally became even more pugnacious always wanting to respond to defeat by going on the attack but today he looked worn down is there any hope digby asked yes if the reds can survive until the end of summer it may be a different story the russian winter defeated napoleon and it might yet undo hitler the next three or four months will be decisive what are you going to do i shall go on the bbc tonight at nine and say that we must give whatever help we can to russia and the russian people digby raised his eyebrows a hard thing for a passionate anticommunist to propose my dear hoare if hitler invaded hell i would at least make a favorable reference to the devil in the house of commons digby smiled wondering whether that line was being considered for inclusion in tonights speech but is there any help we can give stalin has asked me to step up the bombing campaign against germany he hopes it will force hitler to bring aircraft home to defend the fatherland that would weaken the invading army and might give the russians an even chance are you going to do it i have no choice ive ordered a bombing raid for the next full moon it will be the largest air operation of the war so far which means the largest in the history of mankind there will be more than five hundred bombers over half our entire strength digby wondered if his brother would be on the raid but if they suffer the kind of losses weve been experiencing we will be crippled thats why ive called you in do you have an answer for me yesterday i infiltrated an agent into denmark her orders are to get photographs of the radar installation on sande that will answer the question it had better the bombing raid is scheduled in sixteen days time when do you hope to have the photographs in your hands within a week good churchill said dismissively thank you prime minister digby turned away dont fail me said churchill hammershus was on the northern tip of bornholm the castle stood on a hill that looked across the sea to sweden and had once guarded the island against invasion by its neighbor hermia wheeled her bicycle along the winding path up the rocky slopes wondering if today would be as fruitless as yesterday the sun was shining and she was warm from the effort of cycling the castle had been built of mixed brick and stone solitary walls remained their features forlornly suggestive of family life large sooty fireplaces exposed to the sky cold stone cellars for storing apples and ale broken staircases that led nowhere narrow windows through which thoughtful children must once have stared at the sea hermia was early and the place was deserted judging by yesterdays experience she would have it to herself for another hour or more what would it be like if arne did turn up today she wondered as she pushed her bike through ruined archways and across grassgrown floors in copenhagen before the invasion she and arne had been a glamorous couple the center of a social set of young officers and pretty girls with government connections always having parties and picnics going dancing and playing sports sailing and riding horses and driving to the beach now that those days were over would she seem to arne like part of his past on the phone he had said he still loved herbut he had not seen her for more than a year would he find her the same or changed would he still like the smell of her hair and the taste of her mouth she began to feel nervous she had spent all day yesterday looking at the ruins and they held no more interest for her she walked to the seaward side leaned her bike against a low stone wall and looked down at the beach far below a familiar voice said hello hermia she whirled around and saw arne walking toward her smiling his arms spread wide he had been waiting behind a tower her nervousness vanished she ran into his arms and hugged him hard enough to hurt whats the matter he said why are you weeping she realized she was crying her chest heaving with sobs tears running down her face im so happy she said he kissed her wet cheeks she held his face in both hands feeling his bones with her fingertips to prove to herself that he was real this was not one of the imaginary reunion scenes she had dreamed so often she nuzzled his neck breathing in the smell of him army soap and brilliantine and airplane fuel there were no smells in her dreams she was overwhelmed by emotion but the feeling slowly changed from excitement and happiness to something else their tender kisses turned searching and hungry their gentle caresses became urgently demanding when her knees felt weak she sank to the grass pulling him down with her she licked his neck sucked his lip and bit his earlobe his erection pressed against her thigh she fumbled with the buttons of his uniform trousers opening the fly so that she could feel him properly he pushed up the skirt of her dress and slid his hand beneath the elastic of her underwear she suffered a moment of coy embarrassment at how wet she was then it was forgotten in a wave of pleasure impatiently she broke the embrace long enough to take off her panties and throw them aside then pulled him on top of her it occurred to her that they were in full view of any early tourists coming to see the ruins but she did not care she knew that later when the madness had left her she would shudder with horror at the risk she had taken but she could not hold back she gasped as he entered her then clung to him with her arms and legs pressing his belly to hers his chest to her breasts his face into her neck insatiably hungry for the touch of his body then that too passed as she focused on a node of intense pleasure that began small and hot like a distant star and grew steadily seeming to possess more and more of her body until it exploded they lay still for a while she enjoyed the weight of his body on her the breathless feeling it gave her his slow detumescence then a shadow fell on them it was only a cloud passing over the sun but it reminded her that the ruins were open to the public and someone could come along at any time are we still alone she murmured he lifted his head and looked around yes wed better get up before the tourists arrive okay she grabbed him as he pulled away one more kiss he kissed her softly then stood up she found her underpants and pulled them on quickly then stood up and brushed grass off her dress now that she was decent the sense of urgency left her and all the muscles of her body felt pleasantly lassitudinous as they sometimes did when she lay in bed on sunday morning dozing and listening to church bells she leaned on the wall looking at the sea and arne put his arm around her it was hard to wrench her mind back to war deception and secrecy im working for british intelligence she said abruptly he nodded i was afraid of that afraid why it means youre in even more danger than if you had come here just to see me she was pleased that his first thought was of the peril to her he really did love her but she brought trouble now youre at risk too just because youre with me youd better explain she sat on the wall and gathered her thoughts she had failed to think of a censored version of the story that included only what he absolutely had to know no matter how she chopped it up half the truth made no sense so she had to tell him everything she was going to ask him to risk his life and he needed to know why she told him about the nightwatchmen the arrests at kastrup aerodrome the devastating rate of bomber losses the radar installation on his home island of sande the himmelbett clue and the involvement of poul kirke as she talked his face changed the merriment went from his eyes and his perennial smile was replaced by a look of anxiety she wondered whether he would accept the mission if he were a coward surely he would not have chosen to fly the flimsy woodandlinen machines of the army aviation troops on the other hand being a pilot was part of his dashing image and he often put pleasure before work it was one of the reasons she loved him she was too serious and he made her enjoy herself which was the real arnethe hedonist or the airman until now he had never been put to the test ive come to ask you to do what poul would have done if he had lived go to sande get into the base and examine the radar installation arne nodded looking solemn we need photographs good ones she leaned across to her bicycle opened the saddlebag and took out a small mm camera a germanmade leica iiia she had considered a miniature minox riga which was easier to conceal but in the end had preferred the precision of the leicas lens this is probably the most important job youll ever be asked to do when we understand their radar system we will be able to devise ways to defeat it and that will save the lives of thousands of airmen i can see that but if youre caught youll be executedshot or hangedfor spying she held out the camera she half wanted him to refuse the mission for she could hardly bear the thought of the danger he would be in if he accepted but if he refused could she ever respect him he did not take the camera poul was the head of your nightwatchmen she nodded i suppose most of our friends were in it better that you dont know just about everyone except me she nodded she feared what was coming you think im a coward it didnt seem like your kind of thing because i like parties and i make jokes and flirt with girls you thought i didnt have the guts for secret work she said nothing but he was insistent answer me she nodded miserably in that case ill have to prove you wrong he took the camera she did not know whether to be happy or sad thank you she said fighting back tears youll be careful wont you yes but theres a problem i was followed to bornholm oh hell this was something she had not anticipated are you sure yes i noticed a couple of people hanging around the base a man and a young woman she was on the train to copenhagen with me then he was on the ferry when i got here he followed me on a bicycle and there was a car behind i shook them off a few miles outside ronne they must suspect you of working with poul ironically as i wasnt who do you think they are danish police acting under orders from the germans now that youve given them the slip they undoubtedly feel sure youre guilty they must still be looking for you they cant search every house in bornholm no but theyll have people watching the ferry port and the aerodrome i hadnt thought of that so how am i going to get back to copenhagen he was not yet thinking like a spy hermia noted well have to smuggle you onto the ferry somehow and then where would i go i cant return to the flying schoolits the first place theyll look youll have to stay with jens toksvig arnes face darkened so hes one of the nightwatchmen yes his address i know where he lives arne snapped he was my friend before he was a nightwatchman he may be jumpy because of what happened to poul he wont turn me away hermia pretended not to notice arnes anger lets assume you get tonights ferry how long will it take you to get to sande first ill talk to my brother harald he worked as a laborer on the site when they were building the base so he can give me the layout then you have to allow a full day to get to jutland because the trains are always delayed i could get there late on tuesday sneak into the base on wednesday and return to copenhagen on thursday then how do i get in touch with you come back here next friday if the police are still watching the ferry youll have to find some way of disguising yourself ill meet you right here well cross to sweden with the fisherman who brought me then well get you false papers at the british legation and fly you to england he nodded grimly she said if this works out we could be together again and free in a weeks time he smiled it seems too much to hope for he did love her she decided even though he was still feeling wounded at having been left out of the nightwatchmen and still in her heart of hearts she was not sure he had the nerve for this work but she was undoubtedly going to find out while they had been talking the first few tourists had arrived and a handful of people were now strolling around the ruins peering into cellars and touching the ancient stones lets get out of here hermia said did you come on a bicycle its behind that tower arne fetched his bike and they left the castle arne wearing sunglasses and a cap to make himself hard to recognize the disguise would not pass a careful check of passengers boarding a ferry but might protect him if he chanced to meet his pursuers on the road hermia considered the problem of escape as they freewheeled down the hillside could she devise a better disguise for arne she had no wigs or costumes nor any makeup other than the minimal lipstick and powder she used herself he had to look like a different person and for that he needed professional help he could surely find it in copenhagen but not here at the foot of the hill she spotted her fellow guest at the boardinghouse sven fromer getting out of his volvo she did not want him to see arne and she hoped to ride past without his noticing her but she was unlucky he caught her eye waved and stood expectantly beside the path it would have been conspicuously rude to ignore him so she felt obliged to stop we meet again he said this must be your fiance she was not in any danger from sven she told herself there was nothing suspicious about what she was doing and anyway sven was antigerman this is oluf arnesen she said reversing arnes name oluf meet sven fromer he stayed at the same place as me last night the two men shook hands arne said conversationally have you been here long a week i leave tonight hermia was struck by a thought sven she said this morning you told me we should be fighting the germans i talk too much i ought to be more circumspect if i gave you a chance to help the british would you take a risk he stared at her you he said but how do you mean to say that you are would you be willing she pressed him this isnt some kind of trick is it youll have to trust me yes or no yes he said what do you want me to do could a man hide in the back of your car sure i could conceal him behind my equipment he wouldnt be comfortable but theres room would you be willing to smuggle someone onto the ferry tonight sven looked at his car then at arne you arne nodded sven smiled hell yes he said haralds first day working at the nielsen farm was more successful than he had dared to hope old nielsen had a small workshop with enough equipment for harald to repair just about anything he had patched the water pump on a steam plough welded a hinge on a caterpillar track and found the short circuit that caused the farmhouse lights to fuse every night he had eaten a hearty lunch of herrings and potatoes with the farmhands in the evening he had spent a couple of hours at the village tavern with karl the farmers youngest sonalthough he had drunk only two small glasses of beer remembering what a fool he had made of himself with liquor a week ago everyone was talking about hitlers invasion of the soviet union the news was bad the luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed soviet aircraft on the ground in lightning raids in the tavern everyone thought moscow would fall before winter except the local communist and even he seemed worried harald left early because karen had said she might see him after dinner he felt weary but pleased with himself as he walked back to the old monastery when he entered the ruined building he was astonished to find his brother in the church staring at the derelict aircraft a hornet moth arne said the gentlemans aerial carriage its a wreck harald said not really the undercarriage is a bit bent how do you think it happened on landing the back end of a hornet tends to swing out of control because the main wheels are too far forward but the axle tubes arent designed to withstand sideways pressure so when you swerve violently they can buckle arne looked terrible harald saw instead of his army uniform he wore what seemed to be someone elses old clothes a worn tweed jacket and faded corduroy trousers he had shaved off his moustache and a greasy cap covered his curly hair in his hands he held a small neat mm camera there was a strained expression on his face instead of his usual insouciant smile what happened to you harald said anxiously im in trouble have you got anything to eat not a thing we can go to the tavern i cant show my face im a wanted man arne tried a wry grin but it finished up as a grimace every policeman in denmark has my description and there are posters of me all over copenhagen i was chased by a cop all along the stroget and only just got away are you in the resistance arne hesitated shrugged then said yes harald was thrilled he sat on the ledge he used as a bed and arne sat next to him pinetop the cat appeared and rubbed his head against haralds leg so you were working with them when i asked you at home three weeks ago no not then i was left out at first apparently they thought i wasnt suitable for secret work by christ they were right but now theyre desperate so im in it i have to take pictures of some machinery at the military base on sande harald nodded i drew a sketch of it for poul even you were in it before me arne said bitterly well well poul told me not to tell you apparently everyone thought i was a coward i could redraw my sketches although they were only from memory arne shook his head they need accurate photos i came to ask you if theres a way to sneak inside harald found this talk of espionage exciting but it bothered him that arne did not seem to have a wellthoughtout plan theres a place where the fence is concealed by trees yesbut how are you going to get to sande if the police are looking for you ive changed my appearance not much what papers are you carrying only my ownhow would i get any others so if youre stopped by the police for any reason it will take them about ten seconds to establish that youre the man theyre all looking for thats about it harald shook his head its crazy it has to be done this equipment enables the germans to detect bombers when theyre still miles awayin time to scramble their fighters it must use radio waves harald said excitedly the british have a similar system but the germans seem to have refined it and theyre shooting down up to half the aircraft on a raid the raf is desperate to figure out how theyre doing it its worth risking my life not pointlessly if youre caught you wont be able to pass the information to the british i have to try harald took a deep breath why dont i go i knew you were going to say that no ones looking for me i know the site ive already been over the fencei took a shortcut one night and i know more about radio than you so ill have a better idea of what to photograph harald thought the logic of his argument irresistible if youre caught youll be shot as a spy same applies to youonly youre virtually certain to be caught whereas ill probably get away with it the police may have found your sketches when they came for poul if so the germans must know that someones interested in the base on sande and they will probably have improved their security as a result getting over the fence may not be as easy as it was i still have a better chance than you i cant send you into danger what if youre caughtwhat will i say to mother youll say that i died fighting for freedom ive as much right as you to take the risk give me the damn camera before arne could reply karen came in she walked softly and appeared without warning so arne had no chance to hide although reflexively he made a move to get up then stopped himself who are you karen said with her customary directness oh hello arne youve shaved off your moustachei suppose thats because of all the posters i saw in copenhagen today why are you an outlaw she sat on the covered hood of the rollsroyce crossing her long legs like a fashion model arne hesitated then said i cant tell you karens agile mind raced ahead drawing inferences with impressive speed my god youre in the resistance was poul in it too is that why he died arne nodded he didnt crash his aircraft he was trying to escape from the police and they shot at him poor poul she looked away for a moment so youve taken up where he left off but now the police are on to you someone must be sheltering youprobably jens toksvig he was pouls closest friend after you arne shrugged and nodded but you cant move around without risking arrest so she looked at harald and her voice went quiet youre in it now harald to haralds surprise she looked concerned as if she were afraid for him he was pleased that she cared he looked at arne well am i in it arne sighed and gave him the camera harald arrived in morlunde late the following day he left the steam bike in a car park next to the ferry dock feeling it would be too conspicuous on sande he had nothing with which to cover it and no way of locking it but he trusted that a casual thief would be unable to figure out how to make it go he was in time for the last ferry of the day as he waited on the dockside the evening slowly dimmed and stars appeared like the lights of distant ships on a dark sea a drunk islander came staggering along the quay peered rudely at harald muttered ah young olufsen then sat on a capstan some distance away and tried to light a pipe the boat docked and a handful of people got off to haralds surprise a danish policeman and a german soldier stood at the head of the gangway as the drunk boarded they checked his identity card haralds heartbeat seemed to falter he hesitated scared unsure whether to board had they simply stepped up security after finding his sketches as arne had forecast or were they looking for arne himself would they know harald was the brother of the wanted man olufsen was a common namebut they might have been briefed on the family he had an expensive camera in his satchel it was a popular german make but all the same it could arouse suspicion he tried to calm his mind and consider his options there were other ways of getting to sande he was not sure he could swim two miles in the open sea but he might be able to borrow or steal a small boat however if he were seen beaching the boat on sande he would be sure to be questioned he might do better to act innocent he boarded the ferry the policeman asked him what is your reason for wanting to travel to sande harald suppressed a feeling of indignation that anyone should presume to ask such a question i live there he said with my parents the policeman looked at his face i dont remember seeing you before and ive been doing this for four days ive been away at school tuesday is a strange day to come home its the end of term the policeman grunted apparently satisfied he checked the address on haralds card and showed it to the soldier who nodded and let harald on board he went to the far end of the boat and stood looking out to sea waiting for his heart to stop racing he was relieved to have passed the checkpoint but furious that he had to justify himself to a policeman when moving around his own country it seemed a silly reaction when he thought about it logically but he could not help feeling outraged at midnight the boat left the dock there was no moon in the starlight the flat island of sande was a dark swell like another wave on the horizon harald had not expected to return so soon in fact when he left on friday he had wondered if he would ever see the place again now he was back as a spy with a camera in his bag and a mission to photograph the nazis secret weapon he vaguely recalled thinking what a thrill it would be to become part of the resistance in reality it was no fun at all on the contrary he was sick with fear he felt worse as he disembarked on the familiar quay and looked across the road to the post office and the grocery store that had not changed since he could remember his life had been secure and stable for the first eighteen years now he would never feel safe again he made his way to the beach and began to tramp south the wet sand gleamed silver in the starlight he heard a girlish giggle from an unseen source in the dunes and he felt a pang of jealousy would he ever make karen giggle like that it was near dawn when he came within sight of the base he could make out the fence posts the trees and bushes inside the site showed as dark patches on the dunes if he could see so could the guards he realized he dropped to his knees and began to crawl forward a minute later he was glad of his caution he spotted two guards patrolling inside the fence side by side with a dog that was new they had not patrolled in pairs before and there had been no dogs he dropped flat the two men did not seem especially alert they were strolling not marching the one holding the dog was talking animatedly while the other smoked as they came nearer harald could hear the voice over the sound of the waves breaking on the beach he had learned german in school like all danish children the man was telling a boastful story about a woman called margareta harald was about fifty yards from the fence as the guards approached the nearest point to him the dog sniffed the air it could probably smell harald but did not know where he was it barked uncertainly the guard holding the lead was not as well trained as the dog and he told the animal to shut up then carried on explaining how he got margareta to meet him in the woodshed harald lay completely still the dog barked again and one of the guards turned on a powerful flashlight harald hid his face in the sand the beam of the flashlight played along the dunes but passed over him without stopping the guard said then she said all right but youll have to pull it out at the last minute they walked on and the dog became quiet again harald lay still until they were out of sight then he turned inland and approached the section of the fence that was concealed by vegetation he feared the soldiers might have cut down the trees but the copse was still there he crawled through the bushes reached the fence and stood up he hesitated he could back out at this point and he would have broken no law he could return to kirstenslot and concentrate on his new job spending his evenings in the tavern and his nights dreaming of karen he could take the attitude that war and politics were none of his concern as many danes did but even as he contemplated that line he was revolted he imagined himself explaining his decision to arne and karen or uncle joachim and cousin monika and he felt ashamed just for thinking about it the fence was unchanged six feet of chicken wire topped by two strands of barbed wire harald swung his satchel around to his back to keep it out of the way then climbed the fence stepped gingerly over the barbed wire and jumped down the other side now he was committed he was inside a military base with a camera if they caught him they would kill him he walked quickly forward treading softly keeping close to bushes and trees looking around constantly he passed the searchlight tower and thought with trepidation how utterly exposed he would be if someone decided to switch on the powerful beams he listened hard for patrolling footsteps but heard only the constant hushing urged by the waves after a few minutes he descended a gentle slope and entered a stand of conifers which provided him with good cover he wondered for a moment why the soldiers had not thought of chopping down the trees for better security then he realized that they served to conceal the secret radio equipment from prying eyes a moment later he reached his destination now that he knew what he was looking for he could see quite clearly the circular wall and the big rectangular grid rising from its hollow core the aerial slowly rotating like a mechanical eye scanning the dark horizon he heard again the low hum of the electric motor on either side of the structure he could make out the two smaller shapes and now in the starlight he saw that they were miniature versions of the big rotating aerial so there were three machines he wondered why might that somehow explain the remarkable superiority of german radar looking more closely at the smaller aerials he thought they were constructed differently he would need to look again in daylight but it seemed to him they might tilt as well as rotate why would that be he must make sure to get good photographs of all three pieces of apparatus the first time he was here he had jumped over the circular wall in a fright after hearing a guard cough nearby now that he had time to think he felt sure there must be an easier way in the walls were needed to protect the equipment from accidental damage but engineers surely needed to get inside for maintenance he walked around the circle peering at the brickwork in the dim light and came across a wooden door it was not locked and he passed through quietly closing it behind him he felt a little safer no one could see him from outside engineers would not do maintenance at this time of night except in an emergency if someone did come in he might just have time to leap over the wall before he was spotted he looked up at the great revolving grid it must pick up radio beams reflected off aircraft he guessed the aerial must act like a lens focusing the signals received the cable protruding from the base carried the data back to the new buildings harald had helped to construct last summer there presumably monitors displayed the results and operators stood ready to alert the luftwaffe in the halfdark with the humming machinery looming over him and the ozone smell of electricity in his nostrils he felt he was inside the beating heart of the war machine the struggle between the scientists and engineers on both sides could be as important as the battlefield clash of tanks and machine guns and he had become part of it he heard an aircraft there was no moon so it was not likely to be a bomber it might be a german fighter on a local flight or a civilian transport that had got lost he wondered if the big aerial had detected its approach an hour ago he wondered whether the smaller aerials were pointed at it he decided to step outside and take a look one of the smaller aerials faced the sea in the direction from which the aircraft was approaching the other pointed inland both were tilted at angles different from previously he thought as the aircraft roared closer he noticed the first aerial tilt more as if following it the other continued to move though in response to what he could not figure the aircraft crossed sande and headed inland the aerial dish continuing to follow it until after its sound died away to nothing harald returned to his hiding place inside the circular wall musing on what he had seen the sky was turning from black to gray at this time of year dawn broke before three oclock in another hour the sun would rise he took the camera out of his satchel arne had shown him how to use it as daylight strengthened he moved quietly around inside the wall figuring out the best angles for photographs that would reveal every detail of the machinery he and arne had agreed he would take the shots at about a quarter to five the sun would be up but it would not be shining over the wall into the installation sunshine was not necessarythe film in the camera was sensitive enough to record details without it as time went by haralds thoughts turned anxiously to escape he had arrived at night and entered the base cloaked by darkness but he could not wait until tomorrow night before leaving it was almost certain that an engineer would routinely inspect the equipment at least once during the course of a day even if nothing went wrong so harald had to get away as soon as he had taken the photoswhen it would be full daylight his departure would be a lot more dangerous than his arrival he considered which way to go to the south of where he was in the direction of his parents home the fence was only a couple of hundred yards away but the route lay across open dunes without trees or bushes going north retracing his steps under cover of vegetation much of the way would take longer but might be safer he wondered how he would face a firing squad would he be calm and proud keeping his terror under control or would he break and turn into a gibbering fool pleading for mercy and wetting himself he forced himself to wait calmly the light grew stronger and the minute hand crawled around the face of his watch he heard no new sounds from outside a soldiers day started early but he was hoping there would not be much activity before six oclockby which time he would be gone at last it was time to take the pictures the sky was cloudless and there was a clear morning light he could see every rivet and terminal of the complex piece of machinery in front of him focusing the lens carefully he photographed the revolving base of the apparatus the cables and the grid of the aerial he unfolded a yard rule from the monastery tool rack and placed it in some of the pictures to show scalehis own bright idea next he had to go outside the wall he hesitated in here he felt safe but he had to have pictures of the two smaller aerials he cracked the door all was still he could tell by the sound of the surf that the tide was coming in the base was bathed in the watery light of a seaside morning there was no sign of life it was the hour when men sleep heavily and even dogs have dreams he took careful shots of the two smaller aerials which were protected only by low walls thinking about their function he realized that one of them had been tracking an aircraft that was within visual range the whole point of this apparatus was to detect bombers before they came into sight he had thought presumably the second small aerial was tracking another aircraft snapping photographs he turned the puzzle over in his mind how could three devices work together to increase the kill rate of luftwaffe fighters perhaps the large aerial gave advance warning of a bombers approach and the smaller one tracked the bomber within german airspace but then what did the second smaller aerial do it occurred to him that there would be another aircraft in the skythe fighter that had been scrambled to attack the bomber could the second aerial be used by the luftwaffe to track their own aircraft it seemed crazy but as he stepped back to photograph the three aerials together showing their placement relative to one another he realized it made perfect sense if a luftwaffe controller knew the positions of the bomber and the fighter he could direct the fighter by radio until it made contact with the bomber he began to see how the luftwaffe might be working the large aerial gave advance warning of a raid so that the fighters could be scrambled in time one of the smaller aerials picked up a bomber as it came closer the other tracked a fighter enabling the controller to direct the pilot precisely to the bombers location after that it was like shooting fish in a barrel that thought made harald realize how exposed he was standing upright in full daylight in the middle of a military base photographing top secret equipment panic surged through his veins like poison he tried to calm himself and take the last few photos he had planned showing the three aerials from different angles but he was too terrified he had taken at least twenty shots it must be enough he told himself he thrust the camera into his satchel and started walking quickly away forgetting his resolution to take the longer but safer route north he headed south across the open dunes in that direction the fence was visible just beyond the old boathouse he had bumped into last time today he would pass it on the seaward side and it would hide him from sight for a few paces as he approached it a dog barked he looked around wildly but saw no soldiers and no dog then he realized the sound had come from the boathouse the soldiers must be using the derelict building as a kennel a second dog joined the barking harald broke into a run the dogs excited one another more joined in and the noise became hysterically loud harald reached the building then turned seaward trying to keep the boathouse between himself and the main buildings while he sprinted for the fence fear gave him speed every second he expected a shot to ring out he reached the fence not knowing whether he had been seen or not he climbed it like a monkey and vaulted over the barbed wire at the top he came down hard on the other side splashing in shallow water he scrambled to his feet and glanced back through the fence beyond the boathouse partly obscured by trees and bushes he could see the main buildings but no soldiers were in view he turned away and ran he stayed in the shallow water for a hundred yards so that the dogs could not follow his scent then he turned inland he left shallow footprints in the hard sand but he knew the fastmoving tide would cover them in a minute or two he reached the dunes where he left no visible trace a few minutes later he came to the dirt road he glanced back and saw no one following breathing hard he headed for the parsonage he ran past the church to the kitchen door it was open his parents were always up early he stepped inside his mother was at the stove wearing a dressing gown making tea when she saw him she gave a cry of shock and dropped the earthenware teapot it hit the tiled floor and the spout broke off harald picked up the two pieces im sorry to startle you he said harald he kissed her cheek and hugged her is my father at home in the church there wasnt time to tidy up last night so hes gone to straighten the chairs what happened last night there was no service on a monday evening the board of deacons met to discuss your case theyre going to read you out next sunday the revenge of the flemmings harald found it strange that he had once thought that sort of thing important by now guards would have gone to find out what had disturbed the dogs if they were thorough they might check nearby houses and look for a fugitive in sheds and barns mother he said if the soldiers come here will you tell them ive been in bed all night whatever has happened she said fearfully ill explain later it would be more natural if he were in bed he thought tell them im still asleepwill you all right he left the kitchen and went upstairs to his bedroom he slung his satchel over the back of the chair he took the camera out and put it in a drawer he thought of hiding it but there was no time and a hidden camera was proof of guilt he shed his clothes quickly put on his pajamas and got into bed he heard his fathers voice in the kitchen he got out of bed and went to the top of the stairs to listen whats he doing here the pastor said his mother replied hiding from the soldiers for goodness sake what has the boy got himself into now i dont know but his mother was interrupted by a loud knocking a young mans voice said in german good morning were looking for someone have you seen a stranger at any time in the last few hours no nobody at all the nervousness in his mothers voice was so evident that the soldier must have noticed itbut perhaps he was used to people being frightened of him how about you sir his father said firmly no is there anyone else here haralds mother replied my son hes still asleep i need to search the house the voice was polite but it was making a statement not asking permission ill show you around said the pastor harald returned to his bed heart thudding he heard booted footsteps on the tiled floors downstairs and doors opening and closing then the boots came up the wooden staircase they entered his parents bedroom then arnes old room and finally approached haralds he heard the handle of his door turn he closed his eyes feigning sleep and tried to make his breathing slow and even the german voice said quietly your son yes there was a pause has he been here all night harald held his breath he had never known his father to tell even a white lie then he heard yes all night he was flabbergasted his father had lied for him the hardhearted stiffnecked selfrighteous old tyrant had broken his own rules he was human after all harald felt tears behind his closed eyelids the boots receded along the passage and down the stairs and harald heard the soldier take his leave he got out of bed and went to the top of the stairs you can come down now his father said hes gone he went down his father looked solemn thank you for that father harald said i committed a sin his father said for a moment harald thought he was going to be angry then the old face softened however i believe in a forgiving god harald realized the agony of conflict his father had been through in the last few minutes but he did not know how to say that he understood the only thing he could think of was to shake hands he held out his hand his father looked at it then took it he drew harald to him and put his left arm around haralds shoulders he closed his eyes struggling to contain a profound emotion when he spoke the resonant boom of the preacher had gone from his voice and his words came out in a murmur of anguish i thought they would kill you he said my dear son i thought they would kill you arne olufsen had slipped through peter flemmings fingers peter brooded over this as he boiled an egg for inges breakfast after arne shook off the surveillance on bornholm peter had said blithely that they would soon pick him up again peters confidence had been badly misplaced he believed arne was not cunning enough to get off the island unobservedand he had been wrong he did not yet know how arne had managed it but there was no doubt he had returned to copenhagen for a uniformed policeman had spotted him in the city center the patrolman had given chase but arne had outrun himand vanished again some kind of espionage was obviously still going on as peters boss frederik juel had pointed out with icy scorn olufsen is apparently performing evasive maneuvers he had said general braun had been more blunt the killing of poul kirke has clearly failed to disable the spy ring he had said there had been no further talk of promoting peter to head of department i shall call in the gestapo it was so unfair peter thought angrily he had uncovered this spy ring found the secret message in the airplane chock arrested the mechanics raided the synagogue arrested ingemar gammel raided the flying school killed poul kirke and flushed out arne olufsen yet people such as juel who had done nothing were able to denigrate his achievements and prevent his getting the recognition that was his due but he was not finished yet i can find arne olufsen he had said to general braun last night juel had started to object but peter had overridden him give me twentyfour hours if hes not in custody tomorrow night call in the gestapo braun had agreed arne had not returned to barracks nor was he with his parents on sande so he had to be hiding out at the home of a fellow spy but they would all be lying low however one person who probably knew most of the spies was karen duchwitz she had been pouls girlfriend and her brother was at school with pouls cousin she was not a spy peter felt sure so she had no reason to lie low she might lead peter to arne it was a long shot but it was all he had he mashed the softboiled egg up with salt and a little butter then took the tray into the bedroom he sat inge up and gave her a spoonful of egg he got the feeling she did not much like it he tasted it and it was fine so he gave her another spoonful after a moment she pushed it out of her mouth like a baby the egg ran down her chin and onto the bodice of her nightdress peter stared in despair she had made a mess of herself several times in the past week or two this was a new development inge would never have done that he said he put the tray down left her and went to the phone he dialed the hotel on sande and asked for his father who was always at work early when he got through he said you were right its time to put inge in a home peter studied the royal theatre a domed nineteenthcentury building of yellow stone its facade was carved with columns pilasters capitals corbels wreaths shields lyres masks cherubs mermaids and angels on the roof were urns torcheres and fourlegged creatures with wings and human breasts its a bit overdone he said even for a theater tilde jespersen laughed they were sitting on the verandah of the hotel dangleterre they had a good view across the kongens nytorv the largest square in copenhagen inside the theater the students of the ballet school were watching a dress rehearsal of les sylphides the current production peter and tilde were waiting for karen duchwitz to come out tilde was pretending to read todays newspaper the frontpage headline said leningrad aflame even the nazis were surprised at how well the russian campaign was going saying their success baffled the imagination peter was talking to release tension so far his plan was a complete failure karen had been under surveillance all day and had done nothing but go to school but fruitless anxiety was debilitating and led to mistakes so he tried to relax he said do you think architects deliberately make theaters and opera houses intimidating to discourage ordinary people from going in do you consider yourself an ordinary person of course the entrance was flanked by two green statues of sitting figures larger than lifesize who are those two holberg and oehlenschlager he recognized the names they were both great danish playwrights i dont much like dramatoo many speeches id rather see a movie something to make me laugh buster keaton or laurel and hardy did you see the one where these guys are whitewashing a room and someone comes in carrying a plank on his shoulder he chuckled at the recollection i nearly fell on the damn floor laughing she gave him one of her enigmatic looks now you have surprised me i wouldnt have put you down as a lover of slapstick what did you imagine i would like western movies where gunplay ensures that justice is triumphant youre right i like those too what about you do you enjoy theater copenhageners approve of culture in theory but most of them have never been inside that building i like operado you well the tunes are okay but the stories are silly she smiled ive never thought of it that way but youre right how about ballet i dont really see the point and the costumes are peculiar to tell the truth i find the mens tights a bit embarrassing she laughed again oh peter youre so funny but i like you all the same he had not intended to be amusing but he accepted the compliment cheerfully he glanced down at the photograph in his hand he had taken it from poul kirkes bedroom it showed poul sitting on a bicycle with karen perched on the crossbar they were both wearing shorts karen had wonderful long legs they looked such a happy couple full of energy and fun that for a moment peter felt sad that poul had died he had to remind himself sternly that poul had chosen to be a spy and to flout the law the purpose of the photo was to help him identify karen she was attractive with a big smile and masses of curly hair she seemed the antithesis of tilde who had small neat features in a round face some of the men said tilde was frigid because she repelled their advancesbut i know better peter thought they had not talked about the fiasco in the hotel on bornholm peter was too embarrassed to raise it he was not going to apologizethat would just be further humiliation but a plan was forming in his mind something so dramatic he preferred to think about it only vaguely here she comes said tilde peter looked across the square and saw a group of young people emerging from the theater he picked out karen immediately she was wearing a straw boater at a jaunty angle and a mustard yellow summer dress with a flared skirt that danced enticingly around her knees the blackandwhite photograph had not shown her white skin and flaming red hair nor had it done justice to the spirited air that was obvious to peter even at a distance she looked as if she were making an entrance on the stage of the theater rather than merely walking down the steps outside she crossed the square and turned into the main drag the stroget peter and tilde stood up before we go peter said what will you come to my apartment this evening any special reason yes but id rather not explain all right thanks he said no more but hurried after karen tilde followed him at a distance by prearrangement the stroget was a narrow street crowded with shoppers and buses frequently blocked by illegally parked cars double the fines and ticket every car and the problem would go away peter felt sure he kept karens straw hat in sight he prayed she was not simply heading for home at the end of the stroget was the town hall square here the group of students dispersed karen walked on with just one of the girls chatting animatedly peter drew closer they passed the tivoli garden and stopped as if about to part company but continued their conversation they looked pretty and carefree in the afternoon sunshine peter wondered impatiently how much more two girls could have to say to each other after having spent all day together at last karens friend walked toward the main railway station and karen went the opposite way peters hopes rose did she have a rendezvous with one of the circle of spies he followed her but to his dismay she approached vesterport a suburban railway station from which she could catch a train to her home village of kirstenslot this was no good he had only a few hours left clearly she was not going to lead him to one of the circle he would have to force the situation he caught up with her at the entrance to the station excuse me he said i must speak to you she gave him a level look and kept walking what is it she said with cool politeness could we talk for just a minute she passed through the entrance and started down the steps to the platform were talking he pretended to be nervous im taking a terrible risk just speaking to you that got to her she stopped on the platform and glanced around nervously whats this about she had wonderful eyes he noticed a striking clear green its about arne olufsen he saw fear in those eyes and was gratified his instinct had been right she knew something what about him she managed to keep her voice low and even arent you a friend of his no ive met himi used to go out with a friend of his but i dont really know him why are you asking me do you know where he is no she spoke firmly and he thought with dismay that she looked as if she was telling the truth but he was not yet ready to give up could you get a message to him she hesitated and peters heart leaped with hope he guessed she was wondering whether to lie or not possibly she said after a moment i cant be sure what sort of message im with the police she took a frightened step back its all right im on your side he could tell that she did not know whether to believe him im nothing to do with the security department i do road accidents but our office is next to theirs and sometimes i hear whats going on what have you heard arne is in great danger the security department know where hes hiding my god peter noted that she did not ask what the security department was or what crime arne was supposed to have committed and she showed no surprise about his being in hiding she must therefore know what arne was up to he concluded with a sense of triumph on that basis he could arrest and interrogate her but he had a better plan he put a note of dramatic urgency into his voice theyre going to arrest him tonight oh no if you know how to reach arne please for gods sake try to get a warning to him in the next hour i dont think i cant risk being seen with you i have to go im sorry do your best he turned and walked rapidly away at the top of the steps he passed tilde who was pretending to read a timetable she did not look at him but he knew she had seen him and she would now follow karen across the street a man in a leather apron was unloading crates of beer from a wagon drawn by two big horses peter stepped behind the cart he took off his trilby hat stuffed it inside his jacket and replaced it with a peaked cap he knew from experience that this simple switch effected a remarkable change in his appearance it would not defy careful scrutiny but at a casual glance he looked like a different person standing half concealed by the wagon he watched the station entrance after a few moments karen came out tilde was a few paces behind her peter followed tilde they turned a corner and walked along the street that lay between the tivoli and the main railway station on the next block karen turned in to the main post office a grand classical building of redbrick and gray stone tilde followed her in she was going to make a phone call peter thought with exhilaration he ran to the staff entrance he showed his police badge to the first person he met a young woman and said bring the duty manager quick a few moments later a stooped man in a wellworn black suit appeared how may i help you a young woman in a yellow dress has just entered the main hall peter told him i dont want her to see me but i need to know what she does the manager looked thrilled this was probably the most exciting thing that had ever happened in the post office peter thought my goodness said the man youd better come with me he hurried along a corridor and opened a door peter could see a counter with a row of stools facing small windows the manager stepped through the door i think i see her he said curly red hair and a straw hat thats the one id never have guessed she was a criminal what is she doing looking in the telephone directory amazing that someone so pretty if she makes a call i need to listen the manager hesitated peter had no right to listen to private phone calls without a warrantbut he was hoping the manager would not know that its very important he said im not sure i can dont worry ill take responsibility shes putting the phone book down peter was not going to let karen phone arne without listening in if necessary he would pull his gun and threaten this dozy post office clerk he decided i must insist we have rules here nevertheless ah said the manager shes put the book down but shes not coming to the counter his face cleared with relief shes leaving peter cursed with frustration and ran for the exit he cracked the door and peeped out he saw karen crossing the road he waited until tilde emerged following karen then he tagged along he was disappointed but not defeated karen knew the name of someone who could get in touch with arne she had looked that name up in the phone book why the hell had she not phoned the person perhaps she fearedrightlythat the conversation might be overheard by police or german security staff doing routine surveillance still if she had not wanted the phone number she must have been looking for the address and now if peters luck was in she was heading for that address he let karen get out of sight but kept tilde in view walking behind tilde was always a pleasure it was good to have an excuse to watch her rounded rear did she know he was staring at her was she exaggerating the sway of her hips deliberately he had no idea who could tell what was in a womans mind they crossed to the small island of christiansborg and followed the waterfront with the harbor on their right and the ancient buildings of the government island on their left the sunwarmed air of the city was refreshed here by a salty breeze from the baltic sea the broad channel of water was lined by freighters fishing boats ferries and ships of the danish and german navies two young sailors fell in behind tilde and cheerfully tried to pick her up but she spoke sharply to them and they peeled off immediately karen walked as far as the palace of amalienborg then turned inland following tilde peter crossed the wide square formed by the four rococo mansions where the royal family lived from there they headed into nyboder a neighborhood of small houses originally built as cheap accommodation for sailors they entered a street called st pauls gade peter could see karen in the distance looking at a row of yellow houses with red roofs apparently searching for a number he had a strong exciting feeling of being close to his quarry karen paused and looked up and down the street as if checking whether she was observed it was far too late for that of course but she was an amateur in any case she did not appear to register tilde and peter was too far away to be recognized she knocked on a door as peter caught up with tilde the door opened he could not see who was there karen said something and stepped inside and the door closed it was number fiftythree peter noted tilde said do you think arne is in there either him or someone who knows where he is what do you want to do wait he looked up and down the street on the opposite side was a corner shop over there they crossed the road and stood looking in the window peter lit a cigarette tilde said the shop probably has a phone should we call headquarters we might as well go in in force we dont know how many spies might be in there peter considered summoning reinforcements not yet he said were not sure whats happening lets see how this develops tilde nodded she removed her sky blue beret and put a nondescript patterned scarf over her head peter watched her tuck the curls of her fair hair under the scarf she would look somewhat different when karen came out of the house so that karen was less likely to notice her tilde took the cigarette from peters fingers put it to her own mouth drew in smoke and handed the cigarette back it was an intimate gesture and he felt almost as if she had kissed him he sensed that he was blushing and looked away toward number fiftythree the door opened and karen came out look he said and tilde followed his gaze the door closed behind karen and she walked away alone damn peter said what do we do now tilde asked peter thought fast suppose arne was inside the little yellow house then peter needed to summon reinforcements bust into the house and arrest him and anyone with him on the other hand arne might be somewhere else and karen could be on her way therein which case peter needed to follow her or she might have failed in her quest and decided to give up and go home he made a decision well split up he told tilde you follow karen ill call headquarters and raid that house okay tilde hurried after karen peter went into the shop it was a general store selling vegetables and bread and household necessities such as soap and matches there were cans of food on the shelves and the floor was obstructed by bundles of firewood and sacks of potatoes the place looked dirty but prosperous he showed his police badge to a grayhaired woman in a stained apron do you have a phone ill have to charge you he fumbled in his pocket for change where is it he said impatiently she jerked her head toward a curtain at the back through there he threw some coins on the counter and passed into a small parlor that smelled of cats he snatched up the phone called the politigaarden and got conrad i think i may have found arnes hideout number fiftythree st pauls gade get dresler and ellegard and come here in a car as fast as you can right away said conrad peter hung up and hurried outside he had been less than a minute if anyone had left the house during that time they should still be visible on the street he looked up and down he saw an old man in a collarless shirt walking an arthritic dog the two of them moving with painful slowness a lively pony was drawing a flatbed cart carrying a sofa with holes in the leather upholstery a group of boys were playing football in the road using an old tennis ball worn bald with use there was no sign of arne he crossed the street indulging himself for a moment he thought how satisfying it would be to arrest the elder son of the olufsen family what a revenge that would be for the humiliation of axel flemming all those years ago coming immediately after the expulsion from school of the younger son the unmasking of arne as a spy would surely mean the end of pastor olulfsens hegemony how could he strut and preach when both his sons had gone wrong he would have to resign peters father would be pleased the door of number fiftythree opened peter reached under his jacket and touched the grip of his gun in its shoulder holster as arne stepped out of the house peter was filled with elation arne had shaved off his moustache and covered his black hair with a workmans cap but peter had known him all his life and recognized him immediately after a moment triumph was replaced by caution there was often trouble when a lone officer tried to make an arrest the possibility of escape looked tempting to the suspect who was up against only one cop being a plainclothes detective lacking the authority of a uniform made it worse if there was a fight passersby had no way of knowing that one of the two was an officer and might even intervene on the wrong side peter and arne had fought once before twelve years ago at the time of the quarrel between their families peter was bigger but arne was fit and strong from all the sports he did there was no clear result they had traded several blows then been separated today peter had a gun but perhaps arne did too arne slammed the house door and turned onto the street walking toward peter as they came closer arne avoided his eye walking on the inside of the pavement near the house walls in the manner of a fugitive peter walked on the curbside furtively watching arnes face when they were ten yards apart arne stole a glance at peters face peter met his eye watching his expression he saw a frown of puzzlement then recognition then shock fear and panic arne stopped momentarily frozen youre under arrest peter said arne partly recovered his composure and for a moment the familiar careless grin flickered across his face gingerbread pete he said using a childhood nickname peter saw that arne was about to make a run for it he drew his gun lie on the ground facedown with your hands behind your back arne looked worried rather than frightened in a moment of insight peter saw that it was not the gun arne was scared of but something else arne said in a challenging tone are you ready to shoot me if necessary peter said he leveled the gun threateningly but in truth he was desperate to take arne alive poul kirkes death had deadended the investigation he wanted to interrogate arne not kill him arne smiled enigmatically then turned and ran peter held his gun arm straight and sighted along the barrel he aimed at arnes legs but it was impossible to shoot accurately with a pistol and he knew he might hit any part of arnes body or none but arne was getting farther away and peters chances of stopping him were diminishing with every split second that passed peter pulled the trigger arne kept running peter fired again repeatedly after the fourth shot arne seemed to stagger peter fired again and arne fell hitting the ground with the heavy thud of a dead weight rolling onto his back oh christ no not again peter said he ran forward still pointing the gun at arne the figure on the ground lay still peter knelt beside it arne opened his eyes his face was white with pain you stupid pig you should have killed me he said tilde came to peters apartment that evening she was wearing a new pink blouse with flowers embroidered on the cuffs pink suited her peter thought it brought out her femininity the weather was warm and she seemed to have nothing on under the blouse he showed her into the living room the evening sun shone in lighting the room with a weird glow giving a fuzzy edge to the furniture and the pictures on the walls inge sat in a chair by the fireplace gazing into the room with the expressionless look she always wore peter drew tilde to him and kissed her she froze for a moment surprised then she kissed him back he stroked her shoulders and her hips she pulled back and looked in his face he could see desire in her eyes but she was troubled she glanced at inge is this all right she said he touched her hair hush he kissed her again hungrily they became more passionate without breaking the kiss he unbuttoned her blouse exposing her soft breasts he stroked the warm skin she pulled away again breathing hard her breasts rose and fell as she panted what about her she said what about inge peter looked at his wife she was regarding the two of them with a blank stare showing no emotion at all as always theres no one there he told tilde no one there at all she looked into his eyes her face showed compassion and understanding mingled with curiosity and lust all right she said all right he bent his head to her naked breasts part three the quiet village of jansborg was creepy by twilight the villagers seemed to go to bed early so the streets were deserted and the houses dark and still harald felt as if he were driving through a place where something dreadful had happened and he was the only person who did not know about it he parked the motorcycle outside the railway station it did not look as conspicuous as he had feared for next to it was a gaspowered opel olympia cabriolet with a wooden structure like a shed over its rear roof to house the giant fuel bag he left the bike and set off to walk to the school in the gathering darkness after his escape from the guards on sande he had got back into his old bed and slept heavily until midday his mother woke him fed him a vast lunch of cold pork and potatoes pushed money into his pocket and pleaded with him to tell her where he was living weakened by her affection and his fathers unexpected mellowing he had told her he was staying in kirstenslot however he had not mentioned the disused church for fear she would worry about him sleeping rough and he had left her with the impression he was a guest at the big house then he had set out to drive across denmark from west to east again now in the evening of the following day he was approaching his old school he had decided to develop the film before going to copenhagen to hand it over to arne who was hiding out at jens toksvigs house in the nyboder district he needed to be sure that his photography had been successful and there were clear images on the roll cameras could go wrong and photographers made mistakes he did not want arne to risk his life traveling to england with a film that turned out to be blank the school had its own darkroom with all the chemicals necessary for processing tik duchwitz was secretary of the camera club and had a key harald avoided the main gates and cut across the neighboring farm to enter the school via the stables it was ten oclock the younger boys were already in bed and the middle school was getting undressed only the seniors were still about and most of them were in their studybedrooms it was graduation day tomorrow and they would be packing for home threading through the familiar cluster of buildings harald fought the temptation to skulk furtively along walls and dash across open spaces if he walked naturally and confidently he would appear to the casual glance to be a senior boy heading for his room he was surprised at how difficult it was to fake an identity that had been genuinely his only ten days ago he saw no one on his way to the red house the building where tik and mads had their rooms there was no way he could conceal himself as he climbed the stairs to the top floor if he met someone he would be recognized instantly but his luck held the upper corridor was deserted he hurried past the rooms of the housemaster mr moller he quietly opened tiks door and stepped inside tik was sitting on the lid of his suitcase trying to close it you he said good god harald sat beside him and helped him snap the catches closed looking forward to going home no such luck tik said im being exiled to aarhus ive got to spend the summer working in a branch of the family bank its my punishment for going to that jazz club with you oh harald had been looking forward to having tiks company at kirstenslot but now he decided there was no need to mention that he was living there what are you doing here tik asked when they had the suitcase shut and strapped i need your help tik grinned what now harald took the small roll of thirtyfive millimeter film from his trousers pocket i want to develop this why cant you take it to a shop because i would be arrested tiks grin faded and he became solemn youre involved in a conspiracy against the nazis something like that youre in danger yes there was a tap at the door harald dropped to the floor and slid under the bed tik said yes harald heard the door opening then mollers voice saying lights out please duchwitz yes sir good night good night sir the door closed and harald rolled out from under the bed they listened while moller progressed along the corridor saying good night to each boy they heard his footsteps returning to his own rooms then his door closing they knew he would not reappear until morning unless there should be an emergency keeping his voice low harald said to tik have you still got the key to the darkroom yes but first wed have to get into the labs the science building was locked at night we can break a window at the back when they see the smashed glass theyll know someone broke in what do you care youre leaving tomorrow all right they took off their shoes and crept out into the corridor they went down the stairs silently and put their shoes back on when they reached the door then they stepped outside it was now after eleven and night had fallen at this hour no one would normally be moving about the grounds so they had to take care not to be seen from a window fortunately there was no moon they hurried away from the red house their footsteps muffled by grass as they reached the church harald glanced back and saw a light in one of the senior rooms a figure crossed the window and paused a split second later harald and tik had turned the corner of the church i think we might have been seen harald whispered theres a light on in the red house staff bedrooms all look out onto the back tik pointed out if we were seen by someone it must have been a boy nothing to worry about harald hoped he was right they circled the library and approached the science building from the rear although new it had been designed to match the older structures around so it had redbrick walls and composite casement windows each made up of six panes of glass harald took off a shoe and tapped a window with its heel it seemed quite strong when youre playing football glass is so fragile he murmured he put his hand inside the shoe and hit the pane hard it broke with a noise like the last trump the two boys stood still aghast at how loud it had been but silence descended as if nothing had happened there was no one in the nearby buildingsthe church the library and the gymnasiumand when haralds heartbeat quietened he realized that the smash had gone unheard he used his shoe to knock out the jagged edges from the frame they fell inside onto a laboratory bench he put his arm through and unlatched the window still using the shoe to protect his hand from cuts he reached inside and swept the shards to one side then he climbed in tik followed and they closed the window behind them they were in the chemistry lab astringent smells of acids and ammonia stung haralds nostrils he could see almost nothing but the room was familiar and he made his way to the door without crashing into anything he passed into the corridor and found the door to the darkroom once they were both inside tik locked the door and switched on the light harald realized that as no light could get into the darkroom none could escape either tik rolled up his sleeves and went to work he ran warm water into a sink and busied himself with chemicals from a row of jars he took the temperature of the water in the sink and added hot until he was satisfied harald understood the principles but had never tried to do this himself so he had to trust his friend what if something had gone wrongthe shutter had not operated properly or the film had been fogged or the image was blurred the pictures would be useless did he have the nerve to try again he would have to go back to sande climb that fence in the dark sneak into the installation wait for sunrise take more pictures then attempt to escape in daylight all over again he was not sure he could summon up the strength of will when all was ready tik set a timer and turned off the light harald sat patiently in the dark while tik unrolled the exposed film and began the process that would develop the picturesif there were any pictures he explained that he was bathing the film first in pyrogallol which would react with the silver salts to form a visible image they sat and waited until the clockwork timer rang its bell then tik washed the film in acetic acid to stop the reaction finally he bathed it in hypo to fix the image at last he said that should do it harald held his breath tik turned on the light harald was dazzled for a few moments and could not see anything when his vision cleared he peered at the length of grayish film in tiks hands harald had risked his life for this tik held it up to the light at first harald could not make out any images and he thought he would have to do it all again then he remembered he was looking at a negative on which black appeared white and vice versa and he began to make out the shapes he saw a reverse image of the large rectangular aerial that had so intrigued him when he first saw it four weeks ago he had succeeded he looked along the row of images and recognized each one the rotating base the clustered cables the grid taken from several angles two smaller machines with their tilting aerials and finally the last picture a general view of all three structures taken when he was on the edge of panic they came out he said triumphantly theyre great tik looked pale what are these pictures of he said in a frightened voice some new machinery the germans have invented for detecting approaching aircraft i wish i hadnt asked do you realize what the punishment is for what were doing i took the pictures and i developed the film god in heaven i could be hanged i told you it was this kind of thing i know but i didnt really think it through im sorry tik rolled the film and put it in its cylindrical container here take it he said im going back to bed to forget that this ever happened harald put the canister in his trousers pocket then they heard voices tik groaned harald froze listening at first he could not make out the words but he felt sure the sounds came from within the building not outside then he heard the distinctive voice of heis say there doesnt seem to be anyone here the next voice belonged to a boy they definitely came this way sir harald frowned at tik who tik whispered it sounds like woldemar borr of course harald groaned borr was the school nazi it must have been he who saw them from the window what bad luckany other boy would have kept his mouth shut then there was a third voice look theres a broken pane in this window it was mr moller this must be how they got inwhoever they are im sure harald olufsen was one of them sir said borr he sounded pleased with himself harald said to tik lets get out of this darkroom maybe we can prevent their learning that weve been doing photography he flicked off the light turned the key in the lock and opened the door all the lights were on and heis was standing right outside oh shit said harald heis was wearing a shirt without a collar he had obviously been on his way to bed he looked down his long nose so it is you olufsen yes sir borr and mr moller appeared behind heis youre no longer a pupil at this school you know heis went on its my duty to call the police and have you arrested for burglary harald suffered a moment of panic if the police found the film in his pocket he would be finished and duchwitz is with youi might have known heis added seeing tik behind harald but what on earth are you doing harald had to persuade heis not to call the policebut he could not explain in front of borr he said sir if i could speak to you alone heis hesitated harald decided that if heis refused and called the police he would not surrender gracefully he would make a run for it but how far would he get please sir he said give me a chance to explain very well heis said reluctantly borr go back to bed and you duchwitz mr moller perhaps youd better see them to their rooms they all departed heis walked into the chemistry lab sat on a stool and took out his pipe all right olufsen he said what is it this time harald wondered what to say he could not think of a plausible lie but he feared the truth would be more incredible than anything he might invent in the end he simply took the little cylinder out of his pocket and gave it to heis heis took out the roll of film and held it up to the light this looks like some kind of newfangled radio installation he said is it military yes sir do you know what it does it tracks aircraft by radio beams i think so thats how theyre doing it the luftwaffe claim theyve been shooting down raf bombers like flies this explains it i believe they track the bomber and the fighter that has been sent to intercept it so that the controller can direct the fighter precisely heis looked over his glasses my god do you realize how important this is i think so theres only one way the british can help the russians and thats by forcing hitler to bring aircraft back from the russian front to defend germany from air raids heis was exarmy and military thinking came naturally to him harald said im not sure i see what youre getting at well the strategy wont work while the germans can shoot bombers down easily but if the british find out how its done they can devise countermeasures heis looked around there must be an almanac here somewhere harald did not see why he needed an almanac but he knew where it was in the physics office go and get it heis put the film down on the laboratory bench and lit his pipe while harald stepped into the next room found the almanac on the bookshelf and brought it back heis flipped through the pages the next full moon is on the eighth of july id bet there will be a big bombing raid that night its twelve days away can you get this film to england by then its someone elses job good luck to him olufsen do you know how much danger youre in yes the penalty for spying is death i know you always had guts ill give you that he handed back the film is there anything you need food money petrol no thanks heis stood up ill see you off the premises they went out by the main door the night air cooled the perspiration on haralds forehead they walked side by side along the road to the gate i dont know what im going to tell moller said heis if i might make a suggestion by all means you could say we were developing dirty pictures good idea theyll all believe that they reached the gate and heis shook haralds hand for gods sake be careful boy said the head i will good luck goodbye harald walked away in the direction of the village when he reached the bend in the road he looked back heis was still at the gate watching him harald waved and heis waved back then harald walked on he crawled under a bush and slept until sunrise then retrieved his motorcycle and drove into copenhagen he felt good as he steered through the outskirts of the city in the morning sunshine he had suffered some close shaves but in the end he had done what he promised he was going to enjoy handing over the film arne would be impressed then haralds job would be done and it would be up to arne to get the pictures to britain after seeing arne he would drive back to kirstenslot he would have to beg farmer nielsen for his job back he had only worked one day before disappearing for the rest of the week nielsen would be annoyedbut he might need haralds services badly enough to hire him again being at kirstenslot would mean seeing karen he looked forward eagerly to that she was not interested in him romantically and she never would be but she seemed to like him for his part he was content to talk to her the idea of kissing her was too remote even to wish for he made his way to nyboder arne had given harald the address of jens toksvig st pauls gade was a narrow street of small terraced houses there were no front gardens the doors opened directly onto the pavement harald parked the bike outside fiftythree and knocked it was answered by a uniformed policeman for a moment harald was struck dumb where was arne he must have been arrested what is it lad the policeman said impatiently he was a middleaged man with a gray moustache and sergeants stripes on his sleeve harald was inspired displaying a panic that was all too real he said wheres the doctor he must come right away shes having the baby now the policeman smiled the terrified fathertobe was a perennial figure of comedy theres no doctor here lad but there must be calm down son there were babies before there were doctors now what address have you got dr thorsen fiftythree fischers gade he must be here right number wrong street this is st pauls gade fischers gade is one block south oh my god the wrong street harald turned away and jumped onto the bike thank you he shouted he opened the steam regulator and pulled away all part of the job the policeman said harald drove to the end of the street and turned the corner very clever he thought but what the hell do i do now hermia spent all friday morning in the beautiful ruin of hammershus castle waiting for arne to arrive with the vital film it was now even more important than it had been five days ago when she had sent him on the mission in the interim the world had changed the nazis were set fair to conquer the soviet union they had already taken the key fortress of brest their total air superiority was devastating the red army digby had told her in a few grim sentences of his conversation with churchill bomber command would commit every plane it could get off the ground to the biggest air raid of the war in a desperate attempt to draw luftwaffe strength away from the russian front and give the soviet soldiers a chance to fight back that raid was now eleven days away digby had also talked to his brother bartlett who was fit again back on active service and certain to be piloting one of the bombers the raid would be a suicide mission and bomber command would be fatally weakened unless they could develop tactics for evading german radar in the next few days and that depended on arne hermia had persuaded her swedish fisherman to bring her across the water againalthough he had warned her that this would be the last time as he felt it dangerous to fall into a pattern at dawn she had splashed through the shallows carrying her bike onto the beach below hammershus she had climbed the steep hill to the castle where she stood on the ramparts like a medieval queen and watched the sun rise on a world that was increasingly ruled by the strutting shouting hatefilled nazis she so loathed during the day she moved every half hour or so from one part of the ruins to another or strolled through the woods or descended to the beach just so that it would not be obvious to tourists that she was waiting to meet someone she suffered a combination of terrible tension and yawnmaking boredom that she found strangely wearying she diverted herself by recalling their last meeting the memory was sweet she was shocked at herself for making love to arne right there on the grass in broad daylight but she did not regret it she would remember that all her life she expected him on the overnight ferry the distance from the harbor at ronne to the castle of hammershus was only about fifteen miles arne could bike it in an hour or walk it in three however he did not show up during the morning this made her anxious but she told herself not to worry the same thing had happened last time he had missed the overnight boat and taken the morning sailing she assumed he would arrive this evening last time she had sat tight and waited for him and he had not shown up until the following morning now she was too impatient for that when she felt sure he could not have come on the overnight ferry she decided to cycle to ronne she felt increasingly nervous as she passed from the lonely country roads into the more populous streets of the little town she told herself this was safershe was more conspicuous in the countryside and could lose herself in the townbut it felt the opposite she saw suspicion in everyones eyes not just policemen and soldiers but shopkeepers in their doorways carters leading horses old men smoking on benches and dockers drinking tea on the quay she walked around the town for a while trying not to meet anyones eye then went into a hotel on the harbor and ate a sandwich when the ferry docked she stood with a small group of people waiting to meet passengers as they disembarked she scrutinized every face expecting arne to be in some kind of disguise it took a few minutes for them all to come ashore when the flow stopped and passengers started boarding for the return journey hermia realized arne was not on the boat she fretted over what to do next there were a hundred possible explanations for his nonappearance ranging from the trivial to the tragic had he lost his nerve and abandoned the mission she felt ashamed of such a suspicion but she had always doubted whether arne was hero material he might be dead of course but it was most likely he had been held up by something stupid like a delayed train unfortunately he had no way of letting her know but she realized she might be able to contact him she had told him to hide out at jens toksvigs house in the nyboder district of copenhagen jens had a phone and hermia knew the number she hesitated if the police were listening in on jenss phone for any reason they could trace the call and then they would know what that something might be going on on bornholm that would be bad but not fatal the alternative was for her to find overnight accommodation and wait to see whether arne came in on the next ferry she did not have the patience for that she returned to the hotel and placed the call as the operator was putting her through she wished she had taken more time to plan what to say should she ask for arne if anyone happened to be listening in that would give away his whereabouts no she would have to speak in riddles as she had when calling from stockholm jens would probably answer the phone he would recognize her voice she thought if not she would say its your friend from bredgade remember me bredgade was the street where the british embassy had been located when she worked there that should be enough of a hint for himthough it might also be enough to alert a detective before she had time to think it through the phone was picked up and a mans voice said hello it certainly was not arne it might have been jens but she had not heard his voice for more than a year she said hello who is that speaking the voice was that of an older man jens was twentynine she said let me speak to jens toksvig please who is calling who the hell was she speaking to jens lived alone maybe his father had come to stay but she was not going to give her real name its hilde hilde who hell know may i have your second name please this was ominous she decided to try to bully him look i dont know who the hell you are but i didnt call to play stupid games so just put jens on the damn phone will you it did not work i must have your surname this was not someone playing games she decided who are you there was a long pause then he replied i am sergeant egill of the copenhagen police is jens in trouble what is your full name please hermia hung up she was shocked and frightened this was as bad as it could be arne had taken refuge in jenss house and now the house was under police guard it could only mean that they had found out that arne was hiding there they must have arrested jens and perhaps arne too hermia fought back tears would she ever see her lover again she walked out of the hotel and looked across the harbor toward copenhagen a hundred miles away in the direction of the setting sun arne was probably in jail there there was no way she was going to meet up with her fisherman and return to sweden emptyhanded she would be letting down digby hoare and winston churchill and thousands of british airmen the ferrys horn sounded the allaboard with a noise like a bereaved giant hermia jumped on her bicycle and cycled furiously to the dock she had a complete set of forged papers including identity card and ration book so she could pass any checkpoint she bought a ticket and hurried on board she had to go to copenhagen she had to find out what had happened to arne she had to get his film if he had taken any pictures when she had done that she would worry about how to escape from denmark and get the film to england the ferry hooted mournfully again and moved slowly away from the dock harald drove along the copenhagen quayside at sundown the dirty water of the harbor was an oily gray in daytime but now it glowed with the reflection of the sunset a red and yellow sky broken up by the wavelets into dabs of color like strokes of a paintbrush he stopped the motorcycle near a line of daimlerbenz trucks partly loaded with timber from a norwegian freighter then he saw two german soldiers guarding the cargo the roll of film in his pocket suddenly felt burning hot against his leg he put his hand in his pocket and told himself not to be panicky no one suspected him of any wrongdoingand the bike would be safe near the soldiers he parked next to the trucks the last time he was here he had been drunk and now he struggled to remember exactly where the jazz club was he walked along the row of warehouses and taverns the grimy buildings were transformed like the dirty water of the harbor by the romantic glow of the setting sun eventually he spotted the sign that read danish institute of folk song and country dancing he went down the steps to the cellar and pushed the door it was open the time was ten oclock early for nightclubs and the place was halfempty no one was playing the beerstained piano on the little stage harald crossed the room to the bar scanning the faces to his disappointment he did not recognize anyone the barman wore a rag tied around his head like a gypsy he nodded warily to harald who did not look like the usual type of customer have you seen betsy today harald asked the barman relaxed apparently reassured that harald was just another young man looking for a prostitute shes around he said harald sat on a stool ill wait trudes over there the barman said helpfully harald glanced in the direction he pointed and saw a blond woman drinking from a lipstickstained glass he shook his head i want betsy these things are very personal said the barman sagely harald suppressed a smile at the obviousness of this remark what could be more personal than sexual intercourse thats very true he said were tavern conversations always stupid a drink while youre waiting for her beer please chaser no thanks the thought of aquavit still made harald feel nauseated he sipped his beer thoughtfully he had spent the day brooding over his plight the presence of police at arnes hideout almost certainly meant that arne had been found out if by some miracle he had evaded arrest the only place he might be hiding was the ruined monastery at kirstenslot so harald had driven there and checked he found the place empty he had sat on the floor of the church for several hours alternately grieving at his brothers fate and trying to figure out what he should do next if he were to finish the job arne had started he had to get the film to london in the next eleven days arne must have had a plan for this but harald did not know what it was and could not think of any way to find out so he had to devise his own he considered simply putting the negatives in an envelope and mailing them to the british legation in stockholm however he felt sure all mail for that address was routinely opened by the censors he did not have the luck to be acquainted with any of the small group of people who traveled legitimately between denmark and sweden he could simply go to the ferry dock in copenhagen or the boat train station at elsinore and ask a passenger to take the envelope but that seemed almost as risky as mailing it he had concluded after a day of racking his brains that he had to go himself he could not do so openly he would not be given a permit to travel now that his brother was known to be a spy he would have to find a clandestine route danish ships went to and from sweden every day there had to be a way to get on board one and slip off unnoticed on the other side he could not get a job on a boatsailors had special identity papers but there was always underworld activity around docks smuggling theft prostitution drugs so he needed to make contact with criminals and find someone willing to smuggle him to sweden when the afternoon began to cool and the tiled floor of the monastery became chilly he had got back on his motorcycle and returned to the jazz club in the hope of seeing the only criminal he had ever met he did not have to wait long for betsy he had drunk only half his beer when she arrived she came down the rear staircase with a man whom harald presumed she had just serviced in a bedroom upstairs the client had pale unhealthy skin and a brutally short haircut and there was a cold sore on his left nostril he was about seventeen harald guessed he was a sailor he walked quickly across the room and out of the door looking furtive betsy came to the bar saw harald and did a double take hello schoolboy she said amiably hello princess she tossed her head coquettishly shaking her dark curls changed your mind want to have a go the thought of having sex with her only minutes after the sailor was vile but he answered with a joke not before were married she laughed what would your mother say he looked at her plump figure that you need feeding up she smiled flatterer youre after something arent you you didnt come back for the watery beer as a matter of fact i need a word with your luther lou she looked disapproving what do you want with him a little problem he may be able to help me with what i probably shouldnt tell you dont be stupid are you in trouble not exactly she looked across at the door and said oh shit following her gaze harald saw luther come in tonight he was wearing a silk sports coat very dirty over an undershirt with him was a man of about thirty who was so drunk he could hardly stand holding the mans arm luther steered him to betsy the man stood peering lustfully at her betsy said to luther how much did you take off him ten lying turd luther handed her a fivecrown note heres your half she shrugged pocketed the money and took the man upstairs harald said would you like a drink lou aquavit his manners had not improved what are you after then youre a man with many contacts along the waterfront dont bother to butter me up son luther interrupted what do you want a little boy with a nice bum cheap cigarettes dope the barman filled a small glass with aquavit luther emptied it at a gulp harald paid and waited until the barman moved away lowering his voice he said i want to go to sweden luther narrowed his eyes why does it matter it might ive got a girlfriend in stockholm we want to get married harald began to improvise i can get a job in her fathers factory he makes leather goods wallets and handbags and so apply to the authorities for a permit to go abroad i did they turned me down why they wouldnt say luther looked thoughtful after a minute he said fair enough can you get me on a ship anythings possible how much money have you got harald recalled betsys mistrust of luther a minute ago none he said but i can get some so can you arrange something for me i know a man i can ask great tonight give me ten crowns what for for going to see this man you think im a free public service like the library i told you i havent got any money luther grinned showing his rotten teeth you paid for that drink with a twenty and got a ten in your change give it to me harald hated to yield to a bully but he seemed to have no choice he handed over the note wait here said luther and he went out harald waited sipping his beer slowly to make it last he wondered where arne was now probably in a cell in the politigaarden being interrogated perhaps peter flemming would do the questioningespionage was his department would arne talk not at first harald felt sure arne would not crumble immediately but would he have the strength to hold out harald had always felt there was a part of arne he did not fully know what if he were tortured how long would it be before he betrayed harald there was a commotion from the back staircase and betsys latest client the drunk fell down the stairs betsy followed him picked him up and walked him through the door and up the outside steps she returned with another client this one a respectable middleaged man in a gray suit that was old but neatly pressed he looked as if he had worked all his life in a bank and never got promoted as they crossed the room betsy said to harald wheres lou gone to see a man for me she stopped and came over to the bar leaving the bank clerk looking embarrassed in the middle of the room dont get involved with lou hes a bastard ive got no choice then take a tip she lowered her voice dont trust him a single inch she wagged her finger like a schoolteacher watch your back for gods sake then she went upstairs with the man in the worn suit at first harald felt annoyed with her for being so sure he could not take care of himself then he told himself not to be stupid she was righthe was out of his depth he had never dealt with people like luther and he had no idea how to protect himself dont trust him betsy had said well he had only given the man ten crowns he could not see how luther could cheat him at this stage though later he might take a larger sum then fail to deliver watch your back be prepared for treachery harald could not think how luther could betray him but were there any precautions he could take it occurred to him that he was trapped in this bar with no back door maybe he should leave and watch the entrance from a distance there might be some safety in unpredictable behavior he swallowed the last of his beer and went out with a wave to the barman he walked along the quay in the twilight to where a big grain ship was tied up with hawsers as thick as his arm he sat on the domed top of a steel capstan and turned to face the club he could see the entrance clearly and he thought he would probably recognize luther would luther spot him here he thought not for he would be hard to see against the dark bulk of the ship that was good it put harald in control when luther returned if all seemed well harald would go back into the bar if he smelled a rat he would vanish he settled down to wait after ten minutes a police car appeared it came along the quayside very fast but with no siren harald stood up his instinct was to run but he realized that would call attention to him and he forced himself to sit down again and keep very still the car pulled up sharply outside the jazz club two men got out one the driver wore a police uniform the other was in a lightcolored suit peering at him in the dim light harald recognized the face and gasped it was peter flemming the two cops went into the club harald was about to hurry away when another figure appeared slouching along the cobblestones with a familiar gait it was luther he stopped a few yards from the police car and leaned against the wall like an idle bystander waiting to see what would happen presumably he had told the police of haralds planned flight to sweden no doubt he hoped to be paid for the tipoff how wise betsy had beenand what a good thing harald had acted on her advice the police came out of the club after a few minutes peter flemming talked to luther harald could hear the voices for they both spoke angrily but he was too far away to make out the words however it seemed that peter was reprimanding luther who kept throwing his hands in the air in a gesture of helpless frustration after a while the two policemen drove away and luther went inside harald walked quickly away shaken by his narrow escape he found his motorcycle and drove off in the last of the twilight he would spend the night in the ruined monastery at kirstenslot then what would he do harald told karen the whole story the following evening they sat on the floor in the disused church while evening darkened outside and the draped shapes and boxes around them turned to ghosts in the twilight she sat with her legs crossed like a schoolgirl and hiked the skirt of her silk evening gown above her knees for comfort harald lit her cigarettes and felt he was becoming intimate with her he told her about getting into the base on sande then pretending to be asleep while the soldier searched his parents house youve got such nerve she exclaimed he was pleased by her admiration and glad she could not see the dampness in his eyes as he told how his father had told a lie to save him he explained heiss deduction that there would be a major air raid at the next full moon and his reasons for thinking the film had to get to london before then when he related how a police sergeant had answered the door of jens toksvigs house she interrupted him i got a warning she said what do you mean a stranger came up to me at the railway station and told me the police knew where arne was this man was a cop himself in the traffic department but he happened to have overheard something and he wanted to let us know because he was sympathetic didnt you warn arne yes i did i knew he was with jens so i looked jens up in the phone book then went to his house i saw arne and told him what had happened it sounded a bit odd to harald what did arne say he told me to leave first and said he was going to get out immediately after mebut obviously he left it too late or your warning was a ruse harald mused what do you mean she said sharply maybe your policeman was lying suppose he wasnt sympathetic at all he might have followed you to jenss place and arrested arne the minute you left thats ridiculouspolicemen dont do things like that harald realized that once again he had run up against karens faith in the integrity and goodwill of those around her either she was credulous or he was unduly cynicalhe was not sure which it reminded him of her fathers belief that the nazis would not harm danish jews he wished he thought they were right what did the man look like tall handsome heavy red hair nice suit a kind of oatmeal tweed yes that settled it hes peter flemming harald did not feel bitter toward karen she had thought she was saving arne she was the victim of a clever ruse peter is more of a spy than a policeman i know his family back on sande i dont believe you she said hotly youve got too much imagination he did not want to argue with her it pierced his heart to know that his brother was in custody arne should never have got involved in deception there was no slyness in his nature harald wondered grievingly if he would ever see his brother again but there were more lives at stake arne wont be able to get this film to england what are you going to do with it i dont know id like to take it myself but i cant figure out how he told her about the jazz club and betsy and luther and perhaps its just as well that i cant get to sweden id probably be jailed for not having the right papers it was part of the swedish governments neutrality agreement with hitlers germany that danes who traveled illegally to sweden would be arrested i dont mind taking a risk but i need a betterthaneven chance of success there must be a wayhow was arne going to do it i dont know he didnt tell me that was silly in retrospect perhaps but he probably thought the fewer people who knew the safer he would be someone must know well poul must have had a means of communication with the britishbut its in the nature of these things that theyre kept secret they were silent for a while harald felt depressed had he risked his life for nothing have you heard any news he asked her he missed his radio finland declared war on the soviet union so did hungary vultures scenting death harald said bitterly its so maddening to be sitting here helpless while the filthy nazis are conquering the world i just wish there was something we could do harald touched the film canister in his trousers pocket this would make a difference if i could get it to london in the next ten days a big difference karen glanced at the hornet moth its a pity that thing wont fly harald looked at the damaged undercarriage and the torn fabric i might be able to repair it but ive only had one lesson i couldnt pilot it karen looked thoughtful no she said slowly but i could arne olufsen proved surprisingly resistant to interrogation peter flemming questioned him on the day of his arrest and again on the following day but he pretended to be innocent and revealed no secrets peter was disappointed he had expected the funloving arne to break as easily as a champagne glass he had no more luck with jens toksvig he considered arresting karen duchwitz but he felt sure she was peripheral to the case besides she was more use to him roaming around freely she had already led him to two spies arne was the prime suspect he had all the connections he knew poul kirke he was familiar with the island of sande he had an english fiancee he had gone to bornholm which was so close to sweden and he had shaken off his police tail the arrest of arne and jens had restored peter in general brauns favor but now braun wanted to know more how the spy ring worked who else was in it what means they used to communicate with england peter had arrested a total of six spies but none of them had talked the case would not be wound up until one of them cracked and revealed all peter had to break arne he planned the third interrogation carefully at four oclock on sunday morning he burst into arnes cell with two uniformed policemen they woke arne by shining a flashlight in his eyes and yelling then pulled him out of bed and marched him along the corridor to the interrogation room peter sat on the only chair behind a cheap table and lit a cigarette arne looked pale and frightened in his prison pajamas his left leg was bandaged and strapped from midthigh to shin but he could stand uprightpeters two bullets had damaged muscles but had not broken any bones peter said your friend poul kirke was a spy i didnt know that arne replied why did you go to bornholm for a little holiday why would an innocent man on holiday evade police surveillance he might dislike being followed around by a lot of nosy flatfoots arne had more spirit than peter had expected despite the early hour and the rude awakening but as it happens i didnt notice them if as you say i evaded surveillance i did it unintentionally perhaps your people are just bad at their job rubbish you deliberately shook off your tail i know i was part of the surveillance team arne shrugged that doesnt surprise me peter you were never very bright as a kid we were at school together remember in fact we were best friends until they sent you off to jansborg where you learned to disrespect the law no we were friends until our families quarreled because of your fathers malice i thought it was over your fathers tax fiddle this was not going the way peter planned it he switched his line whom did you meet on bornholm no one you walked around for days and never spoke to anyone i picked up a girl arne had not mentioned this in previous interrogations peter felt sure it was untrue maybe he could catch arne out what was her name annika surname i didnt ask when you came back to copenhagen you went into hiding hiding i was staying with a friend jens toksviganother spy he didnt tell me that he added sarcastically these spies are a bit secretive peter was dismayed that arne had not been more weakened by his time in the cells he was sticking to his story which was unlikely but not impossible peter began to fear that arne might never talk he told himself this was just a preliminary skirmish he pressed on so you had no idea the police were searching for you no not even when a policeman chased you in the tivoli garden that must have been someone else ive never been chased by a policeman peter let the sarcasm sound in his voice you didnt happen to see any of the one thousand posters of your face that have been put up around the city i must have missed them then why did you change your appearance did i change my appearance you shaved off your moustache someone told me i looked like hitler who the girl i met on bornholm anne you said her name was annika i called her anne for short tilde jespersen came in with a tray the smell of hot toast made peters mouth water he trusted it was having the same effect on arne tilde poured tea she smiled at arne and said would you like some he nodded peter said no tilde shrugged this little exchange was an act tilde was pretending to be nice in the hope that arne would warm to her tilde brought in another chair and sat down to drink her tea peter ate some buttered toast taking his time arne had to stand and watch them when peter had finished eating he resumed the questioning in poul kirkes office i found a sketch of a military installation on the island of sande im shocked arne said if he had not been killed he would have sent those sketches to the british he might have had an innocent explanation for them had he not been shot by a triggerhappy fool did you make those drawings certainly not sande is your home your father is pastor of a church there its your home too your father runs a hotel where offduty nazis get drunk on aquavit peter ignored that when i met you in st pauls gade you ran away why you had a gun if not for that i would have punched your ugly head the way i did behind the post office twelve years ago i knocked you down behind the post office but i got up again arne turned to tilde with a smile peters family and mine have been at loggerheads for years thats the real reason hes arrested me peter ignored that four nights ago there was a security alert at the base something disturbed the guard dogs the sentries saw someone running across the dunes in the direction of your fathers church as peter talked he watched arnes face so far arne did not look surprised was that you running across the dunes no arne was telling the truth peter felt he continued your parents home was searched peter saw a flicker of fear in arnes eyes he had not known about this the guards were looking for a stranger they found a young man asleep in bed but the pastor said it was his son was that you no i havent been home since whitsun once again peter thought he was telling the truth two nights ago your brother harald returned to jansborg skole from which he was expelled because of your malice he was expelled because he disgraced the school by daubing a joke on a wall once again arne turned to tilde the police superintendent had decided to release my brother without chargesbut peter went to his school and insisted they expel him you see how much he hates my family peter said he broke into the chemistry lab and used the darkroom to develop a film arnes eyes widened visibly clearly this was news to him he was rattled at last fortunately he was discovered by another boy i learned of this from the boys father who happens to be a loyal citizen and a believer in law and order a nazi was it your film arne no the head teacher says the film consisted of photographs of naked women and claims he confiscated it and burned it hes lying isnt he i have no idea i believe the photographs were of the military installation on sande do you they were your pictures werent they no peter felt he was at last beginning to intimidate arne and he pressed his advantage next morning a young man called at jens toksvigs house one of our officers answered the doora middleaged sergeant not one of the forces intellectual giants the boy pretended to have come to the wrong address looking for a doctor and our man was gullible enough to believe him but it was a lie the young man was your brother wasnt he im quite sure he was not arne said but he looked frightened harald was bringing you the developed film no that evening a woman in bornholm who called herself hilde telephoned jens toksvigs house didnt you say you had picked up a girl called hilde no anne who is hilde never heard of her perhaps it was a false name could she have been your fiancee hermia mount shes in england there you are mistaken i have been talking to the swedish immigration authorities it had been hard to force them to cooperate but in the end peter had got the information he wanted hermia mount flew in to stockholm ten days ago and has not yet departed arne feigned surprise but the act was unconvincing i know nothing of that he said too mildly i havent heard from her for more than a year if that had been true he would have been astonished and shocked to learn that she had certainly been in sweden and possibly in denmark he was definitely lying now peter continued the same nightthis is the day before yesterdaya young man nicknamed schoolboy went to a waterfront jazz club met with a smalltime criminal called luther gregor and asked for help to escape to sweden arne looked horrified peter said it was harald wasnt it arne said nothing peter sat back arne was badly shaken now but overall he had put up an ingenious defense he had explanations for everything peter threw at him worse he was cleverly turning the personal hostility between them to his advantage claiming that his arrest had been motivated by malice frederik juel might be gullible enough to believe that peter was worried tilde poured tea into a mug and gave it to arne without consulting peter peter said nothing this was all part of the prearranged scenario arne took the mug in a shaky hand and drank thirstily tilde spoke in a kindly voice arne youre in over your head this isnt just about you anymore youve involved your parents your fiancee and your young brother harald is in deep trouble if this goes on hell end up hanged as a spyand it will be your fault arne held the mug in both hands saying nothing looking bewildered and scared peter thought he might be weakening we can make a deal with you tilde went on tell us everything and both you and harald will escape the death penalty you dont have to take my word for thatgeneral braun will be here in a few minutes and he will guarantee that youll live but first you have to tell us where harald is if you dont youll die and so will your brother doubt and fear crossed arnes face there was a long silence at last arne seemed to come to a resolution he reached out and put the mug on the tray he looked at tilde then turned his gaze to peter go to hell he said quietly peter sprang to his feet furious youre the one whos going to hell he shouted he kicked his chair over backward dont you understand whats happening to you tilde got to her feet and left quietly if you dont talk to us youll be turned over to the gestapo peter went on angrily they wont give you tea and ask polite questions theyll pull out your fingernails and light matches under the soles of your feet theyll fasten electrodes to your lips and throw cold water over you to make the shocks more excruciating theyll strip you naked and beat you with hammers theyll smash the bones of your ankles and kneecaps so that you can never walk again and then theyll carry on beating you keeping you alive and conscious and screaming youll beg and plead with them to let you die but they wontnot until you talk and you will talk get that into your head in the end everyone talks whitefaced arne said quietly i know peter was taken aback by the poise and resignation behind the fear what did it mean the door opened and general braun came in it was now six oclock and peter had been expecting him his appearance was part of the scenario braun was the picture of cold efficiency in his crisp uniform with his holstered pistol as always his damaged lungs made his voice a gentle nearwhisper is this the man to be sent to germany arne moved fast despite his injury peter was looking the other way toward braun and he saw only a blur as arne reached for the tea tray the heavy earthenware teapot flew through the air and struck the side of peters head splashing tea over his face when he had dashed the liquid from his eyes he saw arne charge into braun arne moved clumsily on his wounded leg but he knocked the general over peter sprang to his feet but he was too slow in the second for which braun lay still on the floor gasping arne unbuttoned the generals holster and snatched out the pistol he swung the gun toward peter holding it twohanded peter froze the gun was a mm luger it held eight rounds of ammunition in the grip magazinebut was it loaded or did braun wear it just for show arne remained in a sitting position but pushed himself backward until he was up against the wall the door was still open tilde stepped inside saying what stay still arne barked peter asked himself urgently how familiar arne was with weapons he was a military officer but in the air force he might not have had much practice as if to answer the unspoken question arne switched off the safety catch on the left side of the pistol with a deliberate movement that everyone could see behind tilde peter could see the two uniformed policemen who had escorted arne from his cell none of the four policemen was carrying a gun they did not bring weapons into the cell area it was a strict regulation imposed to prevent prisoners from doing exactly what arne had just done but braun did not consider himself subject to the regulations and no one had had the nerve to ask him to hand in his weapon now arne had them all at his mercy peter said you cant get away you know this is the largest police station in denmark youve got the drop on us but there are dozens of armed police outside you cant get past them all i know arne said there was that ominous note of resignation again tilde said and would you want to kill so many innocent danish policemen no i wouldnt it all began to make sense peter remembered arnes words when peter had shot him you stupid pig you should have killed me that fitted with the fatalistic attitude arne had displayed since his arrest he feared he was going to betray his friendsperhaps even his brother suddenly peter knew what was going to happen next arne had figured out that the only way to be completely safe was to be dead but peter wanted arne to be tortured by the gestapo and to reveal his secrets he could not let arne die despite the gun pointed straight at him peter dashed at arne arne did not shoot him instead he jerked back the gun and pressed its nose into the soft skin under his chin peter flung himself on arne the gun barked once peter struck it from arnes hand but he was too late a gush of blood and brain sprayed from the top of arnes head making a fanshaped stain on the pale wall behind him peter fell on arne and some of the mess splashed on peters face he rolled away from arne and scrambled to his feet arnes face was strangely unchanged the damage was all behind and he still had the ironic smile he had worn as he put the gun to his throat after a moment he fell sideways the smashed back of his skull leaving a red smear on the wall his body hit the floor with a lifeless thud he lay still peter wiped his face with his sleeve general braun got to his feet struggling for breath tilde bent down and picked up the pistol they all looked at the body brave man said general braun when harald woke up he knew that something wonderful had happened but for a moment he could not recall what it was he lay on the ledge in the apse of the church with karens blanket around him and pinetop the cat curled up against his chest and waited for his memory to work it seemed to him that the wonderful event was interwoven with something worrying but he was so excited that he did not care about the danger it all came back in a rush karen had agreed to fly him to england in the hornet moth he sat upright suddenly displacing pinetop who leaped to the floor with an indignant yowl the danger was that they might both be caught arrested and killed what made him happy despite that was that he would be spending hours alone with karen not that he thought anything romantic would happen he realized she was out of his league but he could not help how he felt about her even if he was never going to kiss her he was thrilled at the thought of how long they would be together it was not just the journey though that would be the climax before they could take off they would have to spend days working on the aircraft but the whole plan depended on whether he could repair the hornet moth last night with only a flashlight for illumination he had not been able to inspect it thoroughly now with the rising sun shining through the high windows over the apse he could assess the magnitude of the task he washed at the cold tap in the corner pulled on his clothes and began his examination the first thing he noticed was a long piece of stout rope tied to the undercarriage what was that for he thought for a minute then realized it was for moving the aircraft when the engine was off with the wings folded it might be difficult to find a point at which to push the machine but the rope would enable someone to pull it around like a cart just then karen arrived she was casually dressed in shorts and sandals showing off her long strong legs her curly hair was freshly washed and stood out around her head in a coppery cloud harald thought angels must look like that what a tragedy it would be if she died in the adventure that was ahead of them it was too early to talk of dying he told himself he had not even begun to repair the aircraft and in the clear light of morning it looked a more daunting task like harald karen was pessimistic this morning yesterday she had been excited by the prospect of adventure today she took a more gloomy view ive been thinking about mending this thing she said im not sure it can be done especially in ten daysnine now harald felt the onset of the stubborn mood that always came over him when someone told him he could not do something well see he said youve got that look she observed what the look that says you dont want to hear whats being said i havent got a look he said tetchily she laughed your teeth are clenched your mouth is turned down at the corners and youre frowning he was forced to smile and in truth he was pleased that she noticed his expression thats better she said he began to study the hornet moth with an engineers eye when he first saw it he had thought its wings were broken but arne had explained that they were folded back for easy storage harald looked at the hinges by which they were attached to the fuselage i think i could refit the wings he said thats easy our instructor thomas did it every time he put the aircraft away it only takes a few minutes she touched the nearer wing the fabric is in a bad state though the wings and the fuselage were made of wood covered with a fabric that had been treated with some kind of paint on the upper surface harald could see the stitches where the fabric was attached to the ribs with thick thread the paint was cracked and crazed and the fabric was torn in places its only superficial damage harald said does it matter yes the rips in the fabric might interfere with the airflow over the wings so we need to patch them im more worried about the undercarriage the aircraft had been in some kind of accident probably an awkward landing such as arne had described harald knelt down to look more closely at the landing gear the solid steel stub axle appeared to have two prongs that fitted into a vshaped strut the vstrut was made of oval steel tube and both arms of the v had creased and buckled at their weakest point presumably just beyond the ends of the stub axle they looked as if they would easily break a third strut that looked to harald like a shock absorber appeared undamaged nevertheless the undercarriage was clearly too weak for a landing i did that karen said you crashed i landed in a crosswind and swerved sideways the wingtip hit the ground it sounded terrifying were you scared no i just felt such a fool but tom said its not uncommon in a hornet moth in fact he confessed he had done it himself once harald nodded that fitted with what arne had said but there was something in the way she spoke about thomas the instructor that made him feel jealous why was it never repaired we dont have the facilities here she waved at the workbench and the tool rack tom could do minor repairs and he was good with the engine but this isnt a metalwork shop and we have no welding gear then daddy had a minor heart attack hes fine but it meant he would never get a pilots licence and he lost interest in learning to fly so the work never got done that was discouraging harald thought how was he going to do metalwork he walked to the tail and examined the wing that had hit the ground it doesnt seem to be fractured he said i can easily repair the tip you cant tell she said gloomily one of the wooden spars inside might have been overloaded theres no way to be sure just by looking at the outside and if a wing is weakened the plane will crash harald studied the tailplane its rear half was hinged and moved up and down this was the elevator he recalled the upright rudder moved right and left looking more closely he saw that they were controlled by wire cables that emerged from the fuselage but the cables had been cut and removed what happened to the wire he said i remember it being taken to repair some other machine thats going to be a problem only the last ten feet of each cable is missingas far forward as the turnbuckle behind the access panel under the fuselage the rest was too difficult to get at all the same thats forty feet and you cant buy cablesno one can get spare parts for anything no doubt thats why they were cannibalized in the first place harald was beginning to feel overwhelmed by misgivings but he deliberately spoke cheerfully well lets see what else is wrong he moved to the nose he found two catches on the right side of the fuselage turned them and opened the cowling which was made of a thin metal that felt like tin but was probably aluminum he studied the engine its a fourcylinder inline layout karen said yes but it seems to be upsidedown by comparison with a car engine yes the crankshaft is at the top thats to raise the level of the propeller for ground clearance harald was surprised by her expertise he had never met a girl who knew what a crankshaft was what was this tom like he said trying hard to keep the note of suspicion out of his voice he was a great teacher patient but encouraging did you have a love affair with him please i was fourteen i bet you had a crush on him she was miffed i suppose you think thats the only reason a girl would learn about engines harald did think that but he said no no i just noticed that you talked about him in a fond way none of my business the engine is aircooled i see there was no radiator but the cylinders had cooling fins i think all airengines are to save weight he moved to the other side and opened the right cowling all the fuel and oil hoses seemed to be firmly attached and there were no outward signs of damage he unscrewed the oil cap and checked the dipstick there was still a little oil in the tank it looks okay he said lets see if it starts its easier with two people you can sit inside while i swing the propeller wont the battery be flat after all these years theres no battery the electricity comes from two magnetos which are driven by the engine itself lets get into the cabin and ill show you what to do karen opened the door then let out a squeal and fell backinto haralds arms it was the first time he had touched her body and an electric thrill went through him she seemed hardly to notice that they were hugging and he felt guilty for enjoying a fortuitous embrace he hastily set her upright and detached himself are you all right he said what happened mice he opened the door again two mice jumped through the gap and ran down his trousers to the floor karen made a disgusted noise there were holes in the cloth upholstery of one seat and harald guessed they had nested in the stuffing that problem is quickly solved he said he made a kissing sound with his lips and pinetop appeared hoping for food harald picked the cat up and handed him into the cabin pinetop suddenly became energized he darted from one side of the little cockpit to the other and harald thought he saw a mouse tail disappear into a hole under the lefthand seat through which a copper pipe ran pinetop leaped onto the seat then onto the luggage shelf behind without catching a mouse then he investigated the holes in the upholstery there he found a baby mouse and began to eat it with great delicacy on the luggage shelf harald noticed two small books he reached into the cabin and picked them up they were manuals one for the hornet moth and one for the gipsy major engine that powered it he was delighted he showed them to karen but what about the mice she said i hate them pinetop chased them off in the future ill leave the cabin doors open so he can get in and out hell keep them away harald opened the hornet moth manual whats he doing now pinetop oh hes eating the babies look at these diagrams this is great harald she yelled thats disgusting go and stop him he was taken aback whats the matter its revolting its natural i dont care if it is whats the alternative harald said impatiently we have to get rid of the nest i could dig the babies out with my hands and throw them into the bushes but pinetop would still eat them unless the birds got them first its so cruel theyre mice for gods sake how can you not understand cant you see that i hate it i do understand i just think its silly oh youre just a stupid engineer who thinks about how things work and never about how people feel now he was wounded thats not true it is she said and she stomped off harald was astonished what the hell was that all about he said aloud did she really believe he was a stupid engineer who never thought about how people felt it was very unfair he stood on a box to look out of one of the high windows he saw karen marching off up the drive toward the castle she seemed to change her mind and veered off into the woods harald thought of following her then decided not to on the first day of their great collaboration they had had a row what chance was there that they could fly to england he returned to the aircraft he might as well try to start the engine if karen backed out he would find another pilot he told himself the instructions were in the manual chock the wheels and put handbrake hard on he could not find the chocks but he dragged two boxes of junk across the floor and pushed them hard up against the wheels he located the handbrake lever in the lefthand door and checked that it was fully engaged pinetop was sitting on the seat licking his paws wearing a sated look the lady thinks youre disgusting harald told him the cat looked disdainful and hopped out of the cabin turn on petrol control in cabin he opened the door and leaned into the cabin it was small enough for him to reach the controls without climbing in the fuel gauge was partly hidden between the two seat backs next to it was a knob in a slot he moved it from off to on flood carburetor by actuating the lever on either side of the engine pumps flow of petrol through the jet is then caused by operating the tickler of the carburetor the left cowling was still open and he immediately spotted the two fuel pumps each with a small lever sticking out the carburetor tickler was harder to identify but he eventually guessed it was a ring pull with a springback mechanism he pulled the ring and worked one of the levers up and down he had no way of telling whether what he was doing was having any effect for all he knew the tank might be dry he felt dejected now that karen had gone why was he so clumsy with her he was desperately keen to be friendly and charming and do whatever it took to please her but he could not figure out what she wanted why could girls not be more like engines put throttle in shut position or nearly so he hated manuals that could not make up their minds should the throttle be closed or slightly open he found the control a lever in the cabin just forward of the left door thinking back to his flight in a tiger moth two weeks ago he recalled that poul kirke had set the throttle at about half an inch from the off end the hornet moth ought to be similar it had an engraved scale graduated from one to ten where the tiger moth had nothing guessing harald set the throttle at one put switches in on position there was a pair of switches on the dashboard marked simply on and off harald guessed they must operate the twin magnetos he put them on swing airscrew harald stood at the front and grasped one of the blades of the propeller he pulled it down it was very stiff and he had to put all his strength into moving it when finally it turned it gave a sharp click then stopped he turned it again this time it moved more easily it clicked again the third time he gave it a vigorous heave hoping the engine would fire nothing happened he tried again the propeller moved easily and clicked each time but the engine remained silent and still karen came in wont it start she said he looked at her in surprise he had not expected to see her again today he was elated but replied in a matteroffact tone too early to sayive only just begun she seemed contrite im sorry i stormed off this was a new aspect of her he would have guessed she was too proud to apologize thats all right he said it was just the thought of the cat eating the baby mice i couldnt stand it i know its foolish to think about mice when men like poul are losing their lives that was how harald saw it but he did not say so pinetops gone now anyway im not surprised the engine wont start she said reverting to practical problemsjust as he did when embarrassed he thought it hasnt been turned over for at least three years it might be a fuel problem over a couple of winters water must have condensed in the tank but oil floats so the fuel will lie on top we might be able to drain off the water he consulted the manual again we should turn off the switches for safety karen said ill do it harald learned from the manual that there was a panel on the underside of the fuselage that gave access to the fuel drain plug he took a screwdriver from the tool rack then lay on the floor and wriggled under the aircraft to unscrew the panel karen lay beside him and he handed her the screws she smelled good a mixture of warm skin and shampoo when the panel came off karen handed him an adjustable wrench the drain plug was awkwardly placed being slightly to one side of the access hole this was the kind of fault that made harald long to be in charge so that he could force lazy designers to do things properly when his hand was in the gap he could no longer see the drain plug so he had to work blind he turned the plug slowly but when it opened he was startled by the sudden spurt of freezing liquid onto his hand he withdrew his hand quickly banging his numbed fingers on the edge of the access hole and to his intense irritation he dropped the plug with dismay he heard it roll down the fuselage fuel poured from the drain he and karen quickly wriggled out of the way of the gush then there was nothing they could do except watch until the system was empty and the church reeked of petroleum harald cursed captain de havilland and the careless british engineers who had designed the aircraft now weve got no fuel he said bitterly we could syphon some out of the rollsroyce karen suggested thats not airplane fuel the hornet moth runs on car petrol does it i didnt realize that harald perked up again right lets see if we can get that drain plug back he guessed the plug had rolled until it stopped against a cross member he put his arm into the hole but could not reach far enough karen got a wire brush from the workbench and retrieved it with that harald replaced the plug in the drain next they had to take fuel from the car harald found a funnel and a clean bucket while karen used a pair of heavy pliers to cut a length off a garden hose they pulled the cover off the rollsroyce karen undid the fuel cap and fed the hose into the tank harald said shall i do that no she said my turn he guessed she wanted to prove she could do dirty work especially after the mice incident so he stood back and watched karen put the end of the hose between her lips and sucked when the petrol came into her mouth she quickly directed the hose into the bucket while at the same time grimacing and spitting harald watched the grotesque expressions on her face miraculously she was no less beautiful when screwing up her eyes and pursing her lips she caught his gaze and said what are you staring at he laughed and said you of courseyoure so pretty when youre spitting he realized immediately that he had revealed more of his feelings than he wanted to and he waited for a sharp retort but she just laughed he had only said she was pretty of course that was not news to her but he had said it affectionately and girls always noticed tones of voice especially when you did not want them to if she had been annoyed she would have shown it with a disapproving look or an impatient toss of her head but on the contrary she had seemed pleasedalmost he thought as if she were glad he was fond of her he felt he had crossed a bridge the bucket filled up and the hose ran dry they had emptied the tank of the car there was only a gallon or so of petrol in the bucket harald guessed but it was plenty for testing the engine he had no idea where they would get enough fuel to cross the north sea harald carried the bucket over to the hornet moth he flipped open the access cover and pulled the petrol cap it had a hook to fix it to the lip of the filler neck karen held the funnel while harald poured the fuel into the tank i dont know where were going to get any more karen said we certainly cant buy it how much do we need the tank takes thirtyfive gallons but thats another problem the hornet moths range is six hundred milesin ideal conditions and its about that distance to britain so if conditions are less than perfectfor example if we have head winds which is not unlikely well come down in the sea exactly one problem at a time said harald we havent started the engine yet karen knew what to do ill flood the carburetor she said harald turned on the fuel karen worked the priming mechanism until fuel dribbled on the floor then called mags on harald switched on the magnetos and checked that the throttle was still at the justopen position karen grasped the propeller and pulled it down again there was a sharp click hear that she said yes its the impulse starter thats how you know its working by the click she swung the propeller a second time then a third finally she gave it a mighty heave and stepped smartly back the engine gave a shocking bark which echoed around the church then it died harald cheered karen said what are you so pleased about it fired there cant be much wrong it didnt start though it will it will try again she swung the propeller again but with the same result the only change was that karens cheeks became attractively flushed with the effort after a third try harald turned the switches off the fuel is flowing freely now he said it sounds to me as if the problem is with the ignition we need some tools theres a tool kit karen reached into the cabin and lifted a cushion to reveal a large locker under the seat she took out a canvas bag with leather straps harald opened the bag and took out a wrench with a cylindrical head on a swiveling joint designed to operate around corners a universal spark plug spanner he said captain de havilland did something right there were four spark plugs on the right side of the engine harald removed one and examined it there was oil on the points karen took a laceedged handkerchief from the pocket of her shorts and wiped the plug clean she found a feeler gauge in the tool kit and checked the gap then harald replaced the plug they repeated the process with the other three there are four more on the other side karen said although the engine had only four cylinders there were two magnetos each operating its own set of spark plugsa safety measure harald presumed the left side plugs were harder to get at behind two cooling baffles which first had to be removed when all the plugs had been checked harald removed the bakelite caps over the contact breakers and checked the points finally he removed the distributor cap from each magneto in turn and wiped out the inside with karens handkerchief which had now become a filthy rag weve done all the obvious things he said if it doesnt start now weve got serious trouble karen primed the engine again then turned the propeller slowly three times harald opened the cabin door and threw the magneto switches karen gave the propeller a final heave and stepped back the engine turned over barked and hesitated harald standing by the door with his head in the cabin pushed the throttle forward the engine roared to life harald whooped with triumph as the propeller turned but he could hardly hear his own voice over the noise the sound of the engine bounced off the church walls and made a deafening racket he saw pinetops tail disappear though a window karen came up to him her hair blowing wildly in the slipstream from the propeller in his exuberance harald hugged her we did it he yelled she hugged him back to his intense pleasure then said something he shook his head to indicate that he could not hear her she came delightfully close to him and spoke into his ear he felt her lips brush his cheek he could hardly think of anything except how easy it would be to kiss her now we should turn it off before someone hears she shouted harald remembered that this was not a game and that the purpose of repairing the aircraft was to fly a dangerous secret mission he put his head inside the cabin moved the throttle back to the closed position and switched off the magnetos the engine stopped when the noise died away the inside of the church should have been silent but it was not a strange sound came from outside at first harald thought his ears were still registering the din of the engine but gradually he realized it was something else still he could not credit what he heard for it sounded like the tramp of marching feet karen stared at him bewilderment and fear showing on her face they both turned and ran to the windows harald leaped on the box he used for looking out over the high sills he gave his hand to karen who jumped up beside him they looked out together a troop of about thirty soldiers in german uniform were marching up the drive at first he assumed they were coming for him but he quickly saw that they were in no shape for a manhunt most of them appeared to be unarmed they had a heavy wagon drawn by four weary horses loaded with what looked like camping gear they marched past the monastery and continued up the drive what the hell is this he said they mustnt get in here karen said they both looked around the interior of the church the main entrance at the western end consisted of two enormous wooden doors this was the way the hornet moth must have come in with its wings folded back harald had also driven his bike through there it had a huge old lock on the inside with a giant key plus a wooden bar that rested in brackets there was only one other entrance the small side door that led in from the cloisters this was the one harald normally used it had a lock but harald had never seen a key there was no bar we could nail the small door shut then come in and out through the windows like pinetop karen said we have a hammer and nails we need a piece of wood in a room full of junk it should have been easy to find a stout plank but to haralds disappointment there was nothing suitable in the end he prized one of the shelves from the wall above the workbench he placed it diagonally across the door and nailed it firmly to the door frame a couple of men could break it down without much effort he said but at least no one can walk in casually and stumble over our secret they might look through the windows though karen said they would only have to find something to stand on lets conceal the propeller harald grabbed the canvas cover they had removed from the rollsroyce together they draped it over the nose of the hornet moth it reached far enough to cover the cabin they stood back karen said it still looks like an aircraft with its nose covered and its wings folded back to you yes but you already know what it is someone looking in through the window is just going to see a junk room unless he happens to be an airman that wasnt the luftwaffe out there was it i dont know she said id better go and find out hermia had lived more years in denmark than england but suddenly it was a foreign country the familiar streets of copenhagen had a hostile air and she felt she stood out she hurried like a fugitive down streets where she had walked as a child handinhand with her father innocent and carefree it was not just the checkpoints the german uniforms and the graygreen mercedes cars even the danish police made her jumpy she had friends here but she did not contact them she was afraid of bringing more people into danger poul had died jens had presumably been arrested and she did not know what had happened to arne she felt cursed she was exhausted and stiff from her overnight ferry trip and racked with worry about arne excruciatingly aware of the hours ticking by toward the full moon she forced herself to move with the utmost caution the home of jens toksvig in st pauls gade was one of a row all singlestory with front doors that gave immediately onto the pavement number fiftythree appeared empty no one went to the door except the postman on the previous day when hermia telephoned from bornholm it had been occupied by at least one policeman but the guard must have been withdrawn hermia also observed the neighbors on one side was a dilapidated house occupied by a young couple with a childthe kind of people who might be too absorbed in their own life to take an interest in their neighbors but in the freshly painted and neatly curtained house on the other side was an older woman who looked out of the window frequently after watching for three hours hermia went to the neat house and knocked a plump woman of about sixty years came to the door in an apron looking at the little suitcase hermia was carrying she said i never buy anything on the doorstep she smiled in a superior way as if her refusal was a mark of social distinction hermia smiled back ive been told that number fiftythree might be available to rent the neighbors attitude changed oh she said with interest looking for a place to live are you yes the woman was as nosy as hermia had hoped indulging her hermia said im getting married the womans glance went automatically to hermias left hand and hermia showed her the engagement ring very nice well i must say it would be a relief to have a respectable family next door after the goingson goingson she lowered her voice it was a nest of communist spies no really the woman folded her arms over her corseted bosom they were arrested last wednesday the whole pack of them hermia felt a chill of fear but she made herself keep up the pretense of idle gossip goodness how many i couldnt say exactly there was the tenant young mr toksvig who i wouldnt have taken for a wrongdoer though he wasnt always as respectful to his elders as he might have been then lately an airman seemed to be living there a nicelooking boy though he never said much but there were all sorts in and out of the place mostly military types and they were arrested on wednesday on that very pavement where you see mr schmidts spaniel cocking his leg against the lamppost there was a shooting hermia gasped and her hand flew to her mouth oh no the old woman nodded pleased with this reaction to her story not suspecting that she might be speaking of the man hermia loved a plainclothes policeman shot one of the communists she added superfluously with a gun hermia was so afraid of what she might learn that she could hardly speak she forced out three words who was shot i didnt actually see it myself the woman said with infinite regret i happened to be over at my sisters house in fischers gade borrowing a knitting pattern for a cardigan it wasnt mr toksvig himself that i can say for sure because mrs eriksen in the shop saw it and she said it was a man she didnt know was he killed oh no mrs eriksen thought he might have been wounded in the leg anyhow he cried out when the ambulance men lifted him onto the stretcher hermia felt sure it was arne who had been shot she seemed to feel the pain of a bullet wound herself she was breathless and dizzy she needed to get away from this awful old busybody who told the tragic story with such relish i must be going she said what a dreadful thing to happen she turned away anyway i should think the place will be to rent before too long the woman said to her back hermia walked away paying no attention she turned corners at random until she came to a cafe where she sat down to gather her thoughts a hot cup of ersatz tea helped her recover from the shock she had to find out for sure what had happened to arne and where he was now but first she needed somewhere to spend the night she got a room at a cheap hotel near the waterfront it was a sleazy place but her bedroom door had a stout lock at about midnight a slurred voice outside asked if she would like a little drink and she got up to jam the door with a tilted chair she spent most of the night awake wondering if arne had been the man shot in st pauls gade if so how badly was he hurt if not had he been arrested with the others or was he still at large whom could she ask she could contact arnes family but they probably would not know and it would scare them to death to be asked whether he had been shot she knew many of his friends but the ones who were likely to know what had happened were dead or in custody or in hiding in the early hours of the morning it occurred to her that there was one person who was almost certain to know if arne had been arrested his commanding officer at first light she went to the railway station and caught a train to vodal as the train crawled south stopping at every sleepy village she thought of digby by now he would be in back in sweden waiting impatiently on the quay at kalvsby for her to arrive with arne and the film the fisherman would come back alone and tell digby that hermia had not appeared at their rendezvous digby would not know whether she had been captured or merely delayed he would be as distraught about her as she was about arne the flying school had a desolate feel there were no aircraft on the field and none in the sky a few machines were being serviced and in one of the hangars some trainees were being shown the innards of an engine she was directed to the headquarters building she had to give her real name for there were people here who knew her she asked to see the base commander adding tell him im a friend of arne olufsens she knew she was taking a risk she had met squadron leader renthe and remembered him as a tall thin man with a moustache she had no idea what his politics were if he happened to be pronazi she could be in trouble he might phone the police and report an englishwoman asking questions but he was fond of arne as so many people were so she was hoping that for arnes sake he would not betray her anyway she was going to take the chance she had to find out what had happened she was admitted immediately and renthe recognized her my godyoure arnes fiancee he said i thought youd gone back to england he hurried to close the door behind hera good sign she thought for if he wanted privacy that suggested he was not going to alert the police at least not immediately she decided to offer no explanation of why she was in denmark let him draw his own conclusions im trying to find out where arne is she said i fear he may be in trouble its worse than that said renthe youd better sit down hermia remained standing why she cried why sit down whats happened he was arrested last wednesday is that all he was shot and wounded while trying to escape from the police so it was him i beg your pardon a neighbor told me one of them had been shot how is he please do sit down my dear hermia sat down its bad isnt it yes renthe hesitated then in a low voice he said slowly im dreadfully sorry to have to tell you that im afraid arne is dead she cried out in anguish in her heart she had known this might be so but the possibility of losing him had been too dreadful to think about now that it had come she felt as if she had been struck by a train no she said its not true he died in police custody what with an effort she made herself listen he died at police headquarters a terrible possibility entered her mind did they torture him i dont think so it seems that in order to avoid revealing information under torture he took his own life oh god he sacrificed himself to protect his friends id guess renthe looked blurred and hermia realized she was seeing him through tears which were streaming down her face she fumbled for a handkerchief and renthe passed her his own she wiped her face but the tears kept coming renthe said ive only just heard ive got to phone arnes parents and tell them hermia knew them well she found the steely pastor difficult to deal with it seemed he could relate to people only by dominating them and subservience did not come easily to hermia he loved his sons but expressed his love by laying down rules what hermia remembered most vividly about arnes mother was that her hands were always chapped from being in water too much washing clothes and preparing vegetables and scrubbing floors thinking of them drew hermias thoughts away from her own loss and she felt a surge of compassion they would be distraught how dreadful for you to be the bearer of such news she said to renthe indeed their firstborn son that made her think of the other son harald he was fair where arne was dark and they were different in other ways harald was more serious somewhat intellectual with little of arnes easy charm but likeable in his own way arne had said he was going to talk to harald about ways to sneak into the base on sande how much did harald know had he gotten involved her mind was turning to practical matters but she felt hollow the state of shock she was in would permit her to carry on with her life but she felt as if she would never be whole again what else did the police tell you she asked renthe officially they would say only that he had died while giving information and that no other person is thought to have been involved which is their euphemism for suicide but a friend at the politigaarden told me arne did it to avoid being turned over to the gestapo did they find anything in his possession what do you mean such as photographs renthe stiffened my friend didnt say so and its dangerous for you and me to even discuss such a possibility miss mount i was fond of arne and for his sake i would like to do anything i can for you but please remember that as an officer i have sworn loyalty to the king whose orders to me are to cooperate with the occupying power whatever my personal opinions might be i cant countenance espionageand if i thought someone was involved in such activity it would be my duty to report the facts hermia nodded it was a clear warning i appreciate your frankness squadron leader she stood up wiping her face she remembered that the handkerchief was his and said ill launder this and send it back to you dont even think about it he came around his desk and put his hands on her shoulders i really am most dreadfully sorry please accept my deepest sympathy thank you she said and she left as soon as she was out of the building the tears came again renthes handkerchief was a wet rag she would not have thought she had so much fluid in her seeing everything through a watery screen she made her way somehow to the railway station the hollow calm came back as she considered where to go next the mission that had killed poul and arne was not done she still had to get photographs of the radar equipment on sande before the next full moon but now she had an additional motive revenge completion of the task would be the most painful retribution she could inflict upon the men who had driven arne to his death and she found a new asset to help her she no longer cared for her own safety she felt ready to take any risk she would walk down the streets of copenhagen with her head held high and woe betide anyone who tried to stop her but what exactly would she do arnes brother might be the key harald would probably know whether arne had returned to sande before the police got him and he might even know whether arne had had photographs in his possession when he was arrested furthermore she thought she knew where to find harald she took a train back to copenhagen it traveled so slowly that by the time she got to the city it was too late for another journey she went to bed in her flophouse with the door locked against amorous drunks and cried herself to sleep on the following morning she got the first train to the suburban village of jansborg the newspaper she bought at the station had the headline halfway to moscow the nazis had made astonishing leaps in only a week they had taken minsk and were in sight of smolensk two hundred miles inside soviet territory the full moon was eight days away she told the school secretary that she was arne olufsens fiancee and she was shown into heiss office immediately the man who had been responsible for the education of arne and harald made her think of a giraffe in spectacles looking down a long nose at the world below so youre arnes wifetobe he said amiably how very nice to meet you he appeared to have no knowledge of the tragedy without preamble hermia said havent you heard the news news im not sure i have arne is dead oh my goodness me heis sat down heavily i thought you might have heard no when did it happen early yesterday at police headquarters in copenhagen he took his own life to avoid interrogation by the gestapo how very dreadful does this mean that his brother doesnt know yet ive no idea harald is no longer here she was surprised why not im afraid he was expelled i thought he was a star pupil yes but he misbehaved hermia did not have time to discuss schoolboy transgressions where is he now back at his parents home i presume heis frowned why do you ask id like to talk to him heis looked thoughtful about anything in particular hermia hesitated caution dictated that she say nothing to heis about her mission but his last two questions suggested to her that he knew something she said arne may have had something of mine in his possession when he was arrested heis was pretending that his questions were casual but he was gripping the edge of his desk hard enough to turn his knuckles white may i ask what she hesitated again then took a chance some photographs ah that means something to you yes hermia wondered whether heis would trust her for all he knew she could have been a detective posing as arnes fiancee arne died for those photos she said he was trying to get them to me heis nodded and seemed to come to a decision after harald had been expelled he returned to the school at night and broke into the photographic darkroom in the chemistry lab hermia gave a sigh of satisfaction harald had developed the film did you see the pictures yes i have been telling people they were photographs of young ladies in risque poses but thats just a story the pictures were of a military installation hermia was thrilled the photos had been taken the mission had succeeded to that extent but where was the film now had there been time for harald to give it to arne if so the police had it now and arnes sacrifice had been for nothing when did harald do this last thursday arne was arrested on wednesday so harald still has your photographs yes hermias spirits lifted arnes death had not been futile the crucial film was still in circulation somewhere she stood up thank you for your help youre going to sande yes to find harald good luck said heis the german army had a million horses most divisions included a veterinary company dedicated to healing sick and wounded beasts finding fodder and catching runaways one such company had now been billeted on kirstenslot it was the worst possible stroke of luck for harald the officers were living in the castle and about a hundred men were bedded down in the ruined monastery the old cloisters adjacent to the church where harald had his hideout had been turned into a horse hospital the army had been persuaded not to use the church itself karen had pleaded with her father to negotiate this saying she did not want the soldiers to damage the childhood treasures that were stored there mr duchwitz had pointed out to the commanding officer captain kleiss that the junk in the church left little usable room anyway after a glance through a windowharald being absent warned away by karenkleiss had agreed to its remaining locked up as a quid pro quo he had requested three rooms in the castle for offices and the deal had been struck the germans were polite friendlyand curious on top of all the difficulties harald faced repairing the hornet moth he now had to do everything under the noses of the soldiers he was undoing the nuts that held the buckled wishbone axle his plan was to detach the damaged section then sneak past the soldiers and go to farmer nielsens workshop if nielsen would let him he would repair it there meanwhile the intact third leg with the shock absorber would hold the weight of the aircraft while stationary the wheel brake was probably damaged but harald was not going to worry about brakes they were used mainly when taxiing and karen had told him she could manage without them as he worked harald kept glancing up at the windows expecting at any moment to see the face of captain kleiss looking in kleiss had a big nose and a thrusting chin which gave him a belligerent look but no one came and after a few minutes harald had the vshaped strut in his hand he stood on a box to look through a window the eastern end of the church was partly obscured by a chestnut tree that was now in full leaf there seemed to be no one in the immediate vicinity harald pushed the strut through the window and dropped it on the ground outside then jumped after it beyond the tree he could see the wide lawn in front of the castle the soldiers had pitched four large tents and parked their vehicles there jeeps and horse boxes and a fuel tanker a few men were visible passing from one tent to another but it was afternoon and most of the company were away on missions taking horses to and from the railway station negotiating with farmers for hay or treating sick horses in copenhagen and other towns he picked up the strut and walked quickly into the wood as he turned the corner of the church he saw captain kleiss the captain was a big man with an aggressive air and he was standing with his arms crossed and his legs apart talking to a sergeant they both turned and looked straight at harald harald suffered the sudden nausea of fear was he to be caught so early he stopped wanting to turn back then realized that to run away would be incriminating he hesitated then walked forward conscious that his behavior looked guilty and that he was carrying part of the undercarriage of an airplane he had been caught redhanded and all he could do was try to bluff it out he tried to hold the strut in a casual way as he might carry a tennis racket or a book kleiss addressed him in german who are you he swallowed trying to remain calm harald olufsen and whats that youve got this harald could hear his own heartbeat he tried desperately to think of a plausible lie its um he felt himself blush then was saved by inspiration part of the mower assembly from a reaping machine it occurred to him that an uneducated danish farm boy would not speak such good german and he wondered anxiously whether kleiss was subtle enough to spot the anomaly kleiss said whats wrong with the machine er it ran over a boulder and buckled the frame kleiss took the strut from him harald hoped he did not know what he was looking at horses were the mans business and there was no reason why he should be able to recognize part of the undercarriage of an aircraft harald stopped breathing waiting for kleisss verdict at last the man gave him back the strut all right on your way harald walked into the woods when he was out of sight he stopped and leaned against a tree that had been an awful moment he thought he might vomit but managed to suppress the reaction he pulled himself together there might be more such moments he would have to get used to it he walked on the weather was warm but cloudy a summer combination dismally familiar in denmark where no place was far from the sea as he approached the farm he wondered how angry old nielsen was that he had left without warning after working only one day he found nielsen in the farmyard staring truculently at a tractor with steam pouring from its engine nielsen gave him a hostile glare what do you want runaway that was a bad start im sorry i left without explanation harald said i was called home to my parents place quite suddenly and i didnt have time to speak to you before i left nielsen did not ask what the emergency had been i cant afford to pay unreliable workers that made harald hopeful if money was what the mean old farmer was concerned about he could keep it im not asking you to pay me nielsen only grunted at that but he looked a shade less malign what do you want then harald hesitated this was the difficult bit he did not want to tell nielsen too much a favor he said what sort harald showed him the strut id like to use your workshop to repair a part from my motorcycle nielsen looked at him by christ youve got a nerve lad i know that harald thought its really important he pleaded perhaps you could do that instead of paying me for the day i worked perhaps i could nielsen hesitated obviously reluctant to do anything helpful but his parsimony got the better of him all right then harald concealed his elation nielsen added if you fix this damn tractor first harald cursed under his breath he did not want to waste an hour on nielsens tractor when he had such a short time to repair the hornet moth but it was only a boiling radiator all right he said nielsen stomped off to find something else to grumble about the tractor soon ran out of steam and harald was able to look at the engine he immediately saw that a hose had perished where it was clamped to a pipe allowing water to leak out of the cooling system there was no chance of getting a replacement hose of course but fortunately the existing one had some slack in it so he was able to cut off the rotten end and reattach the hose he got a bucket of hot water from the farmhouse kitchen and refilled the radiatorit was damaging to run cold water through an overheated engine finally he started the tractor to make sure the clamp held it did at last he went into the workshop he needed some thin sheet steel to reinforce the fractured part of the axle strut he already knew where to get it there were four metal shelves on the wall he took everything off the top shelf and rearranged the items on the three lower shelves then he lifted the top shelf down using nielsens metal shears he trimmed off the flanged edges of the shelf then cut four strips he would use these as splints he put one strip in a vise and hammered it into a rough curve to fit over the oval tube of the strut he did the same with the other three strips then he welded them in place over the dents in the strut he stood back to look at his work unsightly but effective he said aloud tramping back through the woods to the castle he could hear the sounds of the army camp men calling to one another engines revving horses whinnying it was early evening and the soldiers would have returned from their days duties he wondered whether he would have trouble getting back into the church unnoticed he approached the monastery from the back at the north side of the church a young private was leaning against the wall smoking a cigarette harald nodded to him and the soldier said in danish good day i am leo harald tried to smile im harald nice to meet you would you like a cigarette thank you another time im in a hurry harald walked around to the side of the church he had found a log and rolled it under one of the windows now he stood on it and looked into the church he passed the wishbone strut through the glassless window and dropped it onto the box that stood below the window on the inside it bounced off the box and fell to the floor then he wriggled through a voice said hello his heart stopped then he saw karen she was at the tail partly concealed by the aircraft working on the wing with the damaged tip harald picked up the axle strut and went to show it to her then a voice said in german i thought this place was empty harald spun around the young private leo was looking in through the window harald stared at him aghast cursing his luck its a storeroom he said leo wriggled through the window and dropped to the floor harald shot a glance back to the tail of the aircraft karen had vanished leo looked around seeming curious rather than suspicious the hornet moth was covered from propeller to cabin and the wings were folded back but the fuselage was visible and the tail fin could be made out at the far side of the church how observant was leo luckily the soldier seemed more interested in the rollsroyce nice car he said is it yours unfortunately not said harald the motorcycle is mine he held up the axle strut from the hornet moth this is for my sidecar im trying to fix it up ah leo showed no sign of skepticism id like to help you but i dont know anything about machinery horseflesh is my specialty of course they were about the same age and harald felt sympathy for the lonely young man far from home but he wished all the same that leo would go before he saw too much a shrill whistle sounded suppertime leo said thank god harald thought it was a pleasure talking to you harald i look forward to seeing you again me too leo stood on the box and pulled himself out through the window jesus harald said aloud karen emerged from behind the tail of the hornet moth looking shaken that was a nasty moment he wasnt suspicious he just wanted to talk god preserve us from friendly germans she said with a smile amen he loved it when she smiled it was like the sun coming up he looked at her face as long as he dared then he turned to the wing she had been working on she was repairing the rips he saw he went closer and stood next to her she was dressed in old corduroy trousers that looked as if they had been worn for gardening and a mans shirt with the sleeves rolled im gluing patches of linen over the damaged areas she explained when the glue is dry ill paint over the patches to make them airtight where did you get the material and the glue and the paint from the theater i fluttered my eyelashes at a set builder good for you it was obviously easy for her to get men to do anything she wanted he was jealous of the set builder what do you do at the theater all day anyway he said im understudying the lead in les sylphides will you get to dance it on stage no there are two casts so both the other dancers would have to fall ill shame id love to see you if the impossible happens ill get you a ticket she returned her attention to the wing we have to make sure there are no internal fractures that means we have to examine the wooden spars under the fabric yes well now that weve got the material to repair rips i suppose we could cut an inspection panel in the fabric and just look inside she looked dubious okay he did not think a knife would easily cut the treated linen but he found a sharp chisel on the tool shelf where should we cut near the struts he pressed the chisel into the surface once the initial breach had been made the chisel cut the fabric relatively easily harald made an lshaped incision and folded back a flap making a sizable opening karen pointed a flashlight into the hole then put her face down and peered inside she took her time looking around then withdrew her head and put her arm in she grasped something and shook vigorously i think were in luck she said nothing shifts she stepped back and harald took her place he reached inside grasped a strut and pushed and pulled it the entire wing moved but he felt no weakness karen was pleased were making progress she said if i can finish the work on the fabric tomorrow and you can bolt the axle strut back on the airframe will be complete except for the missing cables and weve still got eight days to go not really harald said we probably need to reach england at least twentyfour hours before the raid for our information to have any effect that brings it down to seven to arrive on the seventh day we need to leave the previous evening and fly overnight so we really have six days at the most then ill have to finish the fabric tonight she looked at her watch id better show up at the house for dinner but ill come back as soon as i can she put away the glue and washed her hands at the sink using soap she had brought from the house for harald he watched her he was always sorry when she left he thought he would like to be with her all day every day he guessed that was the feeling that made people want to get married did he want to marry karen it seemed like a foolish question of course he did he had no doubt he sometimes tried to imagine the two of them after ten years fed up with one another and bored but it was impossible karen would never be boring she dried her hands on a scrap of towel what are you so thoughtful about he felt himself blush wondering what the future holds she gave him a startlingly direct look and for a moment he felt she could read his mind then she looked away a long flight across the north sea she said six hundred miles without landfall so wed better be sure this old kite can make it she went to the window and stood on the box dont lookthis is an undignified maneuver for a lady i wont i swear he said with a laugh she pulled herself up breaking his promise cheerfully he watched her rear as she wriggled through then she dropped out of sight he turned his attention back to the hornet moth it should not take long to reattach the braced axle strut he found the nuts and bolts where he had left them on the workbench he knelt by the wheel fitted the strut in place and began to attach the bolts that held it to the fuselage and the wheel mounting just as he was finishing karen came back in much sooner than expected he smiled pleased at her early return then saw that she looked distraught whats happened he said your mother telephoned harald was angry damn i shouldnt have told her where i was going who did she speak to my father but he told her you definitely werent here and she seems to have believed him thank god he was glad he had decided not to tell mother he was living in the disused church what did she want anyway theres bad news what its about arne harald realized with a guilty start that in the last few days he had hardly given a thought to his brother languishing in jail whats happened arne is hes dead at first harald could not take it in dead he said as if he did not understand the meaning of the word how could that be the police say he took his own life suicide harald had the feeling the world was crumbling around him the walls of the church collapsing and the trees in the park falling over and the castle of kirstenslot blowing away in a strong wind why would he do that to avoid interrogation by the gestapo arnes commanding officer told her to avoid harald saw immediately what that meant he was afraid he wouldnt be able to withstand the torture karen nodded that was the implication if he had talked he would have betrayed me she was silent neither agreeing with him nor contradicting him he killed himself to protect me harald suddenly needed karen to confirm his inference he took her by the shoulders im right am i not he shouted that must be it he did it for me say something for gods sake at last she spoke i think youre right she whispered in an instant haralds anger was transformed into grief it swamped him and he lost control tears flooded his eyes and his body shook with sobs oh god he said and he covered his wet face with his hands oh god this is awful he felt karens arms enfold him gently she drew his head down to her shoulder his tears soaked into her hair and ran down her throat she stroked his neck and kissed his wet face poor arne harald said his voice choked by sorrow poor arne im sorry karen murmured my darling harald im so sorry in the middle of the politigaarden copenhagens police headquarters was a spacious circular courtyard open to the sunshine it was ringed by an arcade with classical double pillars in a perfect repeating pattern to peter flemming the design stood for the way order and regularity permitted the light of truth to shine in on human wickedness he often wondered whether the architect had intended that or had just thought a courtyard might look nice he and tilde jespersen stood in the arcade leaning against a pair of pillars smoking cigarettes tilde wore a sleeveless blouse that showed the smooth skin of her arms she had fine blond hair on her forearms the gestapo have finished with jens toksvig he told her and nothing he felt exasperated and he shook his shoulders as if to shrug off the feeling of frustration he has told everything he knows of course he is one of the nightwatchmen he passed information to poul kirke and he agreed to shelter arne olufsen when arne was on the run he also said that this whole project had been organized by arnes fiancee hermia mount who is with mi back in england interestingbut it doesnt get us anywhere exactly unfortunately for us jens doesnt know who sneaked into the base on sande and he has no knowledge of the film harald developed tilde drew in smoke peter watched her mouth she seemed to be kissing the cigarette she inhaled then blew smoke out through her nostrils arne killed himself to protect someone she said i assume that person has the film his brother harald either has it or has passed it to someone else either way we have to talk to him where is he at the parsonage on sande i assume its the only home hes got he looked at his watch im catching a train in an hour why not phone i dont want to give him the chance to run away tilde looked troubled what will you say to the parents dont you think they might blame you for what happened to arne they dont know i was there when arne shot himself they dont even know i arrested him i suppose not she said dubiously anyway i dont give a shit what they think peter said impatiently general braun hit the roof when i told him that the spies may have photographs of the base on sande god knows what the germans have there but its deadly secret and he blames me if that film leaves denmark i dont know what hell do to me but youre the one who uncovered the spy ring and i almost wish i hadnt he dropped his cigarette end and stamped on it grinding it with the sole of his shoe id like you to come to sande with me her clear blue eyes gave him an appraising look of course if you want my help and id like you to meet my parents where would i stay i know a small hotel in morlunde quiet and clean that i think would suit you his father owned a hotel of course but that was too close to home if tilde stayed there the entire population of sande would know what she was doing every minute of the day peter and tilde had not spoken about what had happened in his apartment even though it was six days ago he was not sure what to say he had felt driven to do it to have sex with tilde in front of inge and tilde had gone along with it sharing his passion and seeming to understand his need afterward she had seemed troubled and he had driven her home and left her with a goodnight kiss they had not repeated it once was enough to prove whatever he had to prove he had gone to tildes apartment the following evening but her son had been awake asking for drinks of water and complaining of bad dreams and peter had left early now he saw the trip to sande as a chance to get her alone but she seemed to hesitate she asked another practical question what about inge ill get the nursing agency to provide twentyfourhour cover as i did when we went to bornholm i see she looked across the courtyard considering and he studied her profile the small nose the bowshaped mouth the determined chin he remembered the overwhelming thrill of possessing her surely she could not have forgotten that he said dont you want to spend a night together she turned to him with a smile of course i do she said id better go and pack a case on the following morning peter woke up in the oesterport hotel in morlunde the oesterport was a respectable establishment but its owner erland berten was not married to the woman who called herself mrs berten erland had a wife in copenhagen who would not give him a divorce no one in morlunde knew this except peter flemming who had discovered it by chance while investigating the murder of one jacob berten who was no relation peter had let erland know he had found out about the real mrs berten but had otherwise kept the news to himself knowing that the secret gave him power over erland now he could rely on erlands discretion whatever happened between peter and tilde in the oesterport hotel erland would tell no one however peter and tilde had not slept together in the end their train had been delayed and had finally arrived in the middle of the night long after the last ferry to sande weary and badtempered after the frustrating journey they had checked in to separate single rooms and grabbed a couple of hours sleep now they were going to catch the first ferry of the morning he dressed quickly then went and tapped on tildes door she was putting on a straw hat looking in the mirror over the fireplace as she adjusted it he kissed her cheek not wanting to spoil her makeup they walked down to the harbor a local policeman and a german soldier asked them for their identity cards as they boarded the ferry the checkpoint was new peter guessed it was an additional security precaution brought in by the germans because of the spies interest in sande but it could be useful to peter too he showed his police badge and asked them to write down the names of everyone visiting the island over the next few days it would be interesting to see who came to arnes funeral on the other side of the channel the hotels horsedrawn taxi was waiting for them peter told the driver to take them to the parsonage the sun was edging up over the horizon gleaming off the little windows of the low houses there had been rain overnight and the coarse grass of the sand dunes glistened with droplets a light breeze ruffled the surface of the sea the island seemed to have put on its best clothes for tildes visit what a pretty place she said he was glad she liked it he pointed out the sights as they drove the hotel his fathers housethe largest on the islandand the military base that was the target of the spy ring approaching the parsonage peter noticed that the door to the little church stood open and he heard a piano that might be harald he said he heard the excitement in his own voice could it be this easy he coughed and made his voice deeper and calmer lets see shall we they dismounted from the buggy the driver said what time shall i come back mr flemming wait here please peter said ive got other customers just wait the driver muttered something under his breath peter said if youre not here when i come out youre fired the driver looked sulky but he stayed put peter and tilde entered the church at the far end of the room a tall figure was seated at the piano he had his back to the door but peter knew the broad shoulders and domed head it was bruno olufsen haralds father peter winced with disappointment he was hungry for this arrest he must be careful not to let his need take control the pastor was playing a slow hymn tune in a minor key peter glanced at tilde and saw that she looked sorrowful dont be fooled he murmured the old tyrant is as hard as gunmetal the verse ended and olufsen began another peter was not willing to wait pastor he said loudly the pastor did not stop playing immediately but finished the line and let the music hang in the air for a moment finally he turned around young peter he said in a flat voice peter was momentarily shocked to see that the pastor seemed to have aged his face was lined with weariness and his blue eyes had lost their icy glitter after an instant of surprise peter said im looking for harald i didnt imagine this was a condolence call the pastor said coldly is he here is this an official inquiry why do you ask is harald involved in some wrongdoing certainly not im glad to hear it is he in the house no hes not on the island i dont know where he went peter looked at tilde this was a letdownbut on the other hand it suggested that harald was guilty why else would he disappear where do you think he might be go away arrogant as everbut this time the pastor was not going to get away with it peter thought with relish your elder son killed himself because he was caught spying he said harshly the pastor flinched as if peter had struck him peter heard tilde gasp beside him and realized he had shocked her by his cruelty but he pressed on your younger son may be guilty of similar crimes youre in no position to act high and mighty with the police the pastors normally proud face looked hurt and vulnerable ive told you that i dont know where harald is he said dully do you have any other questions what are you hiding the pastor sighed youre one of my flock and if you come to me for spiritual help i wont turn you away but i will not speak to you for any other reason youre arrogant and cruel and as near worthless as one of gods creatures can be get out of my sight you cant throw people out of the churchit doesnt belong to you if you want to pray youre welcome here otherwise go away peter hesitated he did not want to submit to being thrown out but he knew he had been defeated after a moment he took tildes arm and led her outside i told you he was hard he said tilde seemed shaken i think the man is in pain no doubt but was he telling the truth obviously harald has gone into hidingwhich means almost certainly that he has the film so we have to find him peter reflected on the conversation i wonder if his father really doesnt know where he is have you ever known the pastor to lie nobut he might make an exception to protect his son tilde made a dismissive gesture were not going to get anything out of him either way i agree but were on the right track thats the main thing lets try the mother she at least is made of flesh and blood they went to the house peter steered tilde to the back he tapped on the kitchen door and went in without waiting for an answer as was usual on the island lisbeth olufsen was sitting at the kitchen table doing nothing peter had never in his life seen her idle she was always cooking or cleaning even in church she was busy straightening rows of chairs putting out hymn books or gathering them up stoking the peat boiler that warmed the big room in winter now she sat looking at her hands the skin was cracked and raw in places like a fishermans mrs olufsen she turned her face to him her eyes were red and her cheeks were drawn after a moment she recognized him hello peter she said expressionlessly he decided to take a softer approach with her im sorry about arne she nodded vaguely this is my friend tilde we work together pleased to meet you he sat at the table and nodded to tilde to do the same perhaps a simple practical question would bring mrs olufsen out of her daze when is the funeral she thought for a moment then answered tomorrow that was better ive spoken to the pastor peter said we saw him in the church his heart is broken he doesnt show it to the world though i understand harald must be dreadfully upset too she glanced at him and looked quickly down at her hands again it was the briefest of looks but peter read fear and deceit in it she muttered we havent spoken to harald why is that we dont know where he is peter could not tell whether she was lying from moment to moment but he felt sure of her intention to deceive it angered him that the pastor and his wife who pretended to be morally superior to others should deliberately hide the truth from the police he raised his voice youd be well advised to cooperate with us tilde put a restraining hand on his arm and looked an inquiry at him he nodded for her to go ahead she said mrs olufsen im sorry to have to tell you that harald may have been involved in the same illegal activities as arne mrs olufsen looked frightened tilde continued the longer he goes on the worse trouble hell be in when finally we catch up with him the old woman shook her head from side to side looking distressed but she said nothing if you would help us find him youd be doing the best thing for him i dont know where he is she repeated but less firmly peter sensed weakness he stood up and leaned across the kitchen table pushing his face into hers i saw arne die he said gratingly mrs olufsens eyes widened in horror i saw your son put the gun to his own throat and pull the trigger he went on tilde said peter no he ignored her i saw his blood and brains spatter the wall behind him mrs olufsen cried out with shock and grief she was about to crack peter saw with satisfaction he pressed his advantage your elder son was a spy and a criminal and he met a violent end they that live by the sword shall die by the sword thats what the bible says do you want the same to happen to your other son no she whispered no then tell me where he is the kitchen door burst open and the pastor strode in you filth he said peter straightened up startled but defiant im entitled to question get out of my house tilde said lets go peter i still want to know now the pastor roared leave now he advanced around the table peter backed away he knew he should not allow himself to be shouted down he was on legitimate police business and he had a right to ask questions but the towering presence of the pastor scared him despite the gun under his jacket and he found himself reversing steadily to the door tilde opened it and went out i havent finished with you two peter said feebly as he backed through the doorway the pastor slammed the door in his face peter turned away damned hypocrites he said the pair of them the buggy was waiting to my fathers house peter said and they got in as they drove away he tried to put the humiliating scene out of his mind and concentrate on his next steps harald must be living somewhere he said obviously tildes tone was curt and he guessed she was distressed by what she had just witnessed hes not at school and hes not at home and he has no relations except for some cousins in hamburg we could circulate a picture of him well have trouble finding one the pastor doesnt believe in photostheyre a sign of vanity you didnt see any pictures in that kitchen did you what about a school photo not a jansborg tradition the only picture of arne we could find was the one in his army record i doubt theres a photo of harald anywhere so whats our next move i think hes staying with friendsdont you makes sense she would not look at him he sighed she was in a bad mood with him so be it this is what you do he said in a tone of command call the politigaarden send conrad to jansborg skole get a list of the home addresses of all the boys in haralds class then have someone call at each house ask a few questions snoop around a bit they must be all over denmark it would take a month to visit them all how much time do we have very little i dont know how long it will take for harald to figure out a way to get the film to london but hes a cunning young villain use local police where necessary very well if hes not staying with friends he must be hiding out with another member of the spy ring were going to stay for the funeral and see who shows up well check out every mourner one of them must know where harald is the buggy slowed as it approached the entrance to axel flemmings house tilde said do you mind if i go back to the hotel his parents were expecting them for lunch but peter could see that tilde was not in the mood all right he tapped the driver on the shoulder go to the ferry dock they drove in silence for a while as they approached the dock peter said what will you do at the hotel in fact i think i should return to copenhagen that made him angry as the horse stopped at the quayside he said what the hell is wrong with you i didnt like what just happened we had to do it im not sure it was our duty to try to make those people tell what they knew duty isnt everything she had said that during their argument about jews he recalled thats just playing with words duty is what you have to do you cant make exceptions thats whats wrong with the world the ferry was in dock tilde got down from the buggy its just life peter thats all its why we have crime wouldnt you rather live in a world where everyone did their duty just imagine it wellbehaved people in smart uniforms getting things done with no slacking no lateness no halfmeasures if all crimes were punished and no excuses accepted there would be a lot less for the police to do is that really what you want yesand if i ever get to be chief of police and the nazis are still running things thats what it will be like whats wrong with that she nodded but did not answer his question goodbye peter she said as she walked away he shouted after her well whats wrong with it but she boarded the ferry without turning around part four harald knew the police were looking for him his mother had phoned kirstenslot again ostensibly to tell karen the date and time of arnes funeral during the conversation she had said she had been questioned by the police about haralds whereabouts but i dont know where he is so i couldnt tell them she had said it was a warning and harald admired his mother for having the courage to send it and the shrewdness to figure out that karen could probably deliver it despite the warning he had to go to the flying school karen purloined some of her fathers old clothes so that harald would not have to wear his distinctive school blazer he put on a marvelously lightweight sports jacket from america and a linen cap and wore sunglasses he looked more like a millionaire playboy than a fugitive spy as he got on the train at kirstenslot nevertheless he was nervous he felt trapped in the railway carriage if a policeman accosted him he could not run away in copenhagen he walked the short distance from the vesterport suburban station to the main line station without seeing a single police uniform a few minutes later he was on another train to vodal on the way he thought about his brother everyone had thought arne unsuited to resistance work too playful too careless perhaps not brave enough and in the end he had turned out to be the greatest hero of all the thought brought tears to haralds eyes behind the sunglasses squadron leader renthe commanding officer of the flying school reminded him of his old headmaster heis both men were tall and thin and longnosed because of the resemblance harald found it difficult to lie to renthe ive come to er pick up my brothers effects he said personal stuff if thats all right renthe did not appear to notice his embarrassment of course he said one of arnes colleagues hendrik janz has packed everything up theres just a suitcase and a duffel bag thanks harald did not want arnes effects but he had needed an excuse to come here what he was really after was about fifty feet of steel cable to replace the missing control cables of the hornet moth and this was the only place he could think of where he might get it now that he was here the task seemed more daunting than it had from a distance he felt a wave of mild panic without the cable the hornet moth could not fly then he thought again of the sacrifice his brother had made and told himself to stay calm if he kept a cool head he might find a way i was going to send the bags to your parents renthe added ill do it harald wondered whether he could confide in renthe i only hesitated because i thought perhaps they should go to his fiancee hermia harald said surprised in england is she in england she was here three days ago harald was astonished what was she doing here i assumed she had taken danish citizenship and was living here otherwise her presence in denmark would have been illegal and i would have been obliged to report her visit to the police but obviously she would not have come here if that had been the case she would know wouldnt she that as an army officer im obliged to report anything illegal to the police he looked hard at harald and added do you see what i mean i think i do harald realized he was being given a message renthe suspected that he and hermia were involved in espionage with arne and he was warning harald not to say anything about it to him he obviously sympathized but was not willing to break any rules he stood up youve made things very clearthank you ill get someone to show you to arnes quarters no needi can find my way he had seen arnes room two weeks ago when he was here for a flight in a tiger moth renthe shook his hand my deepest condolences thank you harald left the headquarters building and walked along the single road that connected all the low buildings that made up the base he moved slowly taking a good look inside the hangars there was not much activity what was there to do at an air base where the aircraft could not fly he felt frustrated the cable he needed must be here somewhere all he had to do was find out where and get hold of it but it was not that simple in one hangar he saw a tiger moth completely dismantled the wings were detached the fuselage stood on trestles the engine on a stand his hopes rose he walked in through the giant doorway a mechanic in overalls was sitting on an oil can drinking tea from a big mug amazing harald said to him ive never seen one taken to pieces like that has to be done the man replied parts wear out and you cant have them failing in midair on aircraft everything has to be perfect otherwise you fall out of the sky harald found that a sobering thought he was planning to cross the north sea in an aircraft that had not been looked at by a mechanic for years so you replace everything everything that moves yes harald thought optimistically that this man might be able to give him what he wanted you must get through a lot of spares thats right theres what a hundred feet of control cables in each aircraft a tiger moth requires one hundred and fiftynine feet of tenhundredweight cable and thats what i need harald thought with mounting excitement but once again he hesitated to ask for fear of giving himself away to someone unsympathetic he looked around he had vaguely imagined that airplane parts would be lying around for anyone to pick up so where do you keep it all stores of course this is the army everything in its place harald grunted with exasperation if only he could have seen a length of cable and picked it up casually but it was pointless to wish for easy solutions wheres the store next building along the mechanic frowned why all the questions idle curiosity harald guessed he had pushed this man far enough he should move on before arousing serious suspicion he gave a sketchy wave and turned away nice talking to you he walked to the next building and stepped inside a sergeant sat behind a counter smoking and reading a newspaper harald saw a photograph of russian soldiers surrendering and the headline stalin takes control of soviet defense ministry harald studied the rows of steel shelves that stretched out on the other side of the counter he felt like a child in a sweet shop here was everything he could want from washers to entire engines he could build a whole aircraft out of these parts and one entire section was given over to miles of cable of different kinds all neatly wound on wooden cylinders like cotton reels harald was delighted he had learned exactly where the cable was now he had to figure out how to get his hands on it after a moment the sergeant looked up from the newspaper yes could the man be bribed yet again harald hesitated he had a pocketful of money given to him for this purpose by karen but he did not know how to phrase an offer even a corrupt warehouseman might be offended by a crass proposal he wished he had thought more about his approach but he had to do it can i ask you something he said all these spare partsis there any way that someone a civilian i mean could buy or no the sergeant said abruptly even if the price was you know not a major consideration absolutely not harald did not know what else to say if ive given offense forget it at least the man had not called the police harald turned away the door was solid wood with three locks he noted as he left it would not be easy to break into this warehouse perhaps he was not the first civilian to realize that scarce components might be found in military stores feeling defeated he made his way to the officers quarters and found arnes room as renthe had promised there were two bags neatly lined up at the foot of the bed the room was otherwise bare it struck harald as pathetic that his brothers life could be packed into two bags and that his room should then bear no trace of his existence the thought brought tears to his eyes again but the important thing was what a man left behind in the minds of others he told himself arne would always live in haralds memoryteaching him to whistle making their mother laugh like a schoolgirl combing his glossy hair in a mirror he thought of the last time he had seen his brother sitting on the tiled floor of the disused church in kirstenslot weary and scared but determined to fulfill his mission and once again he saw that the way to honor arnes memory was to finish the job he had started a corporal looked in at the door and said are you related to arne olufsen his brother my name is harald benedikt vessell call me ben he was a man in his thirties with a friendly grin that showed tobaccostained teeth i was hoping to run into someone from the family he fished in his pocket and pulled out money i owe arne forty crowns what for the corporal looked sly well dont say a word i run a little book on the horse races and arne picked a winner harald took the money not knowing what else to do thank you is that all right then harald did not really understand the question of course good ben looked furtive it crossed haralds mind that the sum owed might have been more than forty crowns but he was not going to argue ill give it to my mother he said deepest sympathy son he was a good sort your brother the corporal obviously was not a rule keeper he seemed the type who would murmur dont say a word quite frequently his age suggested he was a career soldier but his rank was lowly perhaps he put his energies into illegal activities he probably sold pornographic books and stolen cigarettes maybe he could solve haralds problem ben he said can i ask you something anything at all ben took a tobacco pouch from his pocket and began to handroll a cigarette if a man wanted for private purposes to get hold of fifty feet of control cable for a tiger moth do you know of any way it could be done ben looked at him through narrowed eyes no he said say the person had a couple of hundred crowns to pay for it ben lit his cigarette this is to do with what arne was arrested for isnt it yes ben shook his head no lad it cant be done sorry never mind harald said lightly though he was bitterly disappointed where can i find hendrik janz two doors along if hes not in his room try the canteen harald found hendrik seated at a small desk studying a book on meteorology pilots had to understand the weather to know when it was safe to fly and if there was a storm coming im harald olufsen hendrik shook his hand damn shame about arne thank you for packing up his stuff glad to be able to do something did hendrik approve of what arne had done harald needed some indication before sticking his neck out he said arne did what he thought was right for his country hendrik immediately looked wary i know nothing of that he said to me he was a reliable colleague and a good friend harald was dismayed hendrik obviously was not going to help him steal the cable what was he going to do thanks again he said goodbye he returned to arnes room and picked up the bags he was at a loss to know what else to do he could not leave without the cable he neededbut how could he take it he had tried everything maybe there was another place he could get cable but he could not think where and he was running out of time the full moon was six days away that meant he had only four days left to work on the aircraft he left the building and headed for the gate carrying the bags he was going to return to kirstenslotbut for what purpose without the cable the hornet moth would not fly he wondered how he was going to tell karen he had failed as he passed the stores building he heard his name called harald a truck was parked to one side of the warehouse and ben stood halfconcealed by the vehicle beckoning harald hurried over here said ben and he held out a thick coil of steel cable fifty feet and a bit extra harald was thrilled thank you take it for gods sake its heavy harald took the cable and turned away no no ben said you cant walk through the gate with that in your hand for christs sake put it in one of the bags harald opened arnes suitcase it was full ben said give me that uniform quick harald took out arnes uniform and replaced it with the coil ben picked up the uniform ill get rid of this dont worry now clear off harald shut the case and reached into his pocket i promised you two hundred crowns keep the money ben said and good luck to you son thanks now get lost i never want to see you again right said harald and he walked rapidly away next morning harald stood outside the castle in the gray gleam of dawn it was half past three in his hand he held a fourgallon oil can empty and clean the tank of the hornet moth would take thirtyfive gallons of petrol just under nine canfuls there was no legitimate way to get fuel so harald was going to steal it from the germans he had everything else he needed the hornet moth required only a few more hours of work and it would be ready to take off but its fuel tank was empty the kitchen door opened quietly and karen stepped out she was accompanied by thor the old red setter that made harald smile because it looked so much like mr duchwitz karen paused on the doorstep staring around warily like a cat when there are strangers in the house she wore a chunky green sweater that concealed her figure and the old brown corduroys that harald called her gardening trousers but she looked wonderful she called me darling he said to himself hugging the memory she called me darling she smiled brilliantly dazzling him good morning her voice seemed dangerously loud he put a finger on his lips for quiet it would be safer to remain completely silent there was nothing to discuss they had made their plan last night sitting on the floor in the disused church eating chocolate cake from the kirstenslot pantry harald led the way into the woods undercover they walked half the length of the park when they drew level with the soldiers tents they peeked cautiously from the bushes as expected they saw a single man on guard duty standing outside the mess tent yawning at this hour everyone else was asleep harald was relieved to have his expectations fulfilled the veterinary companys fuel supply came from a small petrol tanker that was parked a hundred yards from the tentsno doubt as a safety precaution the separation would be helpful to harald though he wished it were greater the tanker had a hand pump he had already observed and there was no locking mechanism the truck was parked alongside the drive that led to the castle door so that vehicles could approach it on a hard surface the hose was on the drive side for convenience in consequence the bulk of the truck shielded anyone using it from view by the encampment everything was as expected but harald hesitated it seemed madness to steal petrol from under the noses of the soldiers but it was dangerous to think too much fear could paralyze action was the antidote without further reflection he broke cover leaving karen and the dog behind and walked quickly across the damp grass to the tanker he took the nozzle from its hook and fed it into his can then reached for the pump lever as he pulled it down there was a gurgling sound from inside the tank and the noise of petrol sloshing into the can it seemed very loud but perhaps not loud enough to be heard by the sentry a hundred yards away he glanced anxiously back at karen as agreed she was watching from the screen of vegetation ready to alert harald if anyone approached the can filled quickly he screwed on the cap and picked it up it was heavy he returned the nozzle tidily to its hook then hurried back to the trees once of out sight he paused grinning triumphantly at karen he had stolen four gallons of petrol and got away with it the plan was working leaving her there he cut through the woods to the monastery he had already opened the big church door so that he could slip in and out it would have been too awkward and timeconsuming to pass the heavy can through the high window he stepped inside with relief he put down the can he popped open the access panel and undid the petrol cap of the hornet moth he fumbled awkwardly because his fingers were numb from carrying the heavy can but he got the cap open he emptied the can into the aircrafts tank replaced both caps to minimize the smell of fuel and went out while he was filling the can for the second time the sentry decided to make a patrol harald could not see the man but knew something was wrong when karen whistled he looked up to see her emerging from the wood with thor at her heel he let go of the hand pump and dropped to his knees to look under the tanker and across the lawn he saw the soldiers boots approaching they had foreseen this problem and prepared for it still on his knees harald watched karen stroll across the grass she met up with the sentry while he was still fifty yards away from the tanker the dog amiably sniffed the mans crotch karen took out cigarettes would the sentry be friendly and smoke with a pretty girl or would he be a stickler for routine and ask her to walk her dog somewhere else while he continued his patrol harald held his breath the sentry took a cigarette and they lit up the soldier was a small man with a bad complexion harald could not hear their words but he knew what karen was saying she could not sleep she felt lonely she wanted someone to talk to dont you think he might be suspicious karen had said while discussing this plan last night harald had assured her that the victim would enjoy being flirted with far too much to question her motives harald had not been as certain as he pretended but to his relief the sentry was fulfilling his prediction he saw karen point to a tree stump a little way off and then lead the soldier to it she sat down placing herself so that the sentry had to have his back to the tanker if he wanted to sit next to her now harald knew she would be saying that the local boys were so dull she liked to talk to men who had traveled a little and seen the world they seemed more mature she patted the surface beside her to encourage him sure enough he sat down harald resumed pumping he filled the can and hurried into the woods eight gallons when he returned karen and the sentry were in the same positions while he refilled the can he calculated how long he needed filling the can took about a minute the walk to the church about two pouring the petrol into the hornet moth another minute the return journey another two six minutes for the round trip then making fiftyfour minutes for nine canfuls assuming he would tire toward the end call it an hour could the sentry be kept chatting that long the man had nothing else to do the soldiers rose at fivethirty still more than an hour away and began their duties at six assuming the british did not invade denmark in the next hour the sentry had no reason to stop talking to a pretty girl but he was a soldier under military discipline and he might feel it his duty to patrol all harald could do was hope for the best and hurry he took the third canful to the church twelve gallons already he thought optimistically more than two hundred milesa third of the way to england he continued his shuttle according to the manual he had found in the cockpit the dhb hornet moth should fly miles on a full tank that figure assumed no wind the distance to the english coast as best he could reckon it from the atlas was about miles the margin of safety was nowhere near enough a head wind would reduce their mileage and bring them down in the sea he would take a full can of petrol in the cabin he decided that would add seventy miles to the hornet moths range assuming he could figure out a way to top up the tank in flight he pumped with his right hand and toted with his left and both arms were aching by the time he emptied the fourth canful into the aircraft returning for the fifth he saw that the sentry was standing up as if preparing to move off but karen still had him talking she laughed at something the man said and slapped his shoulder playfully it was a coquettish gesture that was most uncharacteristic of her but all the same harald felt a pang of jealousy she never slapped his shoulder playfully but she had called him darling he carried the fifth and sixth canfuls and felt he was twothirds of the way to the english coast whenever he felt scared he thought of his brother it was difficult he found to accept that arne was dead he kept thinking about whether his brother would approve of what he was doing what he would say when harald told him about some aspect of his plans how he would be amused or skeptical or impressed in that way arne was still part of haralds life harald did not believe in the obstinately irrational fundamentalism of his father talk of heaven and hell seemed mere superstition to him but now he saw that in a way dead people lived on in the minds of those who had loved them and that was a kind of afterlife any time his resolution weakened he recalled that arne had given everything for this mission and felt an impulse of loyalty that gave him strengtheven though the brother to whom he owed that loyalty was no more returning to the church with the seventh canful he was seen as he approached the church door a soldier in underwear emerged from the cloisters harald froze the can of petrol in his hand as incriminating as a hot gun the soldier halfasleep walked to a bush and begin to urinate and yawn at the same time harald saw that it was leo the young private who had been so intrusively friendly three days ago leo caught his eye was startled to find himself observed and looked guilty sorry he mumbled harald guessed it was against the rules to pee in the bushes they had dug a latrine behind the monastery but it was a long walk and leo was being lazy harald tried to smile reassuringly dont worry he said in german but he could hear the tremor of fear in his own voice leo did not seem to notice it readjusting his clothing he frowned whats in the can water for my motorcycle oh leo yawned then he jerked a thumb at the bush were not supposed to forget it leo nodded and stumbled away harald stepped into the church he paused a moment closing his eyes getting over the tension then he poured the fuel into the hornet moth as he approached the petrol tanker for the eighth time he saw that his plan was beginning to fall apart karen was walking away from the tree stump back toward the woods she gave the sentry a friendly wave so they must have parted on good terms but harald guessed the man had some duty he was obliged to perform however he was walking away from the tanker toward the mess tent so harald felt able to carry on and he refilled the can as he carried it into the woods karen caught up with him and murmured he has to light the kitchen stove harald nodded and hurried on he poured the eighth canful into the aircrafts tank and returned for the ninth the sentry was nowhere to be seen and karen gave him the thumbsup sign to indicate that he could go ahead he filled the can for the ninth time and returned to the church as he had calculated this brought the level to the brim with some left over but he needed an extra canful to carry in the cabin he returned for the last time karen stopped him at the edge of the wood and pointed the sentry was standing beside the petrol tanker harald saw with dismay that in his hurry he had forgotten to return the nozzle to its hook and the petrol hose dangled untidily the soldier looked up and down the park with a puzzled frown then returned the nozzle to its proper place he remained standing there for a while he took out cigarettes put one in his mouth and opened a box of matches then moved away from the tanker before striking his match karen whispered to harald havent you got enough petrol yet i need one more can the sentry was strolling away with his back to the lorry smoking and harald decided to take a chance he walked fast across the grass to his dismay he found that the tanker did not quite conceal him from the soldiers angle of view nevertheless he put the nozzle in the can and started to pump knowing he would be seen if the man chanced to turn around he filled the can replaced the nozzle screwed the cap on the can and walked away he was almost at the woods when he heard a shout he pretended to be deaf and walked on without turning around or increasing his pace the sentry shouted again and harald heard running boots he passed into the trees karen appeared get out of sight she whispered ill head him off harald darted into a patch of shrubbery lying flat he wriggled under a rambling bush dragging the can with him thor tried to follow him thinking this was a game harald smacked him sharply on the nose and the dog retreated his feelings hurt harald heard the sentry say wheres that man you mean christian karen said who is he one of the gardeners youre terribly handsome when youre cross ludie never mind that what was he doing treating diseased trees with the stuff in that can something that kills those ugly mushroom growths you see on tree trunks that was inventive of her harald thought even if shes forgotten the german word for fungicide this early ludie said skeptically he told me the treatment works best when its cool i saw him walking away from the petrol tanker petrol what would christian do with petrol he doesnt have a car i expect he was taking a shortcut across the lawn hm ludie was still uneasy i havent noticed any diseased trees well look at this harald heard them take a few paces see that growing out of the bark like a great big wart it would kill the tree unless christian treated it i suppose it would well please tell your servants to keep clear of the encampment i will and i apologize im sure christian meant no harm very well goodbye ludie perhaps ill see you tomorrow morning ill be here bye harald waited a few minutes then he heard karen say all clear he crawled out from the bush you were brilliant im becoming such a good liar its worrying they walked toward the monasteryand suffered another shock as they were about to leave the shelter of the woods harald saw per hansen the village policeman and local nazi standing outside the church he cursed what the hell was hansen doing here and at this time of the morning hansen was standing still legs apart and arms folded looking across the park at the military encampment harald put a restraining hand on karens arm but he was too late to stop thor who instantly sensed the hostility karen felt the dog erupted from the woods at a run made for hansen stopped at a safe distance and barked again hansen looked scared and angry and his hand went to the holstered gun at his belt karen whispered ill deal with him without waiting for harald to reply she went forward and whistled to the dog come here thor harald put down his can of petrol dropped to a crouch and watched through the leaves hansen said to karen you should keep that dog under control why he lives here its aggressive he barks at intruders its his job if it attacks a member of the police force it might be shot dont be ridiculous karen said and harald could not help observing that she displayed all the arrogance of her wealth and social position what are you doing snooping around my garden at the crack of dawn im on official business young lady so you mind your manners official business she said skeptically harald guessed she was pretending to be incredulous in order to get more information out of him what business im looking for someone called harald olufsen harald murmured oh shit he had not been expecting this karen was shocked but she managed to cover up never heard of him she said hes a school friend of your brothers and hes wanted by the police well i cant be expected to know all my brothers schoolmates hes been to the castle oh what does he look like male eighteen years old six feet one inch fair hair and blue eyes probably wearing a blue school blazer with a stripe on the sleeve hansen sounded as if he were reciting something he had memorized from a police report he sounds terribly attractive apart from the blazer but i dont recall him karen was maintaining her air of careless disdain but harald could see the tension and worry on her face hes been here twice at least hansen said ive seen him myself i must have missed him whats his crime failing to return a library book i dontthat is i cant say i mean its a routine inquiry hansen obviously did not know what the crime was harald thought he must be asking on behalf of some other policemanpeter flemming presumably karen was saying well my brother has gone to aarhus and theres no one staying here nowapart from a hundred soldiers of course last time i saw olufsen he had a very dangerouslooking motorcycle oh that boy karen said pretending to remember he was expelled from school daddy wont let him come here anymore no well i think ill have a word with your father anyway hes still asleep ill wait as you please come on thor karen walked away and hansen continued up the drive harald waited karen approached the church turned to check that hansen was not watching her then slipped through the door hansen walked up the drive toward the castle harald hoped he would not stop to talk to ludie and discover that the sentry had seen a tall blond man behaving suspiciously near the petrol tanker fortunately hansen walked past the encampment and eventually disappeared behind the castle presumably heading for the kitchen door harald hurried to the church and slipped inside he put the last can of petrol down on the tiled floor karen closed the big door turned the key in the lock and dropped the bar into place then she turned to harald you must be exhausted he was both arms hurt and his legs ached from hurrying through the woods with a heavy weight as soon as he relaxed he felt slightly nauseated from the petrol fumes but he was ecstatically happy you were wonderful he said flirting with ludie as if he were the most eligible bachelor in denmark hes two inches shorter than me and you completely fooled hansen not difficult that harald picked up the can again and put it in the cabin of the hornet moth stowing it on the luggage shelf behind the seats he closed the door and turned around to see karen standing right behind him grinning broadly we did it she said my god we did she put her arms around him and looked at him expectantly it was almost as if she wanted him to kiss her he thought of asking then decided to be more decisive he closed his eyes and leaned forward her lips were soft and warm he could have stayed that way motionless enjoying the touch of her lips for a long time but she had other ideas she broke contact then kissed him again she kissed his upper lip then the lower then his chin then his lips again her mouth was busily playful exploring he had never kissed like this before he opened his eyes and was startled to see that she was looking at him with bright merriment in her eyes what are you thinking she said do you really like me of course i do stupid i like you too good he hesitated then said as a matter of fact i love you i know she said and she kissed him again walking through the center of morlunde in the bright light of a summer morning hermia mount was in more danger than she had been in copenhagen people in this small town knew her two years ago after she and arne had become engaged he had brought her to his parents home on sande she had been to church watched a football match visited arnes favorite bar and gone shopping with arnes mother it broke her heart to remember that happy time but the consequence was that plenty of local people would remember the olufsen boys english fiancee and there was a serious danger she would be recognized if that happened people would start talking and before long the police would hear this morning she wore a hat and sunglasses but still she felt perilously conspicuous all the same she had to take the risk she had spent the previous evening in the town center hoping to run into harald knowing how much he loved jazz she had gone first to the club hot but it was closed she had not found him in any of the bars and cafes where young people gathered it had been a wasted evening this morning she was going to his home she had thought of telephoning but it was hazardous if she gave her real name she risked being overheard and betrayed if she gave a false name or called anonymously she might spook harald and cause him to flee she had to visit in person this would be even more risky morlunde was a town but on the small island of sande every resident knew all the others she could only hope that islanders might take her for a holidaymaker and not look too closely she had no better option the full moon was five days away she made her way to the harbor carrying her small suitcase and boarded the ferry at the top of the gangway stood a german soldier and a danish policeman she showed her papers in the name of agnes ricks the documents had already passed three inspections but nevertheless she suffered a shiver of fear as she offered the forgeries to the two uniformed men the policeman studied her identity card youre a long way from home miss ricks she had prepared her cover story im here for the funeral of a relative it was a good pretext for a long journey she was not sure when arnes interment was scheduled but there was nothing suspicious about a family member arriving a day or two early especially given the hazards of wartime travel that would be the olufsen funeral yes hot tears came to her eyes im a second cousin but my mother was very close to lisbeth olufsen the policeman sensed her grief despite the sunglasses and he said gently my condolences he handed the papers back youre in plenty of time am i that suggested it was today i wasnt sure i couldnt get through on the telephone to check i believe the service is at three oclock this afternoon thank you hermia went forward and leaned on the rail as the ferry chugged out of the harbor she looked across the water to the flat featureless island and recalled her first visit she had been shocked to see the cold unadorned rooms where arne had grown up and to meet his stern parents it was a mystery how that solemn family had produced someone as much fun as arne she was a somewhat severe person herself or so her colleagues seemed to think in that way she had played a role in arnes life similar to that of his mother she had made him punctual and discouraged him from getting drunk while he had taught her to relax and have fun she had once said to him theres a time and place for spontaneity and he had laughed about it all day she had returned to sande once more for the christmas festival it had seemed more like lent for the olufsens christmas was a religious event not a bacchanal yet she had found the holiday enjoyable in its quiet way doing crossword puzzles with arne getting to know harald eating mrs olufsens plain food and walking along the cold beach in a fur coat hand in hand with her lover she had never imagined returning here for his funeral she longed to go to the service but she knew it was impossible too many people would see her and recognize her there might even be a police detective present studying the faces after all if hermia could figure out that arnes mission was being carried on by someone else the police could make the same deduction in fact she now realized the funeral was going to delay her by some hours she would have to wait until after the service before going to the house beforehand there would be neighbors in the kitchen preparing food parishioners in the church arranging flowers and an undertaker fussing about timings and pallbearers it would be almost as bad as the service itself but afterward as soon as the mourners had had their tea and smorrebrod they would all depart leaving the immediate family to grieve alone it meant she would have to kill time now but caution was everything if she could get the film from harald this evening she could catch the first train to copenhagen in the morning sail to bornholm tomorrow night cross to sweden the following day and be in london twelve hours later with two days to go before the full moon it was worth wasting a few hours she disembarked onto the quay at sande and walked to the hotel she could not go into the building for fear she might encounter someone who remembered her so she walked on to the beach it was not really sunbathing weatherthere was patchy cloud and a cool breeze off the waterbut the oldfashioned striped bathing huts had been wheeled out and a few people were splashing in the waves or picnicking on the sand hermia was able to find a sheltered dip in the dunes and disappear into the holiday scene she waited there while the tide came in and a horse from the hotel pulled the wheeled bathing huts back up the beach she had spent so much of the last two weeks sitting and waiting she had met arnes parents a third time on their onceadecade trip to copenhagen arne had taken them all to the tivoli garden and had been his most debonair amusing self charming waitresses making his mother laugh even getting his dour father to reminisce about schooldays at jansborg a few weeks later the nazis had come and hermia had left the country ignominiously she felt in a closed train with a crowd of diplomats from countries hostile to germany and now she was back seeking out a deadly secret risking her life and the lives of others she left her position at half past four the parsonage was ten miles from the hotel a brisk walk of two and a half hours so she would arrive at seven she felt sure all the guests would have left by then and she would find harald and his parents sitting quietly in the kitchen the beach was not deserted several times on her long walk she encountered people she gave them a wide berth letting them assume she was an unfriendly holidaymaker and no one recognized her at last she saw the outlines of the low church and the parsonage the thought that this had been arnes home struck her with sadness there was no one in sight as she came nearer she saw the fresh grave in the little cemetery with a full heart she crossed the churchyard and stood by the grave of her fiance she took off her sunglasses there were lots of flowers she observed people were always touched by the death of a young man grief took hold of her and she began to shake with sobs tears streamed down her face she fell to her knees and took a handful of the piledup earth thinking of his body lying below i doubted you she said in her mind but you were the bravest of us all at last the storm abated and she was able to stand up she wiped her face dry with her sleeve she had work to do when she turned away she saw the tall figure and domed head of arnes father standing a few yards off watching her he must have approached silently and waited for her to rise well hermia he said god bless you thank you pastor she wanted to hug him but he was not a hugging man so she shook his hand you arrived too late for the funeral that was intentional i cant afford to be seen youd better come into the house hermia followed him across the rough grass mrs olufsen was in the kitchen but for once she was not at the sink hermia guessed that neighbors had cleared up after the wake and washed the dishes mrs olufsen was sitting at the kitchen table in a black dress and hat when she saw hermia she burst into tears hermia hugged her but her compassion was distracted the person she wanted was not in the room as soon as she decently could she said i was hoping to see harald hes not here said mrs olufsen hermia had a dreadful feeling that this long and dangerous journey would turn out to have been for nothing didnt he come to the funeral she shook her head tearfully curbing her exasperation as best she could hermia said so where is he the pastor said youd better sit down she forced herself to be patient the pastor was used to being obeyed she would not get anywhere by defying his will mrs olufsen said will you have a cup of tea its not the real thing of course yes please and a sandwich theres such a lot left over no thank you hermia had had nothing all day but she was too tense to eat where is harald she said impatiently we dont know said the pastor how come the pastor looked ashamed a rare expression on his face harald and i had harsh words i was as stubborn as he since then the lord has reminded me how precious is the time a man spends with his sons a tear rolled down his lined face harald left in anger refusing to say where he was going five days later he returned just for a few hours and there was something of a reconciliation on that occasion he told his mother he was going to stay at the home of a schoolmate but when we telephoned they said he was not there do you think he is still angry with you no said the pastor well perhaps he is but thats not why he has disappeared what do you mean my neighbor axel flemming has a son in the copenhagen police i remember hermia said peter flemming mrs olufsen put in he had the nerve to come to the funeral her tone was uncharacteristically bitter the pastor went on peter claims that arne was a spy for the british and harald is continuing his work ah you dont seem surprised i wont lie to you hermia said peter is right i asked arne to take photographs of the military base here on the island harald has the film mrs olufsen cried how could you arne is dead because of that we lost our son and you lost your fiance how could you im sorry hermia whispered the pastor said theres a war lisbeth many young men have died fighting the nazis its not hermias fault i have to get the film from harald hermia said i have to find him wont you help me mrs olufsen said i dont want to lose my other son i couldnt bear it the pastor took her hand arne was working against the nazis if hermia and harald can finish the job he started his death will have some meaning we have to help mrs olufsen nodded i know she said i know im just so scared hermia said where did harald say he was going mrs olufsen answered kirstenslot its a castle outside copenhagen the home of the duchwitz family the son josef is at school with harald but they say hes not there she nodded but hes not far away i spoke to josefs twin sister karen shes in love with harald the pastor said incredulously how do you know that by the sound of her voice when she spoke about him you didnt mention it to me you would have said i couldnt possibly tell the pastor smiled ruefully yes i would hermia said so you think harald is in the vicinity of kirstenslot and karen knows where he is yes then ill have to go there the pastor took a watch out of his waistcoat pocket youve missed the last train youd better stay the night ill take you to the ferry first thing in the morning hermias voice dropped to a whisper how can you be so kind arne died because of me the lord giveth and the lord taken away said the pastor blessed be the name of the lord the hornet moth was ready to fly harald had installed the new cables from vodal his final task had been the punctured tire he had used the car jack from the rollsroyce to lift the aircraft then he had taken the wheel to the nearest garage and paid a mechanic to repair the tire he had devised a method of refueling in flight knocking out a cabin window and passing a hose through it and into the petrol filler pipe finally he had unfolded the wings fixing them in flying position with the simple steel pins provided now the aircraft filled the width of the church he looked outside it was a calm day with a light wind and patchy low cloud that would serve to hide the hornet moth from the luftwaffe they would go tonight his stomach clenched with anxiety when he thought of it simply circling the vodal training school in a tiger moth had seemed like a hairraising adventure now he was planning to fly hundreds of miles over the open sea an aircraft such as this should hug the coast so that it could glide to land in case of trouble flying to england from here it was theoretically possible to follow the coastlines of denmark germany holland belgium and france but harald and karen would be many miles out to sea well away from germanoccupied land if anything went wrong they would have nowhere to go harald was still worrying when karen slipped through the window carrying a basket like little red riding hood his heart leaped with pleasure at the sight of her all day as he worked on the aircraft he had thought about the way they had kissed early this morning after stealing the petrol he kept touching his lips with his fingertips to bring back the memory now she looked at the hornet moth and said wow he was pleased to have impressed her pretty isnt it but you cant get it through the door like that i know ill have to fold the wings again then unfold them outside so why have you rigged them now for practice ill be able to do it faster the second time how fast im not sure what about the soldiers if they see us theyll be asleep she looked solemn were ready arent we were ready when shall we go tonight of course oh my god waiting just increases the chance that well be found out before we get away i know but what i suppose i just didnt think it would come so quickly she took a package out of her basket and handed it to him absentmindedly i brought you some cold beef she fed him every night thanks he studied her carefully youre not having second thoughts are you she shook her head decisively no im just remembering that its three years since i sat in a pilots seat he went over to the workbench and selected a small hatchet and a ball of stout cord he stowed them in the locker under the dashboard of the aircraft karen said what are they for if we come down in the sea i figure the aircraft will sink because of the weight of the engine but the wings on their own would float so if we could chop the wings off we could lash them together for a makeshift raft in the north sea i think wed die of cold before long its better than drowning she shivered if you say so we ought to take some biscuits and a couple of bottles of water ill get some from the kitchen speaking of water were going to be in the air for more than six hours so how do we pee open the door and hope for the best thats all right for you he grinned sorry she looked around and picked up a handful of old newspapers put these inside what for in case i have to pee he frowned i dont see how pray that you never have to find out he put the newspapers on the seat do we have any maps she asked no i assumed we would just fly west until we see land and that will be england she shook her head its quite difficult to know where you are in the air i used to get lost just flying around here suppose we get blown off course we could come down in france by mistake my god i didnt think of that the only way to check your position is to compare the terrain features below you with a map ill see what weve got in the house okay id better go and get all the stuff we need she slipped out through the window again carrying the empty basket harald was too tense to eat the beef she had brought him he began to refold the wings the process was quick by design the intention was that the gentleman owner would do this every night and garage the aircraft alongside the family car to prevent the upper wing fouling the cabin roof when the wings were folded the inner section of the trailing edge was hinged to swing up out of the way so haralds first step was to unlock the hinged sections and push them up on the underside of each upper wing was stowed a brace called a jury strut which harald detached then fixed between the inner ends of the upper and lower wings to prevent their collapsing together the wings were held in the flying position by lshaped sliding pins in the front spars of all four wings on the upper wings the pin was locked in place by the jury strut which harald had now removed so all he had to do was turn the pin through ninety degrees and pull it forward about four inches the pins on the lower wings were locked in place by leather straps harald undid the strap on the left wing then turned the pin and pulled it as soon as it came free the wing started to move harald realized he should have expected this in its parked position with its tail on the ground the aircraft was tilted with its nose in the air and now the heavy double wing was swinging backward by force of gravity he grabbed at it terrified that it would crash against the fuselage and cause damage he tried to seize the leading edge of the lower wing but it was too thick for him to get a grasp shit he cried he stepped forward chasing the wing and grabbed at the steel rigging wires between upper and lower wings he got a purchase and slowed the swing then the wire bit into the skin of his hand he cried out and automatically let go the wing swiveled back and came to rest with a painful thud against the fuselage cursing his carelessness harald went to the tail took hold of the lower wingtip in both hands and swung it out so that he could check for damage to his intense relief there seemed to be none the trailing edges of the upper and lower wings were intact and the fuselage was unmarked nothing was broken but the skin of haralds right hand licking the blood from his palm he went to the right side this time he braced the lower wing with a tea chest full of old magazines so that it could not move he pulled the pins then walked around the wing shoved the chest out of the way and held the wing allowing it to swing slowly back into the folded position karen came back did you get everything harald said anxiously she dropped her basket on the floor we cant go tonight what he felt cheated he had got scared for nothing why not he said angrily im dancing tomorrow dancing he was outraged how can you put that before our mission its really special i told you ive been understudying the lead role half the company has gone down with some kind of gastric illness there are two casts but the leads in both are sick so ive been called in its a great piece of luck damn bad luck it seems to me ill be on the main stage at the royal theatre and guess what the king will be there he ran his fingers through his hair distractedly i cant believe youre saying this i reserved a ticket for you you can pick it up at the box office im not going dont be so grumpy we can fly tomorrow night after i dance the ballet isnt on again for another week after that and one of the other two is sure to be better by then i dont care about the damn balletwhat about the war heis reckoned the raf must be planning a massive air raid they need our photographs before then think of the lives at stake she sighed and her voice softened i knew you would feel this way and i thought about forgoing the opportunity but i just cant anyway if we fly tomorrow well be in england three days before the full moon but well be in deadly danger here for an extra twentyfour hours look no one knows about this planewhy would they find out tomorrow its possible oh dont be so childish anythings possible childish the police are looking for me you know that im a fugitive and i want to get out of this country as soon as i can now she was getting angry you really ought to understand how i feel about this performance well i dont look i might die in this damn plane so might i while im drowning in the north sea or freezing to death on your makeshift raft id like to be able to think that before i died i achieved my lifes ambition and danced wonderfully on the stage of the royal danish theatre in front of the king cant you understand that no i cant then you can go to hell she said and she went out through the window harald stared after her he was thunderstruck a minute passed before he moved then he looked inside the basket she had brought there were two bottles of mineral water a packet of crackers a flashlight a spare battery and two spare bulbs there were no maps but she had put in an old school atlas he picked up the book and opened it on the endpaper was written in a girlish hand karen duchwitz class oh hell he said peter flemming stood on the quay at morlunde watching the last ferry of the day come in from sande waiting for a mystery woman he had been disappointed though not really surprised that harald had not shown up yesterday for his brothers funeral peter had carefully scrutinized all the mourners most were islanders whom peter had known since childhood it was the others who interested him after the service taking tea in the parsonage he had spoken to all the strangers there were a couple of old school pals some army buddies friends from copenhagen and the headmaster of jansborg skole he had ticked their names on the list given him by the policeman on the ferry and he noticed one name not ticked miss agnes ricks returning to the ferry dock he had asked the policeman if agnes ricks had gone back to the mainland not yet the man had said id remember her shes a bit of all right he grinned and cupped his hands over his chest to signify large breasts peter had gone to his fathers hotel and learned that no agnes ricks had checked in he was intrigued who was miss ricks and what was she doing instinct told him she had some connection with arne olufsen perhaps it was wishful thinking but she was the only lead he had he was too conspicuous loitering at the quay on sande so he crossed to the mainland and made himself unobtrusive at the large commercial harbor there however miss ricks did not appear now as the ferry docked for the last time until morning peter retired to the oesterport hotel there was a phone in a little booth in the hotel lobby and he used it to call tilde jespersen at home in copenhagen was harald at the funeral she said immediately no damn i checked out the mourners no clues there but theres one more lead im following up a miss agnes ricks what about you ive spent the day on the phone to local police stations all over the country ive got men checking on each of haralds classmates i should hear from all of them tomorrow you walked off the job he said with an abrupt change of subject it wasnt a normal job though was it she was obviously prepared for this why not you took me because you wanted to sleep with me peter ground his teeth he had compromised his own professionalism by having sex with her and now he could not admonish her angrily he said is that your excuse its not an excuse you said you disliked the way i interrogated the olufsens thats not a reason for a police officer to run away i didnt run away from the job i just didnt want to sleep with a man who could do that i was just doing my duty her voice changed not quite what do you mean it would be all right if you had been tough just for the sake of getting the job done i could respect that but you liked what you were doing you tortured the pastor and bullied his wife and you enjoyed it their grief gave you satisfaction i cant get into bed with a man like that peter hung up he spent much of the night awake thinking about tilde lying in bed angry with her he imagined himself slapping her he would have liked to go to her apartment and pull her out of bed in her nightgown and punish her in his fantasy she pleaded for mercy but he ignored her cries her gown became torn in the struggle and he became aroused and raped her she screamed and fought him off but he held her down afterward she begged forgiveness with tears in her eyes but he left her without a word eventually he fell asleep in the morning he went to the dock to meet the first ferry from sande he looked hopefully at the saltcaked boat as it steamed into the dock agnes ricks was his only hope if she turned out to be innocent he was not sure what to do next a handful of passengers disembarked peters plan had been to ask the policeman if one of them was miss ricks but there was no need he immediately noticed among the men in work clothes headed for the early shift at the cannery a tall woman wearing sunglasses and a head scarf as she came closer he realized he knew her he saw black hair escaping from under the scarf but it was the large curved nose that gave her away she walked with a confident mannish stride he observed and he remembered noticing that gait when he first met her two years ago she was hermia mount she looked thinner and older than the woman who had been introduced as arne olufsens fiancee back in but peter had no doubt you treacherous bitch ive got you he said with profound satisfaction anxious that she might recognize him he put on heavyrimmed glasses and pulled his hat forward to cover the distinctive red of his hair then he followed her to the station where she bought a ticket to copenhagen after a long wait they boarded an old slow coalburning train that meandered across denmark from west to east stopping at halftimbered stations in seaweedsmelling resorts and sleepy market towns peter sat in a firstclass carriage fidgeting with impatience hermia was in the next carriage in a thirdclass seat she could not get away from him while they were on the train but on the other hand he could make no progress until she got off it was midafternoon when the train pulled into nyborg on the central island of fyn from here they had to transfer to a ferry across the great belt to zealand the largest island where they would board another train to copenhagen peter had heard talk of an ambitious plan to replace the ferry with a huge bridge twelve miles long traditionalists liked the numerous danish ferries saying their slow progress was part of the countrys relaxed attitude to life but peter would have liked to scrap them all he had a lot to do he preferred bridges while waiting for the ferry he found a phone and called tilde at the politigaarden she was coolly professional i havent found harald but ive got a clue good twice in the last month hes visited kirstenslot the home of the duchwitz family jews yes the local policeman recalls meeting him he says harald had a steamdriven motorcycle but he swears harald is not there now make double sure go there yourself i was planning to he wanted to talk to her about what she had said yesterday did she really mean that she could not sleep with him again but he could not think of a way to raise the subject so he kept talking about the case i found miss ricks shes hermia mount arne olufsens fiancee the english girl yes good news it is peter was glad tilde had not lost her enthusiasm for the case shes on her way to copenhagen now and im following her isnt there a chance shell recognize you yes in case she tries to give you the slip why dont i meet the train id rather you go to kirstenslot maybe i can do both where are you nyborg youre at least two hours away more this train is torpid i can drive out to kirstenslot snoop around for an hour and still meet you at the station good he said do it when harald cooled down he saw that karens decision to postpone their flight for a day was not completely mad he put himself in her place by imagining that he had been offered the chance to perform an important experiment with the physicist neils bohr he might have delayed the escape to england for the sake of such an opportunity perhaps he and bohr together would change mankinds understanding of how the universe worked if he were going to die he would like to know he had done something like that nevertheless he spent a tense day he checked everything on the hornet moth twice he studied the instrument panel familiarizing himself with the gauges so that he could help karen the panel was not illuminated for the aircraft was not designed to be used at night so they would have to shine the torch on the dials to read the instruments he practiced folding and unfolding the wings improving his time he tried out his inflight refueling system pouring a little petrol through the hose that led from the cabin through the smashedout window into the tank he watched the weather which was fine with patchy cloud and a light breeze a threequarter moon rose late in the afternoon he put on clean clothes he was lying on his ledge bed stroking pinetop the cat when someone rattled the big church door harald sat upright putting pinetop on the floor and listened he heard the voice of per hansen i told you it was locked a woman replied all the more reason to look inside the voice was authoritative harald noted fearfully he pictured a woman in her thirties attractive but businesslike obviously she was with the police presumably she had sent hansen to look for harald at the castle yesterday clearly she had not been satisfied with hansens inquiries and had come herself today harald cursed she would probably be more thorough than hansen it would not take her long to find a way into the church there was nowhere for him to hide except the trunk of the rollsroyce and any serious searcher was sure to open that harald was afraid he might already be too late to exit by his usual window which was just around the corner from the main door but there were windows all around the curved chancel and he quickly made his escape through one of those when he hit the ground he looked around warily this end of the church was only partly concealed by trees and he might have been seen by a soldier but he was in luck and no one was nearby he hesitated he wanted to get away but he needed to know what happened next he flattened himself against the wall of the church and listened he heard hansens voice say mrs jespersen if we stand on that log we could get through the window no doubt thats why the log is there the woman replied crisply she was obviously a lot smarter than hansen harald had a dreadful feeling she was going to learn everything he heard the scrape of feet on the wall a grunt from hansen as presumably he squeezed himself through the window then a thud as he hit the tiled floor of the church a lighter thud followed a few seconds afterward harald crept around the side of the church stood on the log and peeped through the window mrs jespersen was a pretty woman of about thirty not fat but well rounded smartly dressed in practical clothes a blouse and skirt with flat shoes and a sky blue beret over her blond curls as she was not in uniform she must be a detective harald deduced she carried a shoulder bag which presumably had a gun in it hansen was redfaced from the exertion of getting through the window and he looked harassed harald guessed the village policeman was finding it a strain dealing with the quickthinking detective she looked first at the bike well heres the motorcycle you told me about i see the steam engine ingenious he must have left it here hansen said in a defensive tone obviously he had told the detective that harald had gone away but she was not convinced perhaps she moved to the car very nice it belongs to the jew she ran a finger along the curve of a mudguard and looked at the dust he hasnt been out in it for a while of course notits wheels are off hansen thought he had caught her out and looked pleased that doesnt mean muchwheels can be put on quickly but its difficult to fake a layer of dust she crossed the room and picked up haralds discarded shirt he groaned inwardly why had he not put it away somewhere she sniffed it pinetop appeared from somewhere and rubbed his head against mrs jespersens leg she stooped to stroke him what are you after she said to the cat has someone been feeding you nothing could be hidden from this woman harald saw with dismay she was too thorough she moved to the ledge where harald slept she picked up his neatly folded blanket then put it down again someones living here she said perhaps its a vagrant and perhaps its harald fucking olufsen hansen looked shocked she turned to the hornet moth what have we here harald watched in despair as she pulled off the cover i do believe its an airplane thats the end harald thought its all over now hansen said duchwitz used to have a plane i remember now he hasnt flown it for years though its not in bad condition its got no wings the wings are folded backthats how they got it through the door she opened the cabin door reaching inside she moved the control stick looking at the tailplane at the same time seeing the elevator move the controls seem to work she peered at the fuel gauge the tank is full looking around the little cabin she added and theres a fourgallon can behind the seat and the locker contains two bottles of water and a packet of biscuits plus an axe a ball of good strong cord a flashlight and an atlaswith no dust on any of them she withdrew her head from the cabin and looked at hansen harald is planning to fly well im damned said hansen the wild thought of killing them both occurred to harald he was not sure he could kill another human being in any circumstances but he immediately realized he could not overpower two armed police officers with his bare hands and he dismissed the thought mrs jespersen became very brisk i have to go into copenhagen inspector flemming whos in charge of this case is coming in by train given the way the railways are nowadays he could arrive any time in the next twelve hours when he does well come back well arrest harald if hes here and set a trap for him if hes not what do you want me to do stay here find a vantage point in the woods and watch the church if harald appears dont speak to him just phone the politigaarden arent you going to send someone to help me no we mustnt do anything to scare harald off if he sees you he wont panicyoure just the village policeman but a couple of strange cops might spook him i dont want him to run away and hide somewhere now that weve tracked him down we mustnt lose him again is that clear yes on the other hand if he tries to fly that plane stop him arrest him shoot him if you have tobut dont for gods sake let him take off harald found her matteroffact tone absolutely terrifying if she had been overdramatic he might not have felt so scared but she was an attractive woman speaking calmly about practicalitiesand she had just told hansen to shoot him if necessary until this moment harald had not confronted the possibility that the police might simply kill him mrs jespersens quiet mercilessness shook him you can open this door to save me scrambling through the window again she said lock it up when ive gone so that harald wont suspect anything hansen turned the key and removed the bar and they went out harald jumped to the ground and retreated around the end of the church moving away from the building he stood behind a tree and watched from a distance as mrs jespersen walked to her car a black buick she looked at her reflection in the cars window and adjusted her sky blue beret in a very feminine gesture then she reverted to cop mode shook hands briskly with hansen got into the car and drove away fast hansen came back and disappeared from haralds view screened by the church harald leaned against the trunk of the tree for a moment thinking karen had promised to come to the church as soon as she got home from the ballet if she did that she might find the police waiting for her and how would she explain what she was doing her guilt would be obvious harald had to head her off somehow thinking about the best way to intercept her and warn her he decided the simplest thing would be to go to the theater that way he could be sure he would not miss her he felt a moment of anger toward her if they had taken off last night they might be in england now he had warned her that she was putting them both in danger and now he had been proved right but recriminations were fruitless it was done and he had to deal with the consequences unexpectedly hansen came walking around the corner of the church he saw harald and stopped dead they were both astonished harald had thought hansen had gone back into the church to lock up hansen for his part could not have imagined that his quarry was so close they stared at each other for a paralyzed moment then hansen reached for his gun mrs jespersens words flashed through haralds mind shoot him if you have to hansen a village constable had probably never shot at anyone in his life but he might jump at the chance harald reacted instinctively without thought for the consequences he rushed at hansen as hansen drew his pistol from the holster harald cannoned into him hansen was thrown back and hit the church wall with a thud but he did not lose his grip on the gun he raised the gun to point it harald knew he had only a fraction of a second to save himself he drew back his fist and hit hansen on the point of the chin the blow had the force of desperation behind it hansens head jerked back and hit the brickwork with a sound like the crack of a rifle his eyes rolled up his body slumped and he fell to the ground harald was dreadfully afraid the man was dead he knelt beside the unconscious body he saw immediately that hansen was breathing thank god he thought it was horrifying to think he might have killed a maneven a vicious fool such as hansen the fight had lasted only a few seconds but had it been observed he looked across the park to the soldiers encampment a few men were walking around but no one was looking haralds way he stuffed hansens gun into his pocket then lifted the limp body slinging it over his shoulder in a firemans lift he hurried around the church to the main door which was still open his luck held and no one saw him he put hansen down then quickly closed and locked the church door he got the cord out of the cabin of the hornet moth and tied hansens feet together he rolled the man over and tied his hands behind his back then he picked up his discarded shirt stuffed half of it in hansens mouth so the man could not cry out and tied string around hansens head so that the gag would not fall out finally he put hansen in the trunk of the rollsroyce and closed the lid he looked at his watch he still had time to get to the city and warn karen he lit the boiler on his motorcycle he might well be seen driving out of the church but there was no longer any time for caution however he could get into trouble with a policemans gun making a bulge in his pocket not knowing what to do with the pistol he opened the right door of the hornet moth and put it on the floor where no one would see it unless they got in the aircraft and trod on it when the motorcycle engine had a head of steam he opened the doors drove the bike out locked up from inside and exited by the window he was lucky and saw no one he drove into the city keeping a nervous eye out for policemen and parked at the side of the royal theatre a red carpet led up to the entrance and he recalled that the king was attending this performance a notice informed him that les sylphides was the last of three ballets on the program a crowd of welldressed people stood on the steps with drinks and harald gathered that he had arrived during the interval he went to the stage door where he encountered an obstacle the entrance was guarded by a uniformed commissionaire i need to speak to karen duchwitz harald said out of the question the commissionaire told him shes about to go on stage its really important youll have to wait until afterward harald could see that the man was immovable how long is the ballet about half an hour depending how fast the orchestra plays harald remembered that karen had left a ticket for him at the box office he decided he would watch her dance he went into the marble foyer got his ticket and entered the auditorium he had never been in a theater before and he gazed in wonder at the lavish gilded decoration the rising tiers of the circle and the rows of red plush seats he found his place in the fourth row and sat down there were two german officers in uniform immediately in front of him he checked his watch why did the ballet not start every minute brought peter flemming nearer he picked up a program that had been left on the seat beside him and flicked through it looking for karens name she was not on the cast list but a slip of paper which fell out of the booklet said that the prima ballerina was indisposed and her place would be taken by karen duchwitz it also revealed that the lone male dancer in the ballet would also be played by an understudy jan anders presumably because the principal man had also fallen victim to the gastric illness that had spread through the cast this must be a worrying moment for the company harald thought the leading roles being taken by students when the king was in the audience a few moments later he was startled to see mr and mrs duchwitz take their seats two rows in front of him he should have known they would not miss their daughters big moment at first he worried that they would see him then he realized it no longer mattered now that the police had found his hiding place he did not need to keep it secret from anyone else he remembered guiltily that he was wearing mr duchwitzs american sports jacket it was fifteen years old according to the tailors label in the inside pocket but karen had not actually asked her fathers permission to take it would pa duchwitz recognize it harald told himself he was foolish even to think about it being accused of stealing a jacket was the least thing he had to worry about he touched the roll of film in his pocket and wondered if there was any chance he and karen could still escape in the hornet moth a lot depended on peter flemmings train if it came in early flemming and mrs jespersen would be back at kirstenslot before harald and karen perhaps they could avoid getting caught but it was hard to see how they could get access to the aircraft with the police watching over it on the other hand with hansen out of the way there was no guard on the aircraft at the moment if flemmings train did not get in until the early hours of the morning perhaps there was a chance they could yet take off mrs jespersen did not know that harald had seen her she thought she had plenty of time that was the only thing in haralds favor when would the damn show start after everyone was seated in the auditorium the king came into the royal box the audience stood up it was the first time harald had seen king christian x in person but the face was familiar from photographs the downturned moustache giving it a permanently grim expression that was appropriate to the monarch of an occupied country he was in evening dress and stood very upright in pictures the king always wore some kind of hat and now harald saw for the first time that he was losing his hair when the king sat the audience followed suit and the lights went down at last harald thought the curtain rose on twenty or more women motionless in a circle and one man standing at the twelve oclock position the dancers all dressed in white posed in a pale bluish light like moonlight and the bare stage disappeared into dark shadows at its edges it was a dramatic opening and harald was fascinated despite his worries the music played a slow descending phrase and the dancers moved the circle widened leaving four people motionless upstage the man and three women one of the women lay on the ground as if asleep a slow waltz began where was karen all the girls were in identical dresses with tight bodices that left their shoulders bare and full skirts that billowed as they danced it was a sexy outfit but the atmospheric lighting made them all look the same and harald could not tell which was karen then the sleeping one moved and he recognized karens red hair she glided to the center of the stage harald was taut with anxiety fearing she would do something wrong and spoil her great day but she seemed assured and controlled she began to dance on the tips of her toes it looked painful and made harald wince but she seemed to float the company formed patterns around her lines and circles the audience was silent and still captivated by her and haralds heart filled with pride he was glad she had decided to do this no matter what the consequences the music changed key and the male dancer moved as he leaped across the stage harald thought he seemed uncertain and remembered that he too was an understudy anders karen had danced with confidence making every move seem effortless but there was tension in the boys movements that gave his dancing a sense of risk the dance closed with the slow phrase that had opened it and harald realized there was no story the dances would be as abstract as the music he checked his watch only five minutes had passed the ensemble dispersed and reformed in new configurations that framed a series of solo dances all the music seemed to be in threefour time and very melodic harald who loved the discords of jazz found it almost too sweet the ballet fascinated him but nevertheless his mind wandered to the hornet moth and hansen tied up in the trunk of the rolls and mrs jespersen could peter flemming have found the only punctual train in denmark if so had he and mrs jespersen gone to kirstenslot yet had they found hansen were they already lying in wait how could harald check perhaps he would approach the monastery through the woods in the hope of spotting any ambush karen began a solo dance and he found himself more tense about her than about the police he need not have worried she was relaxed and selfpossessed swirling and tiptoeing and leaping as happily as if she were making it up as she went along he was astonished at how she could perform some vigorous step running or jumping across the stage then come to an abrupt stop in a perfectly graceful pose as if she had no inertia she seemed to flout the laws of physics harald became even more nervous when karen began a dance with jan anders it was called a pas de deux he thought although he was not sure how he knew that anders kept lifting her dramatically high in the air her skirt would billow up showing her fabulous legs anders would hold her up sometimes with one hand while he struck a pose or moved around the stage harald feared for her safety but again and again she came down with ease and grace nevertheless harald was relieved when the pas de deux ended and the ensemble began he checked his watch again this must be the last dance thank god anders performed several spectacular leaps during the last dance and reprised some of his lifts with karen then as the music built to a climax disaster struck anders lifted karen again then held her in the air with his hand in the small of her back she stretched out parallel to the ground her legs curved forward with pointed toes and her arms reached backward over her head making an arch they held the pose for a moment then anders slipped his left foot shot out from under him he staggered and fell flat on his back karen tumbled to the stage beside him landing on her right arm and leg the audience gasped with horror the other dancers rushed to the two fallen figures the music played on for a few bars then died away a man in black trousers and a black sweater came on from the wings anders got to his feet holding his elbow and harald saw that he was crying karen tried to get up but fell back the figure in black made a gesture and the curtain came down the audience burst into excited chatter harald realized he was standing up he saw mr and mrs duchwitz two rows in front of him get to their feet and push urgently along the row excusing themselves to the people they were passing they were obviously intending to go backstage harald decided to do the same it was painfully slow getting out of the row of seats in his anxiety he had to restrain himself from simply walking along everyones knees but he reached the aisle at the same time as the duchwitzes im coming with you he said who are you said her father her mother answered the question its josefs friend harald youve met him before karen is sweet on him let him come mr duchwitz grunted assent harald had no idea how mrs duchwitz knew that karen was sweet on him but he was relieved to be accepted as part of the family as they reached the exit the audience fell silent the duchwitzes and harald turned at the door the curtain had come up the stage was empty but for the man in black your majesty ladies and gentlemen he began by good fortune the company doctor was in the audience tonight harald guessed that everyone associated with the ballet company would want to be present for a royal performance the doctor is already backstage and is examining our two principals he has told me that neither appears to be gravely injured there was a scatter of applause harald was relieved now that he knew she was going to be all right he thought for the first time about how the accident might affect their escape even if they could get at the hornet moth would karen be able to fly it the man in black resumed as you know from your program both lead roles were played by understudies tonight as were many of the other parts nevertheless i hope you agree with me that they all danced wonderfully well and gave a superb performance almost to the very end thank you the curtain came down and the audience applauded it came up again to reveal the cast minus karen and anders and they took a bow the duchwitzes went out and harald followed they hurried to the stage door an usher took them to karens dressing room she was sitting with her right arm in a sling she looked stunningly beautiful in the creamy white gown with her shoulders bare and the rise of her breasts showing above the bodice harald felt breathless and did not know whether the cause was anxiety or desire the doctor was kneeling in front of her wrapping a bandage around her right ankle mrs duchwitz rushed to karen saying my poor baby she put her arms around karen and hugged her it was what harald would have liked to do oh im all right karen said though she looked pale mr duchwitz spoke to the doctor how is she shes fine the man said shes sprained her wrist and ankle theyll be painful for a few days and she must take it easy for at least two weeks but shell get over it harald was relieved that her injuries were not serious but his immediate thought was can she fly the doctor fastened the bandage with a safety pin and stood up he patted her bare shoulder id better go and see jan anders he didnt fall as hard as you but im a bit worried about his elbow thank you doctor his hand lingered on her shoulder to haralds annoyance youll dance as wonderfully as ever dont you worry he left karen said poor jan he cant stop crying harald thought anders should be shot it was his faulthe dropped you he said indignantly i know thats why hes so upset mr duchwitz looked at harald with irritation what are you doing here once again it was his wife who answered harald has been living at kirstenslot karen was shocked mother how did you know do you think nobody noticed how the leftovers disappeared from the kitchen every night we mothers arent stupid you know mr duchwitz said but where does he sleep in the disused church i expect his wife replied that would be why karen was so keen to keep it locked harald was horrified that his secret had been so easily unveiled mr duchwitz was looking angry but before he could explode the king walked in everyone fell silent karen tried to stand up but he stopped her my dear girl please stay just where you are how do you feel it hurts your majesty im sure it does but no permanent damage i gather thats what the doctor said you danced divinely you know thank you sir the king looked inquiringly at harald good evening young man im harald olufsen your majesty a school friend of karens brother which school jansborg skole do they still call the headmaster heis yesand his wife mia well be sure to take good care of karen he turned to the parents hello duchwitz its good to see you again your daughter is marvelously talented thank you your majesty you remember my wife hanna of course the king shook her hand this is very worrying for a mother mrs duchwitz but im sure karen will be all right yes your majesty the young heal fast indeed they do now then lets have a look at the poor fellow who dropped her the king moved to the door for the first time harald noticed the kings companion a young man who was assistant or bodyguard or perhaps both this way sir said the young man and he held the door the king went out well said mrs duchwitz in a thrilled voice how very charming mr duchwitz said i suppose wed better get karen home harald wondered when he would get a chance to speak to her alone karen said mother will have to help me out of this dress mr duchwitz moved to the door and harald followed him not knowing what else to do karen said before i change do you mind if i have a word alone with harald her father looked irritated but her mother said all rightjust be quick they left the room and mrs duchwitz closed the door are you really all right harald asked karen i will be when youve kissed me he knelt beside the chair and kissed her lips then unable to resist the temptation he kissed her bare shoulders and her throat his lips traveled downward and he kissed the swell of her breasts oh my goodness stop its too nice she said reluctantly harald drew back he saw that the color had returned to her face and she was breathless he was amazed to think his kisses had done that we have to talk she said i know are you fit to fly the hornet moth no he had feared as much are you sure it hurts too much i cant even open a damn door and i can hardly walk so i couldnt possibly operate the rudder with my feet harald buried his face in his hands then its all over the doctor said it would only hurt for a few days we could go as soon as i feel better theres something i havent told you yet hansen came snooping around again tonight i wouldnt worry about him this time he was with a woman detective mrs jespersen who is a lot smarter i listened to their conversation she went into the church and figured out everything she guessed that im living there and that im planning to escape in the aircraft oh no what did she do went to fetch her boss who happens to be peter flemming she left hansen on guard and told him to shoot me if i try to take off to shoot you what are you going to do i knocked hansen out and tied him up harald said not without a touch of pride oh my god where is he now in the trunk of your fathers car she found that funny you fiend i thought we had just one chance peter is on a train and she didnt know when he would get in if you and i could have got back to kirstenslot tonight before peter and mrs jespersen we could still have taken off but now that you cant fly we could still do it how you can be the pilot i cantive only had one lesson ill talk you through everything poul said you had a natural talent for it and i could operate the control stick with my left hand some of the time do you really mean it yes all right harald nodded solemnly thats what well do just pray for peters train to be late hermia had spotted peter flemming on the ferry she saw him leaning on the rail looking at the sea and recalled a man with a ginger moustache and a smart tweed suit on the platform at morlunde no doubt several people from morlunde were traveling all the way to copenhagen as she was but the man looked vaguely familar the hat and glasses put her off for a while but eventually her memory dredged him up peter flemming she had met him with arne in the happy days the two men had been boyhood friends she seemed to recall then had fought when their families quarreled now peter was a cop as soon as she remembered that she realized he must be following her she felt a chill of fear like a cold wind she was running out of time the full moon was three nights away and she still had not found harald olufsen if she got the film from him tonight she was not sure how she could get it home in time but she was not going to give upfor the sake of arnes memory for the sake of digby and for all the airmen risking their lives to stop the nazis but why had peter not arrested her already she was a british spy what was he up to perhaps like her peter was looking for harald when the ferry docked peter followed her onto the copenhagen train as soon as the train got going she walked along the corridor and spotted him in a first class compartment she returned to her seat worried this was a very bad development she must not lead peter to harald she had to throw him off she had plenty of time to think about how the train was delayed repeatedly and got into copenhagen at ten oclock in the evening by the time it pulled into the station she had made a plan she would go into the tivoli garden and lose peter in the crowd as she left the train she glanced back along the platform and saw peter stepping down from the first class carriage she walked at a normal pace up the steps from the platform through the ticket barrier and out of the station it was dusk the tivoli garden was a few steps away she went to the main entrance and bought a ticket closing at midnight the vendor warned her she had come here with arne in the summer of it had been a festival night and fifty thousand people had crammed into the park to watch the fireworks now the place was a sad version of its former self like a blackandwhite photograph of a bowl of fruit the paths still wound charmingly between flower beds but the fairy lights in the trees had been switched off and the paths were illuminated by special lowintensity lamps to conform with blackout regulations the air raid shelter outside the pantomime theatre added a dismal touch even the bands seemed muted most dismaying for hermia the crowds were not as dense making it easier for someone to follow her she stopped pretending to watch a juggler and glanced back she saw peter close behind her buying a glass of beer from a stall how was she going to shake him off she moved into a crowd around an openair stage on which an operetta was being sung she pushed her way through to the front then out at the far side but when she walked on peter was still behind her if this went on much longer he would realize she was trying to lose him then he might cut his losses and arrest her she began to feel frightened she circled the lake and came to an openair dance floor where a large orchestra was playing a foxtrot there were at least a hundred couples dancing energetically and many more watching hermia at last felt something of the atmosphere of the old tivoli seeing a goodlooking young man standing alone at the side she was inspired she went up to him and turned on her biggest smile would you like to dance with me she said of course he took her in his arms and they were off hermia was not a good dancer but she could get by with a competent partner arne had been superb stylish and masterful this man was confident and decisive whats your name he said she almost told him then stopped herself at the last minute agnes i am johan im very happy to meet you johan and you foxtrot wonderfully she looked back to the path and saw peter watching the dancers inconveniently the tune came to an abrupt end the dancers applauded the orchestra some couples left the floor and others came on hermia said another dance it would be my pleasure she decided to level with him listen theres a horrid man following me and im trying to get away from him will you steer us all the way over to the far side how exciting he looked across the floor to the spectators which one is it that fat man with the red face no the one in the light brown suit i see him hes quite handsome the bank struck up a polka oh dear said hermia the polka was difficult but she had to try johan was expert enough to make it easier for her he could also converse at the same time the man who is bothering youis he a complete stranger or someone you know i have met him before take me to the far end by the orchestrathats right is he your boyfriend no im going to leave you in a minute johan if he runs after me will you trip him up or something if you wish thank you i think he is your husband absolutely not they were close to the orchestra johan steered her to the edge of the dance floor perhaps you are a spy and he is a policeman hoping to catch you stealing military secrets from the nazis something like that she said gaily and she slipped from his arms she walked quickly off the floor and around the bandstand into the trees she ran across the grass until she came to another path then she made for a side exit she looked back peter was not behind her she left the park and hurried to the suburban railway station across the street from the main line terminus she bought a ticket for kirstenslot she felt exhilarated she had shaken peter off there was no one on the platform with her but an attractive woman in a sky blue beret harald approached the church cautiously there had been a shower and the grass was wet but the rain had stopped a light breeze blew the clouds along and a threequarter moon shone brightly through the gaps the shadow of the bell tower came and went with the moonlight he saw no strange cars parked nearby but that did not much reassure him the police would have concealed their vehicles if they were serious about setting a trap there were no lights anywhere in the ruined monastery it was midnight and the soldiers were in bed all but two the sentry in the park outside the mess tent and a veterinary nurse on duty in the horse hospital harald listened outside the church he heard a horse snort in the cloisters with utmost caution he stood on the log and peeped over the windowsill he could see the vague outlines of the car and the aircraft in the dim reflected moonlight there could be someone hiding in there lying in wait he heard a muffled grunt and a thud the noise was repeated after a minute and he guessed it was hansen struggling with his bonds haralds heart leaped with hope if hansen was still tied up that meant mrs jespersen had not yet returned with peter there was still a chance harald and karen could take off in the hornet moth he slipped through the window and padded across the floor to the aircraft he got the flashlight out of the cabin and shone it around the church there was no one here he opened the boot of the car hansen was still tied and gagged harald checked the knots they were holding firm he closed the boot again he heard a loud whisper harald is that you he shone the flashlight on the windows and saw karen looking through she had been brought home in an ambulance her parents had ridden with her before they parted at the theater she had promised to slip out of the house as soon as she could and join him in the church if the coast was clear he turned off the flashlight then opened the big church door for her she limped in wearing a fur coat over her shoulders and carrying a blanket he put his arms around her gently careful of her right arm in its sling and hugged her for a brief moment he thrilled to the warmth of her body and the scent of her hair then he returned to practicalities how do you feel i hurt like hell but ill live he looked at her coat are you cold not yet but i will be at five thousand feet over the north sea the blanket is for you he took the blanket from her and held her good hand are you ready to do this yes he kissed her softly i love you i love you too do you youve never said that before i knowim telling you now in case i dont survive this trip she said in her usual matteroffact tone youre the best man ive ever met by a factor of ten youre brainy but you never put people down youre gentle and kind but youve got courage enough for an army she touched his hair youre even nicelooking in a funny way what more could i want some girls like a man to be well dressed good point we can fix that though id like to tell you why i love you but the police could get here any minute thats all right i know why its because im wonderful harald opened the cabin door and tossed the blanket in youd better get on board now he said the less we have to do once were outside in plain view the more chance we have of getting away okay he saw that it was going to be difficult for her to get into the cabin he dragged a box over and she stood on it but then she could not put her injured foot inside getting in was awkward anywaythe cabin was more cramped than the front seat of a small carand it seemed impossible with two injured limbs harald realized he would have to lift her in he picked her up with his left arm under her shoulders and his right under her knees then he stood on the box and eased her into the passenger seat on the righthand side of the cabin that way she could operate the yshaped central control stick with her good left hand and harald beside her in the pilots seat would be able to use his right whats this on the floor she said reaching down hansens gun i didnt know what else to do with it he closed the door are you okay she slid the window open im fine the best place to take off will be along the drive the wind is just right but blowing toward the castle so youre going to have to push the aircraft all the way to the door of the castle then turn it around to take off into the wind okay he opened the church doors wide next he had to get the aircraft out fortunately it had been parked intelligently pointing directly at the door there was a length of rope firmly tied to the undercarriage which harald had surmised when he first saw it was used to pull the aircraft he got a firm grasp on the rope and heaved the hornet moth was heavier than he had thought as well as its engine it was carrying thirtynine gallons of petrol plus karen that was a lot to pull to overcome its inertia harald managed to rock the aircraft on its wheels get a rhythm going then heave it into motion once it was moving the strain was less but it was still heavy with considerable effort he pulled it out of the church into the park and got it as far as the drive the moon came from behind a cloud the park was lit up almost like day the aircraft was in full view of anyone who looked in the right direction harald had to work fast he undid the catch holding the left wing against the fuselage and swung the wing into position next he flipped down the foldaway flap at the inner end of the upper wing that held the wing in place while he moved around the wing to the front edge there he turned the lower wing pin and eased it into its slot it seemed to catch against an obstruction he had encountered this problem when practicing he wiggled the wing gently and that enabled him to slide the pin home he locked it with the leather strap he repeated the exercise with the upper wing pin locking it by stowing the jury strut it had taken him three or four minutes he looked across the park to the soldiers encampment the sentry had seen him and was walking over he went through the same procedure with the right wing by the time he had finished the sentry was standing behind him watching it was friendly leo what are you doing he said curiously harald had a story ready were going to take a photograph mr duchwitz wants to sell the aircraft because he cant get fuel for it photography at night its a moonlight shot with the castle in the background does my captain know oh yes mr duchwitz spoke to him and captain kleiss said there would be no problem oh good leo said then he frowned again its strange that the captain didnt tell me about it though he probably didnt think it was important harald realized he was probably on a loser if the german military were careless they would not have conquered europe leo shook his head a sentry must be briefed on any unusual events scheduled to take place during his watch he said as if repeating from a rule book im sure mr duchwitz wouldnt have told us to do this without speaking to captain kleiss harald leaned on the tailplane pushing seeing him struggle to move the tail leo helped him together they swung the back around in a quartercircle so that the aircraft was facing along the drive leo said id better check with the captain if youre sure he wont mind being woken up leo looked doubtful and worried perhaps hes not asleep yet harald knew that the officers slept in the castle he thought of a way to delay leo and speed up his own task well if youve got to go all the way to the castle you could help me move this crate okay ill take the left wing you take the right leo shouldered his rifle and leaned on the metal strut between the upper and lower wings with the two of them pushing the hornet moth moved more easily hermia caught the last train of the evening from the vesterport station it pulled into kirstenslot after midnight she was not sure what to do when she reached the castle she did not want to call attention to herself by banging on the door and waking the household she might have to wait until morning before asking for harald that would mean spending the night in the open but that would not kill her on the other hand if there were lights on in the castle she might find someone with whom she could have a discreet word a servant perhaps and she was nervous about losing precious time one other person got off the train with her it was the woman in the sky blue beret she suffered a moment of fear had she made a mistake could this woman be following her having taken over from peter flemming she would just have to check outside the darkened station she stopped and opened her suitcase pretending to search for something if the woman were tailing her she too would have to find a pretext for waiting the woman came out of the station and walked past her without hesitating hermia continued to fumble in her case while watching from the corner of her eye the woman walked briskly to a black buick parked nearby someone was sitting at the wheel smoking hermia could not see the face just the glow of the cigarette the woman got in the car started up and pulled away hermia breathed easier the woman had spent the evening in the city and her husband had come to the station to drive her home false alarm hermia thought with relief she started walking harald and leo pushed the hornet moth along the drive past the petrol tanker from which harald had stolen fuel all the way to the courtyard in front of the castle then turned it into the wind leo ran inside to wake captain kleiss harald had only a minute or two he took the flashlight from his pocket switched it on and held it in his mouth he turned the catches on the left side of the fuselage nose and opened the cowling fuel on he called fuel on karen called back harald tugged on the pullring of the tickler and worked the lever of one of the two fuel pumps to flood the carburetor he closed the cowling and secured the catches taking the flashlight from his mouth he called throttle set and mags on throttle set mags on he stood in front of the aircraft and swung the propeller imitating what he had seen karen do he turned it a second time then a third finally he gave it a vigorous heave and stepped smartly back nothing happened he cursed there was no time to deal with snags he repeated the procedure something was wrong he thought even as he tried it before when he turned the propeller something had happened that was not happening now he tried desperately to remember what it was once again the engine failed to start in a flash of recollection he realized what was missing there was no click when he turned the propeller he recalled karen telling him that the click was the impulse starter without that there would be no spark he ran to her open window theres no click he said magneto jam she said calmly it often happens open the right cowling youll see the impulse starter between the magneto and the engine give it a sharp tap with a stone or something that usually does the trick he opened the right cowling and shone his flashlight on the engine the impulse starter was a flat metal cylinder he scanned the ground at his feet there were no stones give me something from the tool kit he said to karen she found the kit and handed him a wrench he tapped the impulse starter a voice behind him called stop that right now he turned to see captain kleiss dressed in uniform trousers and a pajama jacket striding across the courtyard toward him with leo close behind kleiss was not armed but leo had a rifle harald stuffed the spanner into his pocket closed the cowling and moved to the nose stand away from that aircraft kleiss shouted this is an order suddenly karens voice rang out stop right where you are or ill shoot you dead harald saw her arm sticking out of the window pointing hansens pistol straight at kleiss kleiss stopped and so did leo whether karen knew how to fire the thing harald had no ideabut neither did kleiss drop the rifle on the ground leo said karen leo dropped his weapon harald reached for the propeller and swung it it turned with a loud deeply satisfying click peter flemming drove to the castle ahead of hermia with tilde jespersen in the passenger seat beside him well park out of sight and watch what she does when she gets here he said okay about what happened on sande please dont speak of it he suppressed his anger what never never he wanted to strangle her the cars headlights showed a small village with a church and a tavern just beyond the village they approached a grand entrance im sorry peter tilde said i made a mistake but its over lets just be friends and colleagues he felt he did not care about anything anymore to hell with that he said and turned in to the castle grounds on the right of the drive was a ruined monastery thats odd tilde said the church doors are wide open peter hoped there would be some action to take his mind off tildes rejection he stopped the buick and turned off the engine lets have a look he took a flashlight out of the glove compartment they got out of the car and went into the church peter heard a muffled grunt followed by a thud it seemed to come from the rollsroyce car that was standing on blocks in the middle of the room he opened the trunk and shone his flashlight on a policeman bound and gagged is this your man hansen he said tilde said the airplane isnt here its gone at that moment they heard an aircraft engine start the hornet moth roared into life and seemed to lean forward as if eager to go harald walked quickly to where kleiss and leo stood he picked up the rifle and held it menacingly putting on an air of confidence that he did not feel he backed away from them slowly and walked around the spinning propeller to the left side door he reached for the handle flung open the door and threw the rifle onto the luggage shelf behind the seats as he climbed in a sudden movement made him glance past karen out of the far window he saw captain kleiss throw himself forward toward the aircraft and dive to the ground there was a bang deafening even over the noise of the engine as karen fired hansens pistol but harald could see that the window frame prevented her bringing her wrist low enough and her shot missed the captain kleiss rolled under the fuselage came up the other side and jumped on the wing harald tried to slam the door but kleiss was in the way the captain grabbed harald by the lapels and tried to pull him out of his seat harald struggled trying to dislodge kleisss grip karen was holding the pistol in her left hand and could not turn around in the cramped cabin to get a shot at kleiss leo came running up but because of the door and the wings he was unable to get close enough to join in the fight harald pulled the wrench from his pocket and lashed out with all his might the sharp end of the tool hit kleiss under the eye drawing blood but he held on karen reached past harald and thrust the throttle lever all the way forward the engine roared louder and the aircraft moved forward kleiss lost his balance he flung one arm out but held on to harald with the other the hornet moth moved faster bumping over the grass harald hit kleiss again and this time he cried out let go and fell to the ground harald slammed the door he reached for the control column in the center but karen said leave the stick to mei can do it lefthanded the aircraft was pointing down the drive but as soon as it began to pick up speed it veered off to the right use the rudder pedals karen shouted keep it in a straight line harald pushed the left pedal to bring the aircraft back onto the drive nothing happened so he pressed it with all his might after a moment the aircraft swung all the way over to the left it crossed the drive and plunged into the long grass on the other side she yelled theres a lag you have to anticipate he understood what she meant it was like steering a boat only worse he pushed with his right foot to bring the aircraft back then as soon as it began to turn he corrected with his left foot this time it did not swing so wildly as it came back to the drive he managed to line it up now keep it like that karen shouted the aircraft accelerated at the far end of the drive a cars headlights came on peter flemming thrust the gearshift into first and floored the pedal just as tilde was opening the passenger door to get in the car jerked away she let go of the door with a cry and fell back peter hoped she had broken her neck he steered along the drive letting the passenger door flap when his engine started to scream he changed up into second the buick gathered speed in his headlights he saw a small biplane rolling down the drive coming straight at him harald olufsen was in that plane he felt sure he was going to stop harald even if it killed them both he changed up into third harald felt the hornet moth tilt as karen pushed the stick forward bringing the tail up he shouted do you see that car yesis he trying to ram us yes harald was staring along the drive concentrating on keeping the aircraft on a straight course with the rudder pedals can we take off in time to fly over him im not sure you have to make up your mind get ready to turn if i say im ready the car was dangerously close harald could see they were not going to lift over it karen yelled turn he pressed the left pedal the aircraft responding less sluggishly at higher speed swung sharply off the drivetoo sharply he feared his undercarriage repair job might not stand the strain he corrected quickly out of the corner of his eye he saw the car turn the same way still aiming to ram the hornet moth it was a buick he saw just like the one in which peter flemming had driven him to jansborg skole it turned sharply trying to maintain a collision course with the aircraft but the aircraft had a rudder whereas the car was steered by its wheels and this made a difference on the wet grass as soon as the buick hit the grass it went into a skid as it slid sideways the moonlight momentarily caught the face of the man behind the wheel fighting for control and harald recognized peter flemming the aircraft wobbled and straightened out harald saw that he was about to crash into the petrol tanker he stamped on the left pedal and the right wingtip of the hornet moth missed the truck by inches peter flemming was not so lucky glancing back harald saw the buick completely out of control slide with terrible inevitability toward the tanker it smashed into the truck at top speed there was a booming explosion and a second later the entire park was lit up with a yellow glow harald tried to see if the tail of the hornet moth might have caught fire but it was impossible to look directly behind so he just hoped for the best the buick was a furnace steer the aircraft karen yelled at him were about to take off he returned his attention to the rudder he saw that he was heading for the mess tent he pressed the right pedal to miss it when they were on a straight course again the aircraft sped up hermia had begun to run when she heard the plane engine start up as she came into the grounds of kirstenslot she saw a dark car very like the one at the station tearing along the drive as she watched it went into a skid and crashed into a truck parked alongside the drive there was a terrific explosion and both car and truck burst into flame she heard a woman cry peter in the fires light she saw the woman in the blue beret everything fell into place the woman had been following her the man waiting in the buick had been peter flemming they had not needed to follow her from the station because they knew where she was going they had come to the castle ahead of her then what she saw a small biplane rolling across the grass looking as if it was about to take off then she saw the woman in the blue beret kneel down pull a gun from her shoulder bag and aim at the aircraft what was happening here if the woman in the beret was a colleague of peter flemmings the pilot must be on the side of the angels hermia deduced it could even be harald escaping with the film in his pocket she had to stop the woman from shooting the aircraft down the park was lit up by the flames from the petrol tanker and in the brightness harald saw mrs jespersen aim a gun at the hornet moth there was nothing he could do he was heading straight for her and if he turned to one side or the other he would merely present her with a better target he gritted his teeth the bullets might pass through the wings or the fuselage without causing serious damage on the other hand they might disable the engine damage the controls hole the petrol tank or kill him or karen then he saw a second woman runnning across the grass carrying a suitcase hermia he shouted in astonishment as he recognized her she hit mrs jespersen over the head with her case the detective fell sideways and dropped her gun hermia hit her again then grabbed the gun then the aircraft passed over them and harald realized it had left the ground looking up he saw that it was about to crash into the bell tower of the church karen thrust the yshaped control column sharply to the left banging it against haralds knee the hornet moth banked as it climbed but harald could see that the turn was not sharp enough and the aircraft was going to hit the bell tower left rudder karen screamed he remembered that he too could steer he jammed his left foot down hard on the pedal and immediately felt the aircraft bank more steeply still he felt sure the right wing would smash into the brickwork the aircraft came around with excruciating slowness he braced himself for the crash the wingtip missed the tower by inches jesus christ he said the gusty wind made the aircraft buck like a pony harald felt they could fall out of the sky at any second but karen continued the climbing turn harald gritted his teeth the aircraft came around a hundred and eighty degrees at last when it was heading back over the castle she straightened out as they gained altitude the aircraft steadied and harald recalled poul kirke saying there was more turbulence near the ground he looked down flames still flickered in the petrol tanker and by their light he could see the soldiers emerging from the monastery in their nightwear captain kleiss was waving his arms and shouting orders mrs jespersen lay still apparently out cold hermia mount was nowhere to be seen at the door of the castle a few servants stood looking up at the aircraft karen pointed to a dial on the instrument panel keep an eye on this she said its the turnandslip indicator use the rudder to hold the needle straight upright at the twelve oclock position bright moonlight came through the transparent roof of the cabin but it was not quite enough to read the instruments harald shone the flashlight on the dial they continued to climb and the castle shrank behind them karen kept looking to the left and right as well as ahead although there was nothing much to see but the moonlit danish landscape fasten your seat belt she said he saw that hers was done up it will save you banging your head on the cabin roof if the ride gets bumpy harald fastened his belt he began to believe that they had escaped he allowed himself to feel triumphant i thought i was going to die he said so did iseveral times your parents will go out of their minds with worry i left them a note thats more than i did he had not thought of it lets just stay alive that will make them happy he touched her cheek how do you feel a bit feverish youve got a temperature you should sip water no thanks weve got a sixhour flight ahead of us and no bathroom i dont want to have to pee on a newspaper in front of you it could be the end of a beautiful friendship ill close my eyes and fly the aircraft with your eyes shut forget it ill be all right she was being jocular but he was anxious about her he felt shattered by what they had been through and she had done all the same things with a sprained ankle and a sprained wrist he hoped she would not pass out look at the compass she said whats our course he had examined the compass while the aircraft was in the church and knew how to read it two hundred and thirty karen banked right i figure our heading for england is twofifty tell me when were on course he shone the flashlight on the compass until it showed the right course then said thats it time twelveforty we should write all this down but we didnt bring pencils i dont think ill forget any of it id like to get above this patchy cloud she said whats our altitude harald shone the flashlight on the altimeter four thousand seven hundred feet so this cloud is at about five thousand a few moments later the aircraft was engulfed by what looked like smoke and harald realized they had entered the cloud keep the light on the airspeed indicator karen said let me know if our speed changes why when youre flying blind its difficult to keep the aircraft in the correct attitude i could put the nose up or down without realizing it but if that happens well know because our speed will increase or decrease he found it unnerving to be blind this must be how accidents happen he thought an aircraft could easily hit the side of a mountain in cloud fortunately there were no mountains in denmark but if another aircraft happened to be flying through the same cloud neither pilot would know until it was too late after a couple of minutes he found that enough moonlight was penetrating the cloud for him to see it swirling against the windows then to his relief they emerged and he could see the hornet moths moon shadow on the cloud below karen eased the stick forward to level out see the rev counter harald shone the flashlight it says two thousand two hundred bring the throttle smoothly back until it drops to nineteen hundred harald did as she said we use power to change our altitude she explained throttle forward we go up throttle back we go down so how do we control our speed by the attitude of the aircraft nose down to go faster nose up to go slower got it but never raise the nose too sharply or you will stall that means you lose lift and the aircraft falls out of the sky harald found that a terrifying thought what do you do then put the nose down and increase the revs its easyexcept that your instinct tells you to pull the nose up and that makes it worse ill remember that karen said take the stick for a while see if you can fly straight and level all right you have control he grasped the control stick in his right hand she said youre supposed to say i have control thats so that the pilot and copilot never get into a situation where each thinks the other is flying the aircraft i have control he said but he did not feel it the hornet moth had a life of its own turning and dipping with air turbulence and he found himself using all his powers of concentration to keep the wings level and the nose in the same position karen said do you find that youre constantly pulling back on the stick yes thats because weve used some fuel and changed the aircrafts center of gravity do you see that lever by the top forward corner of your door he glanced up briefly yes thats the elevator trim lever i set it all the way forward for takeoff when the tank was full and the tail was heavy now the aircraft needs to be retrimmed how do we do that simple ease your grip on the stick you feel it wanting to go forward of its own accord yes move the trim lever back youll find less need for constant back pressure on the stick she was right adjust the trim lever until you no longer need to pull on the stick harald drew the lever back gradually before he knew it the control column was pressing back on his hand too much he said he pushed the trim lever forward a fraction thats about right you can also trim the rudder by moving the knob in that toothed rack at the bottom of the instrument panel when the aircraft is correctly trimmed it should fly straight and level with no pressure on the controls harald took his hand off the column experimentally the hornet moth continued to fly level he returned his hand to the stick the cloud below them was not continuous and at intervals they were able to see through gaps to the moonlit earth below soon they left zealand behind and flew over the sea karen said check the altimeter he found it difficult to look down at the instrument panel feeling instinctively that he needed to concentrate on flying the aircraft when he tore his gaze away from the exterior he saw that they had reached seven thousand feet how did that happen he said youre holding the nose too high its natural unconsciously youre afraid of hitting the ground so you keep trying to climb dip the nose he pushed the stick forward as the nose came down he saw another aircraft it had large crosses on its wings harald felt sick with fear karen saw it at the same time hell she said the luftwaffe she sounded as scared as harald felt i see it harald said it was to their left and down a quarter of a mile or so away and climbing toward them she took the stick and put the nose sharply down i have control you have control the hornet moth went into a dive harald recognized the other aircraft as a messerschmitt bf a twinengined night fighter with a distinctive doublefinned tailplane and long greenhouselike cockpit canopy he remembered arne talking about the bfs armament with a mixture of fear and envy it had cannons and machine guns in the nose and harald could see the rear machine guns poking up from the back end of the canopy this was the aircraft used to shoot down allied bombers after the radio station on sande had detected them the hornet moth was completely defenseless harald said what are we going to do try to get back into that cloud layer before he gets within range damn i shouldnt have let you climb so high the hornet moth was diving steeply harald glanced at the airspeed indicator and saw that they had reached one hundred and thirty knots it felt like the downhill stretch of a rollercoaster he realized he was grasping the edge of his seat is this safe he said safer than being shot the other aircraft came rapidly closer it was much faster than the moth there was a flash and a rattle of gunfire harald had been expecting the messerschmitt to fire on them but he could not restrain a yell of shock and fear karen turned right trying to spoil the gunners aim the messerschmitt flashed past below the gunfire stopped and the hornet moths engine droned on they had not been hit harald recalled arne saying that it was quite difficult for a fast aircraft to shoot at a slow one perhaps that had saved them as they turned he looked out of the window and saw the fighter receding into the distance i think hes out of range he said not for long karen replied sure enough the messerschmitt was turning the seconds dragged by as the hornet moth dived toward the protection of the cloud and the fastmoving fighter swept through a wide turn harald saw that their airspeed had reached one hundred and sixty the cloud was tantalizingly closebut not close enough he saw the flashes and heard the bangs as the fighter opened up this time the aircraft were closer and the fighter had a better angle of attack to his horror he saw a jagged rip appear in the fabric of the lower left wing karen shoved the stick over and the hornet moth banked then suddenly they were plunged into cloud the gunfire stopped thank god harald said although it was cold he was sweating karen pulled back on the stick and brought them out of the dive harald shone the flashlight on the altimeter and watched the needle slow its counterclockwise movement and steady at just above five thousand feet the airspeed returned gradually to the normal cruising speed of eighty knots she banked the aircraft again changing direction so that the fighter would not be able to overtake them simply by following their previous course bring the revs down to about sixteen hundred she said well get just below this cloud why not stay in it its difficult to fly in cloud for long you get disoriented you dont know up from down the instruments tell you whats happening but you dont believe them its how a lot of crashes happen harald found the lever in the dark and drew it back was it just luck that the fighter turned up karen said maybe they can see us with their radio beams harald frowned thinking he was glad to have a puzzle to take his mind off the danger they were in i doubt it he said metal interferes with radio waves but i dont think wood or linen does a big aluminum bomber would reflect the beams back to their aerials but only our engine would do that and its probably too small to show up on their detectors i hope youre right she said if not were dead they came out below the cloud harald increased the revs to nineteen hundred and karen pulled the stick back keep looking around karen said if we see him again we have to go up fast harald did as she said but there was not much to see a mile ahead the moon was shining through a gap in the clouds and harald could make out the irregular geometry of fields and woodland they must be over the large central island of fyn he thought nearer a bright light moved perceptibly across the dark landscape and he guessed it was a railway train or a police car karen banked right look up to your left she said harald could see nothing she banked the other way and looked up out of her window we have to watch every angle she explained he noticed that she was getting hoarse with the constant shouting over the noise of the engine the messerschmitt appeared ahead it dropped out of the cloud a quarter of a mile in front of them dimly revealed by moonlight reflected off the ground heading away full power karen shouted but harald had already done it she jerked back on the stick to lift the nose maybe he wont even see us harald said optimistically but his hopes were immediately dashed as the fighter went into a steep turn the hornet moth took several seconds to respond to the controls at last they began to rise toward the cloud the fighter came around in a wide circle and pitched up to follow their climb as soon as he was lined up he fired then the hornet moth was in the cloud karen changed direction immediately harald cheered dodged him again he said but his underlying fear gave a brittle tone to the triumph in his voice they climbed through the cloud when the glow of moonlight began to illuminate the swirling mist around them harald realized they were near the top of the cloud layer throttle back karen said well have to stay in the cloud as long as we can the aircraft leveled watch that airspeed indicator she said make sure im not climbing or diving okay he checked the altimeter too they were at feet just then the messerschmitt appeared only yards away it was slightly lower and to the right heading across their path for a split second harald saw the terrified face of the german pilot his mouth opening in a shout of horror they were all an inch from death the fighters wing passed under the hornet moth missing the undercarriage by a hair harald trod on the left rudder pedal and karen jerked back on the control stick but the fighter was already gone from view karen said my god that was close harald stared into the swirling cloud expecting the messerschmitt to appear a minute went by then another karen said i think he was as scared as us what do you think hell do fly above and below the cloud for a while hoping well pop out with luck our courses will diverge and well lose him harald checked the compass were going north he said i went off heading in all that dodging about she said she banked left and harald helped with the rudder when the compass read twofifty he said enough and she straightened up they came out of the cloud they both scanned the sky in all directions but there were no other aircraft i feel so tired karen said its not surprising let me take control rest for a while harald concentrated on flying straight and level the endless minor adjustments started to become instinctive keep an eye on the dials karen warned him watch the airspeed indicator the altimeter the compass the oil pressure and the fuel gauge when youre flying youre supposed to check all the time okay he forced himself to look at the dashboard every minute or two and he found contrary to what his instincts told him that the aircraft did not fall to earth as soon as he did so we must be over jutland now karen said i wonder how far north we strayed how can we tell well have to fly low as we cross the coast we should be able to identify some terrain features and establish our position on the map the moon was low on the horizon harald checked his watch and was astonished to see that they had been flying for almost two hours it seemed like a few minutes lets take a look said karen after a while pull the revs back to fourteen hundred and dip the nose she found the atlas and studied it by the light of the flashlight well have to go lower she said i cant see the land well enough harald brought the aircraft down to three thousand feet then two the ground was visible in the moonlight but there were no distinguishing elements just fields then karen said lookis that a town ahead harald peered down it was hard to tell there were no lights because of the blackoutwhich had been imposed precisely in order to make towns hard to see from the air but the ground ahead certainly seemed to have a different texture in the moonlight suddenly small burning lights began to appear in the air what the hell is that karen yelled was someone aiming fireworks at the hornet moth fireworks had been banned since the invasion karen said ive never seen tracer bullets but shit is that what they are without waiting for instructions harald pushed the throttle forward all the way and lifted the nose to gain altitude as he did so searchlights came on there was a bang and something exploded nearby what was that karen cried i think it must have been a shell someones firing at us harald suddenly realized where they were this must be morlunde were right over the port defenses turn he banked dont climb too steeply she said youll stall another shell burst above them searchlight beams scythed the darkness all around harald felt as if he were lifting the aircraft by willpower they came around degrees harald straightened out and continued to climb another shell exploded but it was behind them he began to feel they might yet survive the firing stopped he turned again flying on their original heading still climbing a minute later they passed over the coast were leaving the land behind he said she made no reply and he turned to see that her eyes were closed he glanced back at the coastline disappearing behind him in the moonlight i wonder if well ever see denmark again he said the moon set but for a while the sky was clear of cloud and harald could see stars he was grateful for them as they were the only way he could tell up from down the engine gave a reassuringly constant roar he flew at five thousand feet and eighty knots there was less turbulence than he remembered from his first flight and he wondered whether that was because he was over the sea or because it was nightor both he kept checking his heading by the compass but he did not know how much the hornet moth might be blown off course by wind he took his hand off the control stick and touched karens face her cheek was burning he trimmed the aircraft to fly straight and level then took a bottle of water from the locker under the dashboard he poured some on his hand then dabbed her forehead to cool her she was breathing normally though her breath was hot on his hand she seemed to be in a feverish sleep when he returned his attention to the outside world he saw that dawn was breaking he checked his watch it was just after three oclock in the morning he must be halfway to england by the faint light he saw cloud ahead there seemed to be no top or bottom to it so he flew into it there was also rain and the water stayed on the windshield unlike a car the hornet moth had no windshield wipers he remembered what karen had said about disorientation and resolved not to make any sudden moves however staring constantly into swirling nothingness was strangely hypnotic he wished he could talk to karen but he felt she needed sleep after what she had been through he lost track of the passage of time he started to imagine shapes in the cloud he saw a horses head the hood of a lincoln continental and the moustached face of neptune ahead of him at eleven oclock and a few feet below he saw a fishing boat with sailors on deck gazing up at him in wonderment that was no illusion he realized snapping back to full consciousness the mist had cleared and he was seeing a real boat he looked at the altimeter both hands pointed up he was at sea level he had lost altitude without noticing instinctively he pulled the stick back lifting the nose but as he did so he heard karens voice in his head saying but never raise the nose too sharply or you will stall that means you lose lift and the aircraft falls out of the sky he realized what he had done and remembered how to correct it but he was not sure he had time the aircraft was already losing altitude he put the nose down and pushed the throttle all the way forward he was level with the fishing boat as he passed it he risked pulling the nose up a fraction he waited for the wheels to hit the waves the aircraft flew on he pulled the nose up a little more he risked a glance at the altimeter he was climbing he let out a long breath pay attention you fool he said aloud stay awake he continued climbing the cloud dissipated and he emerged into a clear morning he checked his watch it was four oclock the sun was about to rise looking up through the transparent roof of the cabin he could see the north star to his right that meant his compass was accurate and he was still heading west frightened of getting too close to the sea he climbed for half an hour the temperature dropped and cold air came in through the window he had smashed out for his improvised fuel line he wrapped the blanket around himself for warmth at ten thousand feet he was about to level off when the engine coughed at first he could not figure out what the noise was the engine sound had been steady for so many hours that he had ceased to hear it then it came again and he realized the engine had misfired he felt as if his heart had stopped he was about two hundred miles from land in any direction if the engine failed now he would come down in the sea it coughed again karen he shouted wake up she slept on he took his hand off the stick and shook her shoulder karen her eyes opened she appeared better for her sleep calmer and less flushed but a look of fear came over her face as soon as she heard the engine whats happening i dont know where are we miles from anywhere the engine continued to cough and splutter we may have to land in the sea karen said whats our altitude ten thousand feet is the throttle fully open yes i was climbing thats the problem bring it back halfway he pulled the throttle back karen said when the throttle is on full the engine draws air from outside rather than from within the engine compartment so its colderat this altitude cold enough to form ice in the carburetor what can we do descend she took the stick and pushed it forward as we go down the air temperature should rise and the ice will melteventually if it doesnt look for a ship if we can splash down near one we may be rescued harald scanned the sea from horizon to horizon but he could see no ships with the engine misfiring they had little thrust and lost altitude rapidly harald took the axe from the locker ready to carry out his plan of hacking off a wing to use as a float he put the bottles of water in his jacket pockets he did not know if they would survive in the sea long enough to die of thirst he watched the altimeter they came down to a thousand feet then five hundred the sea looked black and cold there were still no ships in sight a weird calm settled over harald i think were going to die he said im sorry i got you into this were not finished yet she said see if you can give me a few more revs so that we dont splash down too hard harald pushed the throttle forward the engine note rose it missed fired and missed again harald said i dont think then the engine seemed to catch it roared steadily for several seconds and harald held his breath then it misfired again finally it burst into a steady roar the aircraft began to climb harald realized they were both cheering the revs rose to nineteen hundred without missing a beat the ice melted karen said harald kissed her it was quite difficult although they were shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh in the cramped cabin it was awkward to turn in the seat especially with a seat belt on but he managed it that was nice she said if we survive this im going to kiss you every day for the rest of my life he said happily really she said the rest of your life could be a long time i hope so she looked pleased then she said we should check the fuel harald twisted in his seat to look at the gauge between the seat backs it was difficult to read having two scales one for use in the air and the other for on the ground when the aircraft was tilted but they both read near to empty hell the tank is almost dry harald said theres no land in sight she looked at her watch weve been in the air five and a half hours so were probably still half an hour from land thats all right i can top up the tank he unbuckled his seat belt and turned awkwardly to kneel on his seat the petrol can stood on the luggage shelf behind the seats beside it was a funnel and one end of a length of garden hose before takeoff harald had broken the window and passed the hose through the hole lashing the other end to the petrol inlet in the side of the fuselage but now he could see the outside end of the hose flapping in the slipstream he cursed karen said whats the matter the hose has worked loose in flight i didnt tie it tight enough what are we going to do we have to refuel harald looked at the petrol can the funnel the hose and the window ive got to put the hose into the filler neck and it cant be done from in here you cant go outside what will it do to the aircraft if i open the door my god its like a giant air brake it will slow us down and turn us left can you cope with that i can maintain airspeed by putting the nose down i suppose i could press down on the right rudder pedal with my left foot lets try it karen put the aircraft into a gentle dive then put her left foot on the right rudder pedal okay harald opened the door the aircraft immediately veered sharply to the left karen pushed down on the right rudder pedal but they continued to turn she eased the stick over to the right and banked but the aircraft still went left its no good i cant hold it she cried harald closed the door if i smash these windows out that will almost halve the area of wind resistance he said he took the wrench from his pocket the windows were made of some kind of celluloid that was tougher than glass but he knew it was not unbreakable for he had knocked out the rear window two days ago he drew back his right arm as far as he could and hit the window hard and the celluloid shattered he tapped the remaining material out of the frame ready to try again just a minutewe need more airspeed she leaned across and pushed the throttle open then eased the trim lever forward an inch okay harald opened the door once again the aircraft veered left but this time less sharply and karen seemed to be able to correct with the rudder kneeling on the seat harald put his head out of the door he could see the end of the hose flapping around the petrol access cover holding the door open with his right shoulder he stretched out his right arm and grasped the hose now he had to feed it into the tank he could see the open access panel but not the filler neck he got the end of the hose positioned roughly over the panel but the length of rubber in his hand constantly flopped around with the movement of the aircraft and he could not get the end into the pipe it was like trying to thread a needle in a hurricane he tried for several minutes but it became more hopeless as his hand got colder karen tapped his shoulder he drew his hand back into the cabin and closed the door were losing altitude she said we need to climb she pulled the stick back harald blew on his hand to warm it i cant do it this way he told her i cant get the hose into the pipe i need to be able to hold the other end of the tube how he thought for a minute maybe i can put one foot out of the door oh god let me know when weve gained enough altitude after a couple of minutes she said okay but be ready to close the door as soon as i tap your shoulder facing backward with his left knee on the seat harald put his right foot out through the door and onto the reinforced strip on the wing holding his seat belt with his left hand for security he leaned out and grasped the hose he ran his hand along its length until he was holding the tip then he leaned out farther to put the end into the pipe the hornet moth hit an air pocket the aircraft bucked in the air harald lost his balance and thought he was going to fall off the wing he jerked hard on the hose and his seat belt at the same time trying to stay upright the other end of the hose inside the cabin broke free of the string holding it as it came loose harald involuntarily let go of it the slipstream whisked it away shaking with fear he eased back into the cabin and closed the door what happened she said i couldnt see for a moment he was unable to reply when he had recovered he said i dropped the hose oh no he checked the fuel gauge were running on empty i dont know what we can do ill have to stand on the wing and pour the petrol in directly from the can it will take two handsi cant hold a fourgallon can with one hand its too heavy but you wont be able to hold on youll have to hold my belt with your left hand karen was strong but he was not sure she could take his weight if he slipped however there was no alternative then i wont be able to move the control stick well just have to hope you dont need to all right but lets gain more altitude he looked around there was no land in sight karen said warm your hands put them under my coat he turned still kneeling on the seat and pressed his hands to her waist under the fur coat she was wearing a light summer sweater put them under my sweater go on feel my skin i dont mind she was hot to his touch he kept his hands there as they climbed then the engine missed were out of fuel karen said the engine caught again but he knew she was right lets do it he said she trimmed the aircraft harald unscrewed the cap of the fourgallon can and the tiny cabin filled with the unpleasant smell of petrol despite the wind blowing in at the broken windows the engine missed again and began to falter harald lifted the can karen took hold of his belt ive got you tight she said dont worry he opened the door and put his right foot out he moved the can to the seat he put his left foot out so that he was standing on the wing and leaning inside the cabin he was absolutely terrified he lifted the can and stood upright on the wing he made the mistake of looking beyond the trailing edge of the wing to the sea below his stomach lurched with nausea he almost dropped the can he closed his eyes swallowed and got himself under control he opened his eyes resolving not to look down he leaned over the petrol inlet his belt tightened over his stomach as karen took the strain he tilted the can the constant movement of the aircraft made it impossible to pour straight but after a few moments he got the knack of compensating he leaned forward and back relying on karen to keep him safe the engine continued to misfire for a few seconds then returned to normal he wanted desperately to get back inside but they needed fuel to reach land the petrol seemed to flow as slowly as honey some blew away in the airflow and more spilled around the access plate and was wasted but most of it seemed to go into the pipe at last the can was empty he dropped it into the air and gratefully grabbed the door frame with his left hand he eased himself back into the cabin and closed the door look said karen pointing ahead in the far distance right on the horizon was a dark shape it was land hallelujah he said softly just pray that its england karen said i dont know how far we might have been blown off course it seemed to take a long time but eventually the dark shape turned green and became a landscape then it resolved into a beach a town with a harbor an expanse of fields and a range of hills lets take a closer look karen said they descended to two thousand feet to examine the town i cant tell whether its france or england harald said ive never been to either place ive been to paris and london but neither of them looks like this harald checked the fuel gauge were going to have to land soon anyway but we need to know whether were in enemy territory harald glanced up through the roof and saw two aircraft were about to find out he said look up they both stared at the two small aircraft that were rapidly approaching from the south as they came closer harald stared at their wings waiting for the markings to become distinct would they turn out to be german crosses had all this been for nothing the aircraft came closer and harald saw that they were spitfires with raf roundels this was england he let out a whoop of triumph we made it the aircraft came closer and flew on either side of the hornet moth harald could see the pilots staring at them karen said i hope they dont think were enemy spies and shoot us down it was dreadfully possible harald tried to think of some way of telling the raf they were friendly flag of truce he said he pulled off his shirt and pushed it out of the broken window the white cotton fluttered in the wind it seemed to do the trick one of the spitfires moved in front of the hornet moth and waggled its wings karen said that means follow me i think but i havent got enough fuel she looked at the landscape below sea breeze from the east to judge by the smoke from that farmhouse ill come down in that field she put the nose down and turned harald looked anxiously at the spitfires after a moment they turned and began to circle but maintained their altitude as if watching to see what would happen next perhaps they had decided that a hornet moth could not be much of a threat to the british empire karen came down to a thousand feet and flew downwind past the field she had chosen there were no obstructions visible she turned into the wind for landing harald operated the rudder helping keep the aircraft in a straight line when they were twenty feet above the grass karen said throttle all the way back please harald pulled the lever back she lifted the nose of the aircraft gently with the stick when it seemed to harald that they were almost touching the ground they continued to fly for fifty yards or more then there was a bump as the wheels made contact with the earth the aircraft slowed down in a few seconds as it came to a halt harald looked through the broken window and saw just a few yards away a young man on a bicycle watching from a pathway alongside the field staring at them openmouthed i wonder where we are karen said harald called out to the bicyclist hello there he said in english what is this place the young man looked at him as if he had come from outer space well he said at last its not the bloody airport epilogue twentyfour hours after harald and karen landed in england the photographs harald had taken at the radar station on sande had been printed enlarged and pinned up on one wall of a big room in a grand building in westminster some had been marked with arrows and notes in the room were three men in raf uniforms examining the pictures and talking in low urgent voices digby hoare ushered harald and karen into the room and closed the door and the officers turned around one of them a tall man with a gray moustache said hello digby good morning andrew digby said this is air vice marshal sir andrew hogg sir andrew may i present miss duchwitz and mr olufsen hogg shook karens left hand as her right was still in a sling youre an exceptionally brave young woman he said he spoke english with a clipped accent that made him sound as if he had something in his mouth and harald had to listen hard to understand him an experienced pilot would hesitate to cross the north sea in a hornet moth hogg added to tell the truth i had no idea how dangerous it was when i set off she replied hogg turned to harald digby and i are old friends hes given me a full report on your debriefing and frankly i cant tell you how important this information is but i want you to go over again your theory about how these three pieces of apparatus work together harald concentrated retrieving from his memory the english words he needed he pointed to the general shot he had taken of the three structures the large aerial rotates steadily as if constantly scanning the skies but the smaller ones tilt up and down and side to side and it seemed to me they must be tracking aircraft hogg interrupted him to say to the other two officers i sent a radio expert on a reconnaissance flight over the island this morning at dawn he picked up waves of two point four meters wavelength presumably emanating from the big freya and also fiftycentimeter waves presumably from the smaller machines which must be wurtzburgs he turned back to harald carry on please so i guessed that the large machine gives longrange warning of the approach of bombers of the smaller machines one tracks a single bomber and the other tracks the fighter sent up to attack it that way a controller could direct a fighter to the bomber with great accuracy hogg turned to his colleagues again i believe hes right what do you think one of them said id still like to know the meaning of himmelbett harald said himmelbett thats the german word for one of those beds a fourposter bed we call it in english hogg told him weve heard that the radar equipment operates in a himmelbett but we dont know what that means oh said harald ive been wondering how they would organize things this explains it the room went quiet does it said hogg well if you were in charge of german air defense it would make sense to divide your borders up into blocks of airspace say five miles wide and twenty miles deep and assign a set of three machines to each block or himmelbett you might be right hogg said thoughtfully that would give them an almost impenetrable defense if the bombers fly side by side yes said harald but if you made your raf pilots fly in line and sent them all through one single himmelbett the luftwaffe would be able to track only one bomber and the others would have a much better chance of getting through hogg stared at him for a long moment then he looked at digby and at his two colleagues then back at harald like a stream of bombers harald said not sure they understood the silence stretched out harald wondered if there was something wrong with his english do you see what i mean he said oh yes said hogg at last i see exactly what you mean on the following morning digby drove harald and karen out of london to the northeast after three hours they arrived at a country house that had been commandeered by the air force as officers quarters they were each given a small room with a cot then digby introduced them to his brother bartlett in the afternoon they all went with bart to the nearby raf station where his squadron was based digby had arranged for them to attend the briefing telling the local commander it was part of a secret intelligence exercise and no further questions were asked they listened as the commanding officer explained the new formation the pilots would use for that nights raidthe bomber stream their target was hamburg the same scene was repeated with different targets on airfields up and down eastern england digby told harald that more than six hundred bombers would take part in tonights desperate attempt to draw some of the luftwaffes strength back from the russian front the moon rose a few minutes after six oclock in the evening and the twin engines of the wellingtons began to roar at eight on the big blackboard in the operations room takeoff times were noted beside the code letter for each aircraft bart was piloting g for george as night fell and the wireless operators reported in from the bombers their positions were marked on a big map table the markers moved ever closer to hamburg digby smoked one anxious cigarette after another the lead aircraft c for charlie reported that it was under attack from a fighter then its transmissions stopped a for able approached the city reported heavy flak and dropped incendiaries to light the target for the bombers following when they began to drop their bombs harald thought of his goldstein cousins in hamburg and hoped they would be safe as part of his schoolwork last year he had had to read a novel in english and he had chosen war in the air by h g wells which had given him a nightmare vision of a city under attack from the air he knew this was the only way to defeat the nazis but all the same he dreaded what might happen to monika an officer came over to digby and said in a quiet voice that they had lost radio contact with barts aircraft it may just be a wireless problem he said one by one the bombers called in to report that they were heading backall but c for charlie and g for george the same officer came over to say the rear gunner of f for freddie saw one of ours go down he doesnt know which but im afraid it sounds like g for george digby buried his face in his hands the counters representing the aircraft moved back across the map of europe on the table only c and g remained over hamburg digby made a phone call to london then said to harald the bomber stream worked theyre estimating a lower level of losses than weve had for a year karen said i hope barts all right in the early hours the bombers began to come back in digby went outside and karen and harald joined him watching the big aircraft land on the runway and disgorge their crews tired but jubilant when the moon went down they were all back but charlie and george bart hoare never did come home harald felt low as he undressed and put on the pajamas digby had loaned him he should have been jubilant he had survived an incredibly dangerous flight given crucial intelligence to the british and seen the information save the lives of hundreds of airmen but the loss of bartys aircraft and the grief on digbys face reminded harald of arne who had given his life for this and poul kirke and the other danes who had been arrested and would almost certainly be executed for their parts in the triumph and all he could feel was sadness he looked out of the window dawn was breaking he drew the flimsy yellow curtains across the little window and got into bed he lay there unable to sleep feeling bad after a while karen came in she too was wearing borrowed pajamas with the sleeves and the trousers rolled to shorten them her face was solemn without speaking she climbed into bed next to him he held her warm body in his arms she pressed her face into his shoulder and began to cry he did not ask why he felt sure she had been having the same thoughts as he she cried herself to sleep in his arms after a while he drifted into a doze when he opened his eyes again the sun was shining through the thin curtains he gazed in wonderment at the girl in his arms he had often daydreamed about sleeping with her but he had never foreseen it quite like this he could feel her knees and one hip that dug into his thigh and something soft against his chest that he thought might be a breast he watched her face as she slept studying her lips her chin her reddish eyelashes her eyebrows he felt as if his heart would burst with love eventually she opened her eyes she smiled at him and said hello my darling then she kissed him after a while they made love three days later hermia mount appeared harald and karen walked into a pub near the palace of westminster expecting to meet digby and there she was sitting at a table with a gin and tonic in front of her but how did you get home harald asked her last time we saw you you were hitting detective constable jespersen over the head with your suitcase there was so much confusion at kirstenslot that i was able to slip away before anyone noticed me hermia said i walked into copenhagen under cover of darkness and reached the city at sunrise then i came out the way i had gone in copenhagen to bornholm by ferry then a fishing boat across to sweden and a plane from stockholm karen said im sure it wasnt as easy as you make it sound hermia shrugged it was nothing compared with your ordeal what a journey im very proud of you all said digby though harald thought by the fond look on his face that he was especially proud of hermia digby looked at his watch and now we have an appointment with winston churchill an air raid warning sounded as they were crossing whitehall so they met the prime minister in the underground complex known as the cabinet war rooms churchill sat at a small desk in a cramped office on the wall behind him was a largescale map of europe a single bed covered with a green quilt stood against one wall he was dressed in a chalkstripe suit and had taken off the jacket but he looked immaculate so youre the lass who flew the north sea in a tiger moth he said to karen shaking her left hand a hornet moth she corrected him the tiger moth was an open aircraft i think we might have frozen to death in a tiger moth ah yes of course he turned to harald and youre the lad who invented the bomber stream one of those ideas that came out of a discussion he said with some embarrassment thats not the way i heard the story but your modesty does you credit churchill turned to hermia and you organized the whole thing madam youre worth two men thank you sir she said although harald could tell by her wry smile that she did not think that was much of a compliment with your help we have forced hitler to withdraw hundreds of fighter aircraft from the russian front and bring them back for the defense of the fatherland and partly thanks to that success it may interest you to know that i have today signed a cobelligerency pact with the union of soviet socialist republics britain no longer stands alone we have as an ally one of the worlds greatest powers russia may be bowed but she is by no means beaten my god said hermia digby murmured it will be in tomorrows papers and what are you two young people thinking of doing next churchill asked id like to join the raf harald said immediately learn to fly properly then help to free my country churchill turned to karen and you something similar im sure they wont let me be a pilot even though i can fly much better than harald but id like to join the womens air force if there is one well said the prime minister we have an alternative to suggest to you harald was surprised churchill nodded to hermia who said we want you both to go back to denmark it was the one thing harald had not been expecting go back hermia went on first wed send you on a training coursequite long six months youd learn radio operation the use of codes handling firearms and explosives and so on karen said for what purpose youd parachute into denmark equipped with radio sets weapons and false papers your task would be to start a new resistance movement to replace the nightwatchmen haralds heart beat faster it was a remarkably important job i had my heart set on flying he said but the new idea was even more excitingthough dangerous churchill intervened ive got thousands of young men who want to fly he said brusquely but so far we havent found anyone who could do what were asking of you two youre unique youre danish you know the country you speak the language as natives which you are and you have proved yourselves quite extraordinarily courageous and resourceful let me put it this way if you dont do it it wont be done it was hard to resist the force of churchills willand harald did not really want to he was being offered the chance to do what he had longed for and he was thrilled at the prospect he looked at karen what do you think wed be together she said as if that was the most important thing for her then youll go said hermia yes said harald yes said karen good said the prime minister then thats settled
