joseph kanon los alamos april a mrs rosa ortiz found the body she was used to getting up with the sun but this morning she was early too early even for mass so she took the long way cutting through the park along the alameda where mist was still rising from the old riverbed if she had been hurrying she might have missed it but as it happened she was walking slowly enjoying the first light she had not heard it rain during the night so the moisture on the trees surprised her and she stopped once to look at the shine on the leaves the sky was already a sharp cloudless blue promising heat it was when she glanced down from the sky temporarily blinded that she saw the shoes the legs were sticking out from the bushes and her first impulse was to hurry away and let him sleep it off pobrecito too drunk to come in out of the rain she thought as she passed but it was a disgrace all the same sleeping by the alameda like the indians hunched over in the plaza pretending to sell blankets then she stopped and turned around the legs were wrong twisted one on closer to the bush slowly pushed a branch aside then gasped in that second she took in the head splotched red from the blood with its mouth fixed open still trying to draw in air it was the only recognizable feature left in his face but what shocked her was his body the trousers had been pulled down below the knees exposing his genitals why mrs ortiz had not seen a man since her husband died and never one in public it seemed incomprehensible to her this exposure of flesh she clutched her shawl and in a gesture centuries old crossed herself this was what evil felt like you could feel it around you taste it in the air the ground itself might be soaked with blood spreading under her dizzy she grabbed the bush to steady herself but the branch shook its drops onto the body spattering rain on his private parts and she backed away she took little gulps of air and looked around her expecting to be attacked as if the scene before her had just happened but there was no one the noise in her head was her own breathing the alameda itself was quiet and fresh with morning the world had not noticed she hurried toward the cathedral her mind a jumble she knew she should tell the police but her english was poor and what would they think the man was anglo she could tell that from her shameful glance at his body and that might mean even more trouble perhaps it was best to say nothingno one had seen her after all someone else was bound to find him and go to the police but now she kept seeing the body in front of her naked exposed she had not even had the decency to cover him and of course god had seen her so she decided as so often in the past to talk to the priest but father bernardo was already preparing for mass when she arrived and she couldnt interrupt that so she knelt with the others and waited the congregation was small the usual group of old women draped in shawls atoning for blameless lives her neighbors must have felt that she was especially devout that morning for she prayed noisily and sometimes even seemed to sway surrounded by candles the familiar words the solid feel of her beads she began to feel calmer but the feeling of disquiet would not go away she had done nothing but now somehow she had the ache of a guilty secret why had she looked at him so long this was what bothered her most she should have turned her eyes away there was nothing so remarkable about a man not even one without a foreskin but she had never seen this before and it troubled her that in all that scene of horror this was what she had noticed no one would have to know that certainly not father bernardo she would not have to describe the body it would be enough to say she saw a dead man if she said anything at all so it was another hour before mrs ortiz approached the priest with her story and another hour after that before he telephoned the police in english and a car was dispatched by that time the dew had dried along the alameda and the day was hot sergeant oneill had never seen a corpse before there had been murders in santa fe mostly mexicans with knives solving domestic arguments but he had never been assigned one the last real murder during a jewel robbery had happened while he was fishing in the mountains so the man in the park was his first official corpse and it made him sick you all right tom chief holliday asked him while the photographers snapped pictures inevitably holliday was doc oneill nodded embarrassed hes a mess all right wheres doc ritter anyway dont you think we should cover him up chief holliday was crouched near the body turning the head with a stick hed picked up dont be so squeamishhe doesnt mind christ look at this the back of the mans head was crusted over with blood and pulp heres where he got it the face looks like decorationmaybe a few good kicks just for the hell of it oneill was writing on his pad weapon a blunt instrument what do you think blunt instrument hammer wrench could have been anything anyway it cracked his skull funny though theres not much blood around youd think to look at him he wouldnt have any left it rained last night maybe it washed away maybe no id boys find anything further along nothing theyve been checking up and down the alameda broken bushes here where we found him but thats it cant you at least shut his mouth holliday looked up and grinned not now i cant take it easy oneill once the doc gets here well haul him off you get used to it yeah no wallet i suppose keys anything not a thing great john doe for sure doc yeah holliday said distractedly turning the head back gently what about the pants what about them i mean what the hell is a guy doing in the park at night with his pants down what would anybody be doing taking a leak probably no you dont pull your pants down below your knees to take a leak holliday looked at him amused youll make detective yet tommy sounds right to me well then look a guys out at night in the park bushes hes got his pants down and his head kicked in what the hell do you think happened you mean like that guy in albuquerque we never had nothing like that here we do now pretty sight isnt it holliday said gesturing toward the mans groin looks like hes been kicked there too he moved the testicles to one side with the stick a little discolored dont you think i wouldnt know well what color are yours come to think of it maybe theyre blue too anyway they shouldnt look like this hes circumcised by the way i noticed i mean for the report oh oneill said jotting it down time of death wed better let the doc tell us that you got rigor but i dont know what effect the rain would have on that cold too last night i cant remember that far back oneill said wiping his forehead in the unexpected heat this is interesting holliday said poking tentatively at the mans mouth hes got a full plate here no teeth at all kinda young for false teeth oneill shrugged well now at least we got a motive probably isnt used to them and bit down too hard on the guys dick jesus doc by the time the coroner arrived oneill had already completed the area search shame about the rain ill get fred to look downstream just in case anything got thrown in the river like his wallet yeah if god wants to throw you a bone this week holliday said dont figure on the wallet keys though funny taking his keys what have you got here ben doc ritter said using hollidays real name been a long time since ive been called out on a murder well you tell me careful of the clothes thoughim still hoping to get some prints after the rain well i can hope we sure dont have much else john doe with his head smashed in and his pants down the coroner looked at him yeah i know sounds like that case down in albuquerque i guess the papers will be all over us but lets try to keep them out of it until i can talk to the boys down there we could use a head start youve got the whole police force out on the alameda in broad daylight and youre trying to keep this quiet youve got yourself some news here ben is what youve got i dont know what ive got except a corpse take a look at his teeth for me will you hes got a plate but not like one ive seen around here before maybe hes from back east who is he no idea clothes dont tell me anything civilian but he could be on leave maybe a tourist yeah welcome to santa fe where the old world meets the new not too many in april though usually not since the war thats for sure ill check the hotels though just in case itll give them something to do maybe hes from the hill holliday sighed dont say it but he may be holliday nodded then well have the whole fucking army breathing down our necks better call post security anyhow maybe theyve got somebody missing well ill tell you maybe post security should be checking with us instead of telling us how top secret they are and what a bunch of assholes we are besides if theyve got somebody missing well hear about itnot so easy to get lost up there i wouldnt think place is a fort meanwhile all ive got here is a john doe with a cracked skull a month ago some queer down in albuquerque gets knifed and it makes all the papers and now ive got a boy looks like he was up to the same fun and games so before i take on the us army and all the crap we usually have to take from our secret project friends i think ill have a little talk with albuquerque and see if theyd like to take this off our hands suit yourself they find the guy who did it in albuquerque not yet but maybe they havent been looking very hard so it might i dont know but im going to check it out before i tell anybody on the hill weve got a dead pansy and by the way are they looking for one i can hear them yelling now just in case though youd better do a good job on the autopsy dont want your cleaver work making us look bad up there ritter laughed anything else yeah be sure to check for any anal penetration oneill who had been standing quietly at his side looked up what do you mean holliday laughed tommy you need to have a talk with your dad someday so he can explain things then he looked down at the body still twisted and pale and dead poor son of a bitch i wonder what he did to deserve this santa fe gave its name to a railroad but the train itself stops twenty miles to the southeast at lamy a dusty town in the high desert that seemed to have been blown in by the wind and got stuck at the tracks michael connolly thought hed arrived in the middle of nowhere the train had been crowded a sea of uniforms and businessmen with travel priority and women holding children in their laps but only a few got off on the sleepy platform beyond the buildings and the jumble of pickup trucks that had come to meet the passengers there was nothing to see but scrub grass and sage until the tracks finally disappeared in the direction of the mountains the young soldier looking eagerly at each face was clearly meant for him he looked like a high school shortstop jug ears sticking out of his shaved head mr connolly he asked finally when the passengers had dwindled to an unlikely three yes sorry sir i was looking for a uniform they havent got me yet connolly said smiling im just a liaison is this really santa fe the soldier grinned it gets better help you with that he said picking up connollys suitcase were right over here the car was a ford still shiny under a blanket of dust connolly wiped his forehead glancing up at the cloudless sky nothing but blue skies huh yes sir sunny days cool nights they got weather here thats for sure best thing about it been here long connolly said getting into the car since january straight from boot not much to do but it beats overseas anything would i guess not that i wouldnt like to see some action before its all over better hurry then naw i figure the japsll hold out another year at least lets hope not it came out quickly a kind of scolding yes sir the soldier said formal again whats on the program anyway first well get you checked in at santa fe mrs mckibben will have your stuff then my orders are to get you up to the hill asap general groves wants to see you before he goes back to washington tonight is the hill a code name the soldier looked slightly puzzled i dont think so i never heard that anyway its just what everybody calls it around here i assume there is onea hill that is what they call a mesa spanish for table he said a tour guide now thats what they looked like i guessflattopped hills anyway there used to be a school there kind of a dude ranch school for rich kids i think sure doesnt look like a school now what does it look like the soldier grinned breezy again look like well if youll pardon my french like a fucking mess santa fe however was pretty the adobes which connolly had never seen seemed to draw in the sun holding its light and color like dull penumbras of a flame the narrow streets leading to the plaza were filled with american storesa woolworths a rexall drugs that had been dropped into a foreign city the people too dressed in cowboy hats and jeans looked like visitors only the mexican women wrapped in shawls and the indians nodding over their piles of tourist blankets were really at home the plaza itself was quiet a piece of spain drowsing in an endless siesta thats the palace of the governors the soldier said pointing to the long adobe building that lined one side of the square oldest government office in the country or something like that project office is right around the corner the sense of enchantment held they walked through the quiet courtyard of a small adobe house where the only sound was the travelogue splash of a fountain but america returned inside a bright cheerful woman hair piled on top of her head was busy on the phone as she arranged papers on the desk in front of her i know space is tight but hes just got to have it she covered the mouthpiece and nodded to connolly ill be with you in a sec then to the phone edith please see what you can do he just wont take no for an answer give me a call back when you hear okay yes i know bye now she smiled up at connolly without pausing for breath you must be mr connolly im dorothy mckibben welcome to santa fe she said shaking hands you certainly have picked a crazy day course theyre all crazy one way or another i had to get all this together in a hurry but i think its all here she handed him a manila envelope id ration card drivers license no names of course we just go by numbers up on the hill local stores are used to this so you shouldnt have any problem try not to get stopped for speeding thoughthe police have a fit writing out a ticket to a number youve been cleared for a white badgethat allows you into the technical area so youll be able to go anywhere ive included the army bus schedule into santa fe just in case but youll have your own car she raised an eyebrow thats pretty unusual around here so you must be important i guess she made a small laugh that said she was no stranger to importance security office will give you your housing assignment up top im sorry we couldnt find anything at fuller lodge but weve got walltowall visitors for some reason and it couldnt be helped if any of them leave of course we can reassign you right away lets see what else all mail to po box santa fe no other address you should know that mail is censored we dont like to do it but it became a security issue you get used to it censored here connolly asked she smiled dear me no im not that much of a busybody army censors offsite wouldnt be fair to have someone you know poking around in your mail and of course i know everybody of course she blushed i dont mean it that way to brag or anything its just what i do that and try to find an empty seat when the general decides to fly out of albuquerque on the spur of the moment and that means bumping somebody else wholl be madder than a hornet connolly smiled well theres a war on she smiled back youd be surprised what little ice that cuts at the airport i wish hed take the train the way he usually does but well get him on somehow and of course she would connolly looked at her surprised at how quickly hed been taken in and charmed everything about los alamos seemed disjointedthe train that stopped somewhere else this city that didnt seem to be in america and now this goodnatured competent woman who managed emigre physicists and army generals as if they were hungry customers at a church potluck supper he wondered how much she knew what she made of it all a secret project that would help win the warwas that enough was that all she needed according to his briefing there were now four thousand people at los alamos mrs mckibben had been there from the start settling them in handing out numbered identities what did she think they were doing all these people with unpronounceable names and housing problems working into the middle of the night on a hilltop now if you need anything else at all you just let me know thanks im sorry to have put you to so much trouble thats what were here for for a moment he thought he saw in her eyes the inevitable question what are you here for with your car and your wad of coupons but if she wondered she said nothing the car where do i pick it up why youve been in it that is once the motor pool assigns it to you which they will you bet i signed the papers they drove for almost an hour before they got to the long twisting road up the mesa it was graded and paved now but still had all the debris and scattered equipment of a permanent construction site bulldozers and backhoes perched at the edge of hairpin curves and halfway up they passed a car awaiting rescue one of its thinly patched tires finally done in by too many rocks and bakedover ruts once the road had all been dirt a glorified mule track for pack trips up to the school and even now it looked temporary and risky ready at any moment to be reclaimed by scrub it must be a hell of a drive at night connolly thought as he watched the soldier negotiate the curves pulling hard at the wheel an amusement park ride the landscape changed as they climbed sagebrush and stunted junipers giving way to taller pinons and alpine trees the air smelled fresh as if it had been rubbed with astringent and the bright blue sky went on forever connolly felt the alertness of higher altitude awakened from santa fes timeless nap there was traffic on the road now trucks grinding up the steep grade or jerking and halting their way back down and everything moved quickly the entire hill was on the march as they approached the east gate the activity increased cars waited to be passed through security and beyond the fence connolly could see a giant water tower and the instant city a jerrybuilt ant farm of dull green armyissue buildings quonset huts and barrack apartments they were still building it the air itself seemed obscured by dust and tangles of overhead wires noisy with construction and running motors men mostly civilians darted through the unpaved dirt streets with the quick steps of people who had somewhere to go connollys first thought was that a whole college had somehow been dropped accidentally into an army camp while santa fe dreamed on below up here in the high cool air everything was busy they passed through the tollbooth checkpoints and parked just outside the technical area a group of buildings surrounded by yet another high wiremesh fence with two strands of barbed wire running along the top connolly glanced up at the watchtowers where bored mps gazed out toward the mountains it was an indifferent concentration camp too cheerful to inspire any alarm girls in short dresses and sweaters presumably secretaries passed through the fence barely flashing badges at the young guards the two largest buildings were long barracks of offices connected by a secondstory covered passageway over the main road which gave the town its own form of grand portal it was late afternoon and buses were filling with day laborers for the trip back home down the mesa connolly noticed a busload of indian women with their stern faces and braided hair pulling away toward the gate in the most secret place in the world there was maid service connolly and his bags were deposited at the security office with lieutenant mills tall pencilthin and prematurely balding in his twenties who smiled nervously and kept glancing away as if he wanted to examine his new colleague from an angle before meeting him head on look weve got a lot to go over but general groves wants to see you right away so itll have to wait ill show you around afterward colonel lansdales away as usual so its just us and the staff of course how many altogether twentyeight military and seven civilians in g but only four of us here not a lot then well weve never had any security problems before do you have one now mills looked at him and took the bait i assume thats what youre here to find out but you havent been told me i just run the bodyguards they dont have to tell me anything who gets the guards all the top scientistsoppie fermi bethe kistiakowsky anyone considered vital to the project who needs protection outside or surveillance this time he didnt rise to it or surveillance that must make you popular the groom at every wedding connolly laughed yeah ill bet well lets see the boss whats he like anyway straight shooter mills said leading him out of the building built the pentagon in a year made this place out of nothing does drink doesnt smoke clean living no detail too small that easy huh actually hes all right this business with bruners got him spooked though so give him a little room generals are all alike just like happy families connolly smiled youve been to school here we are mind your head he said opening the door inside was a plain anteroom barely big enough for the desk and the pink middleaged woman who fluttered behind it mr connolly thank goodness youre here the generals got a plane to catch and hes been asking for you all afternoon ill just tell him but there was no need because the door behind her was opened by a big man in khaki who seemed to fill the entire doorframe absorbing the space he was not sloppyhe was tucked in as neatly as a hospital corner at inspectionbut he had the pudgy flesh of an overweight businessman and his large stomach strained at his belt there were damp patches under his arms and connolly imagined the washington summers were torture for him the overall effect was boyish like someone who had ballooned out at puberty and couldnt even now pass up a jelly doughnut but the mustache in the middle of his round soft face was surprisingly trimmed and small the borrowed look of a thin clerk good youre here connolly right yes sir he handed a sheaf of papers to the woman we havent got much time so lets not waste any ive got to catch a plane in albuquerque and its a heck of a drive getting there betty youll make sure the cars ready these are all okayed and ready to go be sure you get copies of the first two to dr oppenheimer tomorrowhes been waiting ill phone you from washington about the plumbing contracts connolly the office was simple about the size of a large dormitory room with a window looking out onto the busy main street and the tech area fence there was nothing personal on the walls just a photograph of roosevelt and a map of the country and the desk piled with folders and contracts and a picture of a woman with two little girls could have been that of any bureaucrat only the two black telephones a wartime luxury suggested any importance connolly knew instinctively that his real office in the pentagon was probably no differentplain pared down as if he were determined to remove anything that could distract him from the job in the wastepaper basket at the side of the desk connolly saw the incongruous shiny brown of a hershey bar wrapper sit down he said gesturing to the only chair please i apologize for not seeing you in washington but i was out on the road as usual they say the wars winding down but i dont see it now youve been briefed on karl bruners death yes even the sound of the name seemed to make him uncomfortable yes he said throwing a folder on the pile and resting his hands on the back of his chair first time anything like this has happened on the project terrible thing any way you look at it the question is how do we look at it sir i mean is there more here than meets the eye less do we have a problem well youve got a dead body correction the santa fe police have a dead body what weve got is a missing security officer that could be a heck of a lot more serious any idea how serious groves glared for a minute then sighed no maybe we dont even have a problem maybe it was justsomething that could happen to anyone maybe it doesnt have anything to do with the project or his being on the hill maybe but we need to be sure and were going to be he stopped and looked straight at connolly ive seen that look a million times before so dont waste it groves going off the deep end again spies under the bed paranoid in fact he said smiling a little i can almost guarantee you thats what youll hear from my friend dr oppenheimer says it to me all the time but sometimes i think roberts too trusting for his own good so where do we draw the line i cant change the way i feelsomebodys got to worry about things right from the start people here treated security like a joke theyre brilliant men im the first to say it but sometimes theyre like kidsirresponsible you know maybe even looking for a little trouble some of them used to play pranks with the mailcan you imagine that grown men they used to cut holes in the fence just to see if they could get in and out without anybody noticing grown men brilliant men so somebodys got to play principal and i guess thats me i dont care what anyone says so long as the projects safe he stopped suddenly looking a little surprised at himself for having run on im not a policeman connolly said a question i dont want a policeman tommy mcmanus tells me youre a good man and i can trust you if tommy says it thats it he doesnt know how you ended up at owi in the first place he also tells me you can snoop around without upsetting the horses that why you wanted a civilian groves smiled partly the scientists are allergic to uniforms its very important to keep things running smoothly now were coming to the end of the project ive got a lot of nervous types up heresometimes i think the smarter they are the more nervous they are you never know whats going to set them off im not going to stand for anyone running around digging up dirt that doesnt mean a thing we take care of ourselves do you know how many security incidents weve investigated since this project began over a thousand wives talking at cocktail parties about how brilliant their husbands are factory workers in tennessee bragging about their paychecks newspapermen get curious so we have to make sure they dont get too curious general i think you should know that mcmanus recommended me because ive spent the last two years in washington keeping you out of the papers thats part of my beatthe blackout on the project scientific journals everything so you understand the science groves asked curious does anybody understand the science groves looked at him a little connolly said apologetically enough to know what cant be said which is just about everything right down to the word atom anyway im familiar with the operation good then i dont have to tell you over a thousand incidents and so far not one leak and not one day of work lost this isnt going to be any different you do your job right and the scientists arent even going to know youre here whats the matter he said catching the look on connollys face general im just trying to figure out if im here because i dont know anything or because you dont want to are you trying to catch this guy or not groves raised his eyebrows thats an interesting question he said finally im not sure if somebody robbed bruner and bopped him over the head i hope the police catch him but not if it means taking five minutes away from the project its just not worth the time hate to put it like that but its the truth do you have any idea how important this is what were doing here i know you keep it out of the papers but do you know what it means we could end the war he said this calmly matteroffactly without the usual bonddrive fervor so that connolly took it as literal right now youve got thousands of boys dying every week youve got curt lemay running those bs over japan like the wrath of god we have no idea how many casualties none and the invasion will mean more and more we can stop that if we finish the work here so no i dont care if they catch one killerwe can catch millions unless it isnt just a robbery unless its about the project thats what weve got to know okay connolly said so we want to find out if his being murdered had anything to do with the hill but we dont want to bother anyone on the hill finding out groves looked at him steadily now you think youre being funny i allow one wisecrack and now youve had yours sorry i just wonder if youre giving the police a fair shake or me for that matter fair doesnt apply to you he said evenly youre working for me the police they took their own sweet time getting in touch by which time the physical evidenceif there was physical evidencedidnt amount to much and the papers already had the story thats the last thing we want luckily its still a john doe to them no connection to the hill at all you make sure it stays that way so you put a lid on it sealed for good the police will cooperate well i guess they have to theyre not even allowed up here and they still think it might have something to do with his being homosexual now thats just what i mean groves said louder suddenly where do they get that says who i do not want allegations like that going around weve never had anything like that up here and once that kind of rumor starts he trailed off blushing and connolly realized that the subject was an embarrassment for him general connolly said calmly if he was homosexual that would constitute a security risk all by itself you know that groves looked at him and sat down a kind of body sigh yes i know that but do you know what it means when you start a scare like that ive seen it happen down in miami the army goes on a queer hunt and theres no end to it youve got everybody looking over his shoulder and wondering and thats just the kind of mess im trying to avoid here he paused we dont know anything except bruner got caught with his pants down whatever that means i want you to find out but i dont want you turning the place upside down to do it theres no need to smear this mans reputation for all we know he didnt do anything more than run into some drunk mexican general can i be frank its unlikely the police are going to get anywherethey arent even being told the mans name i take it you dont want to call in the fbi are you out of your mind you do that and youve got washington all over it and ill never get anything done the fbi hasnt been allowed near this project since and i intend to keep it that way war department intelligence takes care of the manhattan district of the army corps of engineers thats enough for me except bruner was intelligence groves peered at him thats the rub isnt it thats what we cant get past he wasnt just anybody he was g i dont believe in coincidences im paranoid remember i dont know whats involved here or who else is involved i dont know whether he was a fairy or not but if he was we had no idea now that makes me worried so an outsider connolly said mcmanus said you were like a dog with a bone with a story thats reporting i havent done that in a while and thats still not being a policeman the war makes us all into something different i never met a reporter yet who didnt think hed make a better cop than a cop besides youre what ive got youre educated so you can talk to the geniuses here without getting everyone riled up youre used to the policetommy said you covered the police blotter in new york before the war if you can handle that the police in santa fe should be a piece of cake youll be official liaison to the chief there by the way we dont want them to feel were not cooperating with them and youre already briefed on the project darn few have been i might add and nobody really knows it all except robert and yourself and myself and sometimes i wonder about that connolly smiled this was about as far as groves was likely to go toward making a joke and he appreciated the effort well now at least i know what my qualifications are in spite of himself he was pleased he hadnt expected to like groves and now he found himself wanting his respect and you were available groves said bluntly there wasnt time to get anyone else up to speed i dont know what weve got on our hands here but wed better find out pdq any questions not now connolly said getting up i assume everyone in g knows i report to you mills does colonel lansdales away so you work with mills as far as anyone else is concerned youre bruners replacement as far as mills goes youre bruners replacement and youre investigating his death if you need to reach me in washington betty will always be able to find me and of course dr oppenheimer knows everything if for any reason im unavailable consider him me connolly smiled inwardly at the pairing some odd jack sprat variation so hes one of the trustworthy scientists not one of the kids grovess face grew stern dr oppenheimer is a hero it was said utterly without irony the highest accolade this spitandpolish military man knew and connolly wondered at the intensity of his feeling it seemed to have the brusque affection of old campaigners whose trench scars could never be shared he may just win this war for us and hes got enough here on his shoulders groves said standing displaying his own capable frame without having to worry about some german g going and getting himself killed bruner was german connolly said surprised i hadnt realized that well german born groves said hes american now of course or was is that usual in g i mean theres nothing in that he was fluent in both german and russian which comes in handy around here half the people on the hill are from somewhere over there theres never been a question of his loyalty if thats what you mean did you know him well lets just say i knew who he was i try to keep tabs on everybody but its impossible these days the place is just too big now lansdale always thought highly of him as i say there was never a question of his loyalty there was never a question of his being murdered either groves stopped not sure how to respond then brushed it aside youd better get started anything else no sir i appreciate your confidence one thing every reporter knows most murders dont get solved unless the wife or the husband did it i dont want you to expect too much groves looked at him i like to get started on the right foot i think we have so let me tell you exactly what i expect i expect you to get this job done no excuses which is the same thing i expect from everybody i expect the contractors to put up buildings in half the time they usually do and i expect the professors here to deliver our gadget on time so far were on schedule no leaks no trouble the only thing we cant seem to solve is getting enough water now you come back and tell me ive got nothing else to worry about and ill be the happiest man on earth i hate to worry it slows things down so you go and do that and you should know i always get what i expect connolly stared at him not sure what to make of this vaudeville turn but since groves seemed perfectly genuine in the part he saluted yes sir groves saluted back a surprisingly careless wave of the hand ill be back in a few weeks by the way he said a slight smile beginning on his face dont think my bark is worse than my bite it isnt the housing office was in one of the old school cabins dwarfed now by another huge water tank mills had arranged for him to have bruners room and connolly guessed this had violated the usual waitinglist order of things because the clerk was surly as he signed the forms nothings been done to that room he said nobody told us you better change the sheets lieutenant he said to mills can you kit him out over at housekeeping were about to close here sure hows my sundt duplex coming in your dreams bathtub row the clerk didnt even bother to answer want to translate connolly said as they went outside bathtub rows for the top brasstheyre the old buildings from the ranch school which means they were actually built for people theyre the only housing on the hill with tubs not showers so theyre considered the top of the line of course they dont get much water either so big deal sundt construction company that built a lot of the hill the housing units are named for whoever built them so youve got sundt units and morgan duplexes and mckee prefabsthose are the flattopsand pascos then youre down to trailers and huts and whatever keeps the cold out i assume bruner wasnt in a sundt mills grinned no weve got a nice dormitory room for you later walking down the dusty road with piles of sheets and towels connolly felt more than ever that hed gone back in time to school the dormitory was the familiar dull green army clapboard but the dayroom inside with its pingpong table and remington cowboy prints had an undergraduate look and the rooms were the same glorified cubicles youd find on any state campus the polished wood floor was bare reflecting light from the uncurtained windows but a curtain of sorts had been hung along the frame of the indented closet area aside from the single bed there was a small desk a reading chair a short bookcase and a hotelstandard imitation sheraton chest of drawers with a bakelite radio on top the room was almost aggressively neat as if the slightest rearrangement of the furniture would put it hopelessly out of kilter well mills said dumping the linens on the bed welcome to boys town it aint much and it sure aint home im just down the hall so i should know i thought he said nobodyd touched the room nobody has connolly opened the top drawer to see neatly folded handkerchiefs and pairs of shorts signs of life well ill let you get on with it mills said dinners in the commissarythats just beyond p building the big one with the bridge you wont have any trouble finding itjust follow the smell of grease motor pools on the other side so dont get confused workday begins at oh eight hundred but thats up to you i guess connolly continued to go through the drawer carefully moving pieces of clothing as if reluctant to disturb the dead what do we do with this stuff he asked beats me no next of kin if thats what you mean i thought youd want to go through it before we pack it up ill get you a box tomorrow i suppose we have to hold it you know as evidence it was a question but connolly was preoccupied i suppose what happened to the next of kin bruner was a german jew his parents are still thereor notas far as we know we have to assume not no other relatives in his file speaking of which im going to need but mills was already pulling a manila folder from under his arm bedtime reading he said handing it over connolly looked at him and smiled why do i get the feeling youre one step ahead of me dont worry youll catch up thats all there is connolly glanced at the file did you know him he worked in the section and he lived down the hall so yes but no did you like him mills hesitated thats some professional question he was all right thats some answer he was a hard guy to like how so he had an edge hed been through a lot and it showed he couldnt relax i suppose he was always waiting for the knock on the door a lot of the germans are like that they cant feel safe not after everything you cant blame them but it doesnt make them the life of the party either what happened to him there specifically the nazis thought he was a communist and locked him up he had a rough time was he not according to him he was a student who attended a few meetings its all in there he said pointing to the folder in the security report even the nazis couldnt make it stick so they finally let him out this was years ago when they were trying to deport the jews instead of keeping them in so they sent him to russia they took him in uhhuh and then arrested him as a german spy they were even worse than the nazis they pulled his teeth out one day at a time thats why he had the plate jesus connolly imagined the wait every morning the clang of the bolt in the door the pliers and the screams and the blood the spare clean room suddenly seemed different as if bruner had tried to live as unobtrusively as possible wanting to be passed over out of pain yeah i know when they ran out of teeth they started messing up his hands until i guess they finally decided he didnt know anything just one of their little mistakes so they got rid of him too the rest is in there its your standard refugee itinerary with the usual red tape and crooks and helping hands until one day hes drinking milkshakes in gods country and now this some life you have to feel sorry for the bastard but you didnt like him you trying to make me feel guilty no i didnt like him maybe it wasnt his fault but deep down he had no use for anybody he was the kind of guy who was always looking for some angle but good at his job loyal american and all that mills grinned yeah all that he liked it here all right but more because i think he hated everywhere else maybe it was too late for him to make friends he wasnt the kind of guy who just came by your room to have a smoke and shoot the breeze come to think of it i think this is the first time ive ever been in this room he hung out in the dayroomhe wasnt a hermit or anythingbut you never felt he was really enjoying it no close friends he may have none that i knew about how about his social life by which you mean what you think i mean i dont know mills said slowly i always thought there might be somebody but he never said anything it was none of my business it never occurred to me that it might be a man he looked up at connolly i know what the police think but there was none of that here ever are you trying to tell me its safe to use the showers mills let it pass all right what made you think he was seeing a woman or anyone his car he loved his car he was always trying to cadge extra coupons and he used to love to show it off you know offer to take people into santa fe things like that and then more and more he was off by himself so i figured he had a girlfriend somewhere how did he rate a car i thought they were oh it was his car he got it in fortytwo when you could still get them a buick and the way he took care of it it was probably as good as the day he drove it off the lot connolly looked around the room imagining the furniture as immaculate pieces of engine i should probably take a look where is it now no idea he took it down the hill saturday and neither of them came back connolly thought for a minute and now we only know where one of them is hard to lose a car though its bound to turn up someplace i dont suppose you know the local blackmarket heavyweights black market never heard of it thats one thing we leave to the police the only thing from the sound of it all right ill check it out tomorrow i suppose its registered to a code number like all the cars here mills nodded you guys like to make things easy havent you heard were the bestkept secret of the war you might even say we dont exist i know i get paid to help keep it that way so what do you do anyway mills said he caught connollys look if im allowed to ask office of war information liaison to army intelligence im a rewrite man what do you rewrite dispatches speeches news whatever the army thinks we should know for a while there we didnt have any american casualtiesonly the germans got shotbut theyve been better lately even they couldnt keep it up indefinitely you mean you write propaganda mills said intrigued ive never met anyone who did that connolly smiled no not propaganda thats big lies fake storiesthe stuff goebbels used to do we dont make anything up you couldnt these days we just look at it right make people feel better about things so they dont get discouraged we dont have heavy casualties we meet fierce resistance a german advance is a lastditch counterattack no body parts dismemberment guts hanging out just clean bullets french villages are glad to see usi think they must be too our boys do not get the syphor give it for that matter we dont mean to bomb anybody by accident so we never do the army isnt up to anything in new mexico there is no manhattan project mills stared at him surprised by the casual cynicism of the speech just a few rewrites connolly said for our own good how do you feel mills said curiously about doing that how would you mills looked away suddenly embarrassed so in a way it feels good to be back on the crime beat again connolly said lightly except im not really here mills picked up his mood towns full of people this week who arent really here if you want to do some ghost spotting though you might check out the party tonight i assume youre on a facerecognition basis with the worlds leading physicists otherwise itll be lost on you only if they look like paul muni now there youve gone and done it youre supposed to use his code name anyway eight oclock if youre interested and all things considered you should be whats the occasion they dont need a special occasion to have a party its just one long bacchanal up here on the mesa of course if they are celebrating something we dont allow them to say so connolly grinned okay maybe ill see you there later an ordinary party might be nice well ordinary for here afterward he lay on bruners bed too tired to change it his mind drifting from the file to the expressionless room around him some rooms were so inhabited with personality that their occupants refused to leave you could feel their presence like a kind of haunting but this wasnt one of them bruner had never been here but of course he had beennobody left without a trace connollys eyes moved slowly around the room perhaps the neatness itself was a clue a life all tucked in put away leaving nothing behind to give it away his things had been unremarkable a crossword puzzle bookto perfect his english or just to pass the time and a germanenglish dictionary on the desk no mail a photograph in the drawer of a couple dressed in the dated clothes of twenty years ago presumably his parents a random collection of reading books for whom the bell tolls an illustrated book of southwest indian life armed forces paperback westerns an anthology of war correspondent dispatches connolly leafed through the latter suddenly back at owi with burly prima donnas throwing tantrums over troop transport passes and scheming to go on bombing raids so their bylines would end up in collections just like this there would never be a bigger story suits a few pairs of socks and a tie rack in the closet connolly took out the empty suitcase to fill it with the folded ordinary clothes in the drawers a dopp kit with the usual brushes and razors a box of prophylactics and special denture powder a project account book with orderly rows of regular deposits only when he took out the sweaters to pack them did he find anything interestinga few pieces of indian jewelry silver and turquoise hidden in one of the folded sleeves now on the bed he held them up to the light playing with them a belt buckle inlaid with turquoise a pendant no chain links for one of those necklaces spanish cowboys wore around the crowns of their hats why jewelry bruners clothes were conservativehard to imagine him drawn to anything so flashy a present the same night he used the prophylactics anything was possible maybe he simply liked the stuff the meager bookcase suggested some interest in indians perhaps the turquoise was no more than a hobby collection like fdrs stampsbruners unexpected passion connolly imagined him taking the pieces out of the sweater at night to look at them their glow of silver and bluegreen lighting up the drab room like silas marners gold and then again maybe not he put them down on the bed and picked up the file instead what no one had mentioned was that bruner was goodlooking not conventionally pleasant but striking his high cheekbones and bush of dark hair arranged in an original angular way that drew attention to his eyes even in the file photo they had a frank direct stare that still seemed alive there was no humor in them but a kind of hard vitality that put the rest of his face in shadow nothing else not the stubble of afternoon beard covering the chin not the hollow cheeks or surprisingly full lips registered what seemed at first the pale jewish face of a hundred other photographs was now rearranged as if the sensitivity had been stamped out to leave something hard more determined connolly wondered if the extraction of the teeth had literally changed the shape of the face or simply the man who looked through it how could it be otherwise the pain must have been crippling all the worse for being repeated without end had bruner counted the teeth left wondering as his raw mouth puffed up with pain whether he could stand another day ten or had the nazis months before already beaten his face to another form connolly looked at the nose in the picture for the sideways slant of a break but it was straight and again he came back to the eyes they were so bright that for a split second he thought he could reach through to the man but the more he looked the less they seemed to say they stared without any comment at all as if simply being alive were enough connolly put the file down and covered his tired eyes with his sleeve in the end the pictures were always the same file after file had crossed his desk stories from europe not just the battle dispatches and the statistical pieces but the personal stories each one terrible each one of suffering almost unimaginable until you were lost in the scale of it all we would never recover from this unless we simply stopped listening europe seemed to him now like a vast funhouse dark and grotesque and claustrophobic you were jerked along from one startling exhibit of horror to the next rocking in alarm squirming skeletons dangled monsters leaped out horrible mechanical screams tore the air and you would never get out the stories made other stories something had happened to karl bruner who in turn became a different person which in turn made him dowhat maybe nothing but once the violence started there was no end to itevery crime reporter knew that it demanded vengeance or at least some answer an endless series of biblical begats a gun fired never stopped it kept cutting through the lives of everyone around it on and on like some unstoppableconnolly smiled to himself at the aptness of itchain reaction until it all became part of the war connolly liked the remoteness of los alamos the clean high air away from the files and reports of the world destroying itself a simple personal crime a police blotter itemnot a war an assignment out of the funhouse some time in the light but bruners face had thrown him back againanother european story he wondered why it had ended on the santa fe river connolly was late to the party and wouldnt have gone at all if mills hadnt dragged him he had needed sleep not dinner but mills had gone to the trouble of getting a table at fuller lodge and he felt he couldnt refuse better to start off on the right foot mills had said you can eat at the commissary anytime the lodge is as good as it gets here and in fact the food was good and gave him a second wind the room itself oversized and two stories high with a running balcony and a massive stone fireplace at either end looked more like the dining room of a national park lodge than the armycamp messes where most of los alamos ate every table was filled so that the room buzzed with conversation and clinking flatware connolly was surprised at how many people wore coats and ties there was clearly no dress codehe could see occasional open shirts and even some westernstyle pointed collarsbut most people were in full suits the women in bright slightly dowdy dresses saturday night at the faculty club if you want to do some scientist spotting you might start with that table over there mills said nodding his head lets see how good you are connolly glanced at a tall man his apple cheeks bellowing out with the draw on his pipe he had the white hair and gentle puckish face of a thin nordic santa claus niels bohr connolly said im impressed nicholas baker code names only please all physicists are engineers and he is mr baker ill try to remember connolly grinned who else henry farmer connolly thought for a second of the italian farmers youre catching on is he here too hes the one with mr baker connolly looked at the modest figure with thinning dark hair bent over to catch the softspoken bakers words fermi a penny for their thoughts you wouldnt understand them even if you heard them youll get used to that too how long have you been here forever since fortythree it was a lot smaller then when i first got here we only had the old school and a few buildings in the tech area one telephone line the road up the mesa was still dirt the good old days not really for the scientists maybe they were gunghoreal pioneer times for them for the rest of us it was he searched for a word quiet you felt like youd dropped right off the edge and nobody knew where you were nobody knows now mills shrugged like i say you get used to it and of course things got busier and busier so you didnt have much time to think about it i suppose its a little like overseas except nobody gets killed until now yeah until now not exactly a war casualty though was he no connolly shifted what did you do before the war lawyer is that how you ended up in security i wish i knew maybe they thought law meant law enforcement they arent famous for being logical maybe they just thought id make a rotten soldier and id be better off pushing paper somewhere criminal law estates and trusts i know boring but youd be surprised besides it makes the firm a ton of money and everybody wants to marry you he grinned they dont even notice the hair he said running his hand along his balding top but nobody did i take it connolly said gesturing toward millss bare finger not yet but wait till i make partner so meanwhile what do you do for a social life you know you have a delicate way of asking rude questions okay connolly laughed withdrawn what the hell i dont care mostly there isnt any just like any army base but i suppose theres enough going on if you look for it you dont want to go near the wivesweve had a little of that and thats always trouble the wacs are something else again we tried to keep the dormitories offlimits to single men for a while and it was the wacs who screamed bloody murder so the parties started right up again you cant blame them nobodys allowed to fraternize with the locals for security reasons so every nights prom night for the wacs theyll never be this popular again what about santa fe not much its an old town and the spanish wont even look at you albuquerques better some of the guys go on a spree there if they get a weekend pass and sometimes we have to go get them out of the tank but mostly theyre so afraid of getting a dose that they just get drunk and end up at the movies i found some prophylactics in bruners drawer did you mills looked away i dont know what that means it usually means he was sexually active one way or the other yes one way or the other christ mills said i dont know maybe he just kept them around you know the way some guys keep them in their wallets maybe but we have to assume they were used sometimes look i know what youre after but i cant help you i dont know anything about his sex life christ i cant even imagine it he never said a word i keep trying to think of something he might have said or some looki mean we worked in the same office for gods sake all this time how could you not notice something i mean what do you look for anyway he was here almost a year and i had no idea never i still cant believe it does it bother you of course it bothers me wouldnt it bother you i mean i dont care if he didnt like women thats his business he could fuck goats for all i care then why does it bother you mills paused and looked at him i guess because it means he was another person all along i never knew it i mean whats the matter with me hell of a thing not to know if youre in security dont you think he felt the glow of the drinks as they walked toward theater his body was still tired but his mind was fresh now eager to take things in everything was sharper in the cold air bright in the glare of the mounted floodlights around the tech area the whole place seemed not quite real with its dusty unnamed streets its wire fences and plain clapboard buildings it became a frontier town but backlit insubstantial the strangeness of the mesa delighted him after months in washington with its weighty masonry and stuffy rooms and routine everything here was raw and new and interesting there were still ditches in the street to catch the runoff even at this late hour lights burned in the laboratory buildings and mps walked on patrol the night air smelled of diesel and pine they heard the music even before they got to the building sawing fiddles of a western band pouring through the open doors like the soundtrack for a movie saloon the big room was as smoky and raucous as connolly expected but the cowboys were only servicemen in uniforms and bushyhaired civilians dressed up for a night on the town who had inexplicably wound up in a barn instead it was one of the oddest things he had ever seen at one end of the room on a raised stage a makeshift band of soldiers country boys all played loud accompaniment to a caller in blue jeans and a bandanna who clapped out the beat as he sang instructions to the dancers stamping feet echoed off the polished hardwood floor of the basketball court there were tables of food and punch bowls and bottles along one wall and folding chairs scattered everywhere but on the dance floor itself people talked over the music and laughed at their unfamiliarity with the steps they all seemed to be at the wrong party moving awkwardly but gamely through their paces stocky middleaged men in ties determined to be good sports and young pale men whose jeans looked as stiff and uncomfortable as a second language here and there someone executed steps with confident precision but offrhythm as if he had mastered the dance as a matter of scientific principle what should have been fluid was jerky and tentative but no one gave up and the more complicated the maneuver the more inevitable the missteps and the better they liked them the fun for these engineers of perfect measurements was not caring physics had come to a hoedown and seemed to be having a great time the room hummed with high spirits quite a party connolly said smiling wait till they really start drinking mills said he led connolly toward the drinks table where a ruddyfaced man whose hair stuck out on the sides like flaps was furiously attacking a block of ice in a zinc washtub chips flew out on the table as he drove the pick up and down careful professor mills said gott im himmel the man said you would think in such a place someone would invent a machine for this here he said handing mills a glass with ice on the rocks yes always meet mike connolly hans weber hello mr connolly youre new you must be in kistys group theres someone new every day we cant get one more person not one and for kistiakowsky they never stop coming no i work with lieutenant mills in the security office ah he said pausing to look at connolly so you replace poor karl yes he shook his head a terrible thing terrible so young and for what some wallet some pocket change how much could such a person have you knew him well no not well sometimes he was my bodyguard thats right yes bodyguard we prefer escort mills said smiling then he turned toward connolly professor weber is one of the engineers whos always given protection offsite hah protection weber said goodnaturedly snoops this time it was the protector who needed the protection what a world we are becoming so he said changing tack you like music mr connolly his intonation made mister a literal translation of herr not this screeching of cats but real music very much you play he asked eagerly no no that would be too much luck our group lost a member last year he explained and i keep trying to find a new one but no people keep coming but no one plays but you like to listen we meet on thursdays my wife likes the visitors you would be most welcome thank you id like that very much well well see how is the saying dont count the chicken before the hatching we are amateurs only but sometimes its good oh theres oppie mills said clearly looking for an excuse to begin pulling connolly away i have to introduce mike he said to weber you know how oppie likes to greet the newcomers weber smiled and moved his hand in a churning benediction circulate circulate oppenheimer was standing with his back to them talking animatedly to a colleague but when he turned to be introduced he looked at them with his full attention as if the entire evening had been arranged for this meeting connolly had seen photographs but he was unprepared for the focus of oppenheimers gaze eyes that took him in so quickly that he was enveloped in an intimacy even before he spoke oppenheimer was thin even frail so that the hollow face offered no distraction from the eyes oddly connolly thought of bruner but those eyes had simply been intense these were quick and curious behind them was a tiredness so profound that their shine seemed almost feverish he had a cigarette in one hand and a drink in the other so he had to bow his head in greeting which he managed with an ironic oriental grace his voice was low but as quick as his eyes sorry i couldnt see you earlierthere was a meeting i couldnt get out of i hear you saw the general yes and how did you find gg colorful oppenheimer laughed did he mention his bark and his bite yes as a matter of fact connolly said surprised good then you must have given him a bit of trouble he said drawing on his cigarette connolly felt the words come at him like the fast balls of a pingpong match and he saw that oppenheimer enjoyed conversation as a form of recreational sport and is it worse his bite oh yes very much so the general never lies i dont think he knows how actually the most honest man ive ever met not an ounce of guile how he copes with the washington maze i dont know but he just plunges in full steam ahead and before you know it the things done oppenheimer with his almost feline elegance might have been describing his opposite and connolly wondered again about their odd friendship with oppenheimer everything must be charm and coercion and subtle jugglingit couldnt get done otherwise maybe his was the admiration of the master politician for the effective battering ram maybe theyre so used to looking for tricks that he takes them by surprise oppenheimer enjoyed the return and smiled maybe so no doubt youve experienced a good deal of that yourself in washington how they love intrigue poisonous place connolly laughed well the airs better here but offices are pretty much the same wherever you go oppenheimer looked up at him an appreciative glance think you can find mine in the morning say seventhirty connolly raised an eyebrow oh dont let this fool you oppenheimer said raising his glass we start early here officially at eight and im afraid ive got a meeting scheduled first thing so well have to make it earlier i do apologizenot very civilized is it but janice will get you a good cup of coffeethe commissary stuff is swilland besides its really the best part of the day here wonderful for riding do you ride no just the subways the phrase was involuntary a casual signaling of the distance between his new york and the riverside drive where oppenheimer had grown up busy with lessons and parties and privilege but oppenheimer seemed not to notice thats a shame weve still got a few horses left from the ranch school and theres nothing like it in the mornings wonderful trails up the mountains all the way to the caldera well maybe someone will give you a few lessonstheres nothing to staying on i doubt ill have the time it might have been rude but oppenheimer caught it and chose to ignore it no none of us have that do we less and less but we must have some of this he said gesturing with his cigarette to the dancing or wed all get very dull i expect youll be especially busy he looked directly at connolly but well discuss all that tomorrow have another drink he turned toward the table to find his colleague still standing there waiting to continue the interrupted conversation friedrich i am so sorry let me introduce mr connolly professor eisler connolly looked up at the tall graying man with soft almost liquid eyes but after a shy nod eisler ignored him we were discussing plancks lectures oppenheimer said politely hardly anybody reads them anymore which is a pity but eisler now had all his attention again and connolly saw how much of oppenheimers charm lay in exclusionyou were so interesting there wasnt room for anyone else what could be more flattering than attention connolly wondered if the scientists fought for it like students all of them eager for their private time with him even he had felt his spirit dim slightly when the light passed to someone else and it was all done gently with flawless courtesy he had not been dismissed but released to drift he wandered slowly around the room thinking hed have one more drink before heading for bed the altitude and his sudden letdown had made him lightheaded and he worried that he had passed the point of making sense of what he saw the whole party seemed improbable the ordinary people stumbling out of time to country music had won nobel prizes the young american kid in cowboy boots might be an expert in quantum mechanics the man in the boxy suit holding a brownie might bewhat a chemist a metallurgist a mathematician the two nattily dressed gentlemen refugees from a gossipy afternoon tea party might be discussing criticalmass geometry or for that matter the real secrets of the universe nothing was farfetched here people lived in air as rarefied as the altitude and it must be just as exhilarating for them their ideas could leap from one mind to another racing with the excitement of meeting none of the usual resistance of the ordinary world the army had strung wires around them to keep the rest out and it had worked with all the bad water and dirt roads and inconvenience they lived in a state of excitement everybody was intelligent everything was possible something as ordinary as a murder victim seemed almost vulgar an unfair intrusion the band played a few foxtrots and even one faltering lindy but they were lining up another square dance when connolly got his drink warm from the liquor he stood against the wall not far from the punch bowl trying to catch a breeze from the open doors at the end of the room the vanished mills had reappeared on the dance floor linking arms with an attractive young girl and dancing with surprising ease she was looking up at him as if his prediction right she wanted to marry him next to her a formally dressed swarthy man with luxuriant eyebrows scowled in concentration connolly became fixated on the eyebrows they arched over the mans eyes like dormers tufts spilling out on top and then running off in unexpected corkscrews on the side his partner a pleasantlooking woman in a print dress and sensible shoes never looked at him but stared straight ahead a smile fixed on her face connolly began making up stories for them given another drink he could do this all night lovely isnt it she said norman bloody rockwell the scorn in the voice seemed so strong it must have been designed to provoke if she had been a man he would have heard the scrappy challenge of someone looking to pick a fight but she was looking straight ahead not really talking to him at all her voice was english throaty and fullbodied with drink she was dressed in riding boots and jodhpurs topped with a white blouse and he thought she was the first woman hed ever seen who looked right in them the trousers seemed to bend and follow the lines of her slim hips not expand them her clothes were dusty as if she had really come in from riding not dressed up in costume for the party her hair was piled up on her head like a factory workers minus the kerchief she wore glasses and as far as he could tell no makeup at all but her carelessness her indifference to what anyone thought had the effect of drawing him to the features that matteredher luxurious skin the tight lines of her body and there was the voice as he looked at her she swayed slightly and he guessed the sharp insolence had come from too much drink but the voice he sensed would never slur it would never flutter or pipe or somehow go wrong it would get more and more controlled not belligerent but impatient as if things had become so clear she couldnt understand why they werent clear to everyone else you dont like square dancing he said not knowing what else to say she looked at him for the first time do you not much well then have a drink and lets start again not much of a line was it square dancing you might as well have morris dancers bouncing up and down with their bloody bells youre english he said christ thats not much better she said and laughed of course im english so what and yes i come here often too often really no we havent met before and yes i like the pictures but im not sure i want to go sometime andwell what else what else do you say to break the ice i like to hear all the lines is that what im doing breaking the ice arent you no well perhaps youre not she said drinking sorry i get confused so youre not would you like to yes she smiled thanks but better not im a happily married woman well thats disappointing and i was just getting to know you better not do that either im mad bad and the other thingwhat was it ask anybody youre new who are you anyway michael connolly he said offering his hand and not dangerous to know he caught her expression the other thing he explained oh says you everybodys dangerous once you get to know them she looked at her glass as if what she had said had just slipped out and she needed a minute to think it over not here he said nodding to the dance looks pretty wholesome to me she laughed and stared at the dancers yes isnt it just your typical allamerican city we ought to be in the bloody saturday evening post weve got everything you could possibly want girl scouts boy scouts chess club baseball little theater groupquite a little treat they are by the wayand the victory garden ladies and she stopped sorry im ranting again arent i im supposed to watch myself anyway were a hive of activity here something for everyone to help pass the time well for the ladies that is and what do you do you mean when im not running up quilts and making jam and not asking any questions not much they encourage the wives to do some sort of job afraid well go starkers probably a lot of us work in the admin offices or teach but im not allowed to do thatno aliens please americans only in the school but so many of the children must be foreign yes funny isnt it i suppose its our values or something such as they are awfully corrupting i dont doubt and so the days fly by actually i dont mind i dont want to teach in their bloody school anyway what i do want though is another drink she said pouring one from the punch bowl oh dont worry im not a lush id hold it better if i were you neednt look like that i know im tight im not a bit proud of it if that makes you feel any better i dont care its your head in the morning its my head now if you want to know the truth god i hate getting tight i knew i would too these little town hall meetings always bring out the worst youre doing all right oh were all doing all right considering what were doing here what do you do anyway or am i not supposed to ask my husband works with bethei shouldnt even say that should i and thats all i bloody know you can imagine what it does for dinner conversation im with the security office she looked up at him as if someone had shaken her by the shoulders oh she put down her drink you might have told me youll think im always like this dont worry he said im not on duty theres no such thing the enemy never sleeps or so they say but her voice had lost its bite thats just something we put around to keep you on your toes your secrets safe with me i dont know bethe and i cant stand little theater either i dont even know your name you keep not telling it to me remember oh god hes going to be nice please dont do that i particularly wanted not to be nice tonight emma pawlowski she noted his surprise nee harris as they say in the tatler why particularly tonight i dont know bad day or something lets just leave it at that oh the hell with it she said picking up the drink and tossing it back do you really dislike it here so much actually i love it here the place i mean i just hate all the andy hardy business she said pointing to the party why come then daniel wouldnt miss it i cant think why maybe he thinks its part of the citizenship course like the bloody founding fathers he smiled at her youre feeling better again actually i feel like hell and in fact she looked pale her skin shining with sweat let me have a cigarette will you and ill just toddle along home before i say anything indiscreet well save that for next time i hope so he said lighting her cigarette she coughed a little as she blew the smoke out i didnt mean anything by that she said i know i mean its been swell but as far as im concerned if we never she stopped looking shaky you all right oh god she said stubbing out the cigarette and searching the room for the door i hate to drink and run do give my apologies to the rest of the guests she moved unsteadily away from the table are you all right he said following her but now she bolted for the door and by the time he caught up with her they were outside and she was doubled over by the side of the building retching dont watch for gods sake she said sharply choking he looked away up toward the wonderful night sky not knowing what to do it seemed wrong to stay and impolite to walk away he took out a handkerchief as he heard her heave finally when it was quiet again he turned and held the handkerchief out to her she took it without looking up god how embarrassing she said gulping now for air ive never been sick before you didnt have to stay sorry he said moving away sure youre all right now of course im not all right oh she said clutching her stomach its the altitude its not the altitude its the bloody drink she held up her head and took in a deep breath well this is awfully intimate isnt it she said laughing at herself or is it just part of the security service do you want me to find your husband no let him dance wot larks im perfectly capable of she started to move unsteadily then stopped swaying christ look as long as youre here do you have an arm that goes with that handkerchief im just down that way he took her arm and felt her lean against him as they walked slowly down the dirt road her body was warm and it trembled slightly either from the chill or from the aftereffects of being sick she said nothing as if she had to use all her concentration just to walk and in the quiet he felt more aware of her than he had before but why was everything confused up here as she leaned into him holding on to his arm they might have been a couple walking home from a dance eager to touch each other slightly tipsy from drink and the promise of sex but they werent that she was someone elses wife and in the morning with her headache she wouldnt even remember who he was this is it my sundt palace thanks im sorry no dont be she smiled wryly ive got a feeling im going to be even sorrier well youve been a gentleman now if youre really a gentleman youll forget all about this mums the word just like the looselips posters she was trying to rally but her earlier high spirits had wilted with the evening just forget you ever met me no i dont want to do that she looked up at him thanks do it though will you do you have your key what she said looking puzzled then remembered the walkinghome ritual oh no its not locked we never lock doors here she gestured around her to the isolated dark implying the fences the guards its the safest place in the world oppenheimer was as alert as hed promised and the coffee just as good his office was not much bigger than grovess but it was filled with the nesting memorabilia of someone who had come to stay connolly glanced around the room taking in the ashtrays the piece of indian pottery the files piled everywhere he wanted to linger over the photographs on the wallscolleagues from berkeley student days in gottingen but it was impossible to look at anything else while oppenheimer was in the room he sat there smoking so animated and intense that the rest receded to the flatness of a still life i suppose youll want to talk to the police first he said id appreciate your reporting back to me on that all i know is what lieutenant mills tells me so now ill have to rely on you he looked at connolly mischievously he is not i trust under suspicion himself you havent talked to the police connolly asked oppenheimer smiled you forget officially i dont exist none of us do youre among ghosts now and with the smoke floating around his gaunt face he did for a minute look like one right my mistake never mind we forget it ourselves from time to timeits difficult not existing no doubt the good general has already given you his security speech so i wont bore you by repeating it nothing must compromise the security of the project as far as thats concerned youll have our full cooperation having said that i should also say that i dont want this incident to compromise the work of the project thats just what general groves said you surprise me i felt sure hed use this as an excuse to turn the place inside out the generals a great one for looking under mattresses and peeking through keyholes and all the rest of it he seems to feel safest when no one knows anything at all he said youd say that too oppenheimer smiled again thinly and put out his cigarette well the general and i have been down this road many times before we walk a very fine line here on the one hand the project is secreteveryone understands thatbut on the other hand its success depends on the free exchange of ideas ggs original plan was to compartmentalize everything the production centers would be scattered around the country and even here the units would work on parallel but separate tracks impossible of course scientists cant work with blinders onyoud never get anywhere so we worked out one of our solomonic compromises the department heads meet once a week to discuss where we are and keep everyone in the picture and what did the general get in the bargain he smiled again and took out another cigarette oh i suppose that we still dont communicate outside you remember of course that in the solomon story they never did divide the baby but everyone saved face oppenheimer nodded anyway we do what we can to keep security the way the general likes it something like this however he trailed off to light the cigarette i dont want it used as an excuse after all the poor man wasnt killed here general groves may not like the idea of homosexuals in his armyactually i doubt very much that he believes they exist anywhere the generals an innocent in his own way but thats no reason to ignore the obvious and launch a full security investigation because youd prefer it to be something else is it obvious i was told it was oppenheimer said somewhat surprised isnt it i dont know maybe he sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose and connolly saw that behind the intensity he was already tired well certainly it would be convenient embarrassing for your officeand to think of all the departments he picked up the thought again but convenient not the end of the world it was the end for him connolly said thinking of the photograph back in his room yes it was that you think me unsympathetic i hope im not he continued rubbing the bridge of his nose closing his eyes for a moment to ease the strain we keep losing the individualits become so easy his talk drifted almost to reverie and connolly was fascinated it was like watching someone think you grow callous just to get through it he sat up pointing to one of the piles on his desk how do you separate out whats important theres algae in the water againsome of the women are complaining important it is to them conants sending a delegation from washington tomorrow and theyll want a summary which isnt ready and then a tour which is disruptive but its important to give them both somehow dr teller wants to see me and of course thats always important even when it isnt because if i dont see him hell sulk and not work and that will be important its all important and sometimes you forget just to get it all done but a lifeyes youre right thats something else again id like to help you any way i can i dont want you to think otherwise its just theres so little time to go around i appreciate that dr oppenheimer i dont want to take any more than i have to do you know how far along the germans are with their gadget no connolly said unsure where he was heading neither do i no idea we do know they have heisenberg and some of the finest scientific minds in the world we have to assume theyre working on it after all the same information is available to everyone was anyway before the war he paused for effect compartmentalized us all now we dont know but what if were running out of time right now it looks like the germans are running out of everything a year ago they said london wouldnt be bombed again and then the vs came nobody knows anything you were briefed about the gadget in washington i know but i wonder if you appreciate how very powerful it will be if the germans develop one first they could take england out of the war connolly raised his eyebrows skeptically you think not oppenheimer said i think so its a gamble we cant afford to make we have to get there first so sometimes individual thingsget lost on the one hand every little detail is important on the other hand nothing is important except the project you have to bargain one against the other all the time but a murder cant get lost can it so what sort of bargain do you want me to make with you connolly looked at him for a minute surprised to be so abruptly brought back to business or was this where oppenheimer had been going all along i want unrestricted access to all security files i want to be able to talk to anyone i think might be useful without having to clear it first my being bruners replacement makes this easy its the most natural thing in the world to talk about i want more background on the scientific details of the projectif there is a connection i need to know where to look and i want to be able to appropriate any personnelall of g if necessaryif i need them done oppenheimer said looking at him thoughtfully but surely you already have all this from general groves id like it from you oppenheimer nodded i see all right anything else whats the gossip what have people been toldwhat storys been given out and what do they think of it you cant have a murder in a small community without some sort of explanation oppenheimer brooded for a minute no i dont suppose so but theres been remarkably little talk now that you ask im not sure why possibly because he really wasnt part of the community not the work community anyway they know that he was attacked and robbed shocking especially in a town like santa fe but then you have to move on its not as if it were one of the scientists he paused dont disapprove im just trying to be truthful if it had been kisty or enrico do they know why you mean were they told he was homosexual no there was no reason for that im sure it never occurred to themit certainly never occurred to me at the time i think there was a feeling that it would be well disrespectful the poor man was already deadno need to rake his life over the coals hold him up to ridicule or the army oppenheimer frowned i dont think that entered into it we may have our moral failings but i hope were not hypocrites it was my decisioni never even considered the armys feelings in the matter i dont care what his sex life was but some people do is it a sin whats a sin but since bruner never said anything i felt we should respect that maybe he never said anything because it would have meant dishonorable discharge thats irrelevant oppenheimer snapped he was dead but he may have had associates just as vulnerable just as a sharp rap was followed by the secretarys head disembodied poking around the doorjamb youve got an eight oclock in five minutes she said right oppenheimer glanced at his watch and stood where this time b building youll need the critical assemblies notes walk with me would you oppenheimer said to connolly an apologetic command putting the cigarette in his mouth to pick up a thick folder from the desk and then he was out the door leaving connolly to trail after him i dont like where this is going oppenheimer said as they walked through the tech area nodding to people in a kind of civilian salute and i suggest you leave the poor man in peace and his friendsif he had any which i doubt you keep forgetting he was forty miles away when this happened thats not exactly slipping out behind the bushes here for a little refreshment maybe he felt he needed the distance maybe there were no opportunities here i dont know but you admit that it would be useful to find someone who does who could tell us about his life yes he said reluctantly of course i see that but how do you propose to do that go through the library cards to see who checks out andre gide connolly smiled involuntarly at the berkeley view of the world in b building they stopped in front of an open door over oppenheimers shoulder connolly could see the scientists already assembled canvas directors chairs forming an impromptu circle around a portable blackboard half the board was filled with a chalk diagram a ring of pointed arches surrounding a core like a flower folded inward a short man in a rumpled doublebreasted jacket was filling the other half with the hieroglyphics of higher mathematics numbers and squiggles as meaningless to connolly as a lost language no one turned around most of the men were wearing jackets and ties but a few in opennecked shirts sat back in the chairs legs draped casually over the arm chins resting on pointed fingers in concentration the rowdy hospitality of the dance was gone replaced by an intense quiet as if they were straining to hear not read the chalk scratching across the board connolly didnt know what he had expectedlab coats and bunsen burners and tubesbut instead he felt himself back at fordham eager and attentive waiting for father healy to begin the days assignment they were making war in a classroom but what were they actually saying inside the room seemed as closed to him as karls life i found some prophylactics in his room he must have been having sex with someone oppenheimer sighed oh how i wish this had never happened well do what you have to could i simply ask that you start at the scene of the crime as they say before you leap to conclusions and start interviewing everyone on the hill the work has to come first he said indicating the sounds of the room behind him i intend to the likelihood is he was so afraid of his secret that he went as far away as he could go before he could trust anyone with it yes thats possible except for his being afraid bruner was never afraid of anything he drew on his cigarette thinking it was probably the deviousness of it that appealed to him not a very trusting sort bruner well what did he have to be trusting about of course i suppose that came in handy in his job you found him devious i hardly knew him he said devious may be unfair he was a survivor quite literally i think were always a bit surprised to find survivors often arent very nice goes against the grain doesnt it wed like to think its the noble spirit that pulls us through when so oftenwell i sometimes think there isnt any moral quality to it at all a purely neutral act like the insects but then who are we to say dont you often wonder what you would do to survive i dont know how bruner got through it all those terrible things but it didnt make him any nicer i know its unkind of me after all that suffering but he always struck me as something of a shit the drive down from the mesa was spectacular the morning was beautiful and under the cloudless blue sky the land stretched out for miles waves of pink and brown earth dotted with clumps of pinons rolling all the way to the sangre de cristo mountains in the far distance after the busy claustrophobia of the base the country felt even larger and connollys spirits rose to meet it the minute he passed through the gate the fences and sentry boxes were behind ahead only the bright freedom of the high desert mills had told him that oppenheimer had selected the sitehed had a vacation ranch in the area about sixty miles awayand connolly wondered if this was another of those paradoxes he relished working with the smallest particles of matter in one of the most open landscapes in the world the rio grande was swollen and brown muddy with spring runoff and connolly could see in its long valley the cottonwood groves and new green fields that had drawn the first settlers in from the desert he had never been to the west before and the sheer size of it overwhelmed him but it was exhilarating not lonelyyou expanded to its scale his mind had been cluttered with a hundred questions but the sight of the country emptied it there was no brooding in this clearheaded sky the road was no better than the day before however and he lurched and bounced afraid for his new tires all the way to the outskirts of santa fe he drove around the cathedral lost in the unfamiliar streets until he found the police station in a large adobe building that resembled a western movie jail inside however everything was uptodate and all business you can call me doc holliday said everyone does sooner or later and ive got no time for the suspense now if youre going to start by dumping all over us and telling us how top secret and important you all are you can save your breath cause ive heard it all before i dont suppose youve come to tell me just who our john doe is his name iswaskarl bruner well ill be damned first time a liaison man ever told me anything usually the way we liaise around here is kind of onewayyou dont tell me anything and i get to like it a german by birth american citizen army also a cop holliday stared at him you dont say what kind of cop security officer holliday continued staring at him as if he needed time to take this in finally he said do i keep going or is this where you cut me off with all the classified horseshit im new they usually give you a hard time they dont tell me much they dont tell me much either maybe theres not much to tell but thats who he was and now that you know youll have to forget it again officially hes still a john doe now you know most of what i know whats important to me is what you know youre not trying to flatter me by any chance are you would it work holliday grinned never fails i dont suppose while youre in the mood youd like to tell me what you boys are doing up there doc well a try actually i dont give a good goddamn the only reason anybody wants to know is you wont tell him you got explosions going off up there at five oclock in the morning you can hear clear across the valley but nobodys supposed to hear them the smart money says its rockets some kind of new v i just hope you dont aim them over here one goes off and thered be a hell of a time explaining that away at the moment all weve got is a body yeah if he was security are you telling me the armys taking this over just put my feet up and have a cup of coffee and politely butt out you want some by the way he said nodding toward the hot plate behind him its cowboy coffee just boiled in the pot and tastes like shit but since were such great friends im okay thanks you still have a case to tell you the truth nobody thinks its connected to the hill anyway so you might have the only case but without a name rank and serial number lets go over what you do have who found the body mexican woman just about had a heart attack and been gibbering ever since none of it means a thing or maybe my spanish isnt what it used to be priest says shes practically living in the church now to get over the shock nothing there she found him in the morning but hed obviously been out all night how obviously rigor plus he got rained on a lot coroner estimates time of death anywhere the evening before and wont budge on getting more detailed i tried ive been assuming he was killed sometime after elevenearlier than that and you figure someone would have seen something after that it gets pretty quiet here even on the alameda state of the body consistent with that time coroner says so youve seen his report havent you not very specific is it well lets just say ritters a careful kind of guy you cant hold him to much lets just say hes incompetent whats your guess figure midnight one oclock at the outside no witnesses no signs of struggle nothing that tells us anything right rain did a good job on the site some broken branches on the bushes but that could be from falling down from the looks of it though id say he was dragged in why there wouldnt have been room for two of them there where we found him you know if theyd been together so i have to assume he was put there we did find footprints partial ones anyway thats interesting no it isnt no special marks just a standard workboot all the mexicans around here wear them just the mexicans no i didnt mean that anybody any working man connolly frowned hmm does that seem right to you theyve got dicks too connolly looked up surprised at the sharpness of it okay lets get down to it i read about the pants any evidence of anal penetration no semen no what about the park is it one of the meeting places i dont know you must youre chief of police well you know this is a quiet town im not saying were dogpatchwe know what it is you go up to taos where all the artists are or down to albuquerque and i guess youd find plenty of what youre looking for weve got a few antique dealers and sandalmakerswell one look you can see theyre covered in fairy dust but they dont bother anybody weve never had this kind of trouble honest to god i dont even know where to look you mean you havent checked the bars or anywhere someones likely to have heard something well ill make you a deal you find out where they are and ill check them out for you ill make you a deal you get your men to talk to their snitches and get them to tell you where people go at night then check it out and talk to people nice so they talk back to you and see what you can see you do that and ill forget you havent even got around to basic police work youre putting it out this guy was homosexual and then you turn around and say you havent got any here who do you think killed him then holliday stared at him offended you tell me what im telling you is weve got no problem in that park take it or leave it all right connolly said lets leave it for now but check about the bars will you ill do that now suppose we both get down off our high horses and look at what we do have such as such as another case down in albuquerque just three weeks ago same mo close enough parking lot behind one of those bars i guess youre talking about another guy caught with his pants down stabbed this time they found him behind his car who was he local businessman ran some laundries down there which is a good business since the war got going seems he met somebody in the bar and they went outside to have themselves a conversation must have been about money since he didnt have any left in his wallet when they found him all this according to the bartender hes the one found him any idea who no boys there think it was a mexican on account of the knife but they always think its a mexican so you probably cant count on that they get a description from the bartender yeah ill get you the file on it id say it was a little on the vague side though medium height medium build medium nothing course his memory isnt the best he doesnt remember anyone else being there i guess they dont have any regulars they sure havent had any sincenobodys been near the place he might have to close it the police had that idea too what about the victimany signs of sexual activity plenty at least this one got his moneys worth connolly frowned and got up to pour some coffee pacing and looking up at the ceiling as he talked as if he were thinking aloud okay so what do we have here lets reconstruct shit well lets try it a guy goes into a bar meets another guy and they go out to the parking lot to get friendly either because they took a shine to each other or because one of thems paying now what do they do for christs sake connolly no follow me for a minute what do we think happened whats the lab report you mean the semen everywhere in his mouth some on his face but nothing behind no so they got to know each other real well then one stabs the other and takes his money so we have to assume its not a lovers quarrel not with the money gone how old was the victim by the way fortyone right how old did the bartender say the other one was holliday turned over a folder cover and glanced at a sheet twenty something not under drinking age of course he wouldnt allow that not him i dont think you can go by any of this he said closing the folder with disgust no but not middleaged either clothes jeans blue shirt like i said anybody even a working man bar cater to that i dont know from the sound of it id say it was a fairly democratic place i dont think they care about your job okay so lets take this same guyyou assume its the same guy dont you lets take him and put him in our case what do you think happened youre going to make me do this arent you i think they met somewhere maybe one of those bars i dont know about that you think the towns full of maybe just sitting in the plaza anyway they meet and go down to the park and do whatever they do in the bushes then one smashes the other on the head pulls him further into the bushes takes his wallet and gets away so whats wrong with this i dont know what i dont know either but theres something lets take our boy from albuquerquelets say hes young lets say hes still in jeans and workboots and lets say he lets guys give him blow jobs probably for money in albuquerque something goes wrong maybe the guy wont pay or maybe our boys ashamed orso he meets bruner or bruner meets him and they strike a deal but why should bruner pay hes young too goodlooking theres nothing in that why do guys go to hookers okay so lets say he likes the convenience or even just likes the idea they go to the park they have sex but before they even finish our guy kills bruner takes his money keys everything steals his car is this the same guy why not finish who stops in the middle of a blow job holliday followed connolly around the room as if he were watching a court performance caught up in the story well i sure as hell never did from a woman i mean unless i was going to move on to something else right but they never did they didnt in albuquerque either remember yes but our guyd already finished maybe the other one was still hoping so why stop this time theres something were not getting here why take everything you just have to get rid of the wallet somewhere else why even bother maybe hes not real bright and the car thats just looking for trouble its not so easy to lose a car well thats where i disagree with you everybody wants a car these dayswhens the last time you saw one for sale so we put a trace on the license which it wont have anymore and check out the used lots and the black marketyeah we do have thatbut ill bet its already gone you just drive down the road to mexico and first thing you know youve got money in your pocket and keep the change hell they dont care down there if its got wheels you can grab yourself a stack of pesos but he didnt do it before and he was in a goddamn parking lot holliday was quiet well maybe its like you say he said finally but you know what that means connolly nodded somebody else did it and where does that leave us we got a victim we dont know anything about and a killer we know even less no victim no suspect fact is the albuquerque case is all weve got without that we might as well hang it up connolly leaned on the back of the chair but it doesnt fit and here i was having all this fun just like a bigcity detective holliday grinned at connolly you spend your life handing out parking tickets and then you get a real live murder and the next thing you know youre up a creek without a paddle guy says nothing fits might as well go take a vacation but its got to fit somehow look were making this too hard it could have happened just the way we said it did in the first place couldnt it he looked up calmly couldnt it connolly shrugged i guess so in fact you might even say theres no reasonno real reason anywayto think it didnt happen that way so he took the car so what maybe he needed a way home we dont know where they met maybe your man drove him all the way from albuquerque and he didnt want to hitch back you might even say its likely that it happened the way we said connolly nodded but i cant picture it oh is that some of that professional police work you were telling me about earlier the kind we dont do connolly smiled all right but i cant why the pants what do you mean why would he have his pants down why would he need to maybe they were taking turns maybe but that doesnt sound like your parkinglot guy maybe he was playing with himself its possible connolly nodded okay then why dont i believe it why cant i picture bruner doing that maybe you need to beyou know to imagine it im not if thats what youre asking i wasnt holliday said firmly then grinned might have come in handy though all things considered were flying blind here okay lets go with your story what else you want to tell me about his car fortytwo buick probably in great conditionhe loved the car apparently liked to go for drives ill get you all the numbers any point in sending the info across the border in case youre right about that to the policia wed just be spinning our wheels well hell but connolly was smiling okay so we stay home then we need to get the albuquerque police to lean on that bartender they listen to you or do you want me to pull in big guns id rather they didnt know were involved in any way ive been saving up a favor or two lets use them then ill bet the bartender can be persuaded upstanding citizen that he is any idea what else your man may have had on him other than the wallet no probably kept all his keys on one ring he was that kind of guy what kind is that neat connolly paused obsessively neat in fact you mean the kind who wouldnt want to get his knees dirty on the grass holliday said my mind is that easy huh no just one track but ill tell you something i wondered about that too why take all his stuff it doesnt fit that kind of crime i thought maybe somebody didnt want us to know who he was and you didnt not for a while anyway now we know everything holliday said wryly by the way who wants the body any family the army i guess connolly got up youll let me know about albuquerque and the bars everything no secrets here doc so far weve got nothing to be secret about how did the papers cover this holliday took a clipping from his desk oneday sensation your people tried to pull the plug but it was too late tourist killing unknown assailant police following up leads this kind of thing we could spin out for weeks around here but they got closed down after the first day if you want to do me a favor you could square it with the paper so theyll talk to me again i cant not yet any connection made to the albuquerque case not directly just the rise in crime things going to hell all over you know they got a good weeks run out of albuquerque so you cant really blame them they even had pictures of the bar no wonder business fell off but people here didnt have time to get nervous we put a patrol car on the alameda for a few nights and that was it the smart moneys on it being a drifter who passed through town and right out again headed north when the smart money last spotted him doc its nice doing business with you connolly said shaking hands and turning to go any time stores always open that reminds me connolly said turning back do you know anyone who sells indian jewelry around here are you crazy everyone sells indian jewelry around here what kind do you have in mind connolly took a handkerchief from his pocket and carefully unfolded it to display the turquoise pieces i dont want to buy any i want to get these appraised you know anything about turquoise only that most of it looks like crap youre not supposed to say that here so dont quote me but it always seems a little clunky and cheap to me what do you want to know what its worth better take it over to sonny chalmers on san francisco street most of the new places have gone out to canyon road but sonny cant be bothered to move anyway hes your man chalmers of santa fe around the corner and two blocks down howd you happen to come by the pieces belong to anyone we know doc holliday dismissed him with a wave sonny chalmers had been a boy in the last century and even now he had the slight boyish look of the perennially young something connolly guessed he had managed by conserving energy san francisco street was quiet only a few people passing in the morning light but the inside of his shop was utterly still and he scarcely looked up when the soft ping of the entrance bell broke the silence he stood behind one of the glass jewelry cases leafing through the morning paper half the store was given over to conventional jewelry the usual display of engagement rings and charm necklaces the other half to local turquoise several cases of elaborate belt buckles and bolla ties for tourists can i help you he said still not looking up i hope so i wondered if you could tell me about these pieces connolly said unwrapping the handkerchief and laying them out chalmers moved the paper aside you wish to sell them no just have them appraised chalmerss glasses hung from a chain around his neck he raised them now and peered at the turquoise oh yes very nice arent they navajo you see how fine the settings areonly the navajos work silver like this the stones are good but of course its the silver that gives them value the dine use sandstone molds you can always tell can you tell me how much theyre worth oh exactly i sold them you see connolly looked at him surprised at his luck these pieces you sold these pieces oh yes im not likely to forget them might i ask you how you came by them id be curious to know what you paid theyre not mine chief holliday said you might be able to help me appraise them are you a policeman not exactly im helping them well that sounds mysterious may i ask how chalmers said looking directly at him over his glasses its about the man who bought them do you remember him i dont know his name if thats what you mean connolly took out bruners photograph is this him chalmers nodded at the photograph yes what has he done hes dead ah connolly paused waiting for chalmers to offer more do you remember how much he paid two hundred dollars each time theyre worth two hundred dollars connolly said surprised well thats what he paid for them chalmers said the original price was higher but he was a man who liked to bargain yes he liked that he took great pleasure in that but theyre worth more i didnt say that i said thats what he paid for them it was the same each time hed pick a piecealways one of the better onesand in the end hed say ill give you two hundred for it and you took it well you dont turn down two hundred dollars lightly not since the war the tourist tradewell you see he said indicating the quiet shop one has to make a living but you didnt sell at a loss oh id never do that no indeed but theyre fine pieces he got a good price did he know anything about jewelry not a thing he bought strictly by the price tag i dont think he cared about the pieces at all of course the most expensive pieces are the best so he did very well he wasnt cheated he did come back you know but if he didnt care about them why was he buying them chalmers looked at him quizzically i assumed they were gifts for a lady theyre womens pieces oh yes you see the fineness of the settings not at all appropriate for a man the concha i suppose you could stretch a point there but the other two are definitely ladies but i gather he kept them yes do people ever buy these as an investment these yes ordinarily no turquoise isnt a fine gemstone theres a lot of it around and i have to say the tourist trade has devalued it the indians just stamp these out now and who can blame them no one seems to know the difference but a piece like this he held one up look at the workmanship youre not likely to see this sort of thing again therell always be a market for this but why not diamonds or rubies or something connolly said half to himself perhaps it was his price range chalmers said trying to help you cant get really firstclass stones not really firstclass for two hundred dollars turquoise is something else these are top of the line how long ago did he buy them the first last fall sometime before christmas anyway because he came in again at christmas and the last a little after that i can tell you exactly if you give me a few minutes please chalmers brought out a black account book and leafed through the pages yes heres one ill jot down the dates for you if its important he said taking out a piece of paper november well i wasnt far off he made a note was he the poor boy who was killed in the park he said not looking up connolly said nothing a terrible thing so young and you think it might have something to do with the jewelry he asked gently frankly no but we need to check everything its a lot of money yes i wondered about that too he had all that money and yet he didnt seem the type of course since the war he paid in cash yes always in cash is that usual usual at that price in santa fe no indeed still i must say it was a convenience not having to wait for a check to clear but you didnt think there was anything wrong chalmers looked up at him wrong there is never anything wrong with cash my friend where he got it was his business not mine he wasnt a gangster not that i could see maybe he gambled maybe he sold tires on the black market maybe he just preferred cashsome people do i dont ask customers for bank references when theyre handing me cash i didnt know he would be killed i didnt say he was no you didnt but who else could it be maybe that explains it carrying all that cash and to think of such things in santa ferobberies in broad daylight we assume it happened at night connolly said we dont know it was robbery he may have been meeting a friend he held the jewelers gaze the store was now very quiet chalmers stared back at him then spoke slowly and distinctly as if he were using a code he did not want connolly to misunderstand perhaps but ive never heard of such meetings not there in santa fe friends see each other in their houses in private it would be a shame to have anything disturb that people get along because they keep to themselves you wouldnt want to disturb that peace not here at first he didnt recognize her she was walking toward him across the plaza still dressed in the blouse and riding pants of the night before but with her hair down now swaying lazily behind her and her face partially hidden by sunglasses she was carrying a few books under one arm leaving the other to keep time with her long stride and stopped short when she saw him on the curb oh god its you she said now i dont even have time to think what to say i just hopedyou know a few days and youd forget he looked at her not saying anything and she took off her sunglasses as if he needed to complete the identification dont tell me you have forgotten hard to think which would be worse emma he smiled yes i know how are you feeling not too bad considering look i am sorry i dont know what got into me you must thinkwell i dont know what you must think quite an introduction being sick all over you no you kept your distance dont worry about it thats something anyway how does one apologize do i send round flowers or something believe it or not ive never done that before you could have lunch with me a bit early or is that a line no its an invitation i hate eating alone she looked at him for a minute all right i could do with some eggs been to la fonda yet oh i forgot youve just arrived better see it then come on she said turning to her left its just up the street they say its the best hotel in town which wouldnt be hard they also say the barmans a spyyou know one of your lot fbi or whatever youre calling yourselves these days is he a good bartender at least i suppose so actually hes probably just some nice little man everybody looking and pointing and putting their hands over their mouthsprobably doesnt have the faintest idea almost worth it to stick around after the war to see if he does go back to washington or just keeps wiping down the bar they had huevos rancheros at a table near the window flooded with sun where will you go after the war connolly said you mean wheres home london i suppose it really depends on danielmy husband maybe hell stay here assuming theres anything to stay for i dont know he could go back to the cavendish but perish that why its the best lab in england yes and think of all those lovely sunday lunches on the maddingly road dreary old dons and watery sprouts and one glass of bad sherry sounds like im obsessed with drink doesnt it sounds like youd need it there youre right not blighty then where but your husbands not english he is now by marriage anyway you mean the name he was polish a polish jew thats twice nothing now so hell have to be english wont he where did you meet in berlin he was at the kwi she answered his unspoken question sorry i forgot youre not an engineer kaiser wilhelm institute he worked with lise meitner connolly raised his eyebrows appreciatively yes hes quite a boy she said look did you ask me to lunch to talk about my husband im not fishing but i could think of a hundred more flattering things such as well you could say you wish i didnt have one for a start does it matter yes she said evenly he looked back at her at least we have that established deftly too i hope you noticed i dont miss much then dont miss that i suppose thats by way of letting me down gently she smiled is there such a thing look im a hopeless flirt i cant help it i was brought up that way we all were in my set here i am now being blinded by this light and still hung over and i wouldnt dream of picking up these sunglasses it wouldnt be polite to the man you see but youll have to settle for the charm it doesnt go any further got it its just eggs you know he said gesturing to the plate its never just eggs now tell me about you thats not even subtle he said smiling tell me anyway what did you do before the war newspaperman in new york real news or agony aunt or what i guess you could call it real news city desk police blotter nothing very special and after the war you just take up where you left off finished with the eggs he lit a cigarette sure but wheres that you spend most of the war wanting to get back before you realize it wont be there anymore itll be something else but you dont know what so you just wait it out she looked at him thoughtfully lighting her own cigarette they dont think that on the hill she said finally theyre having the time of their lives up there and that bothers you no i envy them theyre not filling in time and wondering whats next youve got that right theyve no idea how boring it is for the rest of us while they beaver away then she brightened still theyre happy daniels happy so youre jealous of the project bloody stupid isnt it no im glad for himits what he was meant to do theyre making history oppie keeps saying so anyway you cant ask more than that i just wish i knew what i was meant to do she stubbed out the cigarette with some of her old fierceness so what do you do while youre waiting for the call she looked at him then laughed ill have to watch you you catch me out making a fool of myself and i dont mind why is that do you think maybe i dont scare easily oh scare thats what it is then ive always wondered i thought it was my charm that sent them all packing but not you no ill stick around i give you that after last night i thought id seen the last of you dont apologize again weve done that so we have whats next then i wish you werent married weve done that too look id better go lets get the bill now im scaring you im sorry i was just being cute dont run offhere look ill stay on my side of the table i still have to go i thought you were going to show me santa fe she laughed youve seen it she stopped and looked at him as if trying to make up her mind about something i tell you what though if you really want to see somethingthe country i meani was just on my way to a friends ranch out past tesuque you could come along would that interest you yes he paused if i ask you something will you answer me honestly no would it interest you honestly well if memory serves darling you boys in g are rolling in coupons and im always running out it was your car i had in mind honestly they drove north on the tesuque road past old adobes settled in cottonwood groves shady and cool but when the outskirts of town were behind them the landscape opened up again miles of country stretching off to the jemez mountains on their left he stared straight ahead concentrating on the road but he could feel her next to him one leg pulled up away from him on the seat as she blew smoke out the window she was leaning back her sunglasses on against the glare of the day he couldnt tell whether she had her eyes open but he imagined them closed so he could take her in with quick side glances without her knowing he could smell her skin i thought you werent allowed to fraternize with the locals he said oh hannahs different the project used her ranch before they built all the housing they had us stashed all over the place in the early days before the fences went up so she was your landlady emma laughed well a landlady i never thought of her in that way youll see what i mean when you meet her a local character hm but not local she lives in los angeles something or other in the moviessets here shes an artist quite a good one too actually daniel and i kipped in her studiothe others were in the main house so i spent my first few weeks here surrounded by corn corn the vegetable she laughed again yes maize giant ears of it on these whacking great canvases she calls it her corn series says she spent two years living in corn i can well imagine anyway so did we at least for a few weeks in some ways it was my favorite time here i think thats when i really fell in love with the place all this space she lent us her horses and you could ride for hours and not see a soul i thought it was about as far from england as you could get and thats what you wanted oh no one wants to get away like the english unless youre one of those who dont want to go anywhere at all i couldnt wait to get away and this she said opening her hand to the view you can breathe here but your familys still in england yes i couldnt wait to get away from them either still i suppose its a bit hard on themi mean they havent a clue box santa fe thats all they know it cant possibly mean anything to them were not supposed to make any reference to the place or the work or anything really so what do they think youre doing here havent the faintest they know i go riding and they know daniels a scientist but since that doesnt make sense theyve probably given it up as a puzzle of course mothers been puzzled for years she just rattles around this barn of a house while my father drills the locals in some awful home guard practice and everybodys happy in their own dotty way god its lovely to be here brothers or sisters you can read my file you know yes two sisters thoroughly satisfactory deb balls good marriages dogsthe lot which leaves you yes im not satisfactory at all youre delighted to say she glanced over at him and nodded im delighted to say anything else i should know better save something for another day you can peel me away like an onion he grinned at her its a turn of phrase dear she said nothing more after a few more miles they took a right up a dirt road that paralleled the base of the sangre de cristo mountains how big is this place not very hannahs got horses but its not a working ranch you need thousands of acres for that she started with just the adobe and then added the studio and the stables when she could put the money together shes been here on and off for ten years or so how did she end up in hollywood well actually she ended up here she started there she left germany early in thirtyfourthere was a whole group that went straight from ufa to california i dont know how she got here you could ask her is everyone around here foreign careful i didnt mean you i know sometimes it does seem that way doesnt it packing us all away here odd they should have picked a place that doesnt look american though dont you think i mean youve got all these expats thinking americas like spain no not spain she said slowing down ive been there its nothing like that awful place of course there was a war on which didnt help what were you doing there driving an ambulance or something mostly just sitting around hating the place lots of little men strutting about like stout cortez you cant imagine the dreariness of it not like here at all why spain oh i dont know it was the thing to do like some finishing school for english girls the unsatisfactory ones anyway all sorts of us went outyou know fight the good fight against fascism and take a spanish lover into the bargain he looked at her interested but not you i didnt say that i just said they werent my cup of tea maybe its the mustachestoo silly im glad i shaved youd have made a hit with hannah she loves a big mustache wellshe giggledbig everything wait till you see hector her husband her foreman hand lover according to everybody hes big hm they should have called him ajax i love the way the mexicans use these classical names anyway hes strong as an oxhe can move anything hes got a construction job on the hill now that shes closing the ranch and hannah claims shes heartbroken she dotes on him but he wont go to los angeles i dont know maybe it suits them both hannah says hes an aztec god but then she treats him like a servant i cant imagine what they talk about maybe they dont im fond of hannah but every time i see them together i have to laugh they look like one of those adverts for sex clubs in berlin the things you know connolly said but in fact she was rightthe odd pairing was almost comically sexual hannah turned out to be a slim petite woman still wearing the shortcropped bangs of the s as if she had just stepped off pabsts set next to her bending over a tub of mud was a large mexican stripped to the waist his back rippling as he stirred the wet earth with a paddle when he stood up at the sound of the car and wiped his forehead his frame seemed a wall of muscle ladders had been placed on the side of the house and two indian women entirely covered in long skirts were applying the wet mud to the walls smoothing it over with their hands in long regular strokes they moved with a sure unbroken rhythm practiced for centuries against this background hector seemed even more a primitive figure a builder of ancient cities emma the woman shouted happily extending her arms you came her voice was german deep and thickened by years of smoke but not at all heavy it seemed to float instead with an ironic playfulness just in time for the last coat you see my enjaradoras she said pointing to the indian women hector found them at acoma arent they wonderful so smooth look at the walklike new hello hannah emma said embracing her quickly ive brought a friend actually he brought me michael connolly hannah beckman hannah held up her muddy hands and bowed in greeting forgive me she said smiling at him today im a worker i couldnt resistthe feel of the earth on your hands is something wonderful i wanted to build my own house just like the three little pigs yes she wiped her hands on a cloth neither hector nor the indian women paid any attention they continued plastering the wall their faces grave and impassive hannah took a cigarette out of her jacket pocket but i am so glad you came i thought i would not see you before i left how is danielhes well busy ah thats good yes well its good for him then its good for you my darling so she said glancing at emmas pants you came to ride and ive sent all the horses away now youll be disappointed no i came to see you we cant stay long isnt it early to be plastering what could i do next month is better but i have this week pray for me appease the gods she looked up no rain please so hannahs house can dry but the day was hot and clear and she spoke as if she knew luck was running her way the house was a large square adobe with a haciendastyle overhanging porch decorated with long ristras of dried chiles in the bright sun the old tan walls had faded to the color of buckskin accented by the traditional skyblue paint around the door frame and windows the wet mud would dry smoothly without a crack but why go to the bother if youre shutting up the house emma said cant it wait till you come back and when is that no you see the cracks from the winter if you protect the bricks they last forever if not she left the consequences to their imaginations it must be done before the storms come in july so better now while hector will still come youre filling his pockets with gold up there maybe hell never come back she spoke as if he were not there in front of them come well have some tea but first come watch my enjaradoras you see how they measure the layer their hands tell them not too thin but not too thick or it will fall off they feel the mud and they know theyre great sculptors these women and everything they make is from the earth think of itearth and water and straw thats all buildings of earth paintings of sand ah but you disapprove mr connolly i can tell she turned to emma he thinks im being a romantic not at all connolly said i was wondering how often this needs to be donethe walls hannah laughed you see i was right a pragmatist every few years she said to him depending on the severity of the winters so not so very different from painting an ordinary house but think what it means you take the earth and build it all over againyour work is in the house not some cosmetic not a max factor connolly smiled except for the blue eye shadow he said nodding to the window frames yes the blue keeps the evil spirits away everyone knows that she said lightly why blue because of turquoise its odd you should say that hannah said the navajos believe that turquoise keeps evil spirits away but these doorwaysthese came from the moors they brought the custom with them when they took spain so its nothing to do with the indians at all but bluethe same in both cases its odd yes maybe it has an appeal for desert people he said a feel for the sky something like that hannah beamed well a romantic after all quite a catch emma it neednt have meant anythinga turn of phrase with nothing impliedbut connolly was pleased that emma let it stand uncorrected it was only a moment but he took in it the furtive pleasure of conspiracy hector i must give our guests some tea she said taking emma by the arm shall i make some for you later i need to finish up the flashings on the canales he said in flat unaccented english that slid into quickly inflected spanish he nodded to emma and connolly his only greeting and returned to his work as you wish hannah said her arm still linked in emmas as they walked toward the house you see she said leaning her head toward emma hes angry with me should i be pleased i dont think so but youve gone away before emma said yes but this is different the straw on the camel nonsense hell be here when you come back he always is well always hannah said dubiously nothing is forever my darling just the bricks people have to move on i think you know this will be the end of hector why go then emma said as they entered the house my new master they dont like these long vacations at fox on the lot every day what can i do no more freelance mr zanuck says i have responsibilities now yes sir she raised her hand in a mock salute so i obey the good soldier you emma said he doesnt know what hes letting himself in for the wide center hall with two rooms off each side was cool and dim but it led to a large open room in the back that ran the entire length of the house bordering the patio it was an artificial room clearly made by combining several smaller ones and its whitewashed walls were hannahs art gallery filled with large vivid canvases she painted in closeup over the fireplace connolly noticed two paintings from the corn series massive abstract ears of multicolored kernels but there were other subjects as welldesert landscapes still lifes of chiles an adobe wall lined with morning glories so like the actual courtyard wall outside that it made a trompe loeil effect in the room there were large terracotta jars on the tile floor and the geometric colors of indian rugs single lowlying shelves held found objectsa rusty farm tool little piles of pink rocks nothing was out of place it was one of those rooms entirely arranged to serve an aesthetic the tea was ready so quickly that connolly guessed she kept a kettle always near the boil it was served incongruously in pretty meissen cups floral and delicate in the severe southwestern room like some gap in taste she could not leave behind it was different before of course hannah said at paramount they didnt care well maybe they did but they didnt say when mr da silva was therebuddy da silva she said rolling his name so appropriate you know my buddy she lowered her voice to imitate the song and laughed you could come and go there they appreciated the artists at paramount from the first think of von sternberg what they put up with from him such behavior but now its a mess nobody knows anything before it was marlene now betty hutton it was time to go hannah youve been complaining about hollywood for as long as ive known you emma said yes well thats not so long is it no it was different before i was different perhaps so now i go to design musicals boost morale make mr zanuck happy she said smiling and will that be any better but my darling hannah said laughing think of the money they have so much money now why not take some if i stay on the lot and keep everyone happy i can come back here for good just paint and paint and paint and let them tapdance until they fall over you wont emma said you love it there no hannah said seriously now i love the money besides its finished for me there europe is finished they used to call me for the european touch they would say it just like that hannah give it the european touch what is that now a bomb shelter rubble no no more europe here i think its too serious now this is a country of children she glanced at connolly oh my country too but now its for children mr zanuck and his polo friends i dont think he wants that european touch what does he want emma said now hannah replied her mood light again havana nightclubs palm trees girls more girls so now we go to havana for a while and have fun and then i come home to paint youre really going there emma said no no hannah said they dont want to go to havana just the nightclubs its always the same nightclub i went to ciros they have a long staircase there you stop at the top when you enter you stop at the top on your way out two appearances you see all the producers go there so they see my set and they say yes this is a nightclub wonderful hannahs done it again maybe now ill have the ciros touch connolly watched them as they smoked and talked a quicksilver flow of gossip and saw that for emma it was like leafing through some colorful magazine of the outside world selznicks divorce the mad sets dali designed for spellbound which selznick was making because of his own psychoanalysis brecht who never washed thomas mann who had recreated his berlin apartment in santa monica the difficulty of photographing veronica lake without making her look foreshortened all messages from that world far from the mesa where no one worked behind barbed wire and worried about algae in the water where you could talk about anything but what did she make of it and as he watched her he realized with a start that she was watching him and that hannah was aware of them both they talked around himhe didnt have to say a wordbut emma would glance over at him secretly to see what he thought his expression conversation enough he became in some curious way their audience without either of them addressing him directly the talk was as ephemeral as column filler and after a while he felt that neither of them was really paying attention emma because she was caught up in some disturbance he caused hannah because she was watching a drama play out he felt like someone brought home to dinner on approval and wondered if emma regretted bringing him now that it was his approval she seemed to care about when he lit a cigarette she was alert to the sound of the match and when he looked at her through the smoke she flinched involuntarily as if she felt him touching her it was hannah who rescued them but enough of this foolishness she said standing you must think im selfish mr connolly talking only of myself like this im afraid emmas to blameshe likes to listen to me and you know i cant resist that i dont see many people now you must tell me about you he works up on the hill emma said protectively before connolly could answer here let me help you with the washingup ah then i mustnt ask any more so all my chattering its just as well i know the rules emma told you maybe that some of your colleagues lived here at the beginning with the scientists no questions emma was collecting teacups and made no move to correct her so connolly said that must have been frustrating for me not at all hannah said gaily i love secrets and everyone was so charming how is professor weissmann does he still play chess with dr eisler and that funny boy from new jersey with the nice wife i never see them anymore emma said everyones scattered busy i never see you anymore come to that its like people you meet on holiday and then lose touch not you my darling here you are coming to see me off to havana and now you want to play hausfrau very well heres mine too you wash up and go be nice to hector say nice things about me and ill show your friend the ranch and say nice things about you emma glanced at her disconcerted that wont take long she said that depends on how much he wants to know you see that im a terrible gossip she said to connolly would you like that very much he said smiling emma holding a cup in each hand gave a helpless shrug do be back for supper surprisingly hannah leaned on his arm as they walked slowly toward the corral not saying anything an old couple even the silence seemed an unearned intimacy she wants me to like you she said finally they had reached the corral and stood at the fence looking west toward the mountains do you me it doesnt matter she likes you look i dont want you to think ssh she put her finger to her lips its all right sometimes you know its easier to say something to a stranger do you mind if i say something to you he looked at her expectantly be careful with her ive been worried lately i knew something was troubling hernow i see it was you youre mistaken no we can be honest with each other like strangers i can see that yourewell in love whats that something for the nightclubs a fantasy yes something for the children no involved with her thats something too you know you cant help it either i see you watch her all the time do i connolly said trapped now in her premise wanting to see where it would go she smiled of course thats why im saying this to you i think you can be good for her at first i thought it was the boredom something to do the same way she studies those indians but now i see its more with emma its always something more you know she cant be casual so you cannot be casual either my friend dont hurt her she deserves to be happy everyone deserves to be happy do you think so such an american idea no not everyone but this time yes she patted his arm so make her happy shes in love with her husband ach she said waving her hand dismissively dont be foolish shes in love with her own heroism she got him out thats why she married him out of germany yes out of germany where else she didnt tell you it was the only way he could leavebecome a british citizen she married him to save his life theyre still married yes its as i say never casual she had an impulse she does a wonderful thing for him a favor a political act even except with emma everything is personal not political so then does she live with that for the rest of her life evidently she follows him to america to this camp she plays hausfrau while he goes to the laboratory she studies her indians anasazi she pronounced each syllable of the word a foreignlanguage joke is that a life for her so stubborn this marriagewhat is it some duty i used to ask myself this now maybe youll give us the answer he felt as if he had been pulled down a rabbit hole between past and future his leg held in the grasp of her internal logic to contradict her now seemed itself illogical like alice he began to doubt his own sense of things and let go to follow his curiosity she didnt know what she was talking about she might be right he must have been staring at her because now she patted his arm again and said yes but not today eh enough from this busybody you think but you dont say you are polite not angry i hope neither i just dont know what to say she sighed then that is the best answer they began to walk back toward the house you are right of course how can we know anything we can only meet our destiny and then we know do you really believe that he said eager to change the subject oh yes of course im a great believer in destiny all germans are maybe that will make it easier for them when their destiny arrives now that those idiots have destroyed them they dont seem finished yet a death rattle my friend they are destroyed there will be no germany left at the end nothing at least it will be the end of the gangsters too she tossed her head as if to shake off her somber mood but that is what weve been working for yes you with your work me with my palm trees the end of the gangsters but if that was their destiny all along he said sparring she smiled at him that is what makes destiny so interesting sometimes it needs a little push emma was waiting for them at the house visibly anxious to be off hector was now on the roof and she stood alone by the new wet wall which glistened in the drying sun im glad you came to see my land hannah said to connolly this is my whole country now but you have to leave it emma said joining them ill come back i have nowhere else to go hollywood is not a placeyou cant live there this is a place cant you find someone to live here emma said then at least you wouldnt have to send the horses away no its better this way i dont want other people here you come once in a while and be my caretaker you always know where the key is she said looking directly at emma anytime then i wont worry emma flustered simply nodded her head i dont mind friends hannah said to connolly its the idea of strangers i dont like but you had people here before connolly said hannah looked at him puzzled at his interest well i couldnt refuse then robert asked me robert oppenheimer yes robert asked all the oldtimers we all knew him you see what could we do some army man said it was our patriotic dutyyou know they talk like thatbut robert he was clever he just said he needed a favor and you know hes charming no one could refuse him id forgotten he had a ranch here connolly said backing off yes in the mountains for years he loved to ride in those days does he still you havent seen him no one has he never comes here is he still up on the hill or is that one of your classified questions connolly shrugged well then i dont ask but if you do see him somewhere give him my regards he should take care of his health that one and tell him that were still waiting to hear what it was all about making history he said oo la that sounds important but what kind of history eh anyway never mind about history my darling she said to emma giving her a goodbye kiss on her cheek be happy she shook connollys hand and you good luck with your destiny and yours he said smiling oh dont worry about me she said i have the ciros touch emma asked to drive back to santa fe and he was surprised to find her inexperienced coming up fast on curves and then jerking the clutch at the last minute as if she were pulling on reins he was by now so used to her selfassurance that this inadequacy behind the wheel seemed touching an opening she held the wheel tightly afraid the car would bolt sorry she said after an audible moan from the gears i havent got the hang of this one yet she spoke straight ahead to the road unable to switch her concentration its all right its stiff no its not but thanks how did you like hannah she seemed to think wed known each other for some time did she i wonder why what did you say to her i didnt get a word in edgewise emma grinned yes she can be like that i wish shed listen to hector though theres something wrong there he was positively churlish hes usually rather sweet in a way i dont believe it no really but he seemed all on edge somethings happened the bustup maybe oh dont laugh i know theyre an odd couple still its sad to see any couple come to an end they suited each other in a way he felt for an instant that now they were a couple falling aimlessly into a postmortem after dinner with friends what way now youre going to be impossible i dont knowthe way people do theres no explaining it no she glanced over at him quickly then looked back to the road she said you married your husband to get him out of germany did she emma said nervously i married him he got out of germany theyre not necessarily connected not necessarily she was quiet for a minute avoiding the conversation anyway what does hannah know about it she said concluding an argument i thought maybe youd told her i didnt its her imagination maybe shes intuitive maybe youre not a very good intelligence officer do you always believe the first thing you hear when i want to well dont she downshifted flustered what else did she have to say not much this and that and germany and destiny quite a chat very gloomy and wagnerian hannah she laughed you must bring out something in her she doesnt usually get much further than louella parsons louella o parsons what do you think the o stands for are you trying to change the subject trying all right how about banks what do you mean is there a bank in santa fe everyone uses where do you go for instance she laughed thats certainly changing it i dont go anywhere were not allowed to have accounts offsite what do you do keep it in a sock under the bed theres not very much to keep for a start what there is we keep in a post account i suppose everyone does why do you want to know so if you made a large cash purchase youd have to withdraw the money from this account i mean you wouldnt write a check no cash i suppose if it were a lot youd get a money order from the post office except i never do it always just goes somehow connolly was quiet for a minute thinking now may i ask why she said i was just wondering why anybody would carry a lot of cash when a check is so much easier not anybody you mean karl dont you she said her voice suddenly tight they said he was robbed is that why he was carrying a lot of money i dont know are you she hesitated the police no he said easily but naturally were curious too naturally i didnt realize you knew him everybody knew him he was security theres no escaping you did you like him she seemed surprised by the question at a loss he was all right i suppose she said finally so you werent tempted by his coupons what you said before that g had lots of coupons did i quite the elephant arent you no i wasnt tempted by his bloody coupons just mine she sat back in the seat smiling involuntarily just yours well thats something anyway maybe next time itll be for the pleasure of my company is there going to be a next time isnt there he said quietly she turned to look at him i dont know she said seriously dont ask me okay i dont know when she changed cars in santa fe she shook his hand nervously and tried a casual goodbye but since they were both heading back to the hill she didnt leave him after all he followed her car up to the parajito plateau watching her glance into the rearview mirror as she spurted ahead then waited for him to catch up darting along the empty desert road like birds from the mesa in a courtship flight she drove fast carelessly ignoring the speed limit but he trailed smoothly in her wake close enough to keep eye contact in the mirror until finally she laughed and waved and allowing herself to be pursued they drove together mills was uncharacteristically official about getting bruners account records wed need some kind of order he said they have the same legal protection as real bank records would we cant just how long would it take to get them mills sighed about an hour but bruners account was no different from his passbook as orderly as his room had been connolly scanned the even columns month after month of regular deposits with no significant withdrawals when he compared them to the payroll records he found himself staring at an unrevealing window into bruners life once he deducted the subsidized rent from his salary he was left with the account deposit and the same amount of pocket money each time look at this he said to mills did he have any expenses well karl was close with a dollar he never grabbed a check if he could help it but this goes all the way back to fortyfour at the most a tendollar variance here and there clothes probably mills said what about his car that can get pretty extravagant these days he fiddled that how fiddled whenever he needed gas hed sign up for escort dutyyou know taking the scientists aroundand hed top up from the motor pool supply repairs same thing he was like that what exactly are you looking for anyway three twohundreddollar withdrawals in the last six months mills whistled youre kidding where did karl get that kind of money thats what i want to know according to these he saved everything so where did he get the extra money he hasnt touched this account in over a year maybe he had it from before maybe then why not bank it the europeans are funny that way some of them dont trust banks at all they just stash the money or put it into gold or something they can carry you know refugee stuff maybe he brought something over with him and then sold it no why do that and turn around and buy something else what did he buy turquoise jewelry karl thats what i thought mills was quiet for a minute then he must have been trying to hide it how do you mean keep it off the books put it somewhere you couldnt trace it you know sew it in your jacket lining to cross the border that kind of stuff youve been seeing too many movies connolly said maybe but they did it they werent allowed to take anything out professor webers wife had her earrings ripped out on the train connolly winced another european story okay but where did he get it he didnt deposit it but somebody must have taken it out tell you what lets have a look at all the records are you kidding do you know how many people we have up here over four thousand but not all of them have accounts and we can eliminate the crews and the enlisted menin fact anyone making less than two thousand dollars a year they wouldnt have that kind of money lying around that ought to bring it down to a few hundred at most this will take weeks then the sooner you get started the better i get started we both get started six hundred bucks shouldnt be too hard to find assuming its someone with an account assuming they took the money out assuming its someone up here assuming all that i didnt know we were assuming it was someone on the hill mills said pointedly were not were looking for six hundred dollars and this is somewhere to start you can eliminate all the women too mills looked up at him so thats where youre going you think karl would do that what would have happened to him if hed been exposed as homosexual hed have been discharged so hed want to keep it very quiet then wouldnt he anyone like him would hed understand that he knew what that felt like what if he wasnt the only one up here who needed to keep things quiet what if he thought that might bewell an opportunity is that so farfetched mills nodded not very nice but not farfetched i guess so you think karl was putting the bite on someone lets just say he sounds capable of it for all i know the money was a present maybe he had a boyfriend maybe theres no connection at all but we have a general whod rather not know a director who doesnt want to know and a police force that wouldnt know if you showed them cause theyre too busy pretending everyones buster crabbe so wed better start somewhere you want to get the records youre going to need oppies okay on this getting karls account is one thing but my friend eddie over there isnt going to turn the whole goddamn project over thats pretty personal stuff youre talking about people arent going to like us sniffing around their money hell i dont like it dont tell them then you dont make enough to be so touchy connolly said smiling i just mean its personal thats all suddenly the windows shook as the sound of a blast came up from the west what the hell was that kistys group explosives they use some of the lower canyons around the plateau for testing he grinned as another blast sounded in the distance you get used to it how do you keep bombs a secret when you keep shooting them off these are just the triggers and how do you test them if you dont explode them they used to do it at night but everybody complained no sleep as far away as santa fe or so they said i dont know who we think were fooling all of the people all of the time yeah another explosion went off as mills turned to go now for the quiet life of a bank examiner the records when they finally arrived with oppies warning to keep the audit secret proved more absorbing than connolly expected he had imagined tracing tedious columns of numbers but instead the whole complexity of daily life at los alamos seemed to lie there undeciphered spread across their desks like messages in code to understand the savings he needed mills to explain the expenses paychecks were cashed at the commissary supplies purchased at the px some expenses were fixed rents pegged to annual salaries a month at at etc utilities to space for a threeroom mckee but beyond that there was the sheer variety of financial livesthe thrifty savers the spenders borrowing down the hoarders who must have kept their cash since none of it appeared in the books he wondered why auditors were considered boring maybe they were simply hypnotized by the stories behind their numbers he was surprised though to see how low the amounts were they might be making history on the hill but no one was making much money two hundred dollars should leap off the page but so far it hadnt the problem with the decoding process for all its fascination was that it could take weeks they needed a smaller test group like scientists who worked down the table of elements to narrow the possibilities it was mills who came up with the morning tagging system and for the next few days they followed the same routine connolly would telephone holliday to see if the police were any further along exchanging disappointment over coffee then sit down with mills for the quick first pass files with regular deposits were immediately put on the return pile variations under a hundred dollars were given a quick glance then returned as well anything else was tagged for the afternoon when they could piece together the file with more care no longer as overwhelmed by the size of the pile to come now it was the exception pile that grew instead so that they were working out of alphabetical sequence the names often not even noticed as they looked at the number patterns a choice few where the numbers seemed puzzling went on to the small pile for further investigation but the hills privacy thought connolly was safe the names were meaningless to him it was only when he examined emmas husbands account that he felt mills might have been rightthis was personal he felt prurient like a burglar going through drawers there was nothing odd about the accounterratic deposits but marginal amountsyet he stared at the paper as if he were staring into the marriage itself did emma handle the money or did he dole out allowances why no deposit one montha celebration dinner a weekend in albuquerque did they fight did she use up her clothes coupons or wait until she had enough for a splurge but the paper typed numbers on army buff in the end told him nothing he touched it as if he could coax it to reveal something but the numbers were simply numbers and the lives were somewhere else the audit suddenly seemed foolish what did he expect any of these accounts to reveal he was looking at the financial life of the hill but the people were as unknown as ever the numbers kept their secrets why expect a connection to bruner anywhere here was a file to which he could attach a face and it told him nothing that mattered how often did they sleep together what was it like why for that matter should he care got something mills said looking up no connolly said my mind was just drifting he put the file on the stack of discards before mills could see the name and lit a cigarette you know maybe were looking at this the wrong way i told you that two days ago no i mean its not whats in here thats interesting its what isnt here mills looked at him oddly connolly smiled i guess im not making much sense no i was just thinking bruner used to say that its what isnt here just like that i remember him saying it connolly stared at him disconcerted they couldnt possibly have been talking about the same thing what had bruner meant when he asked mills thought for a minute well thats the funny thing it was just like this when he was going through the files these no security clearance karl liked to go through the files of course it was part of his job but he said it was a great way to get to know people so hed go over them and when id say you must know everything in there hed say its what isnt here just the way you did connolly was silent where do you keep them he said finally in a safe over in t oh no but he removed them so there must be a log mills nodded lets see who he checked out over the past six monthsno nine months why not a year just to play it safe okay i was being funny be convenient if we found something that matched up with one of our exception files here wouldnt it connolly said patting them a miracle anyway its something mike its a phrase it was just something to say this isnt getting us anywhere maybe but he was interested in them the least we can do is look at what interested him maybe itll tell us something about him want me to get a forklift or bring them over one by one how about just the log for now lets see if he wanted to get to know anybody real well but bruner had often been assigned to do vettinghe was one of several security officers who interviewed new employees and did updates on the othersso his initials were all over the log even using the same process of elimination theyd fixed on for the bank accounts they were facing a long list lets focus on the repeats connolly said anyone he was particularly interested in there has to be something he looked up to find mills staring at him what nothing mills said looking away what if he didnt log them out could he do that he was security he was supposed to take files nobodys going to check on him connolly considered for a minute no thats not like him how do you know you never knew him i live in his room hed log out in other words hed commit a criminal act but hed never break the rules youd be surprised ive known guys run somebody through with a knife and then wipe it clean because theyre naturally neat he wasnt like that mills said quietly scraping his chair as he stood up something bothering you lets get some air i cant think straight and i know youre not surprised connolly followed him out waiting until they were on the dusty street before he said anything mills leaned against a rough utility pole the bald spot on his head shining in the afternoon light so look im just a lawyer not some hotshot reporter maybe this is just going too fast for me first im thinking you dont know what youre looking for now you already know what you want to find is there something im missing here relax youre ahead of me am i a few days ago karl was the victim then hes queer and now hes blackmailing somebody and youre all hot to get the story its notright look i worked with this guy he wasnt my favorite drinking buddy but he was all right what are we trying to prove anyway that theres a murderer walking around up here he gestured toward the street the usual mix of trucks and jeeps churning dust technicians walking between buildings stranger things have happened i dont believe it the police dont believe it so what makes you so sure not a goddamn thing but theres something wrong with the police story theyve got karl wrong how do you mean its careless did he strike you as the kind of guy whod go in for pickups in workboots mills looked at him puzzled why workboots police found prints that seem right to you wouldnt you say he was more the fastidious type i guess mills frowned then looked away toward the old school buildings as if hed pick some answer out of the air i might have said that once now i dont know he shrugged all that time and it turns out i didnt know the first thing about him all that time he was someone else all along tell me about him then help me with this millsdont fold on me i need to know what he was like i thought youd already decided that does it make sense to you that someone who survived two prison camps would be careless with strangers well you know what they saya stiff prick has a mind of its own connolly ignored him does it make sense no but none of it does okay so he wasnt the pickup type he didnt seem to be but he was there he wasnt alone so who was it i think he met somebody mills stared at him again you mean somebody from up here maybe then why go to santa fe i dont know connolly thought for a minute you said he liked surveillance detail was he covering someone that day no you sure sure it was his day off you can check the signup sheet i remember because we were shorthanded that weekend and i asked him but he begged off what happens when youre shorthanded mills shrugged they go without cover not the priority list oppenheimer fermitheres a group that always have a bodyguard or they dont leave the project the others we do spot covers the whole point is that they dont know when theyre covered so they have to assume they are it works all right nobodys been kidnapped yet congratulations or had any trouble theyre not the kind they go on hikes you know picnics family stuff once in a while a dinner at la fonda you dont seriously think it was one of the scientists why not that would explain the money theyre the only ones here making more than six grand a year two hundred bucks would be a big piece of change for anyone else no mills said shaking his head its ridiculous theyre professors pointyheads half the time theyre up there somewhere in the clouds anyway not down here with the rest of us theyre not he searched for a word violent i mean thats the last thing they are connolly smiled theyre making a bomb theyre not though theyre solving a problem thats how they see it thats some trick connolly said okay so they dont go around knocking people over the head but we dont know why he was hit people do some unlikely things when theyre upset you admit at least that its possible he had a friend up here anythings possible he met somebody why not a friend then were back where we started why go to santa fe maybe they were discreet maybe they liked to meet off the hill mills shook his head god i hate this pretty soon youll have me thinking just like you do walking around here thinking is he one suspecting everybody this isnt new york you know dont go smalltown on me now connolly said youre a big boy but this is a small townthats just what it is do you know how much trouble weve had since the project started none a few kids sneaking through the fence a little hankypanky in the womens dormitory a fight now and then over in the hutments thats it it sounds crazy but this is the nicest place ive ever lived except it has one dead guy in it who was killed forty miles away but that doesnt feel right to you so now weve got a killer on the loose up here and were going to catch him by going through his bankbook aw mills said waving his hand in disgust were not thinking straight you cant get away from the money where did he get the money if his friend is so rich why was he wearing boots you got me maybe theyre not connected mills looked up to answer him and then stopped his attention drawn away they had walked back toward the tech area and now stood beside the fence sidestepping a jeep a girl in heels her white badge flapping against her sweater brushed past the mp guard her face covered in tears outside the gate she squinted into the late afternoon sun then blinded by the light walked unsteadily past them nearly knocking into mills as she went what was that mills said trouble in paradise connolly said lightly the boss yelled the boyfriend took a hike maybe its no look mills said stopping him with a hand on his shoulder somethings happened suddenly the street began to fill with people coming out of the buildings then standing around aimlessly unsure what to do as if an explosion had gone off inside some of the women hugged each other others began to move in haphazard groups toward the open area in front of the admin building anxious and listless at the same time mills went up to the guard whats going on its the presidentroosevelts dead he said not looking at them nobody said a word connolly felt winded caught by an unexpected punch he was surprised by how much he minded only the war was supposed to end not the foundation of things now what he imagined himself back in washingtonbells tolling people stupefied in their maze of offices the humming of gossip about a new order that was beginning before its time most of the people he knew there had come to washington for roosevelt measuring their lives by his successes they never expected to know anything else now the others would begin scurrying to make the town overit wasnt too soon even now for the first time since hed come to los alamos connolly missed it that nervous feeling of being at the center of things where telephones rang and everything mattered he felt suddenly marooned on a cool bright plateau looking at an inconsequential crime while the rest of the world skipped a beat they joined the others drifting toward the admin building drawn home like children after dark it was only when he saw oppenheimer appear on the steps that he realized why they had come there was a different white house here and the plain armygreen building was as central and reassuring as the one across from lafayette square there were no loudspeakers and oppenheimer barely raised his voice so that connolly missed most of what he said there would be a service on sunday he knew everyone must be shocked he knew they would carry on the presidents ideals the words faded even as he spoke them but no one looked anywhere else his face visibly troubled oppenheimer held them all with the force of his caring in washington there had been the rakish glint of roosevelts eyes his generous celebration of worldliness but here the center was held by oppies almost luminous intelligence it was his town when something went wrongthe water supply a death in the larger familythey didnt have to hear what he said it was enough to have him here connolly looked around the crowd of his new town scientists in jeans nurses and wacs and young typists with vivid red nails mps freshfaced graduate students in sweater vests and tiesyou could almost see them raising their hands in class eager to impress some were openly weeping but most people simply stood there sober after a party and then oppenheimer was finished coming down the few steps to join the crowd and people began drifting back not wanting to burden him further connolly couldnt stop watching him and oppenheimer glancing up caught his stare and looked puzzled for a moment until he placed him he was walking toward them and connolly felt oddly pleased to be singled out then embarrassed when he saw that oppie had been headed for professor weber all along well hans he said placing a hand on his shoulder a sad day weber always in motion now seemed to bubble over terrible terrible a gift to the nazis a gift oppenheimer looked at his watch its already tomorrow there friday the thirteenth dr goebbels wont even have to consult his astrologer for once a clear sign eh but robert the music what should we do should we cancel this evening it seems not respectful no by all means lets have the music oppenheimer said softly let the nazis look at their entrailswell take our signs from the music weber nodded oppenheimer in a gesture of remembering his manners turned to include connolly you know mr connolly yes forgive me i didnt see you we met at the dancing how are you getting on oppenheimer said all right i guess good you must invite him to your evening hans then to connolly all work and no playit can be a disease here theyre really quite good but i have invited him yes you remember so come im planning on it if theres room oh theres always room oppenheimer said and the cakes are even better than the music vays mir weber said putting his hand to his head johanna youll excuse me please but he went off before anyone could answer oppenheimer lit a cigarette and sucked the smoke deeply like opium he likes to help schnecken seed cake i think the music is an excuse how are you getting on slowly thanks for running interference on the files i hope theyre worth it they say bad things run in threesmaybe youll find something yet would that make three has something else happened no im anticipating its been just the opposite today otto frisch finished the critical assembly experiments with metallic u he paused looking at connolly you havent the faintest idea what im talking about have you well so much the better i probably shouldnt be talking about it in any case suffice it to say its a significant stepbest news in a week and now this no doubt theres some philosophical message in it all but im damned if i see it did you know him well the president no not very well ive met him of course but i cant say i knew him he was charming but thats beside the point which is it was his project he okayed it now its anybodys guess truman opposed it he doesnt know about it what oppenheimer smiled you know im constantly surprised at securitys being surprised when something secret is kept secret no he doesnt know nobody there knew except roosevelt and the committee and i expect hell be furious when stimson tells him what he didnt know touchy anyway connolly agreed but hes not going to pull the plug at this point how well do you really know washington this project has cost nearly two billion dollars he watched connollys eyes widen none of the men you sent to washington to spend your money knows a thing about it thats a lot of money to hide connolly said thinking about his own paltry search only roosevelt could have ordered it oppenheimer said it had to come from the top still does so youre off to washington hat in hand no oppenheimer said nothing that drastic general groves will take care of ithe knows his way around those land mines better than anybody but its he hesitated grinding out his cigarette a complication we were always racing against time and now its worse its a bad time to get a new boss it always is this is a particularly bad time can i ask you a question what if it doesnt work i never ask myself that it will because it has to because the science is there it will work the question now is what happens after that the generals will want to own it well need a whole new kind of civilian control otherwise all our work here he looked away rehearsing some talk with himself otherwise it will be a tragedy roosevelt saw that now we havewho some politician nobody ever heard of how can he be expected to make such a decision for all i know hell think its just a giant hand grenade he stopped catching himself well lets hope for the best he said looking back at connolly a little music for the soul seven oclock webers on bathtub rowjust ask anyone by the way i hope youre not looking too closely at my bank account it feels like someones going through my laundry when connolly got back to the office there was a message to call holliday i have something for you he said not even bothering to mention roosevelt most people on the hill had taken an unofficial holiday and left early we found out where your boy went that night or at least where his car went you found the bar he wasnt drinking he went to church church san isidro out on the cerrillos road a mex place what would he be doing in church he was a jew i didnt say he was praying i just said his car was parked there an alley next to the church not a parking lot exactly but people park there whats around houses a gas station no bars quiet and one of the neighbors saw him no actually one of my men you were right put out the word and you always haul something in the night of the killing he was driving past on his way to some complaint and noticed the car there didnt think anything of it until i put out the description of the car what made him notice it a fortytwo buick in a mexican neighborhood but he didnt stop theres nothing illegal about parking there figured it must be somebody visiting the church was open not for mass they dont lock churches around here this one pulls in a tourist now and then theyve got an old reredos there thats supposed to be something special at that time of night what time was it anyway nine maybe more or less hes a little fuzzy about that if you ask me he was taking his own sweet time about answering the complaint and didnt want to say so wheres the church in relation to where bruner was found well its out a ways but you go straight down cerrillos over the bridge and youre on the alameda so its the first park in that direction yes okay so he saw bruner no just the car he thought it was funny a car like that but like i said he figured it was somebody visiting you know some anglo with a girlfriend down there is there a lot of that all over the world very funny so if he didnt see him we dont know for sure he was actually there oh we know we found his blood he imagined hollidays face as he said it the jaws clamping shut in satisfaction he listened to the silence for a minute want to tell me about it theres a patch of ground near the church right under where the tile sticks out seems it never rains there so we got some dry ground with some blood on it and its burners o negative i figure its a safe assumption so bruner gets hit next to some spanish church and his body winds up in the park and his car disappears thats what it looks like i wish i could say any of it made sense well i wish you could too and while youre at it try making some sense of his pants now kinda changes things dont you think doesnt fit that kind of activity at a church would they do that there then driving him all over with his pants down no sense to it could be were sniffing around the wrong tree here you know maybe he wasnt that way at all it was your idea well ive been known to be wrong once or twice then how do you explain the pants i cant yet im just saying its a hell of a place to have sex well for that matter its a hell of a place to kill somebody but why move him the thought that occurred to me was that they didnt want him found so easy hed stick out like a sore thumb at the church but he could have been days in the park well one then why not just take him out to the country and bury him well if you get a better idea let me know you talk to the neighbors sure nada amazing how the spanish mind their business when the police come around i never knew a people for going to bed so early but why move him thats what i dont get i dont know but i tell you one thing it sure wasnt out of respect for the church perhaps people needed to be together after a death in the family or perhaps professor webers evenings were always better attended than he liked to think but his house was crowded a cluster of music stands had been set in one corner of the living room and people spilled out in groups down the hallway in a line to the kitchen where the coffee and trays of cakes were arranged on a crocheted tablecloth the air was warm and close with cigarette smoke and the overpowering scent of butter sugar and cinnamon connolly felt wrapped in the cozy sweetness of a prewar bakery and wondered for a minute where all the coupons had come from did the bachelors trade frau weber their ration books for these onceaweek memories of home the coffee smelled rich and strong but as many people held glasses as coffee cups and the hum of conversation rose and fell in the familiar lapping waves of a cocktail party pregnant women occupied the few upholstered easy chairs with friends draped on the broad arms balancing plates oppenheimer was there a martini glass in one hand his hair so short that without his hat his head seemed almost shaved he barely acknowledged connolly with a nod his wife kitty sat near him her legs curled beneath her on a sofa an ashtray in her lap but paid no attention to her husband as she stared through her smoke preoccupied with some interior conversation she had clearly ceded all hostess duties to johanna weber who bubbled all around her directing people to food and making introductions mr connolly yes my husband has told me about you im so glad you could come do you know mrs oppenheimer kitty mr connolly kitty glanced up but johanna weber had already moved him along introducing everyone in their immediate vicinity mr connolly professor weissmann his wife frieda mr connolly dr carpenter dr carpenter is visiting us this week and so it went a party trick one name following another without pause and without forgetting connolly thought she was wasted on the hill in washington she could have run one of the great houses in rock creek her mind a vast photographic file of names and connections and this is emma pawlowski she hurried on scarcely noticing that emmas back was turned to her her husband daniel connolly stopped and nodded hopelessly curious but pawlowski was a pleasantlooking young man eager to be polite who had obviously never heard of him and wanted only to resume his conversation with carpenter his skin was a scholars pale white with what seemed to be a permanent fiveoclock shadow yes weve met connolly said as emma turned around she looked oddly festive her nails and mouth vivid red her eyes shining connolly realized it was the first time he had seen her in a skirt so that she seemed overdressed as if she had put on heels and makeup for another party and landed here instead again and again she said you seem to be everywhere and then to her husband who looked mildly puzzled darling this is mr connolly i told you about or did i anyway he very kindly drove me to hannahs so you must be especially nice hes new on the hill welcome pawlowski said in the flat monotonal accent of one who had learned too many languages connolly wondered fleetingly if conrad had sounded like this both polish and english squeezed of all inflection whose unit are you with oh darling hes not a scientist hes with security or something it is security isnt it she said all innocence connolly nodded but you like music pawlowski finally said at a loss to explain him and not sure it was worth the effort no hes come to spy on us emma said playfully absolutely tonedeaf cant hear a note pawlowski looked at her then smiled gently a lovers indulgence for what he didnt understand it seemed enough that she was lovely and spirited he didnt have to keep up to admire her for it then i will have to play more loudly he said missing the joke the effect was to make him seem younger than he was a boy making his way connolly looked at his polite face and thought about the unreliability of language he had studied with meitner a man of importance at the kwi but faced with idle chat he became an awkward teenager like so many others on the hill he would have to retreat to the language of science to find his maturity johanna weber was there again a tugboat still steering him through the harbor as loudly as you like daniel never a wrong note not like hans but come some coffee mr connolly or perhaps youd like a drink emma said holding up her glass for an instant connolly wondered if that explained the shine in her eyes coffee would be fine he said and johanna weber beamed clearly pleased and took him in tow to the tall urn emma gave him a weak ironic salute with her glass here johanna weber said handing him a cup shall i get you some cake but she was distracted by a new arrival and connolly watched the party game begin all over again one accurate name following another the day had been somberthese were some of the same faces he had seen drawn and grieving in front of the admin buildingbut the party had taken on a life of its own and as each voice rose to be heard above the others the small house hummed with a kind of decorous gaiety the webers rooms were small but unlike other interiors on the hill had the settled look of lives accumulated bit by bit the heavy furniture the antimacassars the shelves of porcelain knickknacks seemed to have come out of a time machine launched when the world was solid weighted down and explained by things there were no cactuses or indian throws or anything else to suggest they had all gathered on a cool night somewhere on the parajito plateau warmed by the lamps and the yeast cakes and the smell of furniture polish they were back in old heidelberg the webers were at home dont be noble emma said coming up to him at the urn and handing him a drink instead youll want two of these in you before they start playing he took the drink and smiled past experience years of it what was that all about he said gesturing to where they had talked before jealous husband daniel no he wouldnt dream of it that was about johanna always on the qui vive she gives me the pip a gossip terrible and she doesnt have much to go on she already thinks im disreputable why he said biting into a cake consorting with the lower orders i suppose shes a fearful snob lower orders meaning me well lets just say youre not a scientist theres always a pecking order even here who else do you consort with she looked up at him then took a sip before she answered youll do for now your husband seemed nice dont what just dont god here she comes again ah mr connolly johanna weber said as if saying his name aloud sealed it in memory youre meeting people good emmas an anthropologist did she tell you yes we were just talking about the anasazi connolly said johanna weber hesitated clearly surprised fascinating isnt it she said recovering emmas become quite an expert on the subject she looked at emma to contradict her in an amateur sort of a way emma said smoothly and then frau weber was being embraced by a new arrival and they were alone again youve got a pretty good memory yourself emma said however did you remember the poor old anasazi most people cant even pronounce it anthropologist he said playfully pompous old trout everybody has to be something grand her maid is probably an indian princess and you dick tracy no darling hoover at the very least whats the j stand for anyway in j edgar connolly shrugged maybe its like the o in louella o parsons maybe theyre the same person she laughed thats a thought do you take anything seriously everything freud tells us there are no jokes does he really uhhuh of course he meant something else but i doubt he had much of a sense of humor anyway how do you know things like that who are you anyway you pick up things in the paper she looked at him appraisingly i dont think so but then youre an anthropologist he said easily quite maybe youll be my next project the mysterious mr connolly dont drop the anasazi yet that would be fickle she was quiet for a minute studying him over the rim of her glass tell me about yourself she said softly such as well who are your people as they used to say at garden parties my people my mothers dead my father works at an insurance company and spent his life doing crossword puzzles in ten minutes and resenting the fact that he worked for people who couldnt he saved everything to send me to school then what happened i went to work for the same people and now he resents me for the education he wanted himself its a very american story you like him i feel sorry for him not quite the same thing he paused yes i like him and youare you good at crosswords too he nodded i used to be in the genes maybe i like figuring things out watching them fall into place and have they no only in puzzles she stopped still staring at him when she spoke again her words seemed almost unconscious drawn out of her in a trance what are you working out now now i dont know why im here in a room full of pinheads eating cake instead of getting shot on okinawa why anybodys on okinawa in the first place what the jap pilots think about when they crash into the ships why somebody got killed in a park what are we going to do after the war he stopped looking at her why im pretending im thinking about any of this all im really trying to figure out is how i can go to bed with you she looked at him as if nothing had been said but the longer she was silent the more real the words became hanging between them like visible shapes for an instant he thought he had frightened her but he held her eyes without apology determined to play the hand through then still saying nothing she took a drink and walked away from him into the room he stared after her unable to read any expression in her movement not sure what he had done then people closed around her in the crowded room and she was gone someone at the table jostled his arm and finally distracted he looked at the rest of the room people were still eating and talking in the music corner one of the players began tuning his viola now where is hans johanna weber said to nobody in particular busy now with a new hostess assignment connolly decided to look for the bathroom before the music began the room had become even warmer and despite the chill someone had opened the door to let in the fresh night air he brushed past some smokers lining the narrow hallway and went through a halfopen door to the bedroom the bed was heaped with jackets and coats and in the corner under a desk lamp professor weber and another man were leafing through pages the room itself seemed oddly solemn a refuge from the conversation just steps away and connolly realized that the effect came from the men themselves wordlessly and gravely turning the pages of a magazine he had clearly interrupted them but weber glancing over his shoulder nodded with an automatic courtesy the bathroom connolly said through there weber said pointing to a door and then still courteous this is friedrich eisler friedrich mr connolly connolly nodded but both men returned to the magazine as if he had gone oh friedrich weber said a plaintive sound of such quiet distress that connolly stopped alarmed the room suddenly was no longer solemn but filled with the disturbance of something gone wrong connolly looked toward the open magazine life or something like itand stopped shaken he had seen combat pictures before and pictures of rubble and bodies crushed in suffering but this was something new skeletons covered with a thin layer of skin looked out at the camera through a wire fence their eyes utterly without expression some wore the blackandwhite stripes of dirty prison camp uniforms behind them bodies lay on the ground one so thin that a thighbone seemed to puncture the skin in another bodies were heaped in piles limbs at unnatural angles mouths wide open to the air connolly looked at them paralyzed children the men at the fence seemed to hang there as if they needed to hold the wire to remain upright in another picture a vast open pit was filled to overflowing with shaved heads and naked bodies everyone was dead even the ones pretending to be alive at the fence their eyes burned straight through the camera connolly wondered who had taken the pictures who had recorded not just lifeless bodies but death itself only a mechanical box should see this he imagined his finger trembling on the shutter refusing to look his eyes swam he darted from picture to picture trying to make any sense of it but the world had tilted slightly on its axis rearranging everything and it was impossible to understand anything so new another picture a ragged group of nazi guards their eyes dead too a camp entrance more piles of bodies people lying in bunks a bony arm jutting out for help but all too late even those with open eyes were already dead he could hear outside the rasp of the viola tuning and people talking and he realized that in the bedroom they had almost stopped breathing there was a shame in seeing thisthe act of witnessing made one a part of it and there was the shame of failed hopes the past few weeks had been filled with exultant news from germany the rhine crossed a city taken berlin within reach refugees marching to a somber future richly deserved since the offensive of the winter the war had taken on the pace and excitement of a long sporting match finally about to be won the world was beginning to make sense again now he saw it was too late for that too so many eisler said a low intoning we knew but we didnt know they were still oblivious to connolly but looking at the photographs had drawn him into their circle friedrich weber said they killed everybody eisler put his hand on webers shoulder glancing up at connolly connolly took him in for the first timea tall scrawny man with the pallor of laboratory duty about his face his neck stretched unnaturally high with a prominent bobbing adams apple and the slight discoloration of a birth defect to the right of his chin connolly noticed his long fingers delicate and tapering as if they had been formed or trained for precision work his hair was uncombed landing wherever it fell over his gentle face theyve won weber said almost to himself no what are you saying they killed everybody its too late dont you see all this work were too late now he shrugged in resignation just as his wife came to the door to summon him liebchen come start please its getting late she said barely sticking her head in unaware that she had trivialized the moment dutifully weber got up and shuffled out of the room leaving connolly and eisler in uncomfortable silence still holding the magazine eisler sat heavily on the bed cushioned by the heap of coats connolly stared down again at the pictures personalize the crime an old journalists trick focus on one personthat man looking through the fenceto construct the story but as he stared at the picture everyone became disembodied there were no people left just those rows of blank eyes then eisler let the magazine slide shut and he was staring at the bright color of a chesterfield ad on the back what did he mean were too late connolly said quietly for a moment he thought eisler hadnt heard but when he finally spoke his soft voice was precise as if he had been carefully considering his answer we came here to defeat the nazis soldiers you see he smiled weakly this was our way of fighting with our slide rules our tests his voice had only a trace of accent we were the little boys wearing glasses not the big ones with the boots and the armbands but we had the intelligence we could fight with this he tapped the side of his head we would build a bomb to kill all the nazis a terrible thing yes but with the nazis anything was permissible even the bomb they wanted to kill everybody and now you see they have what are we going to do now the war isnt over yet eisler looked up at him surprised at the sound of his voice and connolly realized hed been thinking aloud not talking to him at all it is for them eisler said rising slowly and handing connolly the magazine it will be over for the rest of us very soon you think perhaps they have a secret weapon a new rocket for london well its an idea convenient certainly convenient he took off his glasses and rubbed them slowly with a handkerchief if there are nazis we dont have these inconvenient moral questions but what shall we do with this bomb if there are no nazis i dont know connolly said at a loss no he said smiling none of us do sometimes i wonder what we have been thinking maybe the nazis did that to us too but you must excuse me you came to hear the music not to discusswell what do we call it outside the music had begun the precise lilting phrase of a bach partita german music eisler said ironically such beautiful music you must admit we are an extraordinary people or were connolly felt again that he was eavesdropping on someone elses conversation eisler might have been talking to weber not a stranger holding a magazine his shy face seemed to be looking elsewhere at some invisible sadness something always survives connolly said not even sure what he meant yes we survive eisler said gently opening his hand to indicate the house americans now oh i can see you think im being sentimental youre right of course thats very german too but our culture is over perhaps it had to end this waykilling ourselves very german the end of the world but now it is really over there wont be any more music you know its finished only this bomb is leftour last gift i wonder what you will do with it perhaps youll become germans too everybody can become monsters now connolly felt claustrophobic as if he had stepped into eislers selfabsorption and couldnt find his way out los alamos had struck him as some overgrown international campus everybodys project but that seemed irrelevant now to eisler the americans the hungarians the italians the whole polyglot community were simply spectators to some violent national drama if someone has to have it im glad its us he said finally the blunt pragmatism of the answer roused eisler and his faraway milky eyes gleamed with attention why because were not monsters i say we im american now too but perhaps i dont trust us quite so much once perhaps not now we have all learned to be monsters in this war i wonder are those lessons we forget i dont think so nobody ever won a war being nice fire with fire shall i tell you something i am from hamburg originally you read about the firebombing there the number of houses the docks even the casualties but what was it like most people dont want to read that the fire so high that it sucked in all the oxygen for miles you can do the calculations with slide rules so you step out of the house and your lungs collapse no escape you jump into a canal and you are boiled alive they found people trying to cross the street their feet were stuck in the melting asphalt so they just stood therescreaming i imagineuntil they burned to death thousands what difference the numbers everybody eisler glared at him as if he knew connolly had rewritten those first dispatches headlining the statistics of victory a payback for london we didnt start the war connolly said stupidly a reflex mr connolly neither did my friends in hamburg that was an english raid you know now you are splitting hairs with a vengeance tokyo was all yours that was even worse if there is such a thing what do we do now argue over degrees of terror you think there is a hierarchy of suffering connolly was quiet i dont know what point youre trying to make eisler sighed his shoulders slumping in a kind of apology forgive me please im not myself and he seemed then physically to return to his earlier manner his face growing gentle and sensitive a young boy too polite to offend when he spoke he was distracted as if he were examining his own outburst my point what was my point im sorry my point was not to disturb you i suppose only thisbe very careful when you fight monsters be careful what you become connolly held out the magazine weve never done this no eislers voice sank in defeat not that so he said reflectively they make it possible for us to make the bomb now what else will they allow us to do he hung his head for the first time since he had come to los alamos connolly felt himself an intruder he had expected the science to be over his head what went on in those barrack laboratories was some new form of alchemy too mysterious to be reduced to a set of formulas now everything that surrounded it seemed equally complicated and incomprehensible a series of questions to which there were no answers they folded back on themselves contradictory insistent then got lost in vagueness their scale as measureless as theology connolly liked a problem with a solution he liked the crossword filled in a murder explained but what was happening here left him finally overwhelmed and out of place all of themthe gentle emigre scientists the eager american kidswere living in a state of abstraction as high and remote as the plateau itself he turned toward the door and the audible sounds of the music something real people were listening politely some of them with their eyes closed nodding to the familiar notes the group was amateur but competent they approached the music with a hesitant respect but at least they didnt plow through it and the music rewarded them carrying them through difficult patches with the logical force of its own structure the music leaped the notes joined each other and rose with the lamplight to brighten the room connolly realized with some surprise that everyone already knew the pieceit was as familiar to them as a jukebox hitand he felt again oddly out of place the little boy with his face pressed against the glass but the music itself was welcoming racing along now simple at its heart and no one in the room was excluded at his cello professor weber usually bubbly was sightreading with determination so fixed on the page that he seemed unaware of anything around him next to him a young american in a busy vneck sweater played with confidence glancing up from his instrument to take the audience in when the notes began to answer each other daniel emmas daniel looked only at his violin his eyes sometimes closed in concentration his movements sure and accomplished connolly imagined him as a boy in polandwhat was that like practicing on a rainy afternoon a good boy responsible or had he been chased home by bullies his case flapping as he ran from the tram connollys imagination bounced with the staccato notes but the fact was he didnt want to imagine daniel at all a decent man a gifted scientist why go further as he brought down his bow across the strings there was a surgeons accuracythe strength was in knowing where things went not in being forceful but what did that mean that he was selfpossessed or merely that hed been trained properly all those rainy afternoons he had seemed diffident before but now connolly wondered if he had misread him and then suddenly his eyes opened and connolly had to look away embarrassed by his reverie he didnt want to know him it was safer to speculate about the others there were no consequences to that the fourth member of the quartet for instance with his bulky doublebreasted suit slavic cheekbones and pudgy fingers that grasped the bow like a lance but he couldnt imagine anything about him aside from the occasional rattle of coffee cups the room was quiet and attentive still standing against the wall connolly found himself lulled by the music the sharp rising notes had played themselves out followed now by the deep bass of a cello bridge in the slow moody interlude connollys mind went back to the magazine and then like a succession of snapshots to eislers wistful face the cocktail chat in the hall johanna webers nameremembering trick emma walking away he looked around the room trying to match faces to the faceless columns of the savings accounts theyd be offended if they knew he wished he could tell them it hadnt meant anything he wondered how many had seen the magazine the room didnt seem to be in mourning not even for the president who had brought them all here it was instead a kind of timeout an evening of friends and yeast cakes and music from before the war an evening from that culture eisler claimed had already disappeared had it in this room on bathtub row it still glowed he was so used to the placid almost dreamy faces in the room that he noticed instantly johanna webers look of quiet alarm he followed her eyes to the musicians hans weber was still staring at the sheet music but was now obviously not readingperhaps he had never needed to as he played he was listening to his own music a passage of such beautiful sadness that everything else in the room had stopped involuntary tears rolled down each of his cheeks as if the music itself were squeezing him in pain he never stopped playing his face was impassive not scrunched with emotion so that the tears seemed to come from somewhere else a sorrow so secret that he was not even aware of revealing it connolly couldnt look away a few others in the audience had now noticed and looked around in dismay the music never stoppedit seemed to grow even lovelierand the tears rolled quietly unwilled what did they imagine was wrong did weber bubbly sentimentalist frequently get carried away by the music but no one looked as if this were normal something had happened what was the protocol offer assistance pretend nothing was the matter no one moved and no one connolly saw realized this was a larger mourning beyond all courtesies they hadnt seen the magazine they didnt know he was playing for the dead the room cozy and warm now seemed stifling and connolly fought the urge to bolt he didnt want to be in europe all knickknacks and solid furniture and mistakes past repairing soon they would all choke on tears and he would suffocate then weber sensing their discomfort paused briefly wiped his face and joined in again on the next stanza right on the beat to those who had not noticed he might have been wiping away perspiration connolly saw the others relax oppenheimer across the room stared at weber in astonishment frankly curious about something he didnt understand eisler his hands at his side bowed his head only johanna weber her eyes shining with heldback tears understood that something remarkable had occurred out of either blind loyalty or a shared distress her face reached out to weber across the room ignoring the others and connolly saw that he had got her wrong so eager to notice her manners that he had missed the woman he thought suddenly that he didnt understand anyone here their sorcerers jobs and their terrible stories how many in those camps had the webers known and wouldnt it be the same if they hadnt known any the room was too close and he didnt belong here quietly he slipped through the door unnoticed with the music following him out into the night he gulped in some raw fresh air surprised at its chilly bite and looked up at the sky the stars were always wonderful in the high air of los alamos but tonight they seemed spectacularly abundant masses of them laid out for the music she was standing near the end of the building smoking a cigarette huddled in a cardigan her arms folded across her chest to keep in the warmth the weak yellow light from the window kept her face in shadow she glanced over quickly when she heard him then turned back again unsurprised for once there seemed to be no movement on the mesa no truck exhaust and grinding gears so that the music poured out of the house as if it were being played in the open air she shivered from the cold and inhaled making the end of her cigarette burn a flicker of orange it might snow this weekend she said her voice low but distinct not a whisper dont you like the music i love the music i just dont like to watch theyre sointense i cant bear it wont he notice no as his eyes adjusted to the dim light her face became clearer and he saw that she was looking directly at him the conversation a pretext for this other contact she dropped her cigarette to the ground fire hazard she said running it out with her shoe bloody fire hazard what about you she moved her head to indicate the house bored so soon no just restless she looked at him again interested i dont know he said its all over my head you seemed sure of yourself a while ago thats a hell of a thing to say to anybody i didnt say it to anybody i said it to you she was quiet just studied his face until the silence between them became a conversation finally she leaned back against the building and let him come closer what are we going to do about this she said what do you want to do he said his face close now he could feel her breath on his cold cheek i dont know she said simply her honesty a kind of provocation he leaned forward and moved her arms down to her side and when she stood there unresisting he kissed her gently pressing her against the wall tasting her dont she said but not moving away letting him kiss her again why not he said his words kisses of breath now as he moved against the hollow of her neck no good will come of it she said a catchphrase to ward off a spell yes it will he said still kissing her neck yes then she opened her mouth to him kissing him back moving her tongue with his her arms now behind him pulling him closer oh god she said whispering it wont though no good at all how do you know he said pressing against her excited it never does she buried her face in his chest never but he wasnt listening the words were a kind of chant just a rhythm instead he kissed her harder pulling her body next to his so that she could feel him it will he insisted the words some code for sex he could sense her own excitement as she twisted against him but she was pulling away catching her breath shaking herself awake no she whispered moving away from the wall and for a moment he thought he had lost her frightened her away he grabbed at her arm moving her back into the embrace but when he saw her eyes angry at his force he took his hand away and instead moved it gently down the side of her face he touched her hair as he stroked her and shivering she moved her face into his hand bending her neck calmer i want to make love to you he said she nodded he leaned forward and kissed her again gently this time since the first night she nodded again not here not on the hill i wont here she said finally where i dont know ill think of something she said quickly a conspirator ill drive you someplace he said softly kissing her again with my coupons but when he looked up her eyes seemed stricken as if she had already been found guilty of some terrible crime yes she said catching his look you can drive me someplace anywhere you like anywhere i like well go away he kissed her a reassurance but go home now okay she said no more i cant okay he said quietly and turned to go moving away from the house to the darkened street he heard the music again suddenly she caught his arm and fell against him bringing his face down youll make it all right wont you he looked at her and nodded you think youre taking an awful chance with me dont you she didnt say anything maybe im better than you think i am i dont care she said mills was waiting for him when he got home stretched out on karls narrow bed with his hands behind his head staring at nothing make yourself at home connolly said surprised to see him thanks you sure havent done much to it have you he said getting up and looking around the spare room its like old karl never left i wasnt planning on a long stay none of us do something on your mind or is this just a social call take a look mills said taking a sheet of paper out of his jacket i went over to the office before the movie stanklee tracy and nancy kelly jap spies and the panama canal i mean a little late for the canal dont you think you wonder who thinks them up connolly glanced at him cutting him short so i went back to the office to go through a few more files and this caught my eye probably nothing but you said you wanted to see anything interesting connolly was looking at the figures two withdrawals of five hundred dollars thats a lot of money who is it thats the funny part oppenheimer connolly glanced at the paper again then handed it back better keep looking thats what i thought youd say meaning nothing i just think youre under the spell i know all the signs what spell our great leader those blue eyes that lightning mind ive seen it all before mills have you been drinking i have as a matter of fact but not that much hell i dont think its him eitheri dont think its any of them i was just hoping wed stop all this bank business but out of curiosity are you going to ask him about it yes hell love that youve got guts ill say that for you questioning caesars wife except hes caesar thats something worth thinking about mills said it did snow over the weekend and the ground was covered with the dry powdery snow of the high desert when they met for the memorial service on sunday despite the cold the april sun was bright reflecting off the snow filling the morning with an unnatural glamour the flag in front of fuller lodge was at half mast and oppenheimer spoke in the theater his voice no longer filled with the hastily assembled emotion of thursday but with a more public eloquence all of los alamos it seemed had turned out for this final salute and connolly felt himself looking at them again as if they were in a lineup it was absurd all these bright wellmeaning faceshe doubted there was even a traffic violation among them he looked at the men in formal overcoats and shiny shoes dressed for a winter sundays outing in vienna some of the women wore hats there were children looking solemn oppenheimer quoted from the bhagavad gita man is a creature whose substance is faith what his faith is he is roosevelts faith the faith they all shared was a belief in a better world his voice was simple and unaffected the room was hushed could oppenheimer really be involved wouldnt caesar sacrifice anything to win but what could make karl so important to him the answer was he wasnt perhaps mills was rightonce you started you tainted everything with suspicion until no one was truly innocent there was always something even something that didnt matter that was only about itself they were chasing shadows while oppenheimer spoke connollys eyes drifted elsewhere she was sitting on the aisle three rows away her head tilted toward the stage in attention her hair was down and it caught the sheen of the snow glare through the windows her shoulders were straight and he imagined holding them warm to the touch and feeling them go slack when they moved their bodies together her skin would be cream even while he listened to the meaning of leadership the search for a better world he saw the messed bed her body barely covered by a tangled sheet her skin slick with perspiration all that fierceness dissolving in his hands wet for him and then as if she had read his thoughts she turned her head and looked at him a direct glance an intimacy that said they were already lovers it was the last thing he had expected to happen and for one quick instant he wanted to get away before it was too late just run back to washington leaving them to stew in their own unsolvable murder and impossible moral questions and affairs from whichof course she was rightno good could come but he felt the pulse of his erection and he knew he would never leave now the murder would solve itself somehow and the moral questions would drift to that limbo where they always went and he would have her again and again it was as clear and simple as that when they all stood to leave he realized with embarrassment that he was still hard and folded his coat in front of him people filed out quietly when she passed by him her husband at her side they exchanged a glance in all this somber crowd did anyone else see that her eyes were shining but no one noticed at all and he saw that the secret itself was part of the excitement for her outside they stood in small groups like people after church and to avoid looking at her again connolly found himself talking to pawlowski instead i never got a chance to tell you how much i enjoyed the music he said are you playing again this week not me im afraid pawlowski said politely but you were very good no its not that emma said cutting in daniel wont be here he has to go offsite connolly felt a prick of excitement as if she had touched him declared herself emma youre not supposed to oh darling im sorry but he is security surely its all right she said to connolly easily and while her husband said something polite about the other players doing well without him connolly looked at her for the first time do you really want this her glance said this is what it will mean the code words sex would be the beginning while he imagined those afternoons she had already seen what would come all the complications furtive and tricky and maybe even doomed like the movie japanese risking everything for worthless plans of the panama canal yes i want it he thought but it wasnt emma he got to drive that week it was oppenheimer any idea why he requested me he asked annoyed at this complication mills shrugged maybe he likes your conversation maybe he doesnt like mine anyway youll have to wear this he said holding out a gun connolly took it hesitantly he had handled guns before always with the sensation that they were about to go off christ am i actually expected to use this i thought you were a toughguy reporter thats winchell i just go to press conferences and lock my door at night you know how to use it dont you i mean you dont need a lesson or anything ill manage just remember about the safety of course youre supposed to catch the other guys bullet first so what the hell catch how by dying mostly put your body in front of oppie and do your bit for the war effort cant we send someone else you have something better to do connolly looked at him wondering for a minute whether mills suspected anything did it show this heat like some priapic blush but mills was only being sarcastic just finish the accounts okay you might give holliday a buzz hell let things slide if you dont goose him now and then where am i going by the way south to the test site i didnt know there was one they built it in december must be getting ready to do something cause theres been quite a little traffic back and forth lately try to avoid lunch if you can why its antelope enlisted men have nothing to do down there except shoot rattlesnakes and antelope and roast themthe antelope that is they say it tastes like beef but thats only because theyve had their brains bleached out in the sun it tastes like antelope how far is this place anyway about two hundred miles christ thats all day mills grinned and handed him a test site pass stamped with a large t dont forget to ask about the money in fact it was the first thing they discussed i hope you dont mind oppenheimer said as connolly started down the switchback road in the morning sunlight he was sitting in front at his request and was clearly expecting to talk this will give us a chance to catch up any progress suspects only you i beg your pardon he twisted in the passenger seat his eyebrows raised anticipating a joke why did you withdraw a thousand dollars over three months this winter oppenheimer was quiet then lit a cigarette none of your damned business if you say so i do then ill take your word for it oppenheimer looked out the passenger window and smoked finally he said you neednt do that its personal but not i suppose secret im not allowed secrets anymore im sorry i didnt mean to no youre just doing your job oppenheimer said go ahead do it what did you do with the money put it into two postal orders and sent them to an old friend who needed it why shes been under psychiatric care if you must know shes broke we call it a loan no i mean why a postal order how else we dont have checks up here you know that do you still have the receipts yes does your wife know yes he was silent again youve got a hell of a nerve you know that you authorized the search oppenheimer sighed so no good deed goes unpunished i never imagined you wanted to look at mine more fool me of course you would im the obvious person to beat someone up in the park do you ever feel embarrassed doing this connolly downshifted i dont feel great now if thats what you mean oppenheimer sighed again no of course you dont and now i should apologize for being rude which somehow makes it all my fault when you were the one asking the questions interesting how we tie ourselves up in knots isnt it well dont do it on my account look im eliminating any loose end i can i didnt mean to intrude on your personal life lets just forget it but what did you think it meant what are you looking for whats the point of it all bruner came into some money before he died he may have been blackmailing somebody he may not i want to find out where he got it and you thought he was blackmailing me what on earth about do you think theres a single thing about me the government doesnt already know maybe you should see what it feels like to be on the other side of a security check your leftwing friends your rightwing friendswell such as they are your old girlfriends your jewish friends your students an ambulance for spain was that politically motivated what did you study in germany how much do you drink do you ever feel conflicted loyalties my god does one ever not i said lets forget it bruner didnt know anything about the project i wasnt thinking of that what then he was homosexual that gets to be a pretty sensitive issue oh oppenheimer said then laughed well i have to hand it to youthats one question they never asked are you writing this up for my file am i supposed to formally deny it im not writing anything it would almost be worth it to see the look on g gs face he said still amused i thought you might be sensitive on someone elses behalf a friend someone who needed the money oppenheimer looked over at him only the once he said ending it connolly drove for a while in silence the air was warmer down in the valley they had passed through the slopes of pinon and juniper to the sage desert oppenheimer had lifted some papers from a briefcase and was working through them on his lap tapping his cigarette out the open window ordinarily connolly would have turned on the radio but he was too interested in oppenheimer to think of it everyone else got fifteen minutes and he had hours to go what did you mean when you said he didnt know anything about the project he asked oppenheimer looked up from the papers anything that would put it in jeopardy he said deliberately he couldnt only a scientist would know that the way i hear it he liked to nose around maybe he knew more than you think he wouldnt know how to separate what was important the basic principles were perfectly clear before the war you knowany physicist worth his salt understands the principles someone like heisenberg would know a lot more than that its the mechanics of it that matter now a layman wouldnt be able to differentiate he simply wouldnt know what to look for in that sense the complexity of the project is its own security if you dont know what to look for you look at everything rather like you and your project the quickness of the answer took connolly by surprise thats some connection thats how science works you guess you make connections then if it fits you prove what you guessed in the first place isnt that what youre doing i havent guessed yet but youve guessed where to look he said his voice playful where would you start looking to find out about the gadget the question had the effect of a chess piece put into place connolly alert to the game moved his own where would i start your briefcase oppenheimer looked at him appreciatively then smiled you might be disappointed the only thing youd learn in here he said casually holding up a sheaf of papers is how utterly fouled up our bureaucracy is fucked up connolly corrected him as you say oppenheimer said enjoying himself why bother with the euphemism what would you make of this for example he took up a sheet this ones from bainbridgea good man in charge of trinity which is where were going the test site he wants it officially designated project t it turns out the business office calls it a and mitchell over in procurement calls it t but ships to s and last week it was made project j to prevent any confusion with building t or site t but people call it t anyway since the passes are marked t so he wants to go with t and do you oh yes whatever ken wants heres another procurement wants to create a new series of ratings weve got x a b and c x being priority now they want to break x out to xx x and x whats xx special delivery virtually goes right to the war production board to dispatch a cargo plane anywhere in the country and will you approve it certainly we cant afford to wait for materiel while the services squabble over priority and there it was again the unexpected steel the arrogant willingness to override of course its easy to make fun of all this alphabet soup the problem is its important really every detail its all important to somebody how much materiel are we talking about oppenheimer sighed and lit another cigarette we handle about thirtyfive tons a day at the warehouse maybe five of that is going down to the site five tons a day connolly was staggered yes oppenheimer said more or less everything from beer towell everything but it must be huge how do you hide something that big i never heard of it before today yes oppenheimer said smiling and youre in security special security anyway i often wonder myself you know when we set up the site we needed our own wavelength for the ground shortwave system and what we got by accident was the one they use in the san antonio freightyards they could hear us but i doubt they knew what we were talking about we routed the phones through albuquerque and denver so nobody outside would make a connection to the hill elaborate security precautions but we still have to ship the stuff off the hillno way around that so we send out trucks every night after it gets dark ten of them sometimes and you know i dont think anyones noticed its as i said you have to know what youre looking for he smiled as if he had just demonstrated the neatness of a formula maybe connolly said on the other hand sometimes you come up lucky ive just collected information about the scale of the project the code names the exact telephone connections and the personnel in charge and i havent even been through your briefcase so you have oppenheimer said quietly maybe youre more dangerous than i thought only if i have to use this he nodded down at the gun one more question could i stop you is there anything in the briefcase you wouldnt want the germans to see oppenheimer considered yes but you brought it out anyway i doubt were going to be attacked by the nazis on the road to albuquerque its a long drive and ive got a lot of paperwork to do it seemed worth the risk but strictly speaking its against regulations do the other bodyguards know this oppenheimer smiled a checkmate grin of course why do you think i requested you they had lunch at roys in belen a designated project stop and connolly found himself sweating under the punishing sun after the cold air of los alamos the desert here was a furnace hot and almost empty all the way to mexico even the stunted pinons of the rolling high plateau had now given way to cactus and scorpions in his gray suit and porkpie hat oppenheimer seemed unnaturally cool dabbing the back of his neck with a handkerchief while connolly dripped large patches of sweat through his shirt but afterward as the dust blew through the windows on a constant wind scratchy and irritating he gave up too abandoning his work and staring listlessly at the wavy glare that stretched for miles yes virginia there is a hell and were in it he said to the air all this to win the war he pulled his hat to shield his eyes and slumped down in the seat pretending to sleep but continuing to talk the spaniards called it the jornada del muerto and for once they werent exaggerating if your wagon broke down here there wasnt much you could do but bring out the rosary beads then lets hope we dont run out of gas were pretty low thats poor planning i must say theres a station up ahead in san antonio keep an eye outif you blink youll miss it theres a bar there too were not supposed to stop but everyone does and youve already broken all the rules incredibly the bar was crowded connolly wondered where in all this barren emptiness they could have come from the room was darkhe had to squint when he walked through the doorand one wall at the end was entirely lined with bottles a trophy wall to past conviviality when his eyes adjusted to the gloom he saw that at least part of the crowd had come from the hill they made an elaborate show of pretending not to notice oppenheimer as if one security violation could be redeemed by obeying another but oppenheimer ignored the charade and went over to talk to them connolly saw eisler and pawlowski and he smiled to himself at the irony of discovering pawlowskis destination after all it was a small world in the middle of the desert while emma sat alone both the men who wanted her faced each other over beer in a mexican bar it was an irony oppenheimer would appreciate connolly thought absurd and elegant at the same time a young mexican bartender went busily back and forth popping caps off beer bottles his eyes shining at what must have been unexpected traffic eisler his pale skin gleaming in the halflight managed to look formal even with his shortsleeved cowboy shirt and cocacola like someone who had stepped into the wrong advertisement but oppenheimer didnt want to staythey had miles to goand his leaving broke up the party for all of them so this is what you meant by offsite connolly said to pawlowski as they left together were not supposed to say he said simply he glanced at connollys gun confused as if he were still trying to place him i didnt know you were coming here im driving oppenheimer is there someone with you he smiled shyly no im not that important the only danger to me is from friedrichs driving we havent done so badly so far eisler said pleasantly connolly noticed that one of his forearms was sunburned bright pink against the short sleeve and he imagined him driving with it hanging rakishly out the window his fingers light on the wheel an old schoolmaster free on the open road he wondered what they talked about and knew instinctively it would be serious the arcane mechanics of the gadget that oppenheimer believed constituted its own security shall we follow you its a comfort to have another car in case of a breakdown you know and so with a third car connolly hadnt seen before they set out in caravan across the flat desert oppenheimer resumed his slumpeddown position angling his hat to avoid the blazing afternoon sun you could nap in the back connolly offered i could nap in the front if it were quiet oppenheimer said he sighed and took out a cigarette which somehow i feel it wont be what else is on your mind connolly grinned nothing whats pawlowski like dont tell me you suspect him too no idle curiosity it passes the time hmm like the radio he exhaled thinking hardworkingenjoys working bethe thinks the world of him determined even stubborn he said playing with it now as if he were composing an applicants recommendation wonderful mind but interior ive always thought that physics became a substitute world for him but thats just a guess actually its not so unusual herewere all a little interior no patience with showboating he can be a littlewhat does herr goebbels call us stiffnecked thinks tellers an ass for instance and wouldnt work for him not a homosexual either by the way no ive met his wife emma yes shes quite a girl meaning meaning shes quite a girl english most beautiful rider ive ever seen you have to be brought up with it to ride that well unusual marriage is it i wouldnt know i think all marriages are unusual unless you happen to be in them no i mean coming from such different backgrounds he laughed dont be such a snob you obviously dont know the english least conventional people in the worldonce you get to the gentry level anyway she fought in spain you know so there must be a wild streak somewhere you should watch her ride you can tell everything about an englishwoman by the way she rides he took a drag on his cigarette on the other hand what could it possibly matter to you he dropped it lightly like an ash on the seat and for a minute connolly didnt know what to say it doesnt just looking at everything oppenheimer said i had no idea you were casting your net quite this wide he paused waiting for connolly to respond shes an attractive woman yes she is connolly said flatly he felt talking to oppenheimer that he was always moving a piece into place but the game was unfairit didnt matter to oppenheimer so he didnt have to play carefully i was wondering the way science works if you guess wrong there wont be any connections to make will there no not if you guess wrong connolly let it drop then annoyed at himself for having somehow started it in the first place he grew even more annoyed at not knowing whether oppenheimer had meant anything or not it was a reporters instinct to hide behind a oneway mirror not revealing anything himself now he felt he was too close to the surface unreliable as if the slightest poke would show his hand dr eisler said something interesting the other night thats unusual oppenheimer said bored friedrich doesnt usually say anything maybe you have a gift for drawing people out what if the germans give up before you finish the project friedrich said that oppenheimer said drawing his neck up turtlelike not exactly he said the nazis the fact of them gave us permission to make the gadget so what would we do without them oppenheimer took off his hat and rubbed his temple connolly saw that his face had grown taut with disapproval we havent made it yet he said finally his qualms are premature he may be premature about the nazis as well but if he isnt thats something devoutly to be hoped for every minute this war goes on but would you keep building it of course oppenheimer said simply do you think weve come this far not to build it but if we didnt need it to win the war then wed need it to end the war the germans arent the only ones fighting sometimes our european friends forget that but thats understandable how many more casualties are acceptable in the pacific another year less i dont know how anyone makes that determination i certainly cant no connolly said quietly mooning about permission when theres so much at stake but you can see what he means thats why they wanted to build it we wanted to build it because it was going to be built by someone we wanted it to be us all of us here wanted that does that shock you sometimes it shocks me where do our egos come from we are trying to release the energy of matter itselfliterally transform the composition of things what physicist would resist that would you the science is there it doesnt ask for permission it asks to be revealed but so difficult expensive the price was the militaryhow else could we have done it the sun was still high when they passed the test site perimeter guards and exchanged their passes at the security office the base camp another instant city of hutments and army buildings wrapped in miles of overhead wires baked unprotected in the glare most of the men were shirtless a few even down to skivvies but despite the heat they moved quickly full of purpose like stagehands making lastminute adjustments before an early curtain the only shade lay in the slim patches next to the east side of the buildings at noon there would have been none at all connolly was struck yet again by the sheer scale of the project on the hill with buildings sheltered by trees and water tanks or tucked away in nearby canyons it was easier to imagine it a familiar city in the grip of a construction boom there were wives and clotheslines and musical evenings the land rolled away to calendar mountains there were ranches but here on the endless stark desert the site was undisguised in all its strangeness a bleached oasis willed into existence overnight connolly knew the manhattan project had factories elsewhere in the country huge plants created just to make the gadgets fuel but it was at trinity that he finally grasped the enormous ambition of it all because nothing belonged here and when the test was finished nothing would remain a whole cityall those millions of tons of materielhad gone up for a single moment in time oppenheimer had one inspection to makea bunker almost completed about six miles away to the southand then a series of meetings back at the camp so connolly was left to his own devices as smoothly dismissed as a family servant despite a creaky air cooler the mess was stifling he took a cold coke and went outside to sit in the dusty wind the beads of condensation on the glass evaporated instantly in the hot air he leaned against the side of the building in a sliver of shade and watched men stringing more wires overhead working in bulky gloves to prevent scorching their eyes covered by goggles against the blowing sand jeeps went back and forth throwing up dust but each time they passed they left silence there were no birds only men ventured aboveground the rest of the desert burrowed in waiting for night the camp lay in a hollow bowl whose far sides the oscura mountains were too distant to be much more than hazy frames connolly had never seen so much space if you walked into it stepped beyond the plywood shacks and telephone poles you would be lost he had spent most of his life trying to find enough roomthe cramped pullout couch in his boyhood living room the cubicle at the newspaper where there never seemed any surface to put down a cup of coffeeand now unexpectedly he had found it this was as far away as you could everything here seemed remotethe war the office in washington all the life of the past the desert erased it away he stared at the landscape blankly it was impossible to think herethe sun burned through the connections allowing only stray thoughts to float out like the little eddies of dust meaningless he drained his coke and the thick bottom reminded him of manny wonders glasses smeared from constant wiping so that connolly thought he barely saw at all manny was the papers columnist a short perpetually sweaty man who turned every morning to page of the mirror to see what winchell had done then spent the rest of the day sifting through the reams of pressagent tips to make a column out of what was left an assistant cut up releases and sorted them in piles for him wonders of the city seven wonders wonderfuls he never took his jacket off in the newsroom as if he might have to leave any minute for el morocco and treated the copyboys with elaborate courtesy his thin voice barely audible above the typewriters in his column debutantes did the rumba idle women got divorced actresses sacrificed their careers to war bond drives and the country saw manny with them up all night on the town but in the newsroom he was a sweaty little man with the manners of an accountant he had had four wives connolly smiled what was his real name he had never asked and now he would never know because manny too drifted away just another ghost on the desert who might never have existed at all he wasnt going to return to the paper he had loved it thenthe handlers at city hall the cops on their free lunchbut he didnt care anymore he was tired of those stories too the war had taken him away and parked him finally here at the end of an army lifeline down route on the edge of something new it was what gave the project its exhilarationnot the high mesa air not ending the war but this feeling that they might be the only people in the world who were not still sorting out its past everything here was brandnewthe raw wood the calculations the profound mystery of what it would be maybe thats what oppenheimer had meant they were staring at a blank piece of paper like this endless white sheet of desert nobody knew what would be on it he heard a roar overhead and saw three bombers flying toward him from alamogordo getting ready but what was he doing here everyone else was busy preparing for something maybe this is what sunstroke was like a weightless dreaming it wasnt his projecthe didnt even understand it if he were still a reporter hed be taking notes amazed at his luck in being in the middle of a story that dwarfed anything on the metro desk but he had given that up he was here only to solve a crime everyone else was too busy to care about nothing more than an interruption in their lives and oddly he didnt mind he felt grateful to the project for letting him imagine a future the war made everyone live day to day never promising anything beyond its own ending now he felt the urge to get onit didnt matter where all that was left was to put things in order so he could pack up but now that hed come here he really didnt want to go anywhere else the future was here he lit a cigarette and wondered whether bruner had ever come here felt the new freedom of the desert space probably not connolly guessed that it would have terrified him he had lived in too many cells to feel comfortable without walls and yet he liked to go driving why where did he go maybe a new patriot he wanted to see this movie western landscape come to real life connolly tried to imagine him gazing out to the horizon hand shielding his eyes but the picture wouldnt come his face in the file photo was pale a stranger to the sun his life had been formed in the furtive corners of rooms bargaining for food tapping on wallsbut this was nonsense there was no way of knowing he could try the oppenheimer method and start with a guess but no connections seemed to follow if you had been a victim you could believe in conspiracy now what if you believed in conspiracy you believed in the value of knowing about it how else to be safe the world was organized in a series of invisible networksin prison where survival depended on it in a secret community where sex flourished more freely the more it was hidden when everything important is invisible do you begin to take pleasure simply in discovering it it wasnt just keeping your eyes open that wasnt enough it became finally a love of knowing for its own sake an advantage so karl read files whose yes he could picture that karl sitting under a lamp at night absorbed in a folder looking for a date that didnt match anything or something specific its what isnt there he had said but then why the car why take time away from the hunt pretending to be an indifferent tourist unless this was playing cat and mouse too unless you were tracking somebody unless you were with somebody until curiosity killed the cat and now connolly as always ran out of connections there had to be someone else its not possible to live without a trace karl neat as a monk had left prophylactics in his drawer there had to be someone even though he still could not believe it a pickup you got a light after days of modulated european accents the thick american twang of the voice surprised him texas probably or oklahoma he looked like someone who had played football in high school broad and muscular with an unshaven chin that jutted out in jock confidence he was stripped to the waist his chest covered in an alkali film so that the bandanna facemask now pulled down around his neck flapped like the collar to a shirt that wasnt there young jug ears stuck out beneath the fatigue hat connolly handed him the lighter you new on the site he was one of those people whose most innocent question came out like a challenge as if he hadnt learned to mask some fundamental belligerence connolly imagined him starting a bar fight a redneck quick to take offense just down for the day guard duty no shit join the club he grinned easier now that connolly had explained himself he flashed a security badge to establish club contact whod you draw oppenheimer he grunted youre lucky he never stays over you dont want to stay here no fucking way you been down here long twentyeight days twentyeight fucking days they moved a bunch of us down last month let me tell you this is about the hardest time there is connolly looked at him with interest he thought hed already talked to everybody in the intelligence unit no one had mentioned transfers to trinity yeah its hot it aint the heat we got heat in east texas its the mickey mouse they got this tighter than a rats ass nobody goes out there aint nothing to do but shoot rattlers the well waters got all this shit in it sos you cant drink itgypsum and stuffbut you wash in it so everybody gets the runs anyway you got to stamp on scorpions in the latrine said they wanted only the best for trinity duty so naturally we all thought it was something special it is so what do you guard them gila lizards mostly there aint nothing down here to guard worst problem they got is all the antelope tripping over the sensor wires they got running everywhere thats why they shoot them yeah thats the excitement just the shooting nothing to eat and nothing to fuck at least they got women on the hill once some of the wacs came down to keep us company but they dont put out never so what the fuck connolly put out his cigarette well it wont be much longer according to who connolly shrugged what do they tell you you kidding me brother they dont tell us nothing were not supposed to know they told us when roosevelt diedthats it for all i know the wars over its not connolly said the kid took off his hat to wipe his forehead the skin now turned permanently red under the short blond hair well i got to get going i was just on my break nice talking to you connolly looked at him to see if he was joking but the face was earnest watch out for the centipedes they sting like hell ill do that mind if i ask you a question the kid about to move away turned toward him his eyes suddenly wary connolly had seen the look before the automatic reaction of someone used to the police the legacy of too many saturday night brawls that had got out of hand he waited when you were on the hill did you know a guy called karl bruner karl he said looking puzzled sure he was g everybody knew him why hes dead karl he was genuinely surprised so not even gossip had penetrated the news blackout or maybe nobody had cared he was killed no shit how he was murdered the kid stared at him you kidding me he said quietly no he was found in the river park in santa fe off the alameda you hadnt heard i told you we dont hear nothing down here who did it thats what were trying to find out youre a cop he said an accusation as if connolly should have declared himself earlier no army intelligence were looking into it on our own i dont understand what happened connolly watched his reaction as he answered we dont know the police think it might have been a homosexual murder it was a surprise punch the kid caught his breath with a nervous laugh of disbelief thats fucking crazy why why karl wasnt any fruit how do you know he sputtered how do i know he just wasnt thats all christ almighty karl did you know him well he was just a guy in the office he used to give me duty assignments after i came off the mounteds so you dont know who his friends were whether he was seeing anybody no okay i just thought you might have noticed something he talk to you much some what about nothing stuff you know what kind of stuff he hesitated for a minute and connolly could see him debating with himself embarrassed did he ask about your girlfriends connolly said steering him like whether i was getting any yeah he asked that and you liked to tell him go fuck yourself he said angry now no its important did you get the sense that he was interested or just making conversation to make you think he was interested but this was too complicated for him and he looked at connolly blankly he was interested he liked to know where you could go things like that and who sometimes and did you tell him he darted his eyes away searching for a way out wondering how they had got here sometimes but he was just curious he didnt want the names for himself no he said seeing the implication but not because he was a fruit he was already fucking somebody connolly was quiet unsure where to go with this it was possible that in the texans mind bored and adolescent somebody always had to be fucking somebody it was possible that bruner had used this as a cover a lure for a braggarts gossip but it was just possible that it was true the missing link what makes you think so i dont knowthings he said i guess you know like hed say he had a date those exact words he had a date something like that yeah exact i guess i didnt pay much attention he mention a name how did you know it was a woman the texan flushed well what else jesus christ i mean why would he want to hear about what i was doing if he was a fruit thats a good question what do you mean by that it was at once hostile and uncertain as if the situation were so foreign to him that he wasnt sure he should resent it did he ever ask for any sexual details you know no you dont talk about stuff like that so it was just i had a good time last night or boy oh boy you should see yeah like that nothing dirty look he asked what was i supposed to say maybe your reputation preceded you maybe he was looking for pointers is that supposed to be funny so how often did you guys compare notes for two cents id push your face in you got a right to ask all this i suppose all the way up to groves himself shit he said disgusted look youre making a big deal out of this its just the way guys talk you know every once in a while i thought you were scoring all the time hey more than you ill bet he said sullen childlike youd win that one connolly said smiling listen i dont care if you fuck around more power to you i just want to know what you said about it to a murder victim i dont know nothing about that the guy liked to kid around once in a while thats all we didnt compare notes he had something going all by himself and then they broke it up i think anyway he didnt say anything much lately so thats what i figured and then i came down here i was just kidding around you know not some federal case he liked to listen he was that kind of guy and he wasnt no fruit he said this with emphasis as if it were important to him that connolly agree i wonder how you can be so sure id know id just know he drew himself up almost physically taking a stand you got a lot of them down in east texas huh not alive there were four other security guards whod been reassigned from the hill and by dusk connolly had interviewed them all without learning anything he didnt already know oppenheimer still hadnt returned as he lined up with the others for dinner so preoccupied that he barely noticed the food filling his tray he sat with a group of machinists who were working on protective aluminum goggles to keep off the alkali dust it was cooler now in the mess and he lingered over coffee even after the men at his table had filed out for an openair movie he smiled at the idea of one of hannahs nightclubs lighting up a patch of the nighttime desert even here in the jornada del muerto people danced he stirred the coffee and absentmindedly played with the spoon lifting it out of the cup then lowering it to watch the coffee rise displacement theory eisler said interrupting his thoughts you see how scientific principles never change first archimedes in his bath now a coffee spoon may i join you connolly smiled and opened his hand to the empty chair did he really run through the streets naked shouting eureka i hope so eisler said it makes a lovely story but perhaps only after hed written his report to the scientific committee in duplicate with copies for the file yes he smiled in duplicate his soft eyes were tired his skin pink from the sun he leaned forward over the tray as he ate his shoulders slumped in the same concession to weariness connolly had noticed in oppenheimer while he had been looking at the desert and toying with an overgrown teenager they had been working hard wheres pawlowski connolly said oh he wont be coming back with us tonight hes here for the week poor devil connolly felt a surge of happiness so sudden and unexpected that he was afraid it would show a week i hope you had some rest eisler was saying oppie doesnt like to drive and its difficult for me to see at night such a long drive it would be better you know to stay the night no we need to get back connolly said now eager to start eisler misinterpreted him and smiled again yes its not the adlon here i agree think of daniel all day at station south every step you have to watch snakes eisler shuddered or scorpions who knows i confess i am a coward in the desert whats he doing here am i allowed to tell you is this a security test connolly shrugged im pretty safe i wont understand it anyway the instruments to measure the radioactivity not the actual of course simulated at low level the test isnt the real thing connolly asked surprised eisler smiled this is for the test before the test only this time tnt one hundred tons to study blast effects actually to test our instruments so we put one thousand curies of fission products in the pile to simulate the radioactive material im sorry do you understand this i understand one hundred tons of tnt my god eisler smiled weakly thats the trial run only the gadget will produce more as many aswell nobody really knows they have a pool to guess a game you see his sad voice trailed off in thought how many tons of tnt blast can we produce with one gadget a hundred five thousand more we cannot know yet how many tons did you bet me i dont bet mr connolly its not a lottery but think twenty thousand tons eisler said matteroffactly connolly stared at him appalled twenty thousand he repeated flatly as if he were trying to confirm the figure my friend eisler said softly what do you think we are doing here why do you think we call it a gadget security code i dont think so maybe we dont want to remind ourselves what it is we are making yes twenty thousand tons my calculations are quite precise i would bet on it he smiled ironically of course we cant yet calculate the dispersion there are no good formulas for radioactivity even our daniel recognizes that connolly felt stunned by the figures they were calmly talking in a makeshift mess hall in the desert the rest was beyond imagining he could only fall back on the details of what was real like a terminal patient still interested in medical procedure is that what you do too he asked measure radioactivity partly we are not allowed to say you know you work with frisch in g division critical assemblies group eisler flinched surprised how do you know that connolly didnt say anything i see another test so if you know why do you ask i know where you work i dont know what it means so do you know fast neutrons do you know critical mass how can i explain his eyes looked around the table searching for props how much uranium do we need for the gadgetthats the problem we know it theoretically but how to test the theory he moved connollys coffee cup to the space between them suppose this coffee were u if we took enough if we reached critical mass there would be a chain reaction and of course the explosion but when does that happen so we take the coffee we think we need but we keep a hole in the middleyou must use your imagination here im afraidso the neutrons can escape no reaction the spoon will be the coffee we took out he held it over the cup if we lower it like this the neutron bombardment increases the chain reaction accelerates you have then the conditions for an atomic explosion but not the explosion we cheat a littlewe use uranium hydride so it reacts more slowly and we drop the slug very quickly but yes when we pass through the core he said letting the spoon fall in we momentarily form a critical mass its as close as we can come to an atomic explosion without having one of course you can also produce this effect by simply stacking cubes of u in a tamper of beryllium blocks a critical assembly but the other is more sophisticated perhaps also a little safer connolly stared at the coffee then looked up at eisler as if he were someone else the last thing he had ever imagined him to be was daring you must have nerves of steel he said finally thats like playing chicken dragon eisler corrected him what we call it the dragon experimenttickling the tail of the sleeping dragon and you dont worry youll blow the place up no we can control that its the radiation thats dangerous well better you than me mr connolly please dont be so impressed its a scientific experiment no more i think sometimes were all tickling the dragon just a little testing how far we can go dont you feel that its only he searched the radiation we dont expect i guess connolly said feeling that eisler was really talking to himself and now may i ask you something eisler said politely what do you do youre not a driver he anticipated connollys protest with a dismissive wave of his hand please i know drivers dont go to webers for the music oppie wants to drive with you alone thats very unusual you know we notice things like that you have my dossier i assume others as well what exactly are you doing here am i permitted to know a government agent of some sort i think so there must be something wrong what dragon are you tickling connolly was struck again by how different the emigres were their first assumptions were still those of the police state no he said nothing like that im just helping to investigate a murder oh whose his voice was so controlled and deliberate that connolly took it for indifference a security officer named bruner eisler sipped his coffee saying nothing did you know him no that is i knew who he was we are still a small community on the project i was sorry to hear about it i didnt realize it was a security matter he said the last an uninflected question it may not be eisler raised his eyebrows in another question but connolly didnt elaborate but you dont know who killed him not yet i see he said slowly pushing aside his tray so you will be our sword of justice well i wish you success in your hunt to think of catching even one so many dead these days and never any killers im only looking for one in particular yes of course forgive me i seem always to argue philosophy when you have work to do are you married eisler looked at him dumbfounded the subject swerving so abruptly that hed been caught in its whiplash connolly could see him sorting through explanations and failing until he sputtered a sort of laugh why do you ask is it the investigation place of birth school married no just curious eisler looked at him thoughtfully now i think you are never just curious mr connolly he sipped his coffee i was married shes dead im sorry no it was a long time ago many years now trude she was killedno not like your friend there was no killer a street fight in berlin we used to have so many in those days the freikorps and the gpd andwho remembers them now what could have been so important but riots you know real blood in the streets if you happened to pass by you could get caught just taking the wrong street like a traffic accident so you never knew who killed her who who he said his gentle voice impatient now history killed her theres no one to hunt like a disease he shrugged im sorry you must still miss her no mr connolly im not a romantic shes dead i put the past behind me the old world isnt that the american idea start fresh leave everything behind connolly thought of the white empty stretch of desert his own impulse for something new no more history you dont believe in history here yet sometimes i think we dont believe in anything else so well see who was right and what would you bet eisler smiled twenty thousand tons for the rest i dont know its hard to leave everything behind its always there somewhere you thinkbut then it surprises you a little like the dragons tail eh what is said oppenheimer putting his coffee on the table as he took a chair he seemed jumpy and annoyed history and philosophy eisler said such matters oppenheimer shot connolly a glance another seminar how about finding us some gas instead we need to start back or well be up all night youre not eating robert eisler said no just coffee he scratched one of his hands you should eat something eisler said kindly not now he snapped it seemed to connolly he was living on nerves what a godforsaken place he said rubbing his hand again you wash and the waters so hard youre covered with magnesium oxide now ill be scratching all night connolly smiled at the scientific exactness of the complaint it was he realized the first time he had ever heard oppenheimer complain about anything he had seen him buried under work exasperated worried but that all seemed part of what he liked other people complained leaned on his endless optimism to keep them going if he felt things were all right then the problems were just sandflies now however he was irritated and fretful finally done in by an itch we have five trunk lines here youd think they could manage to keep one open gg throws a fit when hes cut off now we have to sit around and wait for them to get the connection back waste of time in that case eisler said have a little something youll get sick a roll even friedrich stop hovering im fine i heard something today that might interest you by the way yes robert he said chastened the army took stassfurt he paused waiting for a response then plunged in the germans had the uranium ore there over a thousand tons most of the original belgian supply they cant have much anywhere else so i think we can rule out the possibility of a german gadget it seemed to connolly he was taunting eisler getting back at him for having raised any qualms at all and connolly was surprised by the sharp cruelty of it no more nazis to give permission he was daring him to question the project again but eisler refused to be drawn thats everything we hoped for he said carefully yes now theres only the japanese eislers face clouded for only a moment but what connolly saw there was terrible a resignation so profound it looked fated as if a longawaited punishment had finally been handed out and then it cleared and he was composed again yes he said was oppenheimer aware of what he was doing connolly looked again at eisler so easily troubled so alert to contradiction and he wondered if what oppenheimer saw was some part of himself he needed to override how else to become a general to see things through but to put everything else aside the prize no longer allowed him any doubts not in any part of himself phone call sir the gi had barely reached the table when oppenheimer leaped up no sir sorry not for you for mr connolly oppenheimer was too surprised to be angry since he was already standing he made an after you sweep of his hand but the unexpectedness of it restored his good spirits and he laughed at himself dont tie up the line youll keep the general waiting and by the way tell your mother or whoever it is that its illegal to call here connolly shrugged his shoulders be right back youd better hope this is important it was mills sounding elated i thought youd want to knowthey got him what the killer holliday called albuquerque police nailed him both crimes looks like you can start heading back to the bright lights but connolly realized with a sharp pang that it was the last thing he wanted you still there mills said louder now as if he feared a bad line it doesnt make sense brother you dont give up do you they closed the case fermata as we say in the rio grande hes mex by the way just like they thought i want to see him mills paused holliday said if you asked to tell you that the albuquerque police want you both to politely butt out theyll send a copy of the report but tell him ill be there tomorrow i have to get oppenheimer back tonight he said theyre pretty firm about it probably got some bug up their ass about the army coming in you listening tell holliday ill be in albuquerque tomorrow and ill interview the suspect then if im not interviewing the suspect tomorrow ill be on the phone to general groves and hell be talking to the governor of new mexico and he ll be dealing with a severe manpower shortage on the albuquerque police force clear could you really do that probably i dont know but its a risk hes not going to want to take all right calm down ill see what i can do you dont sound very happy i thought youd be pleased as hell i dont believe it what do you mean i just dont believe it hes not the guy mike youd better believe it mills said calmly he confessed they drove through the night eisler asleep in the back seat oppenheimer hunched down in front in a counterfeit of sleep restless but quiet the road was completely deserted their headlights the only points of light in miles of darkness but connolly was alert rubbed by the tension beside him oppenheimer wanting to ask about the call and connolly not telling him he wasnt sure why oppenheimer had a right to know what could be more conclusive than a confession it was useless to pretend he could offer any reason to doubt it the rest of the story wrote itself now oppenheimers wry thanks and a ticket back to washington his billet in the house on l street shared bathroom down the hall another year or so of shuffling paper until the war came to its end his discharge to a life that wasnt there anymore but it wasnt finished yet not the case not anything about los alamos he wasnt ready to go the truth was that he felt alive here somehow on active service at last a part of the project he understood for the first time how the scientists felt unwilling to think about anything else until the main point was reached until it went off there would be time later but there wasnt any now they were so close and as long as he had his case his peripheral investigation he could still be part of it didnt he owe it to bruner to follow this through to the end but even he could see that he was building an absurd house of cards you can talk yourself into anything if you try it wasnt his project he didnt owe bruner anything except an apology for trying to use his death to do something interesting with his own life a mexican pickup a senseless crime life was like that maybe his refusal to accept it had a simpler reason if he left the project hed be leaving her he glanced over at oppenheimer he deserved to know connollys silence bordered on military insubordination dereliction of duty all because it might interfere with his urge for a woman was that really what it came down to still oppenheimer didnt care and what did it matter he wasnt asking for a lot of timejust enough to be sure before he gave it all up they were still south of santa fe when first light streamed over the sangre de cristo mountains lifting mist off the sage and the juniper trees it was going to be another spectacular morning erasing all the uneasiness of the night clear and uncomplicated oppenheimer exhausted finally from whatever worries had preoccupied him in the dark now fell sound asleep eisler who confronted demons and then offered a roll was snoring softly in the back the car felt safe and ordinary again why was the night always filled with ultimatums go one step at a time in the new light he would see what he would see he dropped both men groggy at the entrance to the tech area then returned the car to the pool eager now for a shower and a fresh start but los alamos was still asleep glistening and empty mills wouldnt be ready for hours and albuquerque would be hours after that only a few trucks disturbed the peace he could have coffee check in at the office he could take a walk shake the drowsiness off by strolling around ashley pond instead he stood at the edge of the dirt road not doing anything he started toward his dormitory then hesitated he turned toward the admin building then stopped a second time he was a teenager again nervously looking for excuses in the street when he knew what he had to do was go up on the porch and ring the bell he rapped softly on the door in the sundt complex afraid to wake the neighbors but she must have been up early because the door opened at once her hair was down uncombed and she was wrapped in a robe a clinging prewar silk that draped slightly at her breasts he felt the warmth she still carried with her from bed are you mad she said quietly you cant come here her eyes looked quickly to each side come out then he said sssh someone will hear do you know what time it is he nodded but didnt move she glanced around again then swung the door open further come on she said drawing him in then closing it behind her what is it you look like hell he had turned to face her unconsciously pinning her back against the door and stared at her for a minute his face close to hers as if the distance would lower the sound of their voices you dont he said moving his eyes over her face she gave a halfsmile i asked for that didnt i she said softly at six in the bloody morning i need to talk to you not here he wont be back till friday it isnt that we cantnot here but she didnt move and he could feel her in front of him warm their faces almost touching i need to tell you i may have to leave she looked at him will you i may they found someone i may have to leave why are you telling me she said her eyes still on him i cant promise you anything you should know that i know it may be important to you i dont want to be unfair to you she placed her hand along his cheek but youre not fair she said drawing him closer theres nothing fair about you she kissed him youre here she said kissing him again lightly as if she were drawing a breath between words and then youre not its not fair youre warning me what else i dont want to leave he said kissing her back then stay for a while now are you sure he said still kissing her yes i dont want to hurt you this is a funny love affair apologies at the beginning not the end its not fair no lets pretend were at the beginning he kissed her hard then pinning her against the door his hands behind her drawing her closer he could feel the heat of her skin through the silk as his hands moved down her back pulling her toward him so that their bodies ground together then her robe fell open and he moved his hands inside feeling the skin itself hot alive to his touch she held the back of his head her mouth everywhere on his face come to bed he whispered no she was gulping air not there and as his hand rounded her moving toward the back of her thigh she brought her leg up beside him as if he were taking her right there standing up and his prick jumped with excitement he rubbed his hand under her thigh until he felt her hair graze his fingertips already moist and the wetness made his erection pulse again almost painful now in his pants his fingers moved up along the moist lips slick back and forth so that she began to ride them her mouth making stifled noises behind the kiss then he turned his hand so that his open palm held her the heel of it grinding against the front of her as the wet finger still slid back and forth and she pulled her mouth off his to gasp for air her lower body still moving against him but he couldnt stop nowthe fierceness of it the hurry was outside them he could feel her breath ragged in his ear he covered her mouth again their tongues slippery as he moved his hand away to unzip his pants fast so that when it sprang out it moved toward her at once to replace the hand sliding along the wet part of her until it slipped inside and he thrust up filling her and she gasped dropping her head on his shoulder he thought for an instant he would come then still her heat wrapped around him there was nothing but feeling now so complete he was afraid to disturb it but then he felt the walls of her vagina grip him making gentle spasms and they were moving again oh she said a low sound from her throat her head back against the door and the sound of it excited him more and he put his mouth back on hers kissing her as he gripped her below pounding into her with her thigh still drawn up beside him he could hear them thudding against the door oblivious as animals and then a sharp sound from her as he felt her grip him again inside and he knew she had come so that he was released now too and after a few more jabbing thrusts it spurted out of him everything in him shooting out taking his breath with it they stood there for a few minutes still locked together gulping air and he knew they must look absurd their mouths smeared with saliva standing against the wall like dogs his pants down below his knees but her face glowed and when he looked at her he felt an immense gratitude it had been so quick but she had let him not protesting giving herself to it he had wanted to make love not just fuck but they had already waited too long to take their time now he kissed her gently and lifted her up still hard inside her and moved haltingly toward the couch his pants wadded foolishly around his calves but the point was not to leave her it didnt matter how they looked messy and awkward so long as he remained inside her when he laid her down on the couch still inside she smiled at him and this time they kept a different rhythm moving smoothly in and out and the sensation in him spread outward so that his whole body was making love every piece of skin sensitive this time his hands felt all of her drawing along her breasts kissing the side of her neck until they both began racing and she wrapped her legs around him urging him waiting for him to come so that they could finish together shuddering in the same jolt of pleasure they lay quietly for a while until calm now he sensed his weight on her and slipped out his penis finally soft and moved to the side still holding her he saw her face moist with tears dont he said softly brushing them lightly off her face no im all right she said turning on her side to face him she held the side of his head looking at him what will it be like do you think i dont know no never mind like this maybe maybe she said tracing the shape of his ear why do we ever think anything else matters she smiled thats sex talking i guess ive never done it standing up he grinned what do you think not sure yet they would have gone on like this he knew comfortable idly touching each other but there was a rap on the door oh god she whispered sitting up pointing him quickly toward the bedroom bloody hell what had seemed smooth before no more than another stroke of lovemaking was clumsy now and he almost tripped as he staggered toward the door holding his pants coming she said out loud belting the robe around her and running her fingers through her hair she waited until he had closed the bedroom door inside he flopped on the bed too exhausted to dress and afraid of making a sound emma he heard a womans voice say through the door thank god youre up do you have any coffee i dont know how i ran out but larryll be a bear if he doesnt have his coffee ill pay you back i was just making some this enough she said over the rattling of a tin hmm youre perspiring its this damn central heating youd think id be used to it by now wouldnt you thanks the woman said obviously taking the coffee sorry to bother you so early wheres daniel i thought i heard somebody no just me hes offsite awful talking to yourself isnt it if im not careful theyll put me away there was more as she lingered at the door but connolly stopped listening he lay there instead looking up at the ceiling still drifting in a haze of sex now there was the sound of water running the rattle of a pot being put on to boil the scrape of a match everything seemed to him erotic he imagined her measuring out the coffee her robe half open so that her flushed breasts stood out the nipple firm against the silk he imagined lying here every morning listening to her being busy in the kitchen as the stickiness of sex dried on his skin when she opened the door her finger to her lips in warning she giggled at the sight of him look at you she whispered do you think you might put your trousers on or do you just want to stay like that all day all day he said come to bed but she shook her head no i told you i wont do that to him come and have some coffee she said leaving the room he got up pulled his pants on and followed her out funny scruples you have he said teasingly but she came up to him and held him dont scold i wont thats all sorry he said kissing her do you want me to go no lets not waste the coffee now that ive made it bloody cow next door shes probably put her ear to a glass at the wall he sat at the little kitchen table near the window smoking watching her as she poured the coffee and brought it to the table every movement seemed interestingthe way she smoothed the back of her robe under her as she sat down blew gently on the coffee reached for a match what she said selfconsciously just looking he said i cant get enough of you well youve only just started she said dryly lighting a cigarette no weeks from the start thats nice she said taking a sip of coffee playing it must have been the sight of me doubled over sick that made you decide was that it no the ride back from the ranch he said seriously really she said interested uhhuh there was that moment what moment theres always a moment between a man and a woman when you know something can happen it doesnt have toit can just pass right on by but it can never happen without that moment you know when you feel its possible she laughed youve got cheek didnt you feel it too its different for a woman i dont believe it not that part she shrugged and looked toward the window at the shaft of sunlight pouring between them on the table what was all that about your going away i may i dont know but we can see each other hes not back all week how do you know that ive just come from the test site i saw him there that must have been cozy look if anythings going to happen youve got to leave him out of it i mean it hes not in it im talking about us you and me you can make whatever rules you want all right she said softly but not here no ones ever come here where did you go with the others she looked at him dont pretend youre jealous youve no right i never said there were others i just said no ones ever come here you can see what its like she tilted her head toward the neighboring apartment he followed her gesture taking in the room for the first time a blur of terracotta pots and navajo rugs draped over simple governmentissue furniture he reached across the table for her hand we can meet somewhere yes ill find a place theres the ranch we could go there she left you a key he said a statement emma nodded she thought i might need it that day he said before the drive you thought about this before the drive no a suspicion i didnt know he smiled but you thought it might you were ahead of me come here she shook her head but he gripped her hand pulling it gently and she followed the pull getting up and moving to where he sat her robe falling open as she straddled him his face was level with her breasts and he began kissing them barely touching them at first then as he felt the nipples harden moving over them in a steady rhythm pressing so that she anticipated each stroke of his mouth she closed her eyes his mouth opened to lick the nipple tasting her still salty with sweat he pressed his face into her and her head no longer flung back now dropped down next to his no she gasped youll break the chair a last vestige of practicality he carried her again to the couch his mouth still on her tasting all of her this time slowly making love to every part of her teasing her sex until she held his head there shuddering as she came under his tongue so that when he entered her again she lay open already his mills was waiting in his room lying again on the bed you going to make a habit of breaking in connolly said that was hours ago when i thought youd need a ride then i just got fascinated wondering where you were after being so anxious and all well im here now everything set holliday will meet us there threatening to call the governor did the trick just like you said hes not happy about it though said you put his ass on the line and he doesnt like it there christ youre a mess we drove all night right what the hell does that mean mills grinned i havent seen a look like that since college larry rosen the pussy king just like larry out all night and then hed come back too shagged out to go to class except hed want to tell us about it you have fun dont be an asshole hey i didnt say a thing better grab yourself a shower though the memory lingers on those cons down there get a whiff and theyll start tearing the place apart mills all right all right im just jealous thats all i have to hand it to youive been here a year and i still cant get laid how about just getting the car ill be right with you connolly said stripping off his clothes okay you sure you dont want to get some sleep instead this can wait you know theyve got a signed confession and a witness who the bartender in albuquerque turns out he recognized him after all was this before or after they took his liquor license away there were others the guy was a regular its him mike i just want to get a look at him mills shrugged suit yourself if it was me after a big night id get some sleep well thats you i dont feel sleepy at all but he slept all the way to albuquerque his eyes drooping as soon as they left the hill and millss cheerful voice faded into a background hum by the time they reached the familiar highway he was out not even disturbed by the sun on his face they were in albuquerque before he surfaced again slightly groggy and saw hollidays grim face the albuquerque jail had none of the adobe pretense of santa fe it was a streamlined modern government building in the post office porkbarrel style official and utilitarian chief hendron on the other hand was a throwback to the frontier oneroom jail with a big key ring he had the authority of height and carried himself with the swagger of one who was never far from his sixshooter he was clearly put out about the interview his natural belligerence hemmed in only by the threat of a higher authority an even bigger bully holliday here says you got some special interest in this prisoner is that right you mind telling me what that might be its a government matter shit what isnt he looked at connollys id and snorted army corps of engineers is taking an interest in all kinds of things these days arent they i suppose we got to wait for the war to be over before you tell us what the hell youre all doing here youll be the first to know the chief looked at him dont go fresh on me he snapped dont you do it im still the law around here and i wont have it he handed back the id if holliday vouches for you i guess thats that but im not going to have you messing with my prisoner you want to talk to him youve got to have one of my boys with you we got a selfconfessed murderer back there and i still dont know what business that is of yours the other victim was one of our men one of your men thats a good one now just what would one of you army engineers be wanting with old ramon back there thats what id like to know helluva thing that kind of shit going on in the army if it was my outfit id be ashamed if it was your outfit so would i connolly said and then quickly before hendron could reply can i see him now ill have chief holliday with methat should satisfy your concerns about being alone has he got a lawyer hendron glared at him ready to pounce then backed down he will have you got one hour with him thats it you just find out what you need to find out and dont come back you interfere with this case and the governor himself wont keep me off your ass i appreciate your cooperation hendron stared at him again you do that holliday im counting on you to make sure nothing goes wrong here were going for a conviction on this one i understand you have witnesses connolly said bartender saw them leave together some of the other uh patronsll verify that turns out old ramon worked that parking lot before no question he did it we got a signed confession you know so i heard yeah well arnold here will show you the way you be nice and easy with him now old ramon come to a little grief the other night so hes probably not feeling his best what kind of grief he smirked the kind they got in jail when youre not too popular seems they dont go for ramons type back there i guess he did better with the army engineers they were left to wait in a room down the corridor from hendrons office youre not making any friends here holliday said handing him a copy of the statement i wish i knew what the big deal was what does hendron care anyway you ever step on a snake by accident you didnt mean to and he doesnt want to but hes just got to bite its the surprise of it then what he crawls back under a rock if you let him alone connolly read through the statement kelly i thought you said he was mex his mother father probably worked on the railroad we get a lot of that here mostly they dont hang around long enough to leave a name though maybe it was love connolly said absently still reading through the transcript christ fifty dollars he stuck a knife in somebody for fifty dollars thats a lot of money to some folks anyway it was just a fight you know how accidents happen in a fight connolly looked up at him manslaughter he said a larger question murder second degree would be more my guess and you dont hang for second degree not in this state he have a fight with bruner too no he was defending his manhood he said flatly not willing to meet connollys eyes but connolly refused to look away thats what it says you believe this no reason not to believe it he said it didnt he machismos a big thing with these people he paused its something any jury here would understand connolly turned back to the paper not wanting to press him how much did he say he got off bruner he didnt well it wouldnt be fifty dollars karl would never carry that much he says it wasnt about money thats right i forgot he was protecting his honor so he smashes karls skull in messes up his face holliday sighed just didnt know his own strength i guess but when kelly was led in he seemed to have no visible strength at all he shuffled in careful of the guard and stood before the table quiet and sullen a schoolboy brought up before the principal he was slight but wiry his shoulders hunched as if the handcuffs were weighing him down his face was like a map of his mixed ancestry the copper skin and aztec slant of his cheekbones set off by the surprising blue of his eyes now half lost in the swelling on one side and the deep purple bruises a thin scraggly mustache was pushed up by the cracked puffiness of his upper lip there was no disguising the meanness of his face however the discolored skin stretched across a hard mask of defiant wariness the look of someone whod never known a favor in his life thank you connolly said to the guard he need these he pointed to the handcuffs the guard looked at holliday who nodded and reluctantly unlocked the cuffs kelly rubbed his thin wrists surprised and suspicious at the same time ill be right outside the guard said ramon here give you any trouble you just holler sit down connolly said ignoring the guard and offering a cigarette kelly winced slightly as his cracked lip curled around it then let it dangle from the side of his mouth his eyes closed against the rising smoke i work for the government and i need to ask you a few questions connolly began i dont know anything about that about what about no government whats this have to do with the government nobody told me about that one of the men you killed worked for the government for the first time kelly looked alarmed his bruised face furrowed in concern i dont know nothing about that i didnt kill nobody it was an accident and withhe searched the paperjack duncan thats the man in albuquerquethat was an accident too no jack was different that was a fight what was the fight about he shrugged you know a fight you knew duncan i seen him around did you have sex with him he took the cigarette out of his mouth hey i dont do that he had sex with me connolly looked at him surprised at the distinction what did he do what are you kidding me he blew me what do you think he liked doing that did he pay you nah it was for you know the fun of it i let guys do me once in a while when i cant get it any other way whats the difference but you had fifty dollars he give me that it was a loan like so even though he gave you fifty dollars you two had a fight he shrugged again stubbing out the cigarette that where you got those bruises he stared at both men as if it were a trick question the fight was a while ago connolly said those look pretty fresh i fell where here yeah here i fell he looked away what about the man in santa fe did you know him no where did you meet in a bar which one i dont know some bar near the plaza what were you doing in santa fe he shrugged i was just there thats all then what happened we went for a walk then helook i already told all this stuff why are you asking me again he took another cigarette more confident now i just want to be sure i got it right so you went for a walk not a ride no a walk connolly felt holliday stir beside him shifting in his seat but he didnt say anything down to the river connolly prompted yeah then what happened kelly smirked he come on to me did that surprise you the question seemed to catch him offguard you just thought he wanted to talk i dont know maybe okay i thought maybe he wanted to do me it crossed my mind did he talk about himself his work kelly looked puzzled no so what did you talk about nothing i dont remember he was a pretty big guy connolly said evenly did that worry you again he felt holliday stir i can take care of myself connolly looked at the thin sinewy arms the bloated face and wondered how often he had said this before how often the posturing had protected him i can see that hey kelly said offended i told you i fell so you went for a walk and you ended up hitting him why he got out of hand i told you he didnt want to have sex with you he wanted me to do him i dont do that you tell him this sure but he dont want to listen you know and then hes all over me so so you hit him with what by the way with what connolly could see his face working sorting through answers yes did you just use your fists or did you have something a branch he said quickly it was lying there right on the ground hey what do you want to know all this for and you threw it away afterward yeah i guess i dont remember too well but you do remember hitting him yeah i said i did i didnt know he was dead i just thought he was out you know holliday got up then and walked over to the window you must have been pretty angry connolly said smoothly i was surprised you know i just did the first thing that came into my head i wasnt trying to kill him what surprised you the sex yeah you didnt expect it from him was that because he was mexican too he could feel holliday turn to them from the window watching kellys confused face kelly hesitated for a minute then said no it was just the surprise you know ramon have you ever been to san isidro whats that a church yes ever hear of it i dont understand its a church in santa fe you ever go there i dont go to church much then suspicious what do you ask that for the man you killedthe man you hitused to go there i just wondered if youd ever gone there with him i told you i only saw him the one time no i didnt go to no church with him what do you think holliday sat down again when he spoke his voice was surprisingly gentle you know ramon the police really appreciate cooperation yeah he said not looking at holliday connolly came from somewhere else this was the devil he knew makes our job a lot easier so we appreciate that when you make it easier for us then were more inclined towell make it easier for you yeah when we understand something we got a much better idea what the charge should be like here for instance somebody might think first off this is nothing but a murder one you know but when they understand it when they know all the facts they might think its not so bad we dont want you to hang for something you didnt do connolly sat back watching him work thats right kelly said that jack duncan that wasnt no murder that was just a fight you know thats what it sounds like to me the boys down here understand that they explain that to you ramon looked up at him yeah they explained it good you know its a funny thing boy in your position sometimes the police are the best friends you got ramon absentmindedly rubbed his cheek yeah so youd just want to go right on cooperating with them wouldnt you sure i mean we got two dead bodies here so we got some kind of trouble but that dont have to be murder trouble does it not the worst kind i mean two counts of second aint nowhere near as serious as even one first you still got your life they explain that to you yeah well good now i got one more question after you hit the guy you go through his pockets some kelly hesitated for a minute suspecting a trap then went ahead yeah okay i did what the helli figured he owed me something uhhuh you find much i dont remember some not much you throw the wallet away too yeah i guess what about the car i dont know nothing about a car oh well maybe he didnt have one you didnt find any keys huh just the wallet yeah thats right just a wallet holliday turned to connolly anything else you want to know no i guess thats it connolly said better get the guard you got another cigarette ramon said sure anything else we can do for you kelly stood up the cigarette tucked behind his ear id sure like to get out of solitary think you could do something about that i mean its not like theyre accusing me of being a murderer or something afterward they stood on the steps of the building caught in the glare of the afternoon sun holliday lit a cigarette ignoring connolly looking deliberately at the street only a few cars broke the quiet well that explains the warm welcome connolly finally said holliday just continued smoking how do you want to play this connolly said i dont know what you mean holliday said his voice low yes you do they cant railroad a confession like this who the hell do they think they are anyway i dont know that one either is this just some more wild west stuff what do they thinks going to happen when he talks to a lawyer holliday sighed well thats a funny thing isnt it lawyer gets him to change his statement and hell hang for sure but he didnt do it he did the first one all right then let him take the rap for that well arent you the hanging judge i dont know as id recommend that if i was his lawyer theyre going to hang him anyway maybe but we dont know that maybe he thinks its worth the chance this is what theyre doing in germany for christs sake in new york city too i hear we dont beat phony confessions out of people just to make the police look good no well then i stand corrected youre not going to do anything about this are you holliday turned to face him his expression more weary than angry just what did you have in mind its not right i didnt say it was but its done kellys a little punk whos probably going to get better than he deserves the boys here are going to take credit for solving crimes they probably couldnt ever have solved anyway nothing worse than a murder hanging over you people dont like it makes them feel uneasy so now everybody can just go about his business until the next guy goes out in the parking lotbut at least he wont have kelly getting his rocks off and playing with knives so maybe everybodys better off all around except us weve still got a murder to solve holliday didnt say anything youre keeping the case open arent you you know he didnt kill bruner i cant mike holliday said quietly hell have my badge i cant go against him like that dont then just dont close the case its closed doc youve always been straight with me at least i think you have then dont ask me to do something i cant do he said his voice resigned connolly stared at him you know i cant let this go maybe but as a police matter its closed what you get to up there on the hill is your business i still need your help he looked at the street deciding what exactly i cant hold every drifter who passes through town and i cant go talking to everybody who lives around san isidro only the police can do that why san isidro because bruner was killed there somebody must have seen something theres always somebody holliday raised his eyebrows then why move him i dont know maybe they didnt want you snooping around just in case somebody did see something no crime no questions people dont volunteer do they not much and they didnt want him found so they move him to the center of town connolly sighed yes damnedest thing isnt it you roll a guy and instead of running away you take him away all right you dont want him foundput a little distance between you and the law so youve got all of gods country around here you can just drop him off somewhere in the woods and let the coyotes have him but you dont you take him right back into town where you know hes going to be found and then you take his id everything so hes not exactly found nobody knows who he is sounds like you cant make up your mind one way or the other go on connolly said quietly watching him now you take mr kelly here thats a whole lot of trouble for him to go to hes more what id call the careless type love em and leave em dont think hed bother much about covering his tracks hed just get the hell out we know its not him connolly said impatiently and its not anybody like him either connolly looked up at him meaning meaning i dont think he was rolled i think it was somebody he knew or anyway who knew him thats what ive been saying all along holliday grinned i never said you were dumb just an arrogant son of a bitch so why would whoever it was want him to be found well he was going to be wasnt he you dont just lose a security officer in a top secret government base theyd be all over the place in fact you were so were back to square one why move him holliday lit another cigarette taking his time well ive been giving that a little thought and what occurs to me is how he was found see we dont know him from adamall we got is a victim you find a body in the desert you got a real mystery on your hands san isidro well what would he be doing there but the way we did find him there was no mystery about that you get the picture right away what you got there is kind of an embarrassment you dont want to look into that too closelyyou never know what youre going to find when you turn that rock over you just want to clean it up the army wouldnt want to go looking for pretty boys theyd be squeamish about that he just thought theyd sweep it away and now they will holliday shrugged i have to say ill bet he never figured on old ramon thats just another example of how the good lord looks after his sinners so where do we go from here like i said this case is closed i can give you the benefit of my wisdomthat just comes from being in the business but hendron finds out im conducting an illegal investigation and hell have my ass he can do it too not if you blow the whistle on him first forget it holliday said not me not you either hes got a signed confession and you dont have much more than a theory about a parking lot and a few pieces of goddamn turquoise thats not just sticking your neck out thats handing him the ax so right now its his show and theres not a damn thing we can do about it hendrons the kind of guy if we were in combat you wouldnt be surprised if he got shot in the back one bullet and out and nobodyd look twice to save themselves you know but we dont do that here yet maybe you ought to use some of your contacts in washington and get the bastard drafted let him go push the japs around he ground out his cigarette finished with the conversation but i guess hes too valuable keeping the peace at home something for our boys to come back to connolly was silent for a minute what about the car the car holliday said looking up intrigued you still need to find the car holliday smiled well you know a missing vehicle is another story strictly speaking its not part of this case at all unless you find it well we have to find it first plenty of time to worry about that thanks doc holliday looked at him this isnt anything just a missing car thanks anyway youll sleep better i guarantee it dont go giving me too much credit i sleep pretty good now youd think theyd want to know connolly said shaking his head i mean dont they care that whoever killed bruner is still out there somewhere well you know they probably should but to them its just some fairy fight dont matter the thing is nobodys ever really cared about this except you i cant now oppenheimer said coming out of the building im already late im flying to washington cant it wait no ride with me to albuquerque if you like he said nodding to the driver who held the door for him ive just come from albuquerque two minutes then ride with me to the gate i really am late just like the white rabbit he smiled climbing into the car as if it were the hole in the tree connolly followed bad news oppenheimer said as they passed the tech area that depends on how you look at it i thought you should know the police in albuquerque have arrested someone splendid anybody we know no some kid who knifed a guy down there a few weeks ago they got him to confess to both crimes poor bruner oppenheimer said indifferently his mind clearly elsewhere well its a relief in a way isnt it one less thing to worry about he looked up when connolly didnt answer isnt it connolly shook his head and nodded toward the driver a slight fairhaired soldier but oppenheimer waved his hand hes the wrong man do you know that yes do they maybe they dont care i dont understand he killed their man he didnt kill karl but it suits them to wrap it all up i guess neat and tidy anyway theyre doing it you said they had a confession hes lying it wouldnt hold up for five minutes in court oppenheimer looked at him frankly puzzled but no ones going to challenge it the police want to believe it and kellythats the guywants them to believe it he thinks hes making a deal oppenheimer took this in what are you going to do nothing theres nothing we can do but i wanted you to know itll be in the papers are you seeing groves hell want to know hell want to believe it they had reached the gate and oppenheimer asked the driver to pull over what exactly do you want me to tell him that im continuing our investigation and you support it do i yes if you want to get to the bottom of this of course you can go along with the police and send me back to washington oppenheimer smiled oh im in no hurry to do that i rather like playing dr watson he hesitated do i understand that youre seriously suggesting theres a miscarriage of justice it wouldnt be the first time and were not going to do a thing about it not now what do we get by that officially karl was rolled in the park having sex with a street thug case closed theirs anyway oppenheimer looked out the window its a hell of an epitaph isnt it thats how karls going to be remembered thats what the papers will say anyway we dont get to write our own obituaries no we dont oppenheimer said so the expedient thing what do you want me to do agree with them case closed ill just go about my business in my own way officially youre relieved its over ill be relieved when its really over yes connolly said opening the door to get out but imagine how relieved the real killer is right now but having cleared things with oppenheimer he now found himself at loose ends tired unsure where to begin again at the office he talked with mills now sheepish after hearing about kellys interview and leafed absentmindedly through the savings files he thought about hollidays reconstruction of the night of the crime but why san isidro in the first place it was an unlikely rendezvousthere was always the chance of tourists or parishioners he made a note to check the schedule of services but more out of thoroughness than convictionhe couldnt imagine bruner meeting someone at mass in fact he couldnt imagine bruner meeting someone at all and yet he must have he must have arranged it somehow without telephones from a city so secret it didnt exist just a post office number in the high desert he was thinking about los alamos the communications procedures when emma came into the office she nodded to him but dealt with mills filling out a req for an overnight offsite pass do you need the whole route im going to chaco ive been before so youve probably got it all somewhere purpose of visit mills said bored see the bloody ruins what do you think theres nothing else there archaeology he said pencil still poised to write emma laughed no hiking put hiking down that covers everything tourism mills said writing connolly shuffled papers not trusting himself to look at her but when he did he found her staring directly at him her eyes shining number where you can be reached not for miles and miles thats the point you ought to get out once in a while she said to mills youll get pasty in here ever see the anasazi sites not yet mills said completing the form you really ought to get some proper hiking shoes and start with bandelier its closer chacos a bit remote you have to leave here at six to have any time there at all but its worth it mills handed her the pass dont talk to strangers he said smiling thats what my father used to say and then she smiled at both of them and was gone connolly stared back at the desk afraid to watch her out the door and realized it had all been arranged the time the plan what hed need to take a clandestine meeting all fixed in the security office itself that easy why had he ever imagined bruner couldnt do it everything that mattered was secret arranged under the thin cover of the visible world he had dinner with mills in the commissary then walked over to the movie he couldnt go home hed lie there on bruners chaste bed thinking about tomorrow tempted to slink over to the sundt apartments in the dark instead he sat on a folding chair in the crowded auditorium dazzled by color it was a musical bright and glossy there was a nightclub there was a misunderstanding there was a spot with carmen miranda afterward he couldnt remember anything about it people filed out complaining about the night chill and drifted away in pairs just the way they did on main street he was too tired to go back with mills for a beer so he found himself alone the street suddenly empty smelling of woodsmoke and resin excuse me the voice startled him coming from behind could i speak to you for a minute connolly turned and tried to make out the face in the dim light eyes blinking nervously under short blond hair youre the driver today thats right i couldnt help overhearing i mean i he faltered what he took a breath i wasnt going to say anything i mean im not saying anything now its just you seem like an allright guy it was a question what is it its just thatlook youre making a mistake about kelly no not about ramon connolly was surprised you know him the soldier shrugged lots of people know him he gets around so do you huh he stiffened no not like that ramons just one of those guys whos around you know in the bar yeah in the bar but karl wasnt thats what im trying to tell you youre looking at this wrong he wasnt connolly waited for him to finish but he had stopped whatever courage had prompted him now gone how do you know connolly said finally id know thats all you were a friend of karls no just from the office thats right youre a driver so youd be attached to the office the soldier bit his lip dont worry im not going to say anything i dont even want to know who you are whats the difference you could find out in a minute why say anything then youre right maybe im crazy its just i can see where this is all going ive seen it before they start looking at everything i hear youre going through our savings accounts he smiled at connollys expression i have a friend over in admin he explained things get around everybody gets along fine here nobody bothers anybody but now you think its a sex crime wait and see all hell will break loose i was on a base once where they started im not looking for that no and what if you find it all the sudden theyve got records on people stuff they never bothered about before and then youve got trouble ive seen it thats bad enough but this time theres no point it all starts because of karl and he wasnt like that connolly was quiet so you said before how do you know id know he said again you guys have a secret handshake or something like the masons the soldier wrinkled his nose in disgust okay forget it i knew i was crazy to do this i think it took a lot of guts you do huh yes i do but what do you expect me to do with this ignore everything because it might be inconvenient for you you didnt even know the guy all we can go on is what we know and what we know here is weve got a guy dead in the park with his pants down the soldier looked at him i could pull your pants down right here and what would that make you the quiet hung between them if you killed me i guess it would make me karl the soldier nodded then turned to walk away ill make you a deal connolly said after him watching him turn back with suspicion what if you look for me what do you mean maybe youre right but what if youre not what if karl was so secretive that even you couldnt spot it and its important that we know for sure know who his friends were know who he was seeing we need to talk to other people who might know youve got the wrong guy ill take your word for it thats the deal youre telling me there are things going on up here i dont know anything about and im going to make a mess trying to find out okay i wont no mess you do it for me talk to peopledont tell me who just tell me if you find out anything about karl ill look somewhere else if youre right fine ill take your word for it but make sure thats your part of the deal no tricks no tricks youd be doing me a favor and your friends nobody wants to turn the place upside down the soldier stuck out his hand and took connollys christ i dont believe im doing this what does this make me an undercover cop connolly smiled well youve got the handshake down nobody knows about this promise connolly nodded by the way whats your name so i dont have to look it up batchelor he grinned yeah i know some joke maybe it was in the stars okay ill let you know if i come up with anything but dont get your hopes up im right about this just out of curiosity do you always know well sometimes you hope it would be nice to be wrong about you for instance connolly was shocked then laughed caught offguard am i supposed to be flattered no i think that about lots of people he said waving his hand in a mock salute as he left connolly watched him for a minute then turned toward the dormitory he felt cheered by the meeting as if a road sign had been replaced finally sending him on his way instead of around in circles but now there was the deflation of having to begin over los alamos began with a secret and now it seemed it lived on them one layer wrapped around another he wished for a minute to be back at the movie where everything was before you a shining selfcontained surface that stopped at the edge of the screen hiding nothing the car was still covered in early morning dew a film of rime catching the pale light but she came out in hiking shorts her long legs shivering in the cold she threw her knapsack in the back as she motioned him to the passenger seat are you trying to be provocative he said come on she said quietly its bloody freezing i want to get the heater going next time you could wear nothing at all youd like that would you she said pulling the car away and heading west youd be surprised how fast it heats up here itll be boiling in a few hours any trouble getting away not when you write your own passes she grinned at him and he saw that she was excited as if they were children ducking out of school and the day an adventure where are you going the gates that way he pointed behind them west gate well take the back roadits faster oh whats wrong nothing he said thinking about the investigation i just forgot there was another gate ive never been there you havent missed much in fact it was much smaller than the east entrance with a single sleepy mp at the barrier stifling a yawn as he checked the passes and waved them through theres tea in the thermos hope you dont mind but i hate drinking coffee all day as long as its hot they turned right onto route and climbed higher into the mountains the mist burning away from dense green forests of pine and aspen the heater blasted at their feet a cocoon of warmth and tiny streams of condensation streaked off the hood of the car you brought coupons she asked isnt that what im here for itll do for a start how far is this place anyway or are we just going to a hotel miles and miles itll take the morning so just sit back and relax oh but wait till you see it its marvelousnothing like it anywhere he watched her drive remembering the trip back from tesuque when he first thought it would be possible they kept climbing the sun rising with them so that when they finally reached the high ridge the land was flooded with light aside from one rusty pickup truck with goats in the back headed toward santa fe theirs was the only car on the road connolly rolled down the window breathing in a rush of fresh air and looked out across an immense valley of grass a handful of cattle were grazing clotting the rippling fields like miniatures in a diorama the grass arranged in folds of green velvet a series of peaks surrounded the bowl it was a world away from the rio grande valley with its low twisted conifers and dry riverbeds thats the valle grande she said nodding to the right except it isnt its really a calderayou know the top of a volcano it stretches for miles back there beyond those hills it just kept bubbling and falling in until you had this great lake of lava and now this its wonderful riding oppie likes to come hereyou can really let the horses out down the other side youre always running into arroyos but up here well she trailed off letting him watch the view you spend much time with oppenheimer a little not lately last year it was easier things werent quite so tense like him she considered yes oh it can be a bit much all that manofdestiny business but i suppose he is really hes difficult to read everyones difficult are you she laughed ask anybody they were in the high mountains now the trees close with patches of alpine wildflowers dotting the clearings by the road she was driving fast putting distance between them and the hill as if they were racing horses across the caldera the car throbbed a little as they climbed then galloped across the open stretches do you still have to go away she said no they made a mistake im back to square one she took her eyes off the road for a second to look over at him is that such a bad place to be not at the moment he said smiling trouble is you cant stay there no she said but maybe for a little while she put her hand on his thigh nothing more than a comforting pat but it jumped at the touch an involuntary spasm the reaction made her laugh my she said withdrawing her hand connolly felt teased embarrassed to be so sensitive to her you can put it back if you like mmm maybe later she said youll need your strength for the hike whered you get the boots by the way borrowed he was going to tell her about bruners closet the disconcerting moment when the boots fit as if he had learned something new about him but karl had been left behind at los alamos there wasnt room for anyone else in the car how do you manage this he said being away with your neighbors i mean eileen oh she doesnt think anything of it im always going off its my project you see thats the great thing about the hilleveryones trained not to ask so they dont what does she think youre doing what i am doingstudying indians whatever that means actually i dont think she cares really she just swans around in blissful ignorance listening at walls she giggled well thats something different isnt it what about your husband i left him a note she said quickly not wanting to talk about it in case hes back early then as if shifting into second god its good to get away isnt it look at this morning so he let it go glancing out the window at the shafts of light through the trees thinking about los alamos everything was secure so nothing was noticed then los alamos faded away too left behind in a rush of miles and the bright sharp air they were heading west where the day even the landscape was new they drove for a long time without talking as comfortable with the silence as an old couple and then he sensed the gradual beginning of the descent the dips seemed longer now the road twisting to skirt the uneven hills the speed theyd kept on the high ridge began to seem faster hurtling them toward curves so that emma was forced to brake to check the pull of gravity down the other slope they raced up the sides of hills unable to see over the top pausing carefully before the downward plunge the views were closed in a series of hollows and bends it reminded him of mountain roads in the east up and down waves of hills when they reached jemez springs a cluster of buildings stretched a few blocks along the road they had already slowed to thirty so he was startled to hear the short whoop of a siren behind them a police car its roof light now shining in the morning sun had slid out of its hiding place to follow them motioning the car over to the side oh god emma said pulling to the curb in front of a white clapboard hotel with the wide rockingchair porch of an old adirondack resort the policeman in full uniform took his time getting out of the car on this sleepy street in a notch of mountains there was never a reason to hurry maam he said in a cowboy drawl we got a twentymile speed limit in this town its clearly posted can i see your license connolly could see emma about to rise to the bait could already hear her sharp answer but her shoulders shrank in resignation and wordlessly she handed the cop her wallet oh another one of these he said glancing at the anonymous project license well i reckon we can write a ticket to a number just as well as a name he pulled out his ticket pad you from up that ranch school huh funny thing all you people with no names enough to make a person wonder but thats wartimethats what they tell me anyways you ought to slow down though live longer connolly recognized the tone the mix of folksiness and swagger as familiar as a blue uniform how much is it emma said ten dollars youre joking he looked at her sharply well no maam we dont consider putting our children at risk a laughing matter the road was deserted but ten dollars she repeated injustice rising in her voice he smiled well you can mail it in lots of folks like to do that be sure you do though well yank that license sure as shooting name or no name he handed her the ticket bending down to peer into the car you ought to get your wife here to slow down buy her a new dress cost you less in the long run ill do that he said automatically polite he was struck by the smooth assumption of it how easy it was to become someone else the policeman would probably swear to it bloody thieves she said after the cop had left connolly smiled its what we call a speed trap its how they make their living she had begun driving out of town with exaggerated slowness creeping along the street thats one word for it anyway now weve been arrested together you said this would be an adventure he noticed that she was trembling clutching the wheel to hold herself steady you all right it just gave me a turn thats all i must be mad to do this i run off with a man and ive got the police onto me before im even down the mountain he laughed i suppose it is funny but its not the police what if do you want me to drive its not the driving what then i dont know maybe i dont like being married off so fast maybe im not very good at this dont worry im not going to buy you a dress she smiled no you wouldnt she drove quietly for a minute i just dont want anybody to get hurt she said softly nobodys going to get hurt yes they are she said her voice distant were all going to get hurt he waited afraid now of easy reassurance does it make any difference he said finally she didnt answer then slowly shook her head no thats whats so awful it doesnt make any difference she shifted oh to hell with it she said suddenly stepping on the gas the car shot forward you never get two tickets in one day do you we might as well do as we like the road continued twisting downward its curves even narrower bordered only by a margin of soft shoulder emma hugged the center line letting the sloping grade make its own speed trusting the road connolly felt his ears pop here and there he saw signs of settlement the surprise of a few fruit trees blossoming after so many miles of dark pine the views began to open out to a wider sky until finally they were near the bottom and the hills disappeared entirely like curtains pulled back to show an immense panorama of red sandstone buttes and mesas a sky beyond measuring it was the most spectacular landscape connolly had ever seen on they drove on a highway river entering sandstone canyons dotted with slides of red rock and juniper whose walls grew higher and higher around them until they were completely surrounded by rock and then a bend in the road opening out again to a blue tent of sky this was the west he had always imagined and never seen not the cactus emptiness of the desert at trinity not even the greasewood and sage arroyo country of the rio grande but land that seemed to exist at the beginning of time monumental so resistant to man that it found its beauty in geology as if vegetation were a hapless afterthought the mountains to the right seemed the border of the known world before them the giant mesas rose up like islands from an old ocean floor the distances between them whole seas of sandy earth the walls were striated discrete sediment layers of white and yellow and maroon and red a color map of time with slabs of rock broken or withered into shapes statues of what might have been gods he felt her smiling beside him enjoying his reaction when they finally left the twists of canyon walls and headed straight across the empty flat plateau the promised heat arrived in a bright glare that flooded the open country with light they rolled down the windows now to catch the dry air baked with dust and sage clouds were everywhere darting back and forth making shadows so that the tawny grass would turn gray for an instant then gleam yellow again when they passed he saw chollo cactus and thin bushes whose names he didnt know survivors the sun burned through the windshield they were alone on the road nothing around them for miles but a desolate landscape alive with clouds and shadows and hot wind when they entered chaco wash they left the highway and bounced along a narrow dirt road trailing dust behind them like smoke emma slowed down dodging ruts and dry potholes with only a trace of moisture on their cracked muddy bottoms you said it was remote connolly said how much more of this twenty miles or so she grinned it discourages the fainthearted god lets not break down think of the anasazi they walked he looked out at the desert again trying to imagine it filled with people why here no one knows presumably it was wetter then but not much theyve found logs that must have been carried over forty milesso why not build where the trees were but they didnt its one of the mysteries what are the others mainly what happened to them they disappeared about eight hundred years ago just like that it all just stopped there were settlements everywheretheres a big one near the hill in frijoles canyonand then nothing they all died well the archaeological record did probably they became the hopis pueblo architectures much the sameblock dwelling kivas the lot but no one really knows its difficult without writing imagine the egyptians without hieroglyphics then how do we know their name we dont know what they called themselves anasazis our name for them navajo park service says it means the ancient ones but i read somewhere that it actually means ancestors of my enemies quite a difference of course that fits perfectly with the hopi theorytheyre still fighting the navajos here we are watch out for the park ranger nobody comes here anymore since gas rationing and hell talk your head off if you let him they were entering a broad open canyon formed by a long mesa along the north and two smaller ones on the south that opened like gates to the desert beyond connolly could see clumps of stone ruins backed against the walls of the canyon small villages placed up and down the valley a dusty official pickup truck was parked next to the building at the southeast end of the canyon road the park ranger an incongruous uniform in the emptiness stared casually at her legs as he warned them to take water on the trail but emma seemed not to notice his interest as if she had left all that behind in the miles of desert that separated them from the world in fifteen minutes they were back on their own the ranger another shadow as they ate sandwiches on the kiva wall of the bonito ruin their faces lifted to the sun with his eyes closed he could hear the faint movement of insects when he opened them the sound retreated back into the stillness of the canyon he looked over at her at the line of her raised throat running into the now blazing white of her blouse and marveled at their being here away from everything she guided him through the site pointing out the masonry patterns the low chamber entrances the arrangement of the rooms so that what had been an inexplicable maze of stones now became real filled with imagined life people had lived here moving from ceremonial kiva to irrigated field to storage room the valley floor had hummed with noise as they walked from room to room the place began to make sense there was an order to things and he wondered suddenly if years from now people would walk like this on the hill picking their way through its buildings and rituals and puzzles until they arranged themselves in the simple pattern of a town maybe it would keep its mysteries too and maybe they would seem just as inconsequential but why here he asked again it cant have been easy to farm here no emma said frijoles makes sensetheres a river there and mesa verdei havent been but presumably its green of course they liked difficult places they were always building on cliff faces and overhangs but i agree its a problem the archaeologists think there were as many as five thousand people here at the peak so it may have been an administrative center of some sort perhaps religious i think its more likely it was geographicyoull see what i mean at the top its pretty much in the middle of their territory so they may have picked it for just that reason you know an artificial capital like canberra or ottawa or washington or washington what are you looking at he took her hand im just looking she was flustered but pleased you havent listened to a thing ive said yes i have they built in the middle of nowhere because it was the middle keep the bureaucrats away from the fleshpots he leaned over and kissed her a soft long kiss because now there was so much more time thats never a bad idea is it she said her face still close to his i dont know maybe they need it more than anybody he kissed her again but then she drew away hell see she said nodding her head toward the park station connolly laughed all this way and its still the neighbors is there anywhere we can go he asked playfully taking in the vast stretch of land later she said pushing him away are you always so anxious no im shy i just hate to pass up an opportunity we could always go behind that wall no we couldnt if you think im going to lie down on a kiva for you youre very much mistaken but she had come closer to him afraid of disturbing the spirits maybe maybe i just dont fancy a stone floor you can be on top later she said again laughing at him come on you could do with the exercise but the moment had made the emptiness around them sensual he was aware of her skin in front of him as they climbed up the mesa trail her leg stretching to a rock footing flexing as it pulled the rest of her upward the heat was tangible now his body suddenly damp with sweat and the air was busy with the crunch of their boots on the rocks and the sound of breathing they climbed through a chimney between tall boulders the path cluttered with loose rocks and sand and the tough root of a broken bush when they cleared the top on a shelf of slickrock he found himself slightly winded his heart beating faster except for the hint of a little breeze everything around them still lay inert but the torpor of the valley heat was gone he felt alive with movement his leg muscles straining as they went up another steep stretch she looked behind her and laughed leaping goatlike to another rock daring him to follow the canteen tied to her belt slapped against her hip a trickle of sweat ran into his eye the trail switched back following a series of cairns he imagined the ranger had made then rose steadily on packed earth until the great ledges of slickrock began like sidewalks running around the rim of the mesa she waited for him on top her blouse sticking to her shading her eyes with her hand as she looked south to the valley floor from here the ruins below took on the cellular shapes of a blueprint circles and squares spreading out flat with only their dimensions to suggest buildings she handed him the canteen in the landscape nothing moved but shimmering heatwaves rising lazily off the desert they were the only things alive in the world they followed the slickrock around the edge steps away from steep drops into canyons but the path was level and broad and they could walk together moving quickly from the view of one site to another the strain had left his legs and he was unaware of his steps now buoyant sometimes not even sensing the cairn markers when she stopped suddenly sticking her hand out in front of him he almost pitched forward carried by the unconscious momentum she stood motionless not breathing so that the quiet was its own alarm he darted his eyes around not seeing anything on the barren slickrock until she extended a finger pointing silently toward the edge ahead of them on a ledge a few steps below he saw the gray gnarled twist of an old juniper branch nothing more and then his eyes focused and the branch sharper now took on markings of gray and brown in a thick unnatural coil the rattlesnake stirred slightly adjusting itself to catch the sun then settled back on the rock connolly stood frozen feeling his muscles twitch with fear it was the surprise of it the unexpected lurking while they paid no attention he had a city boys terror of wildlife it crept up on you alert only to its own rules frantically he looked around the trail for a rock even a stick to defend himself but the snake lay still coiled motionless in the sun connolly felt the slightest sound would arouse it but emma was already drawing him away stepping carefully from the edge he almost jumped when he saw it move a nearly imperceptible tremor along the markings as it began to uncoil he watched fascinated as prey while it sluggishly stretched out its length and glided down off its ledge to a sunnier shelf below unaware of anyone else in its garden emma continued quietly moving away and he followed her his eyes still on the ledge expecting the snake to spring back he was embarrassed by his own fear but his blood kept jumping shouldnt we kill it he said when they were farther down the path he wont bother us now he lives here you know but theyre poisonous she smiled calming him i know but they dont come after you unless theyre provoked the first time i heard a rattle i nearly died but he was just telling me to go away at least they give you fair warning not everything does what they dont like is being surprised i guess i dont either he said catching his breath ive never seen one before maybe youll never see another ive only seen two the horses spot them but theyre here you know they come with the territory she put her hand on his arm come on well go up to the pueblo alto just be careful where you walk its probably like speeding tickets you never get two at once but the snake had unsettled him the limitless space had been exhilarating and now made him feel exposed what if it hadnt gone away he saw himself holding an ankle full of poison miles from anywhere any cry for help muted by the wind he had thought they had got away that all this bright uncomplicated space was theirs and now he saw that he had merely intruded in it made unsafe by what he couldnt see they cut across the land to the center of the mesa where the high ruins were on the roof of the anasazi world there was wind up here constantly drying their skin and blowing their hair and as he watched her striding ahead the white sleeves of her blouse fluttered back like little banners he wondered what had brought her here coolly avoiding snakes and climbing over slickrock so far from the rainy hedgerows of hampshire but it was hers now he liked the way she delighted in the land as if she had made it all up at the pueblo alto they could see miles in every direction and she pointed out the faint traces of straight roads coming from the north then going out the valley to the south of course why they had roads is another mystery since they didnt have wheels not even pack animals apparently you couldnt walk for miles in that he said pointing to the desert but they did hundreds of miles theyve found macaw feathers that must have come from mexicoyou know on the gulf and conch shells from lower california somebody must have brought them they were sitting on the wall smoking connolly felt the heat of sunburn on his face but the clouds kept moving across the sun throwing the mesa into cool lateafternoon shadow right up that road too she said pointing toward the straight track between south mesa and west mesa cant you imagine it though feathers and beads and whatnota whole stream of people all coming here he smiled at her i dont believe it maybe a handful staggering with thirst its some place though he said looking around again yes it makes it all worth it makes what all worth it you know the hill the life there why dont you leave he said quietly where would i go i dont mind really as long as i can get away like this besides ive come this far i wouldnt go back now i didnt mean that i know she crushed her cigarette then stripped it letting the bits of tobacco blow away but its true just the same i like it here but it has to end sometime the projectll be finished and everyone go home do you think so i dont know i used to think thatit was all so temporary in the beginning but now i think itll just go on it has to end when the war ends you know what theyre doing there everybody knows we just dont like to talk about it its nicer to think of it as pure science she said an edge in her voice not blowing everything up anyway theyll want to make another something bigger perhaps we wont be going anywhere you cant just build a whole city like that and walk away from it they did here yes but did they walk away she got up tired of sitting and paced idly turning over a loose rock with her boot didnt they you like a mystery what do you think a question in school he looked out at the landscape and shrugged i think they ran out of water hmm thats the obvious answer isnt it but you dont think so they may have just moved on to greener pastures of course anywhere would be wouldnt it but then why not pack up they just left things you see pots farm tools i mean youd take your tools and valuables feathers shellsthe sort of thing youd take with you if you were moving on like your good china turquoise beads turquoise he said they left turquoise behind yes she said puzzled at his interest they had turquoiseit was their jewelry funny sort of refugees leaving jewelry behind maybe they thought theyd be coming back he said his mind in karls drawer now wandering but they didnt because they were killed she looked at him what makes you say that we dont know that nothing i was thinking of something else he stood up maybe they were too weak maybe there was too much to carry jewelry he smiled at her youre reconstructing the crime they say thats what archaeology is reconstructing the crime if there was one there usually is one way or another so what do you think she paused looking out again across the mesa i think the germans came the germans their germans i think they rounded them up and took them away his mind already distracted now leaped to magazine photos a man weeping at a cello why well theres never an answer to that she shrugged as if she could shed the thought with her skin this is a funny sort of conversation to be having maybe they did it to themselves what had some hitler who led them away or just went mad blew themselves up she looked at him again then crossed her arms holding herself dont lets talk about it anymore well never know anyway but wouldnt you like to know i suppose so but what does it matter maybe it was droughteveryone thinks so i rather like its being a mystery but if we knew then this would only be a place wouldnt it she turned to go come on its getting late the trail down was easier but they stopped several times to take in the view the white light of the day was gone replaced by the late afternoon sun with a deep yellow fire that colored the rocks part of the valley was in shadow and the sandstone had lost its bright reflection it was now just harder earth dark as dried blood by the time they reached the bottom even the sky had changed its steady blue beginning to streak with color my legs are going to feel this later he said rubbing his calf tired not too tired she grinned thats good weve miles to go where now well drive north to nageezi then cut across on the road to taos cant we stop at nageezi thats just for the maps there isnt anything thereits a trading post just a filling station when its open where then anxious i thought wed go to hannahs thats hours from here everythings hours wed have it to ourselves well be exhausted he said taking her by the waist you can sleep in all day he smiled lets go what if we find something on the way it would be a mirage she said getting in the car there isnt anything dont worryim worth the wait they said a courtesy goodbye to the ranger then headed northwest out of the valley into the orange sky this access road was rougher than the one to the south and connolly driving now cursed as the car bounced through deeper holes even on a straight stretch of dirt he was forced to slow down dodging rocks emma put her head back against the seat squinting dreamily into the light why did you ask about the turquoise she said mildly curious i was thinking about karl oh she said opening her eyes why him he left turquoise behind in his room it just seemed an odd coincidence hearing about it well not really a coincidence it just reminded me of it thats all what was he doing with turquoise she said genuinely surprised i dont know is that why he was robbed no it was in his room oh so its a mystery for now it is but you dont like mysteries she said i dont like this one she laid her head back again is it so important to you hes dead isnt he like my indians what does it matter what happened to them you dont believe that i suppose not but sometimesoh why not let things be let them be mysteries she looked out the window arguing with the landscape this didnt happen eight hundred years ago whoever killed him is still around i thought he was robbed in the park whoever did it must be long gone maybe maybe hes on the hill she was silent is that what you think its possible thats horrible then it wouldnt be an accidentsome robbery i mean you think someone murdered him planned to kill him he was quiet for a minute thinking planned thats interesting no i dont think so not planned i think it justhappened how do you mean he may have provoked someone like the snake he said a sudden thought they only attack if theyre provoked isnt that what you said well surprised theyre defending themselves thats all yes he said his voice drifting off again anyway it wasnt a snake murder she said softly no why would anyone want to murder karl but he wasnt listening what is it she said bringing him back what you said i hadnt thought of that what if he surprised someone doing what she said he didnt answer i hate all this it scares me you just want to believe he was murdered its too absurd things like that dont happen yes they do not here and then before he could contradict her but why not a robber its the obvious answer i thought you didnt approve of obvious answers but youre just guessing is that how this works you make a guess and see if it fits no he said thats how science works or so they tell me i need a little more than that she looked over at him is that why youre here it is isnt it the army just wants to know what happened she turned away to look out the window again so youll turn over every rock in the place i wonder what else youll find i havent found anything yet he said lightly not even one skeleton in the closet she looked back at him be careful you dont surprise someone too that would be one way of finding out wouldnt it im serious so am i he said still light dont worry i can take care of myself god listen to you it must be the irish cop in you which dont you like the irish or the cop she smiled the cop i suppose good not much i can do about the irish we can retire the cop though today anyway she shook her head maybe its all of a piece she laughed i never thought id end up going to bed with a cop technically speaking we havent actually been to bed yet he said smiling she put her hand on his knee a promise no we havent have we youll make me go off the road he said turning to her it was then his eyes off the road that they hit the rock there was a loud pop as startling as gunfire then the sudden lurch as they felt the car swerve to the right sinking to the flapping tire christ connolly said stopping the car now what the hell do we do do you have a spare in the boot christ he got out to look can you fix it this ones shot he reported well have to change it he looked around the empty landscape in the dwindling light do you have a jack whatevers back there theres some sort of toolbox i think she opened the trunk this i dont know what any of it is whats the matterdont you ill figure it out i thought americans knew everything about cars he didnt answer but instead started struggling with the jack trying to assemble the handle and getting down to look under the chassis can you manage it do you think she said lets hope so unless you want to spend the night can i help you can stand out of the light he looked up whats so funny you nothing you should see your face like a cross little boy do you have any idea what youre doing ive seen it done you have a better idea i could walk back to the ranger station and bat my eyelids and get him to fix it hed come like a shot ill figure it out he said fixing the jack in place she sighed men what makes you all like that anyway like what he said only half paying attention you never want to ask for help directions a man will never ask directions just drive round and round and never ask want to hand me that he asked pointing to a wrench she jumped up ready to help scalpel she said handing it to him sponge he looked up at her youre having fun i know isnt it awful i am ive always wondered what it would be like stuck in the middle of nowhere rather exciting its going to be a lot more exciting if we dont fix this before it gets dark never mind we can always sleep in the car theres something to look forward to he said absently unscrewing the lugs on the wheel oh poor michael still longing for bed jinxed thats what it is still theres always the car ive never done it in a car have you as a matter of fact yes really whats it like he stared at the wheel trying to determine the next step right now i dont know which is more annoying you or this tire all right she said ill be quiet thats the thanks one gets for being cheerful what is it like though in a car cramped she got a cigarette out of the car then sat near him watching him work the heat had gone with the sun and she drew her legs up huddling over them and smiling to herself in unexpected contentment after a while he needed the flashlight so she held it for him training its beam on the tire while she studied his face in the shadow i wonder what else you cant do she said besides fix cars i mean i dont know anything about you what do you like what are your politics why arent you in the army for instance eyes i have a lazy muscle in my left whats that you mean you dont see properly no the right compensates its not serious just serious enough to keep me out of the army they figured id make a lousy shot did that bother you for about ten minutes then i felt grateful there now you know something ive never told anyone what else she said softly i dont know hate team sports except baseball not very handy fixing things around the house either that help she shook her head uhuh what then nothing i guess thats a load off my mind he said absently still concentrating on the lugs damn the wrench clattered to the ground have a break she said handing him her cigarette his sunburned face glistened with sweat in the narrow light this is jolly isnt it she looked around and up at the sprinkling of early stars i love the desert at night it comes alive then dont tell me with what he took a drag on the cigarette following her gaze upward then settling back on her face there thats better she said we may as well enjoy it what breaking down mm being marooned can you think of a better way to get to know someone hundreds he handed back the cigarette is that why were here to get to know each other its away i wanted to get away from the hill i couldnt know you there and now you do a little you always learn something out here such as all sorts of things youre stubborn you like to finish things dont you she paused for a minute not always sometimes i justwalk away go somewhere else stubborn thats not much and youre jealous of whom the ranger well he was after you she smiled you see thats what i mean you just didnt notice oh i noticed all right that was just cabin fever you know cabin fever he couldnt take his eyes off you window shopping she said theres a difference one can tell like you im that obvious she nodded your eyes when at the ranch the musicevery time i always feel your eyes do you like that he said his eyes touching her now moving over her face what do you think she leaned forward to kiss him but you are jealous i cant believe everybody doesnt see you the way i do oh thats nice she said kissing him again tell me some more are you flirting with me he whispered his breath close to her no i told you she said brushing his cheek im just getting to know you isnt it lovely here this place didnt i tell you then he kissed her full on the mouth she lay back on the packed earth and there it was again the quickness to his touch as if her whole body were always waiting for even a trace of a signal he lay over her his elbow poking into the ground everything dark except for a sliver of moonlight his feet felt the rim of the tire behind them they heard the car before the headlights swept up the road catching them in the beams like the surprise flash of a camera connolly looked up his eyes dazzled then rose to his knees brushing himself off as he stood you folks all right the ranger said pretending he had not seen connolly caught the eager tremor in his voice he got out keeping his motor running his lights still shining on the small screen of an unexpected blue movie flat tire emma said getting up and dusting her blouse her voice cool and matteroffact well sure the ranger said these roads let me give you a hand lucky i happened along yes isnt it emma said and connolly could hear the faint beginnings of laughter the ranger looked at her not quite sure whether he should grin then at connolly to see what would be allowed but neither said anything and connolly saw him fall into awkwardness backing away from the silence with an embarrassed shuffle as if he were the one whod been caught for a moment they stood there listening to the hum of the idling motor unable to move in a second connolly knew emma would laugh turning the scene the rangers own excitement into an offcolor joke but suddenly the ranger took charge bending down to inspect the tire moving the spare into place emma watched amused as he twirled the lug wrench fitting the tire with sure swift movements in some exaggerated sexual display of competence connolly stood nearby not even asked to help frowning as he followed the performance then in a minute the ranger pumped the handle of the jack and lowered the car with an absurd sigh of climax he stood up wiping his hands on his pants there that ought to hold it you want to be careful in the desert not a place to be at night connolly glanced at him alert to innuendo but the ranger had lapsed into official courtesy unaware of any effect he might have had you best follow me out ill just go on ahead holler if you need anything and then his point made he swung into the carryall and started down the road emma looked at connolly her eyes laughing well there you are she said wiping her hands against each other as if she had done the job cabin fever my ass connolly said throwing the tools in the trunk and slamming it so they drove north for half an hour in the path of the rangers red taillights dipping and swerving while emma coaxed connolly into the laughter of a private joke the stars rolled out in front of them the darkness dissolving the horizon so that everything was sky connolly hunched over the wheel watching for holes in the road and when they finally reached the pavement of the highway and waved goodbye to the ranger his shoulders were sore they had the road to themselves again the nageezi post no more than a darkened shadow when they passed it emma fiddled with the radio but in all this space even the soundwaves seemed to have been swallowed by the dark trapped on the other side of some tall unseen mesa i could use a drink he said its indian land not a drop for miles maybe when we get to madrid will anything be open by then she ignored him leaning closer to the open window you can smell the sage we have to eat sometime hmm she said but her voice was content as if the rich night air were enough and after a while he didnt mind either following the small circle of their headlights in a trance once he saw a rabbit bounce near the side of the road but then it vanished just a dreamy speck of white and they were alone again he forgot the time stretched out now to match the distance so that they became interchangeable and the car sailed lazily by itself through both there were no signs or markers they had driven off the map it was almost another hour before he saw the light a firefly wink and then a candle until finally it became shafts of light pouring out the windows of a long building a few dusty pickup trucks were parked alongside their hoods catching the dim neon reflection of a beer advertisement when they got out of the car he could hear western music the place was as raw and makeshift as the buildings on the hill and for a moment he was afraid he had imagined it there seemed no reason for it to be here in the empty landscape just something conjured up because they were tired and hungry inside there was a brightly lit general store and next to it a dimmer bar area filled with smoke beer signs a gaudy swirl of jukebox and a few wooden booths that looked filled with slivers at the far end of the bar several indians in jeans and ranch shirts were drinking silently barely talking to one another the bar in front of them a sea of beer bottles nearer the door two old ranchers in western hats were parked on stools everyone looked up when they came in the indians quickly retreated into their quiet huddle but the ranchers looked openly at emma then smiled and tipped their hats behind the bar was a tall indian woman clearly of mixed blood her long anglo face set off by unexpected high cheekbones and long braided hair her breasts drooping from years of nursing spilled into a white blouse decorated with beads can we get a drink connolly asked sure she said her face as expressionless as her voice without asking she set up a boilermaker of whiskey and a beer there was no sign of anything else connolly handed one whiskey to emma youre like to catch your death in them shorts one of the ranchers said to emma nodding toward her legs like em emma said stepping back to display them the rancher laughed surprised at her boldness i guess i do emma took a drink thanks me too thats why i keep them to myself the rancher laughed again well i guess so then to connolly i dont mean nothing by it you dont see that every day around here oh i dont mind a look emma said well i guess not the rancher said goodnaturedly where you folks coming from so late chaco well now isnt that something i thought they closed it not too many goes out there these days with the gas they say its real nice though everybody in the west it seemed to connolly wanted to talk only the movie cowboys were silent i know its late he said to the woman behind the bar is there anything to eat she hesitated come on louise the rancher said you give these nice folks some of that stew aint nobody here going home anyways anything would be fine connolly said to her sure she said pouring two more whiskeys she pointed to a booth nice meeting you thats a pretty wife you got there the rancher said to both of them you ought to cover her up though never know who youre gonna run into oh she can usually take care of herself the rancher found this funny ill bet she can yes sir his eyes followed them as they went over to the booth to nurse their drinks another window shopper connolly said smiling well this one might be after a sample not like our boy scout really oh hes harmless he just wants watching can you always tell of course any woman can its what were trained for is that so uhhuh he looked at her aware now of the drink the booth seemed surrounded by a faint haze he took another sip what do you think this stuff is firewater she giggled youre not kidding he said holding his throat careful it doesnt go to your head like the song what song you dont know that song she shook her head just a song youll hear it sometime well go to a clubtheyre always playing it encourages the drinking like here she said cocking her head toward the jukebox still pumping out western music they dont need encouragement here if you can drink through that you can drink through anything god he said reacting to another sip id better slow down it always hits you when youre tired that was before when we were hiking and fighting rattlesnakes and then had to watch charles atlas kick sand in my face she laughed did we do all that on one lousy sandwich sounds wonderful she put her hand over his lets do it again he looked at her eyes bright in the smoky light whenever you say the indian woman stood at the edge of the table waiting for them to separate hands before she unloaded the traybig heavy bowls of mutton stew with a large basket of navajo fry bread she set the table with surprising delicacy placing clunky spoons down without a sound arranging a bandannalike napkin thank you emma said sure and another round of drinks when you get a minute sure she moved slowly away pulled by an unseen tug emma giggled do you think she can say anything else i havent heard one other word shall we bet on it a dollar no fair prompting okay hows the stew now i know why the anasazi went away that bad not when you close your eyes but it was hot and each thick gray spoonful filled him spreading warmth through his body like a wonderful liniment how do they stay in business do you think he said its probably just outside indian land theres always a place over the border to sell liquor he tore off a piece of fry bread amused at his own appetite when he looked up again from the stew he found her watching him part of the slow easy warmth that enveloped them now like steam the beer took on flavor as he gulped it they talked of nothing little snippets that kept them company as they ate then evaporated forgotten before the bowl was finished he had to sit back flushed with wellbeing his head buzzing gently now with halfheard sounds from the bar the loud twangy music had stopped he got up and went over to the jukebox hoping to find something before the ranchers could fill it with more nickels he scanned the selection slips glowing under the yellow light running his eye down one unfamiliar cowboy title after another and then unaccountably a wealth of music in the righthand columnteddy wilson lester young where had it all come from it was the last thing hed expected to find here he stood there for a minute fixated on the puzzle maybe the cafe was so remote that no one came to change the records maybe theyd siphoned off some free v discs the music was colored maybe the record company traveler unable to place them on his swing south had dumped them finally into a juke for indians what did it matter he fed nickels into the machine pressed the ivory buttons then came back to the table a silly grin on his face as the room picked up the tempo of sweet lorraine the piano dancing over the steady bass the ranchers looked at him surprised then turned back to mind their own business the indians never moved a stocky frieze they sat back listening to the music and smoking the stew bowls pushed to the middle of the table the indian woman came over to fill their glasses but didnt bother to collect the dishes as if she were still waiting for them to finish they didnt say anything for a while watching the smoke smiling at their luck its the mood that im in the music seemed to change the room like some slow trick of the light the rough edges receding so that the cafe took on the mellow glamour of the sounds all wet glass rings on a bar and ashtrays and the hope of taking someone home is this what its like she said quietly that club youre taking me to he smiled just like and wed sit and drink and look at each other and dance yes she looked lazily around at the ranchers and indians someday the record changed to the piano runs of teddy wilson opening the very thought of you looking straight at her he took her hand and stood up the drink making him slow and fluid at the same time an underwater movement here she said a little laugh her arm extended in his but her legs were crossed so she was unable to move why not he continued to look at her willing her upward with a gentle pull until her legs righted themselves and her body rose up leaning into his they stood still awkward his hand feeling the small of her back and then the music led them asking nothing more than one small conscious movement to start billie holiday was doing the vocal their feet slow with drink moved forward without their thinking the room slid into the haze of peripheral vision im living in a kind of daydream one of the old ranchers laughed at them and connolly looking over her shoulder grinned back joining in the joke they must look drunk but every inch of him felt her now he moved slowly lightheaded happy when she pulled her head back from his shoulder they looked at each other surprised the dancing was supposed to have been a joke a little parody of another life now it was something else another kind of joke he wanted to laugh out loud at the unexpectedness of it he had held girls like this before halfdrunken nights of good times and smoky rooms and sex but it was here miles from anywhere filled with mutton stew and cheap whiskey that it finally happened the hope of a million popular songs there was another record then another and they kept dancing too tired to sit down they didnt see the ranchers leave could he have had so many nickels the lights went off in the general store its late she said he nodded i dont know where we can go doesnt matter his words were slow part of the music she touched the back of his neck this isnt what you had in mind at all is it no but its all right and it was he wasnt thinking about sex he just wanted to hold her can you drive can you if i have some coffee but when they sat down moving dreamily away from the empty floor they found fresh drinks on the cleared table and they sipped them the coffee forgotten the music had stopped but it was too late to play any more they sat enjoying the quiet the faint rattle of crockery in the back room a scurrying of night sounds he couldnt stop looking at her when the indians left two of them supporting the third he only glanced at them for a minute then there was a sputter outside a roar as the pickup ignition caught and pulled away and it was quiet again the indian woman didnt bother them so they sat finishing their drinks warm with sunburn and liquor too drowsy to get up and go his legs were heavy glued to the scratchy booth when the woman finally came to clear the glasses she was dressed to leave an old army jacket covering the beaded blouse emma asked about coffee as connolly got out his money looking up at the woman for the bill there was no check she took a few bills then tucked them into her jacket no coffee back room she said indicating a door and leading them there she pulled the string of an overhead light to reveal a small storage room piles of boxes next to an old rolltop desk and against the wall a daybed covered with navajo blankets dont drive she said stay here then with a small smile nobody bother she refused any money waving off their thanks and then turned the bar lights off and was gone our suite at the waldorf emma said smiling at the linoleum and the narrow bed connolly stood under the light bulb unbuttoning her blouse i dont think i can move she said no dont he said kissing her the light she said he reached up and pulled the cord turning the room black in the pitch dark there was only touch the gritty feel of dust and the smell of sweat and liquor and when they fell on the bed their bare skin against the rough blanket they finally made love slow as dancing as if they had already gone to sleep they found the car on may th the day the war ended in europe connolly had spent the afternoon at a motel on the taos road a motor court with faded cabins that had become their usual place and had stayed late daniel had been spending most of his time at the test site but he was back again this week so they had to steal what time they could a few hours of afternoon on old sheets the sun dimmed to evening by dusty venetian blinds at first mills had been titillated by connollys absences but now finally bored with someone elses affair he scarcely raised an eyebrow more research he said when connolly turned up you ought to at least check in once in a while why did i miss something it was a standard joke between them for days weeks now there had been nothing to miss ramon kelly had been convicted a oneday excitement for the santa fe new mexican a longer run for the albuquerque papers and the hill had shrugged off the news with indifference and gone back to work karl bruner even as gossip was gone a few paragraphs on the crime blotter corporal batchelor a little nervous now at having come forward at all had found nothing to report doc holliday checked in regularly but more out of boredom than progress the files on millss desk sat undeciphered dusted once a week by the cleaning staff waiting for a new key all around them life on the hill intensifiedfurloughs canceled lights blazing at night as eighteenhour workdays raced to some uncertain deadlineso that by contrast they seemed at a standstill just holding their breath connolly to his surprise didnt mind he lived in the hurried measured hours of motel rooms there would be time enough later for everything else the car mills said they found karls car one of kistys men down at s site its been here all along no mills smiled nothing that good one of the box canyons off the plateau i dont understand join the club hell of a place to stash a car wrecked i dont know ive been waiting for you he glanced at his watch for hours in fact well lets go connolly led the way out of the office relax its not going anywhere weve got a guard posted we ought to call doc i did hell wait for us at the west gate mills met connollys glance i told him youd be back by five why five mills shrugged im in security remember i notice things youre always back by five why is that i wonder i figure somebodys got to be home a detective mills smiled it passes the time quiet around here lately feeling neglected me i like it quiet the germans surrendered by the way in case you havent heard connolly nodded youd never know it here he looked around the tech area as busy and undisturbed as ever oh theyll pop a few corks tonight you know the longhairswork first unlike some of us you mean no i figure youre pretty busy he grinned just thinking about it is what gets me through the days they drove past s site the explosives unit at the opposite end of the plateau a new industrial plant of snaking steampipes smokestacks and hangars of heavy machinery the tech area was the university but s had the raw utility of a foundry where blueprints were hammered into casings and people risked accidents who found it they were setting up a new firing range in one of the canyons off south mesa you know they like to keep the explosives off the hill yes its comforting mills grinned lucky this time anyway we never would have found it otherwise at the end of a road thick with conifers they found holliday standing at the gate chatting with the young sentry you took your time the sentry recognizing connolly gave an innocent halfsalute funny isnt it mills said catching the gesture all this time and ive never used this gate you he said to connolly once in a while connolly said not looking at him well i dont blame you holliday said to mills my friend here says they dont get much traffic anytime nights they just close the road so youd have to drive all the way around to the front pretty discouraging if you didnt know that but everybody does the sentry said his voice liquid with the south its just for hill people trucks go to the east gate and all us folks from the outside eh holliday said aint nobody from outside on the hill no well i guess thats right and here i was with my nose pressed against the screen just like always holliday followed their car as they skirted the plateau on winding switchbacks the mesa was like a giant hand with a series of deep canyons between its fingers some in turn breaking off into smaller box canyons that dipped away under the pine cover lying as hidden as secrets the car was in one of these a mile or so from the entrance turnoff at the end of an old dirt road partly overgrown with brush an mp was posted where the car had driven off the dirt to carve its own path into the canyon floor mills cleared them and they moved toward the car looking at the broken brush along the way why the road connolly said probably an old logging road holliday said they used to take a fair amount of timber out around here you notice that canyon just before this one theres a real road there they probably just gave up on this one thats the test range connolly said what exactly they firing there i dont know then catching hollidays look honestly theyre measuring projectile velocity mills said they looked at each other then at him he laughed well i asked thats what they told me you mean like how fast an arrow goes when you shoot it holliday said something like that sure are chewing up the trees to find out he pointed toward the end of the canyon where a series of test explosions had opened a rough clearing but why come here connolly said well if they hadnt started shooting things up around here nobody would have found it you know what i mean holliday looked at him you mean why so close to the hill connolly nodded i dont know lets see what we got first maybe its not even his but there had been no attempt to disguise the car the hill license plate the glove compartment registration were intact the paint in front had been scratched by the drive through the brush but otherwise the car was as karl might have left it the keys were still in the ignition switch thats a nice touch holliday said ive never seen that before can you have them checked for prints i could but ive got no jurisdiction here nobody does youre just assisting the manhattan project of the army corps of engineers connolly smiled at him war work you got a paper if i need it weve got nothing but paper i think theres some blood here mills said looking at the back floor yes sir holliday said dont touch that nowwell see if we can get a match try a church parking lot connolly said i guarantee it there was nothing unusual in the trunk aside from the bloodstains in the back where karls head must have been laid the car was clean let me try something connolly said taking a handkerchief in his right hand he got in and twisted the key the motor turned over and started he sat at the wheel for a minute listening to the hum running karls car as he had worn his boots when he turned it off the canyon was quiet enough to hear the birds why save the key he said handing it wrapped to holliday why anything holliday said these thingsthey dont have to make sense yes they do they dont have to be sensible but they have to make sense ill get the boys to go over the whole thing for prints holliday said ignoring him he was searching the ground too much traffic here kistys men mills said they didnt know it was a crime scene lets check it anyway connolly said you never know you want to square it with the guard he said to mills it was a polite dismissal and mills took it moving back to the road whats on your mind holliday said i cant see the logistics of this connolly said staring at the car as if there were a visible answer lets say just for the sake of argument you kill karl at san isidro you put him in the back and then you dump him in the park why not just dump him here he looked up at hollidays stare okay you want him found just the way you said like that like it was something else why not find the car too why not just leave it in santa fe near the park the blood i guess he said talking to himself maybe he needed the ride connolly looked up so where was his own car holliday shrugged he could have walked to the church if he was already in santa fe how did he get there youre assuming the guy was from here yes bus theyve got buses running from here dont they saturday night you got a few people on passes right connolly nodded thinking then why not take a bus back just leave the car holliday leaned against the car staring at the ground well what did we think happened when we found him that it had been stolen uhhuh which fit right that kind of crime bump him off and the next thing you know youre in mexico valuable thing a car in wartime you leave it on the street youve got somebody asking questions plus youve got the blood he said nodding to him so youve got to get rid of it seems a shame a nice new car but i guess you do but there are lots of ways to do that leave it in the desert push it over a cliff well the trouble is you never know how thats going to turn out it falls wrong or the damn thing catches fire you dont want to attract any notice you just want it to disappear for good or a good long while anyway and maybe you dont have time for any of that maybe you dont even have time for all the thinking were doing about it you just hide it here here like i said maybe he needed the ride he comes here the gate is closed nobody around maybe he knew the gate was closed then hed still have to get over to the east gate the only way to do that holliday nodded thats right if somebody else was driving his car connolly stared at the ground silent two i hadnt thought of that i dont say it happened that way just that it could have it makes sense there had to be another car could be and had to be are two different things but connolly dismissed him with a wave of his hand still thinking okay he gets the car here and someone else gets him back on the hill you agree hes on the hill id say it was indicated holliday said a cop giving testimony so why leave the keys why not just throw them away holliday sighed and took out a cigarette yeah why not ive been thinking about that maybe just force of habit you know you dont throw keys awaywhat for you dont want them on you but you dont know if youre going to need them again either you think he was going to use the car no i was thinking of something else he looked up searching the canyon rim with a turn of his head must have been pretty dark when he parked it here right so he cant tell if its been hid real good i mean that time of night you cant see anything so i thinkits just a guess nowthat he wanted to take another look in the day see what he could see what if you look down from up there he said pointing to the rim and theres this shiny new car even just a piece of it youd have to move it make sure it was really out of sight so he mightve left the keys just in case course he never thought you boys would be shooting up the place hes on the hill connolly said yes he is holliday said quietly or was hed be taking a hell of a chance coming back for the car mister he took a hell of a chance when he murdered a man as a ve celebration he took mills to dinner in santa fe following hollidays car down the back road past bandelier and the rio grande valley and the humpy stretches of twisted pinon and red earth the plaza was crowded the sleepy square awake with people waving little flags and drinking openly shouting victory with the bells of the cathedral it was early but la fonda was packed and they spent an hour at the bar before they could get a table do you really think hes fbi connolly said indicating the bartender thats what they say makes a great martini though mills said sipping at the rim of the wide glass maybe hell go legit after the war a good bartenders never out of work the fbi always finds something for them to do what about you after a nice house on the north shore nice office with a window wacker drive i think how does that sound nice yeah i know dull as hell christ its something isnt it to think this might be the most exciting time of your life and all i did was not get shot dinner arrived a broad platter of chiles rellenos and mills ordered another martini you could catch a murderer connolly said thats exciting you catch him hes on the hill connolly said slowly i know i figured what with the car and all he ate that what you and holliday were talking about connolly nodded you think hes still up there yes and that doesnt bother you no why should it it scares the hell out of me did it ever occur to you that if he did it once hed do it again but we dont know why he did it the motives easier this time you get away with murder and some guy tracks you down to nail you for it so you nail him first youd have to two guys tracking you connolly said looking at him thats what i mean ive never been a target before do you want to be reassigned connolly asked seriously mills went back to his food no thats all right he smiled youve got me interested now just watch my back will you be nice to get back to old winnetka in one piece he doesnt know connolly said he doesnt know i know hes there mills raised his eyes again he knows youre looking so they celebrated the end of the third reich with martinis and chiles rellenos as if the war had caught them posted somewhere overseas afterward pressured to give up the table they walked out into the plaza where people were shouting in spanish slightly rowdy but goodnatured it was beginning to get dark the warm pink and coral of the adobes fading back to earth do me a favor connolly said lets drive down to san isidro theres nothing to see there theyve been all over it a hundred times i know i just want to be able to picture it in my mind indulge me okay for a change it was slow going over the cerrillos bridge with the streets still filled with pockets of celebration parties but they thinned as the road headed south past gas stations and quiet houses there were a few cars in the alley next to the church and inside the glow of candles and the sound of voices mills idled the car across the street watching connolly study the building seen enough lets go in for a minute they must be saying mass they do this every night no we checked probably a celebration for the war not very many cars people walk its a neighborhood church only the tourists drive out here connolly frowned brooding then shook the thought away and entered the church it was crowded inside rows of women with shawls over their heads and men holding hats the small lights of votive candles licked against the whitewashed walls and the reredos intricate and dark during the day glowed now as if it were simmering on a low flame at the altar end of the narrow room carved wooden saints crude and bright with paint looked down on the congregation like primitive aztec gargoyles a priest was speaking in spanish at the lectern connolly felt he had literally stepped back in time the faithful had gathered like this for centuries fingering rosaries praying for rain while the rest of the world went to hell but these were the people who had beat the nazis too in the room there must be gold star mothers he wondered if they sent telegrams in spanish or if the bad news was the piece of yellow paper itself the army messenger from the outside their lives seemed timelessly simple hoarding squash and chiles sticky candy on name days but they had driven tanks and thrown grenades at scared frozen teenagers who were trying to kill them all those mad northern people who wantedwhat more room to breathe or something like that now a victory in europe and they had walked here only the tourists drove connolly stepped back out the door feeling like an intruder san isidro had nothing to do with them he asked mills to head for the alameda trying to imagine that other drive as they passed the quiet streets it was dark in the ribbon of park along the river but a few people were out strolling lit by passing headlights he saw one couple kissing against a tree mills parked the car by the murder scene without being asked and they sat looking at the bushes there are people connolly said finally why bring him somewhere where there are people there werent mills answered it was late it was raining but he couldnt be sure maybe he drove around until the coast was clear maybe its a park you mind your own business especially at night look at those guys he nodded toward a man walking unsteadily propping up a drunk friend under his arm whos to say he isnt dead whos going to ask you have an answer for everything connolly said lets go home mike theres nothing here but connolly not yet satisfied asked that they drive the back way to the canyon by the west gate retracing steps mills said as they climbed the road to bandelier i cant see it look we figure the cars here because the guy needed to get back to the hill right then why leave the hill at all youve seen the church if you were meeting somebody there are a hundred places on the hill that would be better why go all the way to santa fe to a public place i thought the idea was they didnt want to be seen together you know that was the idea its wrong mills looked from the wheel surprised connolly ignored him they could just go into the woods for that or for anything if the other guy was already on the hill exactly thats what doesnt make sense he was he must have been theres no other explanation for the car so why go all the way to san isidro to meet somebody whos just down the street i give up why he wasnt meeting karl mills drove in silence for a minute want to run that by me again he was meeting someone else someone off the hill its the only way it makes sense but karls the one whos dead he wasnt supposed to be there it wasa surprise you dont know any of this no im guessing but follow me tonight i stood there in that alley next to the church and i thought no one in his right mind would pick this place to kill someone open like that a mex neighborhood but no one did pick it it must have been an accidentan accident that it happened there i mean but it happens then what everything has to be done in a hurry you have to take some risks even all along weve been trying to follow karls moves how would karl see it what would he do like he was the criminal but all that stops in the alley its the other guy we ought to be thinking about what would he do tonight i was trying to imagine how he saw it and i had to get rid of a body i had to get rid of a car and i had to get home id say you did a pretty good job i was lucky too nobody saw the one thing i couldnt imagine though was karl if id wanted to kill him i would have done it somewhere else why go to san isidro to see him answer i didnt mills thought for a minute but he was there anyway another accident no he followed me now youre really guessing why not he was security wasnt he he was used to tailing people there isnt much of that we go with people guards we dont usually tail them thats fbi stuff but karl might he was capable of that wasnt he mills hesitated yes he said finally connolly looked at him what nothing he did tail people didnt he i guess so he knew thingswhere people went things like that he liked knowing things hed say something once in a while how else would he know i guess he must have been following them i never thought about it before yes you did all right i did but it wasnt official so what was it i figured it was just karl he liked being the sheriff you learn not to pay too much attention to things like that thats a hell of a thing for a security officer to say youre supposed to pay attention yeah well how did i know he was going to get himself killed for christs sake i just thought he was a nut like the rest of them the rest of who security theyre all a little nuts maybe you too how do i know look i didnt ask for this assignment i dont get shot and i keep my head down you stick it out and theres always somebody ready to chop it off you never know what anybodys up to for all i knew karl was fbihe sure acted like it so you dont look too closely just keep your head down and stay out of the way he wasnt fbi you know that for sure groves would have told me yeah mills laughed just like he told lansdale about you right youve got the head of project security sitting there in washington and his boss puts an outside man in and he doesnt know what the hell is going on hes a little nuts already now how do you think he feels i dont know connolly said quietly how does he mills looked ahead at the road saying nothing he asked you to report on me didnt he connolly said his voice low mills still said nothing didnt he im sorry mike jesus christ he felt disgust mingled with irrational fear the way he had felt the time his apartment had been burgled there was nothing to steal it was just the fact of someones having been there at all but now there was something he imagined emmas name sitting in a washington file tell him anything interesting no nothing like that mills said its just the case mike he wants to know whats going on he thinks groves should have put him in charge so your boss tells you to spy on me so he can spy on his boss all in the family nice i was ordered mike he said quietly what a fucking waste of time and whos checking up on you i dont know maybe you thats what its like maybe karl was connolly thought for a minute is that possible would he be asked to do something like that unofficially i dont think so why not i dont think they trusted him that way the way they trust you why not he was foreign everybody heres foreign thats what makes them crazy they cant trust anyone mike look i have to ask anything i tell you you can trust me connolly said his voice heavy with sarcasm they were driving around the bottom of the mesa away from the canyon where the car had been hidden back toward the east gate connolly looked out the window again imagining the drive that night i dont want any trouble mills said but connolly was lost in his own thoughts you have to admit hed be ideal from their point of view no you dont know them he was too smart for them you werent they didnt have much choice im the only one youre working with anyway im not a communist karl might have been for a while anyway that makes them crazier than anything i thought he was tortured by them or was that a lie too no theres no question about that he hated them but there it was in his file theyre not going to use anybody with that in his file i know they had me on the clearance files the first few months i was here lansdales like a maniac with that stuff van draseks worse you met him yet hes a real cutie crazy connolly smiled pretty high opinion of your colleagues theyre just following orders too but look whos giving them van draseks specialty is reds so he keeps busy you know what its like here half the berkeley crowd were parlor pinks the unions the negroesthe usual it doesnt amount to a damn thing but try to tell old van drasek that hes on a mission hes out at lawrences lab againgoes through the place over and over maybe hes just trying to get away from his wife wed all be better off hes serious though ive seen him deny clearance to scientists here and then call the university to get them fired a real vindictive prick and hes got lawrence running in every direction scared shitless theyll stop his funding hes got files on everyone i know you know a lot connolly said thinking of that first night millss shiny head bobbing at the square dance why doesnt oppenheimer put a stop to it are you kidding hes the one they want most theyve all got the knives out for oppenheimer you should see the file theyve got on him i have seen it not all of it you havent every meeting every check for the spanish refugees his brother the girlfriendshe was a party member his wife used to be married to one his studentsany kid thats left of roosevelt they blame on him it just piles up van drasek wouldnt even clear him until groves told him to fuck off and just pushed it through himself but why what does he think oppenheimers doing working for the russians why hes crazy hed love it if oppie were working for themthat would be perfect actually what it is oppenheimer thinks its bullshit and they know he thinks it which means he thinks theyre bullshit which they are but they cant touch him as long as hes building their damn bomb and groves protects him and the more he tries to get along with them the more they hate him theyre all obsessed with himthe crazies anyway i think thats why karl was following him he was a little obsessed too what well if he was i dont know for sure youre the one who thought he was following somebody i never thought it was oppenheimer i know it doesnt fit your story but hes the only one i can ever remember karl talking about he was interested in oppie why i think because they were karl was ambitious you know maybe he thought if he could get something on oppie hed angle himself a nice big promotion be one of the big boys of course thats where he was crazy because they didnt trust him either they had begun the steep climb up the hill connolly was thinking again so if he had anything on somebody hed want to make sure home at last mills said as they approached the gate and oddly it was connolly looked at the high wire fence the mps checking passes the rough buildings dim in the moonlight and felt at home somewhere to screen out the rest of the world was this what the killer had feltrelief at being back the canyon and the panic at the church behind him are you going to report our conversation tonight connolly said i have to write something mills said apologetically try this say that i have evidence karl was asked by lansdale to do a check on van drasek and accidentally get a copy to van drasek we could have some fun with them mills shook his head and smiled you have the fun i just want to get back to winnetka in one piece after they dropped the car at the motor pool they walked back toward the tech area the streets were quiet the usual lights still shining in the labs not even victory in europe interrupted the project just out of curiosity connolly said what will you write i dont know nothing much youre puzzled about the car cant figure it out he paused he likes to hear youre stumped makes groves look like a jerk for putting you in so i usually just say youre not getting anywhere im not and what if there was a genuine security breach while i was getting nowhere and he was looking good mills shrugged whats more important in the scheme of things somebody elses security or your own job theyve got a healthy sense of priorities in g nightcap no but ill buy you a coffee if the lodge is still open mike about all thisi couldnt help it you know i would never say anything connolly looked at him the pleasant eager face that avoided waves unless you had to mills looked as if hed been slapped never mind connolly said not wanting to push him its just the way things are now its the war yeah the war there were still people at the lodge smoking over leftover dishes and coffee cups the celebration dinners finished a few men from the office hailed them and mills joined them with something like relief tired of intimacy connolly sat with them for a while listening to the easy jokes ignoring the rest of the room because emma was three tables away she had glanced up when he came in then turned back to her table as if he werent there he heard her laugh the officers at his table were telling their own war storiesfeynman sending a letter cut into pieces to kid the censors the physicist who sneaked out through a hole in the fence and kept coming back through the gate a marx brothers trick he looked at their faces and wondered if one of them checked on the others an easy deceit was she aware of him they were ten feet apart no more did daniel see her glance over notice some nervous pitch to her voice he moved restlessly in his seat uncomfortable afraid of giving himself away but no one paid any attention he looked in the other direction toward a large table of scientists who were laughing at something teller was saying ulam metropolis and a few of the others surrounded him like a court and he was beaming with pleasure the center of attention the bushy eyebrows raised in arcs over the round vain face oppenheimers problem child and of course that was why he was happy oppenheimer wasnt there the table its little world was his connolly wondered for a moment what oppenheimer meant to them whether like millss boss they were simply waiting for their moment but it seemed absurd the table was genial the room itself filled with high spirits a bright faculty lounge on oppenheimers enchanted campus how had he managed it he listened people said he understood everything he kept the army away he defused the rivalries von neumanns mathematics fast neutrons diaper service everything people wanted to be with him at parties and according to mills they were out to get him was oppenheimer aware of any of it did he notice the jealousy and suspicion frosted over now in the consensus of getting the job done did he know that karl had been following him just another in a long line of checks and clearances too familiar to bother about a nuisance and was connolly any better another one of grovess whims blundering in on the scent of small scandal when there was important work to be done did oppenheimer resent him too connolly felt suddenly like mills wanting to explain to excuse himself he meant no harm to the project and he knew that one way or anothera crime revealed a husband betrayedhe would do it damage and his first impulse he smiled to himself like everyone else with a problem at los alamos he wanted to talk to oppenheimer he wandered out to the tech area nodding at emmas table as he left surprised by the shiver of guilty pleasure he felt at getting away with something it was easy to look at her now she was someone else here another person the lights were still on in main tech he showed his badge to the sentry mp at the inner fence and climbed the few wooden steps to the building inside it was quiet he turned left toward oppenheimers office then stopped in the corridor what after all had he come to say a report on the car a question about karl a complaint about lansdale excuses not worth his time the fact was he simply wanted to talk like an eager graduate student working out a proof when he saw that oppenheimers office was dark he felt relieved and foolish at the same time why had he expected him to be here so late yet it was part of the myth he was helping construct in his mind the brightly lit door was always open the door next to the office however was open fluorescent light pouring out into the corridor there was no one inside instinctively he reached in to snap out the light then stopped it had been years since he had been in a classroom and he stood there for a minute taking in the familiar smell of chalk and dust and dry radiator heat the room was smalla desk in one corner piled with books a conference table with chairs a blackboard and two narrow windows that faced ashley pond the blackboard had the chalk smears of a hasty eraser and connolly went over to it automatically picking up the eraser to finish he took off his coat and looked at the blackboard in school it had helped to map things out make the problem visual he remembered writing formulas on the board so clear when you could see them that the answer followed at the end he took a piece of chalk and almost without thinking began to draw near the bottom he drew the outline of an adobe church two squat towers and a cross with a side patch of alley with an x in it a line followed the cerrillos road up the board crossing the chalk arc of bridge and intersecting with the alameda the lines came quickly a squiggle of river a generic puff of bush another x then some of the city streets the rectangle of the plaza and off in the far left corner forty miles away the wavy ridge of canyons another x the chalky portico symbols of gates when he stepped back he saw everything he knew about the logistics of the case an algebra formula disguised as a childs map he held the chalk in one hand resting his elbow in the other as if he were staring at a painting in a museum how to connect the xes he was at the church he had come to meet someone karl arrived three cars faintly he heard the clunky governmentissue clock ticking over the board how many to the final x but thered been no signs of another car in the box canyon the building was still saved from eeriness by a background murmur of voices down the hall working late he stared at the map he could see karls car moving up the cerrillos road what about the others how many at the second x he stared until even the background sounds faded away rain headlights there must be a way to see the gasp from behind startled him he turned around to see friedrich eisler put a hand to his heart a european gesture of surprise i am so sorry he said flustered i didnt meanfor a moment i thoughtyou looked so like robert robert yes of course you are much bigger but the way you stood there with the chalk forgive me i didnt mean to disturb you he turned to go no please come in i shouldnt be here anyway i was just doodling eisler smiled yes doodling he pronounced it as an exotic word it was very like of course this was many years ago gottingen he would stand there for hours you know just looking at the board thinking but what kind of thinking that i could never discover once i saw him in the morning and i came back later and he was still there and then later all day just holding the chalk looking did he find the answer eisler shrugged and smiled that i dont remember he was your student a colleague i am not so old you know what was he like eisler smiled again so you too everyone wants to know robert what was he like the same of course not so busy in those days there was more time for thinking like you with the chalk connolly had moved away from the board and eisler looked at it puzzled this is not i take it a mathematical formula no connolly laughed embarrassed just a map i was trying to figure something out i suppose id better clean up he said taking the eraser but eisler was looking thoughtfully at the map his eyes darting from one x to the others no dont bother he said absently no one comes here perhaps youll find your answer like robert he turned wearily from the board to face connolly then you must tell me how you did it the process i always wondered the oppenheimer principle connolly said lightly yes well i leave you to your problem but connolly was reluctant to see him go i was thinking about something you said to me really what is that about the nazis giving us permission to do what we do yes today i thought theyre gone whos going to give us permission now eisler looked at him his gentle eyes suddenly approving a teacher pleased with his pupil my friend i dont know my war is finished that is for you to decide he stretched his arm back toward the blackboard you must use the oppenheimer principle with me its guesswork only the answers the questions are real keep asking the questions maybe you have to be him to make it work eisler sighed it will work for you too i think im not like him no perhaps not roberts a very simple man you know he does not he searched for a word dissemble yes dissemble he doesnt know how there is no mystery there hes a mystery to me eisler moved toward the door perhaps thats because you do dissemble mr connolly good night connolly watched him go his tired shoulders sloping as he went down the corridor when he looked back at the blackboard he saw nothing more than crude gradeschool sketches a childs problem no car was driving down the road nervous about a body no questions he stared at it for a few minutes then took up the black eraser and wiped the chalk away tomorrow there would be grownup numbers there outside he put on his jacket against the night chill the moon outlined the buildings with faint white lines he felt that he was walking in one of his blackboard maps this road went south from the tech area the box canyon was in the far distance to his right the longer he walked the more the map filled in until he could see the whole plateau fingers stretching away from the jemez toward santa fe he kept walking awake with coffee and the bright night sky but it had been cloudy that night perhaps already raining when the car pulled into the canyon dark and suddenly he thought of a question and started walking faster glancing at his watch as he headed away from the building toward the far west gate his luck held the same soldier was on night duty sitting inside the lighted post with a thermos and a comic book he looked up surprised when connolly said hello mighty late he said a question in his voice i was just out taking a walk its a nice night for it i guess he said all piedmont twang and suspicion i have a question for you you have any more of that coffee well sure nice to have some company whats on your mind he poured some coffee into the lid cup and handed it to connolly at night when they close the entrance what happens exactly well they close it i dont know what you mean they lower the crossing barrier to cars right but someones still here he nodded me usually ive been pulling night shift regular but if a car came by accident youd let him in they dont theres two barriers roads closed down at the turnoff so a car dont come up this far but youre here anyway the soldier smiled a sly grin well thats to keep people from going out aint nobody coming in that late but if they werei mean someone could walk in couldnt he walk the vowel spread into syllables just for the sake of argument someone could walk in right theres nothing to stop him well theres me id stop him if you heard him the soldier looked at him guardedly as if he were somehow in trouble and didnt know why id hear him you didnt hear me right now while weve been talking here someone could have slipped by outside couldnt he look im not accusing you of anything im just trying to get a picture of how it works it works fine the soldier said defiantly the vowel stretched again connolly stepped out of the box sipping the coffee as he looked around the soldier following him aint nobody going to walk you know he said still worried where they going to be walking from whos going to walk i dont know connolly said looking at the road the wide space at the pole the dark on the side nobody i guess i was just wondering it would have been easy no more difficult than a stroll you patrol out here or just stay in the post i got my rounds if somebodys complaining they dont know jackshit im up and down here all night even if it is cold but it had been raining a comforting drum on the post roof whats all this about anyway you got some kind of problem no theyre just looking over all the security points what for he said still suspicious its the army they dont need a reason the soldier grinned yeah i guess connolly looked up and down the dark road again one car not two hide it and walk in a long walk but safe enough worth the chance and then home how long you been on the hill he asked casually bout a year i guess i aint never had no trouble before you havent got any now i was just curious like it the soldier shrugged aint nothin to do beats combat though i guess you read about them jap divebombers theyre just plain crazy those people connolly nodded years a long time you must know everybody up here i just look at the passes we dont get invited to no parties thats only for the longhairs you know karl bruner the soldier looked at him his eyes squinting again in suspicion thats the guy who got himself killed there it was againkarls fault well somebody killed him know him i knew who he was i never talked to him or nothing i heard they got the guy he said a question yeah they did he use this gate much off and on so youd see him then the soldier shrugged again well sure if i was on duty they told me he liked to drive around yeah in that buick of his so he noticed did he ever have anyone with him the soldier looked at him puzzled as if he hadnt understood the question did he connolly asked pressing sometimes youre asking an awful lot of questions he said cautious again just one who used to go with him the soldier looked away is this some kind of investigation or something what do you want to know for connolly stared at him i mean hes dead i dont want to go making trouble for nobody that was his business now its just hers i guess hers well sure i figured they was justscootin off you know none of my business youd better make it your business i mean it you know who she was what she looked like i need to know this the soldier looked flustered well hell i thought you did know i didnt mean to start nothing how would i know well i thought she was a friend of yours too connolly stood still when he finally spoke his voice had the low steadiness of a threat are you trying to tell me it was mrs pawlowski the soldier retreated a step well god almighty you kept askin now dont go and blame me how many times connolly said his voice still unnaturally steady a few where were they going where and now his face no longer frightened filled with a sly grin as if the question were irrelevant i guess youll have to ask her he didnt see her until the end of the week he sat listlessly at his desk or lying on karls bed absorbed in his own mystery the days were hot and dry a steady wind scratching at everyones nerves the talk was of drought and an outbreak of chicken pox in the school and the frequent caravans to trinity the scientists seemed never to appear locked fulltime in the labs there were no parties a fight broke out in one of the enlisted mens barracks something to do with an insult taken but really about the new tension of the work and the constant dry wind that made everything feel as suspended as dust connolly didnt notice any of it something had detonated in him like one of kistys tests and he sat shuffling through the pieces repeating her conversations in his head wondering what had been meant what she wanted him to believe mills avoided him sensing the black mood that was smothering him and when connolly noticed him at all it was only as a figure of a more cheerful betrayal he read through emmas file and daniels as if they were new characters on the hill people hed never met why had she married him hed never asked how many others the mood festered in him silently until the surprise and hurt became pure anger and when that happened he stopped thinking about anything else one day he saw her walking past ashley pond and he wanted to run over and take her by the shoulders why did you lie to me but he couldnt bring himself to ask her and he realized with a sick feeling in his stomach that it was because he still wanted her the wind blew her clothes against her and there was that riders stride quick and straightforward utterly without deceit but why lie what had she to do with karl with any of it he drew his imaginary blackboard map but she didnt fit anywhere instead she was in another map an x at theater and the punch bowl lines to santa fe to chaco toand he saw that she was everywhere on this personal map it was about her everything that had happened to him was any of it true where had they gone maybe just a lift into town but the soldier hadnt thought so with his stupid sly grin the mp at trinity hadnt thought so either in this hot lazy afternoon with nothing to do but brood no one was innocent not even him hed just been the next in line when they did meet he was disarmed by her smile easy and guileless as bright as the day daniel had gone down to the test site again and they went to the ruins at bandelier dodging the hot sun on the shady path along frijoles creek down toward the waterfall that finally emptied into the rio grande she was glad to see him talking happily about nothing pleased to be out she hiked briskly along the trail in the boots and shorts she had worn at chaco when things were different but in fact it all seemed the same so clear and bright that for a moment he felt the weight of the past few days was nothing but an anxious dream one of those nights whose gloom and dread were burned off by morning she laughed when she washed her face in the stream splashing him he watched her how easily she moved through her part and he smiled back unwilling to let her see him watching he wanted her to say something a disingenuous moment so he could begin but she hiked back in high spirits and he waited they ate a picnic near the tyuonyi kiva again like chaco with the sun overhead there were no sounds but the stirrings of lizards and the faint hot breeze that blew the cottonweed seeds like bits of snow you can see why theyd come here she said her voice lazy and contented water bottomland storage bins she pointed toward the caves hollowed out in the soft lava tufa above them nothing like chaco but they left yes she said facing the sun with her eyes closed strange isnt it in the quiet they heard a muffled explosion from one of the distant test canyons a wave of intrusion from the hill they looked toward the sound alarmed but then it was over and everything was still again she leaned back closing her eyes to blot it out did the germans come here too he said stalling i suppose they must have she said not opening her eyes or maybe it was the priests its always the priests isnt it some bloody archbishop leading them to the promised land some idea the navajos were frightened by it when they came found all these readymade cities and never moved in wouldnt touch them maybe they were the germans no at least we dont think so she said a seminar we no sign of fighting at all anyway theyre not like that theyre lovely in the creation myth one part of the darkness makes love to another and the one on top becomes light and rises up to be the first day its lovely that she said her voice soft think of ours god blundering about making this and that busy everything done in a week no wonder we blow things up what happens after they have sex the dark and the light they make the wind the life force i love the navajos for thateverything beginning in bed they really say that of course she said lightly would i lie to you i dont know would you she opened her eyes and looked at him but he didnt say anything more and she let it pass theres quite a lot of sex in the myth the earth and the sky make love and the moisture between them the sweat waters the earth and makes everything grow do admit its a lot nicer than god just waving his hand here and there making zebras and things its funny though they dont seem sensual at all the indians but i suppose they must be her voice drifted away so that in the quiet it seemed she had been talking to herself she sat up and lit a cigarette staring out at the swath of green near the creek waiting for him to speak a penny for your thoughts she said finally whats wrong nothing he said why should anything be wrong i dont know youre all coiled you havent touched me all day so something must be wrong youre not the navajo type he said nothing working a stick in the ground making idle patterns i want to ask you something and im not sure how he felt her stiffen beside him an almost imperceptible movement like one of the tiny lizards flitting behind a rock oh perhaps youd better just ask then tell me about you and karl she exhaled smoke as if she had been holding her breath and continued to look ahead what do you want to know everything oh everything you told me you scarcely knew him but that isnt true is it you were seen with him quite the detective she paused is it so important she said softly of course its important he was murdered well i didnt bloody murder him she said facing him why did you lie to me i didnt lie to you its nothing to do with this it wasnt any of your business you did lie to me have it your way then she said getting up its still none of your business tell me he said standing what does it matter it was over tell me he shouted his voice breaking through the still air like the far explosion tell me she mimicked all right he was my lover better her words hung in the air as if neither of them wanted to pick them up why he said finally why why he asked me i suppose im easy you ought to know they glared at each other tell me he said quietly she broke the stare looking down to rub out her cigarette last year a few times it didnt mean anything why didnt you tell me maybe i didnt want you to think i was that kind of girl where where she said exasperated places there are places you know santa fe nowhere weve been if thats what you want to know she said angrily someplace on the road to albuquerque look it happened i cant help that it was over what do the details matter youve no right yes i do did you love him stop it did you of course i didnt bloody love him we had sex i enjoyed it i didnt enjoy it is that what you want to hear anyway it stopped i didnt want daniel to know i was afraid youre not afraid of anything im afraid of you she said then looked away you want too much tell me everything where did you go did you enjoy it were you ashamed all angry and wounded as if it had anything to do with you i didnt even know you it had nothing to do with anybody really except him and then later he was killed what did you want me to do run over and tell everybody in security that wed been having it off in some motel down the road i was relieved i thought nobody would ever know and it didnt matter that there was a murder investigation why should it i didnt know anything about that even when they said it was a homosexual murder she looked stunned what are you talking about they thought karl was homosexual they still do they convicted a man because they thought it but why she said bewildered thats crazy he wasnt that you never told them otherwise she shook her head confused and angry thats not fair i never knew you never told me come to that he was killed in the parkthats all i ever heard a robbery why would anyone think she trailed off still trying to digest it youre sure what do you want to know she snapped what we did in bed is that part of the investigation it was lovely all right maybe he thought i was a boy how would i know it didnt feel that way to me emma whoever killed him tried to make it look like that kind of crime probably so we wouldnt look anywhere else he succeeded there was no reason to think otherwise nohistory until now thats why i had to know thats all is it is that what this is about i only went to bed with him you know i didnt kill him he turned away from her squinting into the sun his voice toneless and quick as he questioned her did you go to santa fe with him that night no of course not it was over long before that did you ever go to san isidro no yes i suppose so when i first came here everybody does oh what does it matter stop this i cant you mean you wont youre putting me on trial for what did i hurt your feelings well im sorry this isnt about us she was biting her bottom lip isnt it i thought it was emma he said patiently he wasnt killed he was murdered that means there was a reason its important youve got to help me she looked at him disconcerted by his tone what do you want me to do tell the police i slept with him that theyve made a mistake no it wouldnt make any difference they dont care she stared at him for a minute taking this in but you do i just want to know no thats when you were just a cop now youre judge and jury as well ive told youisnt that enough i went with him ive done it before you werent the first why him i dont know he was goodlooking maybe i was bored it just happened is that so hard for you to believe yes why does it disappoint you did you think i was better than that it wasnt like that he said evenly sure now it didnt just happen how would you know oh you think you know something you dont know anything leave me alone she turned to walk away but he grabbed her arm bringing her back and holding her youre lying to me again leave me alone just a casual fling with karl no karl wasnt like that he liked to know things thats what he cared about he knew something about you so you slept with him because he made you or maybe it was your idea to keep him quiet thats what happened isnt it was it your idea leave me alone she shouted pulling her arm free and moving away from him what was it emma he said to her back what was so important that youd do that did you give him money too or was the motel enough but she was walking away from him go to hell she said the low wall of the kiva stopped her and she stood against the piled stones looking down the canyon not crying but heaving gulps of air connolly moved toward her slowly afraid a quick movement would make her bolt when he spoke his voice was gentle soothing a startled horse emma youve got to tell me he was killed you were the only one who knew him i didnt know him she said her back still to him i just slept with him they dont always go together i thought i knew you karl was blackmailing someone he began again he was getting money if it wasnt you it was somebody else dont you see what im saying theres somebody else ive got to find out who youre the only one who can help me she turned to face him her eyes moist i cant please but i will find out you know that dont you ive got to why why you because theres been a crime and this isnt just anyplace it isnt new york its not even santa fe its a weapons lab thats what theyre doing here not science theyre making weapons secret ones so everythings different why do people get killed money there isnt any money here sex maybe that would have been convenient for everybody but what if its about the weapons they cant stop until they know so they wont if its not me itll be somebody else is there really anything so terrible you couldnt tell me youve got to trust me that much do i she said her face creased in a sarcastic smile i wonder why because im going to find out anyway she looked away letting her shoulders slope wearily yes i suppose you will she said coolly for the good of the country or something nothing to do with you a patriot that was one lovely thing about karl he wasnt a patriot you can trust someone who doesnt believe in anything the rest of you she walked back to where the remains of the picnic lay and lit another cigarette where do you want me to start my first husband he believed in everything mostly himself it turned out you were married before yes matthew i seem to have a run of ms all great believers too anyway we were youngi suppose thats no excuse but we wereand he was a great rebel and so i adored him he was fun i dont think you know how boring england can be sunday roast and all the eligibles in the tatler and matthew wasnt having any of it the peoples revolution was his line god all those treks to highgate to see old marxs grave my parents loathed him so when he went off to spain to fight the fascists naturally i went with him my father always said id end up in gretna greenthats where the wild girls elope tobut it turned out to be madrid instead that dreary registrars office not even a clergymanyou know how the comrades are about that actually they werent very keen on marriage either but free love in the trencheswell it wasnt madly me was it you can only take the country out of the girl so far so there i was senora matthew lawson international brigade you were a communist she hesitated as if his question had interrupted a reverie he was she said more seriously drawing on her cigarette party membership the lot you had to be really in the brigade i was justwhat in love maybe away on my adventure not that i didnt admire him for it i did tremendously he believed in something no one else seemed to you know the world is always coming to an end at that age and no ones doing anything about it except thenwell it really was wasnt it i thought he was right anyone could see the germans were up to no good and of course all the people one despised most didnt seem to mind at all uncle arthur he actually went to the olympics and said how inspiring it all was the fool that was typical but matthew he knew he actually did something and then he was wounded nothing serious a flesh wound it turned out but i didnt know that then i thought he was going to die you can see how romantic it was me all weepy next to the cot in that awful field hospital and the comrades crashing around in spanish shooting anything that flew over and my brave matthew stopping the fascists with his body while everyone back home was just out in the garden and being mean about the minersoh i was having my adventure sounds rather pathetic now doesnt it it wasnt though it was romantic exciting she stopped looking toward the creek as if it were the past then shook her head well never mind you dont want to hear all that you want to know about karl that was berlin we went to berlini never knew whether it was matthews idea or the partys the partys i suppose i dont know if he had any ideas by then he liked being a soldier it suited him which is odd when you think of it since hed never obeyed an order in his life but now he did i suppose he thought they were moving him back from the front lines to some other unit anyway we went not so romantic this time though it was useful to them to have an englishman there the huns always gave us a wide berthi suppose they thought we were all like uncle arthur the german comrades couldnt do much i think they were paralyzed with fear i know i was but matthewwell naturally he was up for anything id no idea what he was actually doinghe kept telling me it was better my not knowing but of course that only meant i imagined the worst i hated it terrible little flats not that i minded that really i was doing a course at the university that was our cover and students werent expected to live high and god knows it was better than spain berlin was pretty if you werent being thrown into jail you could have a good time there but i hadnt come for any of that i was justisnt it awful i suppose i was actually a camp follower just like those women they used to drag along except my soldier was never there he was always out fighting the good fight and of course it was the good fight so you couldnt complain id go to the meetings just to be with him you cant imagine the dreariness of it all secret and squalid andendless hours of it matthew would natter on and id just drift off i doubt he even noticed i was there but karl did at least he said he did i dont remember him being there but i wasnt seeing much of anything then except matthew and how miserable i was but karl remembered me evidently i made a striking impression so she got up and began to walk absently kicking small stones as she paced so you went to bed with him because he saw you at a few meetings she snorted a pretend laugh i said id tell you what happened i didnt say it would make sense his stare followed her as she paced waiting when was all this just after he got here i was getting a pass and he recognized me and then later he asked me about it wondered why it wasnt in my file and why wasnt it nobody ever asked i was just a wife daniel was vetted in london they knew id been in spain so had lots of people it was the thing to do maybe no one there thought anything of it but you know what its like here she turned to face him look i was scared is that so hard for you to understand being here is all daniel ever cared about you know what happens if they pull your security clearance i couldnt do that to him just because his wife went to some silly meetings they didnt mean anything anyway i dont even remember what they talked about it was allinnocent but would your lot believe that why didnt you tell us before who else was there you know what its like theyd never trust him after that is that where you met him at the meetings no she said dismissively he didnt know anything about that we met at the university so it was your little secret i didnt think it mattered it didnt and then laterwell then it was too late theyd always want to know why i hadnt told them in the first place i just wanted things to go on as they were no one was the wiser what did it matter but karl was wiser yes so you decided to do daniel a real favor and make a new friend she stared at him thats right i needed a friend and was he a friend she shrugged and turned away pacing again what else why should there be anything else because there is emma half the people on the hill went to political meetings ten years ago you didnt sleep with him for that maybe i wanted to who knows why we do things why do you what else oh leave me alone what happened in berlin to your husband i dont know she said he left just like that yes just like that he deserted me she looked at him for a reaction i guess my charms werent enough to keep him he must have had something more important to do but where did he go ive no idea i never heard from him i assume he died given everything did you try to find him no he left me you see he didnt want to be found what did you do go back to london no i stayed on you stayed on in berlin with a missing communist husband nobody knew he was my husband that wasi dont know part of it look i know it sounds silly now but things were different then he didnt want anybody to know for my sake in case something happened what the hell was he doing oh dont get your hopes up he wasnt the cominterns man in place or anything like that at least i dont think so probably just leaflets and setting up those awful meetings but he liked to pretend it was dangerous maybe it was anything was then i suppose anyway he thought so so you stayed emma shrugged again i didnt fancy running home to daddy id made my bedi thought id better lie in it in berlin he said skeptically living hand to mouth with the nazis in the street thats right stupid wasnt it he watched her as she lit another cigarette not meeting his eyes tell me emma he said quietly she blew out the smoke raising her head to look at him i was pregnant he waited for a minute but she simply continued to smoke staring at him what happened i got rid of it i killed it god well what was i supposed to do she said her voice breaking for the first time i didnt mean that didnt you well never mind it doesnt make any difference i had ittaken care of one office visit easy really not so easy to arrange though the germans had views on that sort of thing she snorted matthew always thought he was so frightfully clandestine try finding a friendly doctorthat was the real secret world how did you daniel helped me she said simply surprised no german would have touched me but he knew the refugees they were always open for a bit of business im sorry dont be it was a long time ago no for asking she nodded yes it makes things different doesnt it its not always nice knowing things and thats why you helped him get out she smiled wryly take one life and save another maybe it was something like that i dont know i didnt look into things then i just did them maybe you can sort it out for me her eyes were moist i dont know why im explaining all this to you hardly what you want for your report is it no anything else then while youve got the light in my face why did it stop well theres a question because i asked i just couldnt anymore and he agreed he didnt insist threaten you threaten me karl it wasnt like that youve become as mad as the rest of them he didnt bloody blackmail me im sorry but he didnt thats what you want to think he never threatened me he knew things ordinarily it wouldnt have matterednot exactly the end of the world to go to a meeting is it but in a place like this it wasawkward okay there wasnt time to sort anything out i thought theyd send daniel packing so she paused looking away anyway its done now youll tell them anyway so it seems i neednt have bothered but he didnt care she considered this for a minute as if the idea were new to her you know oddly enough i dont think he did oh he was fond of me in his way but in the end i dont think it interested him very much he wasntpersonal he was afraid of it its hard to explain once he had his file complete i think he just wanted to move on you liked him i felt sorry for him its a terrible thing not being able to trust anyone prison did that i guess i often wondered what happened to him thereoh i dont mean physically the fingers and all that but inside it made him a little crazy i think goblins everywhere she paused wiping sweat from her face with her handkerchief anyway he came to the right place for it here he got paid for not trusting anybody i think he liked that better than sex all theuntangling he was excited by that maybe it was just prison all over again get them before they get you he couldnt help it anymore he always thought somebody was out to get him somebody did yes she said then went over to gather up the picnic things i think youd better take me home now ive had enough time in the confessional its not as good for the soul as they say connolly watched her pack the knapsack gracefully picking up the cups making room for the thermos what was she thinking for a moment he thought he finally understood the pleasure karl took in it that tension of not knowing of wondering what was true did he ever mention anyone else what any other bad security risks no he followed her to the car dont you think its strange his just letting go like that i didnt say he was pleasedhe just didnt make a fuss thats all i didnt think about it i was relieved maybe he was too maybe he found someone more interesting when youre paranoidisnt that the word theres nothing more boring than an open book no mystery there after all he knew everything about me he stopped at the car door do i she hesitated i thought you did she said softly everything that mattered i thoughtwell never mind what i thought she busied herself putting the pack in the car then stood up looking at him over the roof there is one more thing i wasnt going to tell you but you may as well know maybe it will make a difference to you she hesitated again still not sure karl waswell karl was very good at what he did you know he knew things that even i didnt know dont ask me how he waited i suppose you can find out anything if its really what you care about she said to him with a wry halfsmile he knew that matthew was still alive i thought so did i id no idea you can see what that means cant you she said her voice pleading i was frantic daniel only got out because of the marriage now hes british you thought theyd send him back no not then she said her voice trembling we werent exactly sending trains into berlin but what about now if the marriage isnt real what happens to him is he supposed to go back to poland i cant let that happen to him they wouldnt do that how do you know i didnt so logical i couldnt be dont you see i couldnt think straight all i knew was that daniel would have no legal status at all and it was my fault i had to do something so you went with him yes i went with him she said almost shouting it always comes back to that doesnt it i needed time i thought after the war id sort it outi couldnt do it here besides no one knew except karl yes except karl and now you michael im asking you dont dont ask me she bit her lip again her face resigned at least karl you dont know what youre asking i cant help it i saved him oncei wont let anything happen to him i thought it all died with karl do i have to buy you too or have you already had everything you want get in the car they drove up the dirt canyon road in silence emma looking out the side window her face blotchy but dry connolly stared at the road as if he could quiet the jumble in him with a grip on the wheel you can have the marriage annulled yes she said absently how did karl find him no more please how hes here connolly almost stopped the car in surprise here on the hill no in the states for years karl used to keep tabs on aliens who were friendly to the comrades it was his specialty remember where is he i dont know new york he was anyway karl lost track of him when he left washington and all his precious files there it shouldnt be hard if you want to find him do you no did karl tell him karl didnt know him he was just a name in a file does he know where you are nobody knows where i am im a post office number box santa fe new name new person she trembled again i got clean away remember a lovely new life they were approaching the turnoff road for the west gate let me off here ill walk in he looked at her walk yes walk why not im a great hiker didnt you know i could do with a walk now besides theres my reputation to consider he stopped the car well she said not wanting to get out yet ill see you emma what you said before about his not blackmailing you there must have been someone else theres the money she smiled sadly you never give up what are you suggesting that i gave him the idea is that my fault too once he saw how easy it was with me he went on to better things maybe he did you find out michael i dont care she opened the door half getting out will you put us in your report too when he opened his mouth she put her fingers to his lips barely touching them no dont say anything i dont want to hear itits all in your face do what you have to do ill just get out here she kept her hand on his face a braille touch keeping him still i seem to have made a mess of things havent i you always want things to make sense sometimes they make sense and its still a mess she ran her fingers across his mouth as if she were kissing him it was nice for a while though before it was such a mess no dont say anything she dropped her hand and got out of the car then leaned through the window youd better go on first itll look better he sat there for a minute not knowing what to say and then it was too late she had moved off to the side starting to walk and when he put the car in gear and saw her in the rearview mirror she was looking somewhere else he drove back to the office random phrases darting through his mind so quickly he could not assemble them they bounced off each other uncontrollable until all they lived for was their speed fission he knew in some part of him that he had no reason to feel angry or betrayed or shamed at his own inability to know what to do how he ought to feel but the feelings bounced off each other too like glandular surges that swept through his blood drowning thought he saw her with karl in some motel room like theirs sweaty and half lit she had felt sorry for him and karl what had he felt surprise at his good luck or did he worry wondering what it all meant but he had kept quiet cared enough to lie for her now she wanted him to lie another karl for daniel because she cared enough to protect him but not enough to be faithful but who was he to accuse her of that hed never even thought about daniel before betraying him again and again because for them it had been different as natural and carefree as a hike through the canyon i didnt know you then but what if she had would it have been any different it always comes back to that she had walked in through the gate i thought it died with him but no this was crazy youve become as mad as the rest of them and suddenly he felt for the first time what it had been like for karl this endless noisy suspicion ricocheting so loudly inside him that he couldnt hear anything else and when it stoppedand now it didhis mind blankabsolutely nothing she disappeared in the rearview mirror he felt as empty as karls room when he parked and walked through the tech area fence his mind was still cloudy and preoccupied but it was weber who didnt see him bumping so hard into his shoulder that he was stopped in midflight ouf pardon pardon he said in the allpurpose french used in crowds at railway terminals he looked up at connolly dimly through his glasses trying to focus his memory ah mr connolly the music yes im so sorry im late again you see no my fault i was just thinking weber smiled thinking he said savoring the word for us now its only the work so close he fluttered his hand in the air every day a new deadline but no matter were almost there the w was a v so i hear weber looked up at him sharply a pinprick of alarm then put it aside too absorbed to pursue it we all work too hardeven thinking you look like robert all the troubles of the world no time even for music do you play connolly smiled to himself no but i like to listen good good come tomorrow a small gathering so many at trinity now of course before connolly could answer weber started off his mind busy again with formulas connolly watched him go bustling toward the gate encased in his private bubble he seemed the very soul of the hill all distraction and yeast cakes and the determined icepick at the dance but the sudden jolt to connollys shoulder had awakened him like someone shaking him to get up for work he knew that later he would sink back into his private obsession the terrible feeling of having broken something he didnt know how to fix but what did any of it have to do with the case at least there was still that he thought of weber peering up trying to place him karl had known emma right away all she had had to do was walk into the office when he got to his desk however he simply sat there staring not sure where to begin whats wrong mills said nothing why i dont know you look funny everything all right as rain he said absently then aware of mills watching him picked up the phone to call holliday howdy doc said when he got on i was just about to call you let me ask you something connolly said briskly you examined the body well i saw it could a woman have done it not unless she was one hell of a strong woman he was hit more than once you know kicked too not many womend do that at least i hope not whats on your mind nothing never mind just a little crazy i guess its the altitude you ought to watch that they say half the people up there are crazy connolly said nothing running his finger along the edge of the phone his mind elsewhere want to know why i was going to call doc said finally im sorry yes sure youre going to like this cheer you right up you know those bars you told me to look into the ones we havent got turns out you were right we got one connolly said nothing but looked up from the phone puzzled now i suppose i got to keep my eye on it wish i could say i was better off knowing about it but i doubt it i dont understand im getting to it turns out there was a little loose talk there and one of my boys heard about it course everybody was quiet as a mouse before but now that theyve got the guywell you know how it is a few beers and doc all right all right hold on you going to let me tell this my way seems one of the customers was in the park that night taking care of a little business he dont want to talk about that though anyway point is he saw someone taking old karl into the bushes just like you figuredthought he was drunk car pulls up and before you know it the two of them are heading somewhere quiet our boy dont think nothing of it tell you the truth sounded like he was annoyed didnt want any company around what was he doing there said he was taking a leak holliday paused yeah i know looks like i got to keep an eye on the alameda now too all kinds of stuff going on i didnt know about did he get a look at him nope said he was tall tall thats right now ramon he struck me as on the short side wouldnt you say so i asked him about that but he says tall course given what he might have been doing there maybe anybodyd look tall what else nothing else next thing he knew was when he heard the car driving away like i said he didnt think nothing of it and then when it comes out theres a body found there well the whole thing just goes right out of his head you know he didnt see his face no tall thats it i asked connolly was quiet so what have we got he said not much hes not even what youd call a real witnessall he saw was two guys going into the bushes one of them drunk court of law it wouldnt mean shit but he saw what he saw only reason i got it out of him now is he probably thinks it was ramon he saw and its all over anyway hes the nervous type but i figured youd like to know you werent imagining things happened just like you thought yeah thanks doc what about the car in the pause connolly felt he could see doc smiling oh i almost forgot that he did see that funny thing isnt it he didnt see the guy but he did remember the car let me guess if you said a buick he wouldnt argue with you you still holding him no ive got no call to do that i could charge him with something but why would i want to go and do that and stir up everybody he was practically pissing in his pants the way it was now whats all this about a woman you on to something up there no nothing just thinking out loud trying to figure out you know how strong uhhuh ill be down in a few days ill fill you in whats the matter your phone tapped suddenly he was karl again his hand instinctively recoiled from the black telephone as if docs words had carried their own shock of course oppenheimers phone his naturally theyd do that he looked over at mills blandly signing forms paying no attention he tried to remember everything hed just said imagining it typed up one carbon for the files was there a phrase that drew the eye that would have to be passed along his mind was busy again mike doc said but dont let them know that you know that click you hear is me hanging up doc he said easily i have to go ill call you and thanks then the receiver back in its cradle he looked at it again they had every right to know thats what they were all doing here karl at least had known that had stayed alert after a while he felt mills looking at him now what mills said nothing ive been thinking you know those security files karl had noticed her right away intimately the vetting and the updates i want to see everybody who arrived on the hillwhen was the first two hundred bucks october lets say from september on just the new arrivals foreigners how many do you think there are mills shrugged some the tube alloys group came through canada about then theyd all be foreign but not americans if they were naturalized first i want the ones who were vetted abroad mills raised his eyebrows whats up were looking for any leftwing historygroups contributions popular front any of it communists not officially what was it karl said to you its whats not there i think thats what karl knew a communist who wasnt there mills looked at him for a minute what makes you think so a hunch a hunch thats right connolly said looking at him directly okay ill get started on the arrival list you want to look at all these yourself it was another question both of us connolly said but no one else no reports mills stood in front of the desk raising his palms in a kind of pleading its my job mike connolly looked up at him just a soldier following orders but what he heard was himself talking to emma mad as the rest of them and then the noise in his head began to clear and he felt ashamed trust me a little he said and now the voice was hers he went out to ashley pond shrunken now in the drought and walked around its necklace of dried mud the late afternoon sun burned against the windows of gamma building making rows of little fires the hill as always was in motion trucks grinding past scientists rushing to meetings and secretaries in wobbly heels heading to the px on their break it all went on behind him around him while he stood apart on this margin of water karl hadnt said anything why out of some improbable decency no maybe he thought it wasnt really over that he could always return when his new interest had been satisfied or maybe he thought there was nothing to tell just another european story they would never understand questions would have to be asked about him too already compromised what good would it do he lived to protect himself now in a world of tapped phones and secret reports and files that told everything about the past except what it meant you had to be careful loyalty was a bargaining chipyou had to hoard it until you could play it to advantage and meanwhile the hill would go on around him too indifferent busy with itself connolly saw him standing by the same pond outside of things looking for a way in why would they trust him the germans hadnt the russians hadnt would his new masters be any different unless he had something really important to offer something more than a sloppy vetting so he waited if it was true connolly picked up a small rock threw it into the pond and watched the water rearrange itself like thoughts he thought of emma at the memorial service coolly walking out on daniels arm saw her at fuller lodge her back to him laughing maybe everything was a performance the practiced story but he had made her do thatit had all been for him hadnt it he had made her lie and now he distrusted the lie he started back toward the dormitory looking down at the ground as he walked maybe karl hadnt been sure either waiting for something more he only had her word for it what did karl really think he thought he was beginning to know him but karl didnt exist he could only imagine him the dormitory was quiet even the pingpong table empty and connolly went straight to his room he sat in the chair by the window with karls file staring at the picture that would somehow make him real dark intelligent eyes had he trusted her but karl didnt trust anyone goblins everywhere he came to the right place for it maybe he hadnt felt like an outsider at all maybe he had liked it his files and his private suspicions and the adrenaline thrill of a hunt maybe hed felt at home he knew how to live here what he was expected to do but what did he have for it a car some money just in case and now the secret of his own death half the people up there are crazy connolly stared at the room and realized with a shock that it looked exactly the way it had on his first night did he live here a shaving kit on the washbasin a bag in the closet a book otherwise the same neat empty he hadnt expected to stay but the room in washington was no different temporary until the war was over he was living in other peoples stories for how long then the war would be over and he would be back in his own where nothing would happen unless it already had he felt a panic so intense that it swept over him like a kind of nausea if he sat back in the chair now he would disappear into karls room waiting to be sure he threw the folder on the floor and got up standing so quickly that his head felt dizzy when he hurried out of the building blinking at the sun his head was still light but he felt his body coming back filling up again there was room now for everythingthe insubstantial buildings the clotheslines flapping white the smell of gasoline when he reached her building he almost laughed remembering that other time turning left turning right the neighbor with the coffee this time he knocked without hesitation loudly so that when she opened the door she pushed against it as if he were a gust of wind he looked at her face the details of it his own story what do you want she said still holding the door im in love with you oh she said a sound not a word a reflexive whimper her body went soft exhaling shoulders easing as her eyes filled the door seemed to open by itself pushed by the same wind and he was inside for a minute they just looked her eyes fixed on him moist with relief but not crying moving with his alive with conversation you came back she said im in love with you he said again she put her hands to the sides of his face and brought him down to kiss her short drinking kisses like gulps yes she said into his cheek do you know what that means no tell me smiling now teasing him then she kissed him again no dont so much talking dont say anything else i dont care about the rest i cant lose you no she said her head back shaking it happily no you cant tell me again come to bed and this time she took his hand and led him into the other room the drought had brought summer early and with it one of the electrical storms that usually waited for july outside webers house connolly could see the giant dark anvil of a thunderhead rolling toward the mesa the sky crackling with branches of lightning that shot through the air like xrays leaving an inverted image on the eye inside an indian maid was refilling the coffee urn edging her way through the crowded living room despite the absentees down at the test site the room was full the low thunder outside barely audible over the noise of the party voices nothing seemed to have changed kitty oppenheimer was again curled up in a corner of the sofa while johanna weber scurried about playing her hostess memory trick the air was close warm with bodies and connolly bored and beginning to sweat had been there only a few minutes before he began planning an escape weber came to his rescue asking him to fetch eisler from his lab hes always forgetful friedrich but its the beethoven without him we cant the music was outside deep cello moans of thunder under the viola staccato of the moving clouds for once there was no dust even the earth was holding its breath eislers lab was near the edge of the plateau not far from x building where the cyclotron was and the rain began before connolly could reach it so that he sprinted the last few yards now the noise was everywhere and when the wind banged the door behind him it was lost in a crack of thunder the hallways brightened for a minute with lightning and connolly expected the dim of a power surge but the overhead lights were steady when he opened the lab door and stepped in the sounds were hidden by more thunder so that eisler was unaware of his coming he was about to call out but instead stood for a moment watching afraid to interrupt eisler was bending over a table in front of a blackboard stacking small plumcolored metal cubes in a surrounding well of what looked like soft aluminum blocks critical assemblies his body was tense his long fingers barely moving with slow precision in the noise of the storm he seemed to stand in his own vacuum oblivious to anything beyond the table connolly watched as he tentatively lowered his right hand dropping the metal a fraction then held it still to listen for the increased clicking sound his whole frame rigid with concentration so this is what it was like this awful attention tickling the dragons tail then he straightened for a minute staring ahead at the blackboard as if it were a mirror and took a deep breath when he bent over again his movements were fluid no longer hesitant and connolly watched fascinated as he lowered another cube in a steady deliberate push suddenly the clicking erupted and a blue light flashed in the room some terrible new lightning and connolly gasped eisler whirled around seeing him for the first time then swept his arm across the pile of blocks knocking them over to the floor with a crash connolly instinctively froze the blue light and the frantic clicking noise stopped for a moment they held their positions connolly listening to his own ragged breath eisler looking at him in anguish when connolly moved eisler held his hand up in warning please stay where you are he said calmly youve been exposed then slowly with the inevitable movements of a dream he went over to the blackboard ill be with you in a minute mr connolly he said distantly absorbed how many meters would you say ten the blocks lay scattered at his feet now just harmless metal he picked up a piece of chalk and quickly sketched an outline of the room like one of connollys maps then began to fill the space to its side with the numbers and signs of a formula connolly stood trembling watching him move his chalk across the board methodical as a madman what are you doing he said finally his voice hoarse scraped by shallow breathing the effect of the radiation eisler said his back still to him it cant have been more than two or three seconds thats something but its the distance that matters its good you stopped where you are you have good manners mr connolly he said dispassionately as if it were no more than another factor to compute not to walk in they may have saved your life you did connolly said shaking involuntarily eisler turned to face him unless i have taken it he paused we will have to do some tests then sensing connollys shock i think you will be all right it was a very small exposure but what happened was that a chain reaction oh yes eisler came away from the board his shoulders drooping i am so very sorry mr connolly i didnt know but whatwhat should i do connolly said his voice still urgent and unsteady do theres nothing to do eisler looked at him then moved over to the table we must go to the infirmary but first you will permit me one note connolly watched hypnotized as eisler wrote on a sheet of paper so fast a simple flash what if he died radiation poisoning was a grisly painful death everyone knew that but nobody knew anything minutes ago he had been hurrying through the rain just a flash like a bullet in combat here as far away from the war as anyone could get may i ask eisler said why you came here weber sent me to remind you the beethoven ah the beethoven he said wistfully he will have to wait im afraid we must get you to a doctor right now as he moved forward connolly involuntarily stepped back no dont worry its not contagious i am not myself radioactive it doesnt work that way connolly flushed sorry and then embarrassed that it had not occurred to him before but what about you are you all right eisler shook his head gravely but his voice had the tone of a wry smile no mr connolly for me its fatal its in the numbers you see he said pointing to the board the numbers dont lie they lay side by side on the small infirmary examination tables as nurses drew blood samples and the doctor ran tests that incongruously reminded him of an annual physical is there anything wrong with me connolly said i dont feel anything well just keep you overnight to be sure the doctor said then to eisler how long did you say he was exposed a second two three it was not significant there have been worse cases eisler replied but he was looking at connolly reassuring him they dont know you see he said gently they put you under observation but what can they observe so now we are to be roommates just for the night the doctor said just to be sure but he meant connolly the questions the light reassurances were directed to him eisler lying quietly in his hospital smock would not be expected to leave he was dying connolly knew it when oppenheimer arrived eisler had busied himself sending apologies to weber politely teasing the doctor making small jokes to connolly about the makeshift hospital so that it all seemed no more unpleasant than an interrupted seminar then oppenheimer came into the room his porkpie hat dripping with rain and connolly saw his pale face the bright quick eyes for once still and afraid robert eisler said softly oppenheimer looked at him a silent exchange then took off his hat i came as soon as i heard he said his eyes never leaving eisler im sorry robert friedrich he came over and took eislers hand the gesture surprised connolly it was something new in oppenheimer he had seen frustration even a kind of haunted wisdom hed never seen simple affection well have you moved to albuquerque oppenheimer said falling back on authority eisler smiled albuquerque and leave the project what could they do in albuquerque here is fine ill have it all to myself mr connolly here will be leaving tomorrowhes quite all right oppenheimer took him in for the first time what the devil were you doing there he said quickly and it occurred to connolly that it might have been his fault the interruption robert robert eisler said soothingly you blame the messenger it was nothing to do with him an accident stupid my own stupidity are you all right oppenheimer said to connolly an apology connolly nodded i guess so how did it happen he turned back to eisler the dragon it went critical you can see the notes i told you yes yes a thousand times how long was the exposure long enough my god friedrich oppenheimer took his hand again disconcerted and connolly felt the impulse to turn away his face to the wall its a risk robert thats all you dont take risks every day how else can we go forward it was foolish perhaps but now theres much to be done we have the moment now we need to calculate but oppenheimer had got up and was nervously lighting a cigarette glancing toward the open door robert a hospital its my hospital oppenheimer snapped drawing some smoke he turned back its over friedrich he said quietly i cant allow it allow im not dead the effects arent immediate you know there will be a week maybe two i can still im asking you to stay here or albuquerque eisler looked up at him to protest then seeing his face settled back on his pillow under observation yes oppenheimer said reluctantly under observation eisler was quiet for a minute so i am to be the guinea pig friedrich no of course you are right i myself should have thought of this each day we observe and then in the end we go a little forward but you will allow me to help organize it the experiment friedrich no no please we are not sentimentalists its important to know we can observe the elements break downhow the body reacts oppenheimer walked over to the sink and doused his cigarette under the faucet im not asking you to no not you i volunteer its my idea my wish for the project eislers voice was clear eager it seems fair it should be me connolly looked over at him puzzled but there seemed no irony in his voice he was back at the blackboard going about his business getting ready to keep the chart on his own death oppenheimer turned away from the sink and connolly saw that his eyes were moist is there anything i can get for you eisler thought for a minute you have morphine for later ill need that i think im a coward when it comes to that and theres nothing to learn then just the pain of course oppenheimer said almost a whisper nothing to learn eisler repeated the nurse drew a screen between them at night white cotton stretched on a wheeled frame but connolly couldnt sleep he had never been in a hospital before and it unnerved himthe constant light in the hall the discreet sound of rubber soles in the corridor even once the faint smell of nightshift coffee but eisler was quiet behind his screen so connolly was forced to lie still as well listening to occasional bursts of rain on the asphalt shingles of the roof he would drift into a kind of halfsleep then find himself peering at the shadows on the ceiling his mind moving from one to the other making pictures until he no longer knew when he was awake he saw eisler bending over the lab table then emma biting her bottom lip then oddly his friend lenny keazer who had been killed in new guinea shot down connolly wondered whether hed seen anything more than a flash before the plane tipped he had never imagined dying before now he saw that it was being nothing and everything else just went on lenny didnt know whether theyd won orbut what was the point it wouldnt matter if you werent there karl found his secret and then it didnt matter and eisler whod said his war was over then connolly was back on his street in washington home that afternoon with the bay window of the little room open to the spring air magnolia trees and he leaned out to see the brown army car move slowly down the street looking for house numbers was anyone else looking out holding a crack open in the curtains a soldier got out across the street carrying an envelope and walked up the steps to the house and the next thing connolly heard was a scream a long wail that tore the air a sound from the ancients a lamentation he watched the soldier get back in the car and drive away then a truck drove down the street the paper boy on his rounds another car and everything went on that had been the afternoon he thought he had seen the war the brown car going down one street after another it would be worth anything to end that a quick flash and it would stop the japanese finally startled out of their mad reverie a hundred to save a thousand a new kind of mathematics did oppenheimer think of it that way the rain woke him a little spurt of gunfire and he heard eisler breathing the fancies of the night the ceiling was dark like the blackboard and he filled it with chalk marks so many minutes so many meters eisler had saved his life then calmly gone about his business connolly had been the surprise he closed his eyes looking at the lab again the steady hand on the cube the cool dispassion of science he watched eisler bend over carefully inching the metal down and suddenly he knew what was bothering him all this fitful dreaming there hadnt been any accident he had been the accident quickly corrected the cube had been deliberate it had done just what eisler had wanted it to do not an accident he heard him tell oppenheimer an easy lie he wanted to be nothing connolly turned toward the screen his whole body awake now and listened the breathing was light barely audible not the heavy patterned rhythm of sleep professor eisler he said quietly mr connolly eislers voice was alert politely surprised when you said before that it was fair it was you what did you mean eisler did not answer right away when he did his tone was interested as if the phrase intrigued him did i say that i dont remember you must havewhat is the sound equivalent of a photographic memory the question disembodied seemed to rise in the dark connolly stared at the ceiling waiting for it to float over the screen he said nothing i suppose i meant that one of us should feelwhat the effect of what were doing here yes you might put it that way wont people be killed outright like an ordinary bomb most yes but there will be others we just dont know but why you eisler was quiet for a minute i cant say mr connolly some things even i cant answer he paused then more lightly maybe you will tell me you must use your oppenheimer principleyour leap in the dark on the map how is your other problem coming along connolly felt he was being diverted his ear searched for nuance in an idle phrase but clearly eisler wished to be left alone with his demons not very well he said playing along ah eisler said but you will get there im sure the elegant solution yes i think so but nowyou dont mind a little sleep connolly said nothing and after a while the breathing deepened and he fell in with it so that he wondered whether theyd talked at all or whether hed been having a conversation with the dark the next morning brought a flood of visitors weber was there early fluttering then a graver fermi then bethe and what seemed to be all of bathtub row they nodded politely to connolly or ignored him drawn to eisler with an embarrassed mix of concern and prurient curiosity like people at a highway accident no one stayed long and no one talked about the radiation once in the room good instincts and duty satisfied they were at a loss talking around the incident until they could excuse themselves to work only teller asked for details precise and brisk a consulting resident brought in for a second opinion by the time emma arrived connolly was dressed waiting to be released she looked at him in surprise expecting to find him in bed and her eyes filled with relief she smiled at him a broad involuntary grin then caught herself and turned to eisler the ostensible point of the visit you too mrs pawlowski eisler said has everyone heard news travels fast she said bad news well i dont think johanna weber makes the distinction eisler laughed out loud connolly realized it was the first time hed ever heard eisler laugh and for a second he was filled with an odd embarrassed pride that it was emma who could make the joke it flustered her however and she said apologetically how are you feeling no dont be somber eisler said gently everyone here plays the nurse tell me the gossip what else does frau weber say shes baking you a cake excellent eisler said smiling and connolly thought again how little he knew anyone last night he had spoken to a dead man and now he saw the eyes were alive and playful taking delight in a young woman had he been like this at gottingen with oppenheimer a world ago they talked making an awkward joke about angel food but it was connolly she had come to see and her eyes kept moving away sliding over to where he sat on his bed the night screen now gone eisler courtly in his smock seemed not to notice but mills caught it immediately he stood in the doorway looking at them like three points of a triangle and connolly could see him putting it together a theorem proof he raised an eyebrow at connolly as he walked in lieutenant mills eisler said at last a visitor for mr connolly or have you come to arrest me arrest mills said eisler leaned forward conspiratorially to emma my parking tickets we have to give them to him and then he scolds us what do you do with them he said to mills do you make the apologies then again to emma but i cant help it if the space is straight i can do it but to back up for those little slots its too difficult my driving he waved his hand mills smiled a little surprised by the party atmosphere parkings the least of it he said to emma joining in hes a menace behind the wheel not only there it seems eisler said smoothly indicating his presence in the bed no one knew what to say connolly felt the air go out of the room in the awkward silence mills turned to him you look all right he said im just waiting for my walking papers eisler aware that the atmosphere had changed now looked moodily down at the bed id better be going emma said getting up she went over to eisler and put her hand on his arm youll let me know if theres anything i can do for you he patted her hand no nothing mr connolly here will get my few things he said a question to connolly who nodded its absurd im still all right but now im a prisoner here my jail he said with a nod to the room just walk out emma said sympathetic they cant make you stay but where will i go no this suits me cmon mike mills said fidgeting lets go fix you up with the doc mr connolly eisler said as emma and mills headed for the door you dont mind a few things no of course not some clothes i dont want to be in bed im not an invalid not so soon do you have the key the key eisler smiled its not locked we never lock things at the project theres nothing to steal anything else books you pick do you know german no well pick anything and he looked up to see if the others had gone yes if you wouldnt mind a bible please he smiled no not for the angels im a scientist you know but i like the stories so simple an eye for an eye wonderful stories ill get one of course the angels eisler said wryly nothing is proven you know not yet outside the three of them walked together for a while then mills with a pointed glance at connolly spun off to head for the office im just going to get cleaned up connolly said ill be over in a bit take your time ill cover he said almost winking im good at that he tipped his head a little bow to emma he knows connolly said watching him walk off i dont care i had to come connolly smiled the reports of my death were greatly exaggerated its not funny i was out of my mind with worry what if it didnt im all right he put his hand on her arm facing her no not here i thought you didnt care but not like this not in the open oh i dont know what i want anymore more time i guess until i know what to do she said almost to herself but youre all right thats the main thing now i feel silly what must eisler have thought charging over there i hardly know him well enough for that i dont think he noticed he has other things on his mind poor man she said hes the nicest of the lot too its not fair all your life and then one slip it wasnt an accident what she said stopping it wasnt an accident she stared at him for a minute you mean he tried to kill himself he did kill himself hes just waiting it out she shivered thats an awful thing to say how do you know i was there but why he shrugged and continued walking i dont know i dont know if he knows its all mixed up in his mind something about the gadget he feels guilty about that i think he sees this as a kind of penance i dont knowis there ever a good reason can there be thats insane maybe anyway its his life i doubt well ever know funny your saying that you always want to know everything she said not looking at him not this time they had reached the turnoff for connollys building emma stared down at the drying mud in the road i wish you hadnt told me its sounhappy all alone like that oh michael she said looking up dont letswhy shouldnt we be happy when i heard this morning are you happy now he said taking her arm again she nodded all right and miserable happy miserable scared everything all that dont tease anyway its your fault what do you want me to do nothing just come tonight thats all she said looking at him thatll make it better no but come anyway then in broad daylight she took his hand and put it against her face for a second before she walked off he showered and changed and headed for eislers apartment the office millss smug discretion could wait eisler lived in one of the sundt units a modest onebedroom that was nevertheless several steps up from connollys spartan room there was a fireplace with a morris chair and a floor lamp to one side and indian carpets scattered over the hardwood floor it was clean without being really tidyold coffee cups still in the sink a tie flung over the edge of the couch there were books everywhere a pipe near the chair another on the nightstand and rows of shelves lining the wall full of german books some bound in leather others with the yellowing paper of european books whose edges you sliced as you read connolly ran his finger along the shelves recognizing a few names which would you take to a desert island goethe mann he took out a title then stopped sliding it back it was too long there would never be enough time to finish it he went into the bedroom to get the clothes the bed was made but lumpy next to it was the photograph of a young woman her hair bobbedpresumably his wife a girl what had he said about how she died you just turned down the wrong street thats all it took he was in the bathroom filling the old leather shaving kit when he heard the door open he looked up into the mirror waiting for someone to appear but the steps went to the kitchen he heard water running he stepped out of the bedroom and peered around the corner surprising johanna weber she was busy at the sink washing the cups and she jumped when she saw him oh she said grabbing the saucers with two hands before they could rattle mr connolly im sorry i didnt hear you come in i was just getting a few things you oh yes you were with him werent you terrible but she was busy again putting the cups on the drying rack wiping her hands such mess a bachelor always the same you found the satchel he held up his palms a helpless gesture under the bed she said smiling here ill show you you sit and let me pack a man cant do it look at this she picked up the tie clothes everywhere in the bedroom she scurried around opening drawers rolling socks talking to herself as she worked drawing the air into her circle of activity like a whirl of dust she picked up the photograph by the bed and held it for a minute before she put it in the satchel his wife connolly said she nodded he never forgot her all these years such a long time she shook her head and connolly saw her at one of her parties a frustrated matchmaker or had she been in love with him herself checked by a memory nobody knew anything he retreated to the living room and ran his eye again along the shelves you could tell a man by his books but the language made these meaningless there was no visible order all connolly could tell was that hed never left germany he thought of karls modest shelf all new the dictionary the westerns but these had the depth of a culture remembered he bent down searching the lower shelf for a bible heine das leben von beethoven principia mathematica historic santa fe his eye paused intrigued by the english he took out the book with a glossy photograph of the cathedral on the cover and flipped through the pages one of the corners had been turned down and the book opened to it a blackandwhite picture of san isidro his heart stopped no the picture seemed to blur as if connolly had moved it out of focus and when he stood up it swam back again a paragraph of history the reredos dates marked in boldface the church with its belltower the smooth adobe walls the alley parking lot to the side no the corner turned down bent to remind him no he would never violate a book that way someone else had marked the page a message why hadnt he turned it back but who would look connolly stared at the book his face growing warm this wasnt what hed wanted to find just a bible why hadnt eisler thrown it away but he never threw books away look at the room the parking lot was easy no problem there everything straight had he gone into the church at all what had they said to each other connolly drew in a breath still staring at the picture he heard the voices in his head crossword clues falling into place until they came to a blue flash an eye for an eye but not for the gadget something else mr connolly he looked up is something wrong ive been calling you no nothing he stood there startled holding the book in front of him are you sure you look im sorry i was thinking she clicked her tongue just like hans once he puts his head in a book she glanced toward it and for a second connolly wanted to snap it shut before anyone else could know he looked down it was absurd a tourist guide there could be any number of explanations but he knew there wouldnt be eisler but how the head had been smashed in you were reading frau weber said drawing him back no just looking for something to take him im afraid i dont know german she smiled ill find something for him i know what he likes go to work nowill take the valise youve been very kind isnt it heavy this a feather wet laundry is heavy dont worry ill take care of everything he started to turn away the book still in his hand and she looked at him strangely as if he were stealing i thought i might borrow this he said closing it i dont think professor eisler would mind its just what ive been looking for sightseeing mills said when he saw the book in connollys hand you still have those bank files boy you never stop do you whos the suspect this time let me see eislers now what what are you going to do cuff him in his bed do you have the file no but i can tell you its all up here he placed a finger by his temple theres nothing in it but he opened one mills nodded now curious when he got here one deposit the first month nothing after that guess he kept it himself karl had recognized emma right away youre sure positive let me see it anyway whats all this about mike mills said but connolly just looked at him until he backed away from the desk holding up his hand okay okay ill get it he went over to rifle through the stack on his desk connolly sat looking at the book adobe press something local copyrighted before the war glossy paper but thin photographs darker than they should be he took out the santa fe directory and when he couldnt find a listing called holliday instead ever hear of something called the adobe press sure now what made you think of that where are they well they is a he its just old art perkins made that guidebook i guess thats what you mean not bad either but the tourists just kinda dried up during the war so he closed the shop well shop garage was more like it whats the interest where can you buy them anywhere art had a nice little business with that ive got one myself if you need it but theyre still around in the stores he do any mail business not now art died about a year ago oh now you going to tell me what this is all about in a day or two doc some things i want to check out first mills had slid the account sheet in front of him an empty column with one deposit just as hed promised dont forget to call now doc said hanging up the suspensell kill me connolly pushed the sheet aside and looked at the book you could buy it anywhere so eisler had walked into a store maybe one of those near the plaza and boughtno it was too elaborate how would he know where to mark if it was a message it had to be sent but not by the adobe press mills the mail censors offsite right right the envelope goes unsealed they check it out then seal it and send it on its way so no one out theres the wiser or it comes back here if theyve got a problem with it what about incoming that just goes to the post office here problems in the other direction but the top scientists somebody must look mills shifted in his chair i wouldnt know about that he said carefully again connolly just stared at him check with bailey two doors down he said finally and dont mention my name bailey had no such scruples he was sitting in front of a pile of unread mail glad of the interruption we dont keep a record he said no point but what are you looking for he was small and delicate not quite filling the neatly pressed uniform and when he took off his glasses he looked no older than fifteen dr eisler thats easy he doesnt get any no letters nothing ever not since ive been here he noticed the book in connollys hand well there was that he said nervously as if hed been caught in a lie connolly unaware that he was still carrying it held the book up you remember this he said skeptically well he never got anything so it stuck out any letter with it no youre sure of course im sure he said slightly prissy a craftsman challenged in his work when was this bailey looked at the book again then closed his eyes concentrating april he said opening them youre wasted here connolly said impressed and nothing with it just the envelope right i figured it was something he sent for what about a return address again he closed his eyes connolly waited no nothing connolly sighed okay thanks he said turning to leave but it was from santa fe bailey said eager to help how do you know the postmark santa fe you remember a postmark connolly said amazed the boy nodded christ you are wasted here no i enjoy it its interesting connolly looked at his open young face imagining him reading oppenheimers correspondence witnessing history another hill story but now there wasnt time thanks he said i appreciate it when he got back to his desk he lit a cigarette and took out eislers security file leaning back in his chair to read he wasnt looking for anything specific the trick was to look at the same information differently like turning a prism wasnt the money enough why not all of a sudden the book arrived in april a meeting notice but karl had been there too mike mills said interrupting him whats going on im not sure yet im trying to figure it out but youre not going to tell me look if you dont think you can trust me you should i trust you he said stopping him i just dont trust myself not yet mills shrugged suit yourself im going to get some air he headed toward the door one thing connolly looked up karl liked to work alone too when he was gone connolly didnt turn back to the file but looked at the wall instead karl did like to work alone nobody planned to kill him a snake would attack if surprised but the meeting was planned and he was there connolly pictured the road down from the mesa the alley the car in the box canyon all the lines were there waiting to be connected you just turned down the wrong street thats all it took he didnt notice it was beginning to get dark and when mills came back and flipped on the light it startled him he got up without a word and started for the infirmary lights had gone on everywhere the hive still busy the thin air as always carried gasoline fumes and coal smoke but he was oblivious his mind still on the blackboard when he got to the room he found eisler dressed sitting up to read he looked over the top of his glasses when he saw connolly standing in the door holding the guidebook his eyes moved from the book to connollys face and stayed there calm and bold for a minute neither of them said a word then gravely he sighed and slowly took off the glasses mr connolly he said ive finished my map have you ever killed a man mr connolly so quick and then the responsibility that goes on forever eisler paused well as long as life not very long the room was dim the dark shadows broken only by the small reading lamp near his chair outside the nurse was quiet so that connolly felt they wre lying side by side again talking into the night eisler was rambling as if in a fitful sleep and connolly let him lead not knowing where to begin afraid he would stop have you come to arrest me he had said before and connolly hadnt known how to answer now that hed got what he wanted he was dismayed hed imagined the scene so many times his list of questions as orderly as a deposition and now suddenly he felt powerless what threat could possibly matter he would hear what eisler wanted to tell him and that gentle voice came out of a depression so profound that each statement seemed a favor one last tentative offering before it would stop altogether and stay silent what punishment was left so connolly sat in the opposite chair waiting afraid to interrupt as eisler moved from karl to gottingen and back again randomly stepping between remorse and cool reflection i knew when i saw you at the board he was saying it was a relief do you understand that but i thought i would have timebefore you knew how much did you get out about the bomb connolly said trying to steer the conversation back eisler paused and for a moment connolly thought he had lost him then he sighed yes the bomb thats the important thing isnt it not karl not even now how did you know you said there was nothing to steal on the hill but there was always one thing to steal here is that how you see it stealing dont you prometheus stole the fire eisler said quietly but not for himself scientific knowledgedo you think that belongs only to you it does for now how much did you tell them i am familiar with all the principles involved in our work here he said formally surely you already know that and now the russians know them too my friend eisler said gentle again the russians have known them for some time these are not secrets the mechanics yes but that is simply a matter of time they will know them and now theyll know just a little bit sooner yes mr connolly do you expect me to apologize for sharing this knowledge about karl he hesitated that was a great wrong i accept the guilt but the fire belongs to everybody the bomb is only the beginning you know all this money he swept his hand to indicate the entire mesa it took the bomb to get this money and since america is rich it can afford to pay but what we will have here when were finished is something new energy not just for bombs such a thing cannot be owned would you keep electricity to yourself its not possible even if it were right the fact remains it wasnt yours to give the fact is you took classified information and passed it on thats treason so many facts i came with the tube alloys group was it treason to work with the english were not at war with england my friend we are not at war with russia either germany is at war with russia more than you can know the real war america is a factory and she is getting rich england he waved his hand england is a dream the war is russia and germany it has always been that is the great struggle to the death and what have you done to help the second front that had to wait tube alloys committees for russia no not for that ally for them the great secret not my knowledge to give to defeat the nazis i would give anything connolly listened to his voice gathering speed feeling the rhythm of a lecture and looked at him in fascination the kind face the austere ideology but why answer the debate was old and the war was over he looked away so you have he said quietly the nazis and who will give you permission now eislers cheek moved in a small tic as if hed been struck a good pupil mr connolly you listen well not that well i didnt know you were a communist you werent supposed to know but karl knew did you give the same speech at the meetings meetings where karl saw you eisler smiled slightly what makes you think that karl had a good memory he recognized someone else from the meetings in berlin he recognized you too you interest me i wonder whom he saw connolly didnt answer but for once your method has failed you i never attended meetings i was in a secret chapter from the start then where did you meet karl he was a messenger just once but he remembered a messenger for you yes he did some work for us a good communist he must have been sent to meetings towell to observe connolly looked at him in surprise so karl had had his secret too karl was a communist i thought the nazis had made a mistake the nazis rarely made that kind of mistake mr connolly i told you it was always a war between us thats why many of us had to work in secret otherwise they always knew a mistakeis that what he told your people he seemed almost amused but later in russia yes that was unfortunate eisler said seriously a terrible time he was foolish to go as a good communist as a jew do you think it was only the germans he stopped his eyes moving away to the past the revolution doesnt always move in a straight line it moves and then there are dark times it was madness then shootings thousands of people maybe more friends people informed on their own friends yes youre surprised i would tell you this yet you did all this for them the idea is right the country is sometimes flawed do you not feel this about your own country youre not russian the idea lives there now it doesnt matter where so you want them to have the bomb dont you have you thought what it will mean to be the only one do you trust yourself that much he paused but i admit that is in the future a philosophical point i was thinking of this war nothing more the wars over yes he said slowly so we were wrong thats for you to say my work is over too connolly stood up annoyed your work he said heavily murder thats what were talking about my god how can you live with yourself eisler looked up at him not answering why connolly said his voice almost plaintive mr connolly eisler said may i suggest we confine our discussion to whathow if you prefer the why is my concern i make no apologies i did what was asked of me i could not do anything else not now i wasuseful i dont think you can know what that means an obligation no even more than that i would never have refused but my motives are irrelevant now so lets speak of something else his tone soft and reasonable seemed a reproach why tell me anything at all connolly said why perhaps i want to explain myself perhaps i am curious curious yes to see if the oppenheimer principle works to see what you know he paused again gathering his thoughts i like you mr connolly such a passion for truth you want to know everything but to understand im not so sure theyre not the same thing so this time maybe its different ill make you understand my last student connolly looked at him thinking of emma at bandelier then turned to pace in the room as if he had a pointer in his hand so lets start at the beginning wherever that is your wife i think she didnt just walk down the street there was fighting all right but she was part of it i assume she was a communist too eisler nodded that is correct possibly even before you were connolly said a question but eisler didnt answer possibly not but afterwardyou were committed then you had to carry on the fight or anyway carry on the memory mr connolly please this is psychology not facts what is the point let us stay with what you know but you want me to understand it what was she like eisler grimaced looking straight ahead she was young she believed in what a better world in me everything does that sound foolish now yes to me too but then it seemed perfectly natural to believe in things i loved her he said then paused its too simple mr connolly your psychology she may have been the beginning yes but she was not the cause for that you had to be alive in germany then to see the nazis come it was bad and then worse and worse how was it possible that no one stopped them did you even know about those things here what were you a boy can you remember nuremberg there must have been newsreels i remember it very well the cathedral of light even the sky was full of them so much power they would kill everybody i knew it even then and no one to stop them no one what would you have done weve been over this before yes eisler said stopping so you worked for the communists that must have been lucky for them a prominent scientist i was not so prominent then but it was useful yes i knew many people heisenberg many so your bosses knew them too then you had to get out and you kept doing the same thing in england in manchester yes how did it work there mr connolly do you really expect me to tell you that i made reports i met with people i dont know who and you told them about tube alloys yes of course mr connolly would you please sit down youre making me anxious all this back and forth you can smoke if you like sorry connolly sat down feeling reprimanded and lit a cigarette you dont mind its roberts hospital eisler said with a small smile then you came to the hill early last fall connolly continued karl would have known right away hes probably the one who got your filehe took an interest in that but there wasnt anything there its what isnt there he said aloud to himself and karl knew youd done some work together in the good old days so he asked you about ithe couldnt resist thatbut he kept it to himself why i wonder or was karl still a communist too that russian jail just another story you are too suspicious the mirror in a mirror no the jail was real you had only to see his hands he was never the same after thatcertainly not a communist he renounced everything it was not so much he stopped searching not so much what they did to him there as perhaps the feelinghow can i say it that they had renounced him and the pain didnt help a disillusioning experience all around eisler glanced up at his sarcasm then looked away again yes it must have been so you made him think you felt the same way yes that was very easily done he said with a hint of pride a matter of the past you know mr connolly when you stop loving a woman you cant imagine what anyone else might see in her connolly was jarred by his tone in the lamps small circle he felt absurdly that they might be swapping stories around a fire so youd both seen the light but nothing in the filehe wouldnt like that thats the sort of thing that would worry karl you forget there was nothing in his file either he could understand not making a point of it here in a place like this people are not so understandingthey dont know what it was like there would he have kept his job it would be natural to let the sleeping dog lie for both of us i assure you he wassympathetic sympathetic enough to put the bite on you eisler looked at him puzzled you gave him money didnt you what was that for old times sake oh i see you think he threatened to expose me no no it was not like that karl was an opportunist but not a traitor if he had really thought i was stillactive nothing would have stopped him certainly not a little money but you gave him money not a little and he kept your secret and it wasnt blackmail eisler waved his hand you insist on this term its not precise what do you think he said to me thirty pieces of silver for my silence this is a fantasy mr connolly be precise well why did you give it to him six hundred dollars wasnt it eisler looked up pleased very good a little more but that is close how did you know what did he say it was for connolly said ignoring his question he appealed to me he had the chance to buy members of his family out there are such cases you know how much for a life and he had very little his familys dead yes of course it was much too late for such arrangements that was all in the past when they were letting people out but that is what he said i did not contradict i knew it wasan opportunity for him did he know you thought that eisler shrugged i cant say i didnt question him i was generous perhaps he felt our past was a bond between us that he could approach me this way perhaps he enjoyed seeing how far he could go a game he could trust me not to say anything it was very strange i think you know he felt i was the only person he could trust maybe the first time connolly said picking up the story but afterit was too easy he asked for more money and you gave it to him and then again why hed be suspicious so he started following youwhere you went especially off the hill he liked driving around were you aware that he was tailing you no so you never saw him at any of your meetings there was only one other he wasnt there how did you set them up the first had been arranged before i came the second you know i already had the date i would be contacted about the place the book arrived and i knew and this time karl was there yes and he saw that you were passing information there were papers yes but he was suspicious before that he followed you down you probably didnt see him that time eitherhed be a good tailbut i imagine you drove around santa fe for a while just to be sure standard procedure for meetings then out to san isidro but you wouldnt want to stop there until your man was already in place you wouldnt want to risk being seen waiting in the alley so you drove past and then again until the car was there and by that time karl knew something was going on how many times did you go around is that important eisler said a few it was as you say you seem to know everything except who you were meeting i dont know the name i couldnt help you even if i wanted to and you dont want to no but its useless to pursue this i do not know what if you couldnt make it or had to postpone the meeting how could you contact him i couldnt another meeting would be arranged how that i dont know either that was not my affair but its of no importance i was there and karlkarl was there too foolish foolish boy he said shaking his head it was impossible we could not allow he stopped so he was there and now i am here i think im a little tired now if you dont mind is there anything else you want to know who killed him eisler looked up i killed him mr connolly no you didnt eisler looked at him quizzically its a popular murder connolly said everybody wants to confess to it weve got one guy in prison and i dont believe him either you bashed karls head in then dumped him in the park and drove on home i dont think so you do not have any choice in the matter i still want to know karl was killed in that alley all right we have the blood samples to prove it and you were therei dont doubt it for a minute you might even say it was all your fault youre so eager for blame fine take some but you never killed him your contact did that right there were you shocked all that blood what did it sound like when his skull cracked thats not in your line at all you must have had a disillusioning experience yourself which is why youre here what i dont know is why you still want to protect him eisler bowed his head staring at his hands we were alone karl and i he said quietly the other was only a messengeralready gone no he was there did you help clean up and shove karl in the car or did you just leave right away that must have been some trip back lots of time to think he paused i know hes here here eisler said looking up confused what did you do with the car the car he said thrown by the question karls car you didnt leave it there no no on the streets he said improvising not far perhaps it was stolen no we found it its in a canyon just down the road from the west gate eisler fumbled his hands nervously picking at his trousers i dont understand somebody drove it there your friend you didnt know you had to hightail it back here get away from san isidro as soon as possible the usual way i would guess through the east gate its closer shall we go back to the map your friend has to dump the body he was seen it turns out just him one man not you so i figure he was on his own you were probably safe and sound back home by then no risks just in case then he drove karls car up the back way and stashed it close enough so he could walk in unless you waited around to give him a lift but i dont think so why chance it but you see what this means you see why i cant let it go hes here im tired eisler said again its enough who was it i dont know thats not possible eisler sighed wearily it is possible mr connolly its necessary surely you see that to us its just a contact not a person we arent supposed to know in casewell of something like this an interrogation you mean yes if you are forced i could not tell you even if you tortured me we dont go in for pliers here thats your people connolly said eisler looked away please go now its not enough for you all this you have your answers i compromised the project yesits done and karl that too you dont believe in my guilt it was enough for god he has already punished me you were the one playing god i was there remember thats suicide not punishment so he said quietly you know that too maybe i was just helping him the way you helped the russians if you like i make no apologies its done now connolly stood up to go no apologies you want to be guilty for everything thats just playing god again wipe the whole thing away in somewhat sacrifice youre right its not enough for me you want me to understand what how everything was justified but what was actually done compromise the project what is that betraying oppenheimer an old friend betraying your colleagues all the work theyve done do you know what hell this is going to make for them do you think it ends here with you prometheus for christs sake theyll have to live with all this shit the secrecythe war will never end for them and karl a conniver a snoop so unfortunate we couldnt allow so you know how they found him he saw eisler wincing now almost cringing in his chair but he couldnt stop his head crackedyou knew that did you also see him get his face smashed in or did your friend do that later a little goodbye gesture a kickseveral kicks the poor bastard they couldnt recognize his face but i guess that was the point pulp and blood and his pants yanked down with his dick sticking out so that everybody would thinkso thats how karl ended thats the way it goes down in the books one kind of disgrace he had no right to expect lets not even think about the future all the bombs and god knows what i just want to know did you see his face and for what some cause your big idea your wife all this was it worth it to you eisler raised his head his tired eyes filled with tears as if he were being beaten but connolly couldnt stop was it worth it he said his voice hoarse was it i dont know eisler said a whisper it was the only outburst he saw eislers face in the night floating through his sleep like a plea old and uncertain and felt ashamed in the morning they went on as before a couple whod had a spat careful and polite eager to put things behind them connolly couldnt let go the radiation poisoning had created a deadline firm and immediate so that he felt himself in a race like the men at trinity who worked too fast with no time for consequences when had he left the hill that day were they alone at san isidro before karl arrived describe the contact had karl mentioned anyone else from the early days how had it been left was another meeting scheduled were there people in place at hanford at oak ridge describe the contact but eisler deteriorated with the meetings the pain coming swiftly knotting his face and connolly found himself fighting the drugs now as well as time the lucid periods fencing with remembered details became a kind of martyrdom some final struggle for eislers soul they were alone at first oppenheimer refused to see eisler at all devastated by the betrayal but connolly couldnt ask about the science and there was no one else but his visits were erratic stolen time it was connolly who kept the vigil he welcomed the isolation away from the others questions sealed off from the rest of the hill holliday mills even emma had to be content with promissory notes not now not yet he couldnt leave one evening when the pain was very bad eisler gripped his hand and he was startled at the touch bony desperate to make any contact and he felt oddly that he had become eislers protector in the close soursmelling room he was tormentor and guardian eislers last thread oppenheimer had turned away he had never quite recovered from the shock of that first day connolly had insisted they leave the office and walk over toward ashley pond what the devil is this all about oppenheimer had protested annoyed at the interruption but when connolly told him he stopped still in the road people unnoticed passed around them and for a minute connolly thought that something had happeneda heart attack a stroke as if the mind couldnt absorb the blow alone and had passed it on to the body youre sure oppenheimer said finally and connolly unnerved by his calm was almost relieved when he noticed that oppenheimers hands were shaking as he lit his cigarette he didnt know what reaction he had expecteda howl a denial but when oppenheimer began to talk he didnt mention eisler at all instead irritated he said was it really necessary to bring me out here we have to assume your office is wired his eyes flashed for a moment in surprise do we dont you know they dont tell me im the one they brought in from outside remember vividly they check on me too who the general then as if hed answered his own question oppenheimer started to walk my god i suppose youll have to tell him i think it might be better coming from you on a safe phone if you can manage it according to you theres no such thing arent you letting your imagination run away with you anyway i fail to see the difference theyll have to be told groves has to be told not the others not yet hell want to run with it but youll have to persuade him to keep it to himself how do you propose i do that connolly shrugged call in a favor he owes you thats the city desk talking oppenheimer said almost sneering he dropped his cigarette and rubbed it out thinking may i ask why have you stopped to think what will happen the minute army intelligence gets this they wont stop with eisler if i remember correctly thats precisely what you were brought in to prevent i am preventing it look its up to you youre the boss my advice is to get the general to sit on it youll never finish otherwise no oppenheimer said looking now over the pond the good of the project im touched id no idea you were so concerned with our work here theyd close me down too i have an idea eisler might talk to me you think lansdale or any of his goons would let that happen if they knew groves brought me in to sniff around some queer murder they didnt like that much either but what the hell but reds a spy case they live for stuff like that for a moment oppenheimer looked almost amused are you asking me to save your job and yours ah and mine what a funny old world its become friedrich he said to himself then turned to connolly and what makes you think groves will agree because the only thing he cares more about than security is getting the damn thing done and it wont get done if he starts a red scare now hell believe you he cant finish this without you he has to trust you and thats why he spies on me you really think hes got the phone hed have to connolly said quietly you know that oppenheimer sighed you forget though after a while you get so used to the idea you arent even aware of it anymore i dont know why i mind ive never had anything to hide you do now when oppenheimer finally came to the infirmary he almost broke down he stood at the foot of eislers bed holding on to the frame as a barrier between them his thin body rigid and unyielding then he took in the swollen skin splotched now by intradermal bleeding the thinning hair and connolly saw him let go nearly folding robert eisler said softly the old affection his first smile in days are you in pain oppenheimer said not now have you seen the charts oppenheimer nodded connolly felt he should leave but the silence held him the air filled with emotion too fragile to disturb it will take them years oppenheimer said finally perhaps years oppenheimer repeated all thisfor what why you my friend eisler held his stare then looked away do you remember roosevelts funeral the bhagavad gita what a mans faith is he is oppenheimer continued to stare at him and what are you eislers face fell and he turned his head to the window im sorry about the boy he said finally a jew friedrich a jew then he took his hands off the frame and moved away from the bed his eyes hard again were you the only one he said his voice detached and composed but eisler was quiet and after a while oppenheimer gave up very well he said brisk and matteroffact shall we begin with the fuel the purities i assume theyre not familiar with the alloying process so they began their interview the first of several while connolly sat on the other side of the room and listened explosive lenses the initiator tampers none of it meant anything to him instead he watched oppenheimer cool and efficient run through his checklist of questions he never wavered again connolly marveled at his singlemindedness there were no more reproaches no more attempts at any human connection my friend now there was just a flow of information how much was lost it was the project that had been betrayed oppenheimers own feelings had disappeared in some willed privacy perhaps he would take them out later bruised when the project was safe eisler told him everything connolly felt at times that he was eavesdropping on some rarefied seminar question answer observation they anticipated each other with connolly eisler sparred and evaded but now his answers came freely as if he were a foreigner relieved to find someone who spoke his native language to him science really was universal and openit belonged to everyone who could know it but mostly now it belonged to oppenheimer as connolly watched them he felt that eislers eager cooperation had become a kind of sad last request for forgiveness he would give oppenheimer everything they would talk as they always had and oppenheimer would feel the pleasure of it again and understand what scientist could believe it must be secret but oppenheimer was somewhere else now whenever he saw that eisler too sick to go on needed medication he would stop without complaint almost relieved to go back to his real work in the morning they would take up where they had left off and connolly would see eislers eyes strained and cloudy clear for a minute in anticipation it became a question of how long he could last connolly would watch for the signsa few beads of sweat the voice suddenly dry the small movements of his hands on the sheetsand see him struggle with it ignoring the pain just a few minutes longer to keep oppenheimer there then after a week they were finished and oppenheimer stopped coming eisler would look at the door in the morning and then resigned turn his head toward the chair and smile weakly at connolly who was now all there was groves wants to come oppenheimer told him one day outside tell him to wait a few days hes dying im still hoping hell talk to me how much longer do you think i dont know a few days it cant go on much longer hes in pain all the time now yes oppenheimer said and for a moment connolly thought he saw something break in his eyes then he turned to go why this way there were a hundred easier ways to do it i dont know fit the punishment to the crime maybe something like that oppenheimer looked at him a question no not karl connolly said i think its about the bomb but oppenheimer didnt want to hear it nonsense hes a scientist connolly said maybe for him its the elegant solution oppenheimer started at the words no he said wearily its an atonement my god what a waste does he think anybodys watching he asks for you oppenheimer ignored him groves wants to come he said again then he anticipated connollys reaction i told him you were doing everything possible he doesnt trust me hell have to well all have to mr connolly interesting how things work out isnt it do you think hell talk if he doesnt were at a dead end literally it dies with him keep groves away will you and no goons either ill do what i can he has to come sometime you know we have to decide what to do like what theres nothing to be done you dont know gg theres always something to be done in fact i suggest you start thinking about what hell want ideas id better go now weve still got a gadget to build you dont want to see eisler ive seen him he said and walked away so eisler talked to connolly some days he would lie staring at the ceiling his eyes halfclosed in a daze and then there would be a rush of talk hamburg a back garden the damp rooms after the first war when there was no coal he talked pictures for connolly gabled roofs and tramlines and a summer lake then as if a cloud had passed in front of the sun in his mind blocklong factories and slate skies and his father the hacking cough of damaged lungs a last attempt even now at precision connolly didnt interrupt hoping instead for a revealing moment sometimes he drifted into german a secret testimony that left connolly helpless he had long since stopped answering questions if connolly drew him back to the alley at san isidro he would grow quiet then speak of something else he no longer enjoyed the verbal fencing there wasnt time to go over it again he was talking out his life now berlin trude a hiking trip in the mountains connolly sat in the dim room day after day listening for clues he saw emma only once on a saturday when they drove up to taos pueblo for an outing past hannahs ranch and along the high mountain road where the villages reminded her of spain after days with eisler the sun was too bright glaring off the whitewashed walls and after a while connolly wished he hadnt come what if eisler said something and there was no one to hear he missed the puzzle of the stories eisler had wanted him to understand but all he had learned so far was that his life was inexplicable it couldnt end in the alleyway he had to leave a name a description the pueblo itself was poor and dusty filled with scratching chickens and occasional pickup trucks and quiet resentful indians selling blankets the mud apartment blocks windows outlined in bright blue seemed like tenements all clotheslines and old tin cans and rickety ladders leading to roofs maybe it had always been like this he thought the splendor of the anasazi ruins no more than a leap of imagination they sat near the fast high stream that divided the two sides of the settlement watching children crossing on the railless wooden bridge are you really all right she said what do you mean people are talking they say youve got it too thats why youre the only one allowed theyre afraid to let anyone else in no im fine i just talk to him thats all you mean youre questioning him i thought he was dying he is what about karl you think he killed karl i dont believe it neither do i but i think he knows who did why would he she said and then when he didnt answer oh i see dont ask run along emma is it something terrible yes she shivered then dont tell me i dont want to know i like him i like him too then why do this to him what do you actually do anyway give him shots to make him talk keep at him till he breaks down like the films god michael sitting there like a vulture waiting for him to die everybody deserves a little peace connolly was quiet for a minute he doesnt want peace he wants to talk we justtalk about what his life germany everything hes dying emma he wants somebody to talk to and you volunteered it just worked out that way i cant explain it now i dont like it either you know its a lousy way to die its not fun to watch emma stood picking up a stone and throwing it at the water i hate what you do i didnt ask to do it you didnt say no either and now youll never give up sometimes i wonder how far youd go would you do anything no whats your limit then do you know she came back from the stream im not a cop no something else god i wish he would tell you put an end to all this we could just be ourselves whats the difference anyway we could go away somewhere together connolly stared ahead a dog was barking on the bridge herding the children across is that what were going to do he said i dont know is it he got up and took her arm if thats what you want yes well do whatever you want she looked up at him and nodded but not now no when its finished eisler got worse that night the morphine had made him itch and unconscious he had scratched himself over and over so that in the morning his arms were covered in jagged red lines connolly found him tethered to the bed with narrow strips of gauze and when he reprimanded the nurse and gently untied the arms thin as sticks he felt eisler look up at him momentarily coherent and grateful robert he said his voice little more than a croak is robert coming later connolly said eisler nodded hes very busy he said then drifted off again later that afternoon they talked a little but eislers mind wandered he no longer cared about his charts or his own disintegration he lived now entirely in memory sustained by an iv dripping into his arm when connolly asked once about karl he seemed to have forgotten who he was he went back to gottingen a lecture about the instability of negative charges connolly fed him small pieces of ice and when the ice began to melt it ran down his chin his cracked lips too dry to absorb the moisture the gold crown on one of his molars had become radioactive causing the tongue to swell on one side when they capped it with a piece of lead foil a last tamper his gums bled warm june air blew in through the window but the smell resistant hung over everything connolly no longer noticed he watched eislers face waiting when eisler gasped involuntarily wincing in agony connolly knew it was time to ask for another injection and then he would lose him again until the pain had soaked up the drug and brought him back youve got to see him he said to oppenheimer he asks for you and when oppenheimer didnt reply he wont last the week it would be a mercy a mercy oppenheimer said examining the word have you learned anything its too late for that then why do you stay connolly didnt know what to answer it wont be much longer he said oppenheimer did come in the morning with the sun cutting through the slats in the blinds he took off his hat and stood for a minute at the door appalled then forced himself to cross to the bed eislers eyes were closed his face immobile stretched taut as a death mask is he awake he said in a low voice to connolly try connolly said oppenheimer took eislers hand friedrich he held it waiting while eislers eyes opened yes eisler said a whisper friedrich ive come eisler looked at him his eyes confused yes who is it please oppenheimers face twitched in surprise then slowly he let the hand go and stood up yes eisler said again vaguely but his eyes had closed and oppenheimer turned away he faced connolly about to speak but instead his eyes filled with tears dont go connolly said he doesnt know me oppenheimer said dully and turned toward the door connolly went over to the bed to wake eisler but when he looked back again oppenheimer had gone so he dropped his hand to his side yes eisler said faintly returning it was robert connolly said but eisler seemed not to have heard robert eisler said as if the word meant nothing then his eyes widened a little and he felt for connollys hand yes robert he said holding him there were two more days as bad as before and now no one else came at all connolly sat for hours by the bed listening for breathing once eisler came back his voice clearer and his eyes steady not moving as they usually did to avoid the pain what is troubling you robert eisler said for connolly was always robert now nothing get some sleep no more questions what happened to the questions ask me its all right ask me cant i help you you remember karl yes he said vaguely the boy the man you methe was wearing workboots workboots i dont understand workboots on the hill it doesnt fit i dont understand robert why are you asking me these things what about the test trinity be careful of the weather the windthe particles the wind will spread everything well be careful connolly said good he said closing his eyes again good in a minute connolly tried again friedrich he said please tell me who was driving the car eisler lay quietly his eyes fluttering they stopped at the river robert he said opening them he looked at connolly troubled and confused and connolly leaned forward to hear him but it was another river the russians they stopped at the river until the fighting was over they wouldnt cross they waited till everyone was dead connolly knew then that the hill had slipped away for good he had lost in warsaw he said giving in in warsaw yes they waited till everybody was dead connolly watched his eyes fill with tears a spontaneous sorrow he wondered if everyone ended this way overwhelmed with regret can you imagine such a thing he said the russians then his eyes moving irrationally he grabbed connollys hand dont tell trude connolly patted him soothingly no i wont eisler lay back his eyes closed again but he kept connollys hand connolly helpless to remove it sat there feeling eislers fingers pulse faintly then clutch and relax as if he were touching what was left of his life of all the strange things that had happened to him since he had come to los alamos this seemed to him the strangest the sour room the swollen hand holding on to someone else he thought was there the unexpected intimacy of death confiding in an imposter when eisler clutched him tightly toward the end and said was it so terrible what i did was it so terrible he knew he meant not this last betrayal but the ruined faith of a lifetime no not so terrible he lied giving comfort to the enemy groves used the funeral service as the excuse for his trip the entire hill closed down for the afternoon eerie in the sudden stillness like a forest in the absence of birds connolly had never realized before how noisy the place usually was voices and motors and the clangs of the metallurgy unit vibrating in a constant hum now you could actually hear the wind blow across the mesa a character in the creation myth it was even quiet in the crowded theater only a few whispers and scraping chairs until professor webers quartet filled the room with some mournful bach afterward oppenheimer and groves sat on the stage with the speakers groves in his tight bullying uniform and oppenheimer almost languid the dark cloth of his suit hanging in folds over his gaunt frame he had refused to speak ceding his place to weber as a gesture to the emigre community and only connolly was aware that it was a deft evasion the maneuver of one practiced in compromise the speakers said the expected eislers contribution to science his contribution to the project his concern for humanity and the arts his generosity his ethical standards connolly looked around the room at the hundreds of people in varying stages of grief eisler had betrayed all of them what if they knew weber broke down in the middle of his speech weakened by genuine sentiment and some people in the audience cried eisler was science at its best the pure inquiry the search for truth he evenhere connolly restless almost rose to leavedied for it connolly thought that the hypocrisy of eulogies was a final mercy to the survivors if people knew the truth would there ever be kings tyrants were always praised for their love of the people politicians for their vision artists for their selflessness now los alamos had its own martyr the one they needed and he did them more honor than most he had died for science but oppenheimer sat on the stage his legs crossed and did not speak afterward connolly walked with oppenheimer and groves out toward s site an inspection team of three a little hot for a walk isnt it groves said wiping the back of his neck his uniform already showing splotches of dampness connolly tells me people listen in my office bugs i know youd never allow that oppenheimer said mischievous but you know what the intelligence unit is like better to indulge them interfere with a delusional and they go stark raving or so im told why dont you take off your jacket groves choosing comfort over dignity flung it over his shoulder and held it with his forefinger without the camouflage of the jacket his stomach strained at his shirt buttons spilling over his belt you pick one heck of a time to make jokes weve got a real mess on our hands here i always said this would happen yes you did oppenheimer replied foreigners and would you feel any better if he came from ohio all right groves said make your point these pesky foreigners are making your gadget so dont lets start down that road again it could have been anybody well you would think that he said backing off but not mollified hows the timetable still on track oppenheimer nodded just five minutes leeway give or take a minute we cant afford any time off he said directly to groves thats why im here groves said so lets get started first assess the damage how bad is it what do they know can they make a bomb no said oppenheimer thoughtfully i dont think so eisler was a theoretical physicist he knew the plans for the implosion bomb thats a plus for them but he cant build their reactor for them he didnt know the purity requirements he couldnt alloy plutonium its a complicated metallurgyfive different phases and five different densities he had nothing to do with that so yes they know but they dont know how they will though you know sometime not on my watch groves said how about all those coffee klatches you like to have wouldnt he hear about the alloy requirements there yes oppenheimer sighed i didnt say he didnt know about them he just wouldnt know in any meaningful detail he wouldnt have to know if he just passed them plans no he only had access to theoretical his own papers he could steal them he didnt he told me yes he said responding to grovess questioning look i believe him he was a traitor but he wasnt a thief thats some difference at any rate he didnt give them that i dont mean to minimize whats happened here he passed valuable information we dont know how valuable because we dont know where they were starting from but they need more than what eisler gave them to actually make a bomb its almost a certainty they dont have one yet of course the point is they know we do wonderful groves said yes its awkward politically awkward groves said almost snorting not telling them of course if thats the main concern we could simply tell them now groves stared at him as if he had missed the point of a joke thats the kind of thing you say that keeps me up at night then he dropped it and kept walking forcing them to flank him in a kind of brooding convoy what gets me is how easy it all was he said finally this place is like a sieve a man walks out hands over some papers and thats it we wouldnt even know about it now if they hadnt killed someone it shouldnt be that easy at least we can plug up a few holes i want you to cancel all leaves nobody goes out anymore isnt it a little late for that the horse is already out of the barn i think its a good idea connolly said oppenheimer looked at him in surprise you do he said displeased whats on your mind groves said they both stopped and turned to him it doesnt end with him go on groves said eisler only had a piece but what if he wasnt the only one what if there are others the russians must want all this pretty badly why stop at eisler how many of us do you suspect oppenheimer said ten all groves who had paled even in the sun shook his head hes right the reds could have people planted all over the hill all over but we dont know connolly said and were not going to not this way theres no point looking on the hill we have to find out who eisler met you said there was one here groves said well i think there is it still doesnt make sense but somebody drove karls car up here eislers contact no why meet off the hill in the first place there has to be an outside guy but somebody drove the car and then walked in through the west gate which means there were two oppenheimer said quietly exactly i dont know how or why but its the only way the logistics work then find them groves said thats not so easy the trail really did die with eisler weve got to find the outside guy if theres someone else on the hill hes the key oppenheimer stopped to light a cigarette what makes you say that he said thoughtfully as if he were looking at a math problem why would he know anyone else if everyone was working in isolation im guessing connolly said but the odds are good that the outside contact was the only mailman the more people you have running around on the outside the more chances you have of someone getting caught why spread the risk hes not essential like the scientists hes just collecting the rent you lose him you replace him but you dont lose him because hes the pro the tricky part is getting the stuff to himyouve got to rely on well people like eisler you dont know what theyre going to do if they get excited so you keep it simple and you keep them in the dark but once youve got the information you want someone who really knows what hes doing and hes not the one on the hill groves said no he couldnt be my guess is hes nowhere near the hill maybe santa fe or albuquerque but youre always taking a chance with somebody in place more likely he breezes into towna businessman or a tourist he met eisler as a touristcollects the rent and then clears out till the next time all the way to moscow groves said connolly shrugged somewhere well thats just fine groves said now what are we supposed to do cancel the leaves connolly said to oppenheimer make it difficult for him youve got the test coming upits a legitimate excuse according to eisler there was no procedure for a missed meeting they just rescheduled somehow if other meetings are planned at least we can make him sweat for them put a few people on the tourist spots he said to groves if we can manage some surveillance without being obvious i could get some of the local boys to helphollidays a good guy and wont ask any questions see who turns up and whether they come back its a long shot but you never know somebody was waiting for eisler at san isidro maybe hell be waiting somewhere else now the locals arent great but theyre all weve got we cant use anyone from up here why not groves said why did you bring me here in the first place because we cant trust anyone here i never said that you thought it karl was security and you didnt know whether that meant anything or not but you sure as hell werent going to take the chance now we know we cant and we cant let anyone know we suspect business as usual theyll wonder about eisler theyll look for anything suspicious but nobody bothered him i was with him in the lab so it made sense for me to be in the hospital too you might want to spread the word that youre still worried about my health he said to oppenheimer i am oppenheimer said dryly what makes you think they even know hes dead if they dont they will you dont need newspapers up hereitll get out we have to assume they know everything except that we know karl gets killed and they pull down his pants and what do you know the army gets squeamish and falls for it he said shooting a glance at groves and somebody else comes along and takes the rap you dont get luckier than that then eisler dies an accident remorse about karl but hed never talk and he didnt nothing happens no security no sudden visits from washington things just go on theyre still lucky except now theyre missing a source maybe their only source maybe not either way theyll be hungry which is just what we want and thats it groves said say nothing and have the police watch the churches thats your plan of action but oppenheimer was studying connolly his eyes following the sequence of his thought what do you mean theyll be hungry he said quietly what are you planning to do i want to offer some rent to collect groves stopped and looked at him his face squinting in appraisal what do you mean by that but oppenheimer lighting a fresh cigarette was already there i think mr connolly means he wants to go into the spying business he said smiling forget it groves said quickly were already in it connolly said smiling back at oppenheimer but groves had drawn in his breath swelling his chest so that involuntarily connolly thought of the storybook pig huffing and puffing hold on both of you he said the last time i listened to you he said to oppenheimer connolly here was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat leave him alone you said eislerll talk to him well he didnt and now hes dead and so is our last chance of getting anything out of him youre not fbi he said to connolly youre not even army intelligence so its my own fault i guess i dont know what i was thinking about but i know enough not to make the same mistake twice gg oppenheimer began but connolly interrupted general ive just spent two weeks watching a man die theres nothing anybody could have done to himhed already done it to himself maybe thats why he did it who knows you cant torture a man whos already in that kind of pain it wasnt going to get any better he knew that if he didnt want to say anything nothing on gods earth was going to make him who said anything about torture groves said thats right i forgot only the enemy does that maybe eisler couldnt see the difference mister thats out of line lets everyone calm down shall we oppenheimer said general were all disappointed about eisler its a great pity but thats all very spilt milk now the question is i know what the question is weve spent billions of dollars to create a strategic advantage to end this war now the whole projects being undermined and connolly here wants to play cops and robbers general oppenheimer said soberly youve still got your strategic advantage unless the war ends before we can use it nothings been undermined what exactly is your concern and afterward well afterward thats a very interesting question but its not the question before us right now not yet i suppose it doesnt bother you that somebodys selling us out to the russians right under your nose maybe youd like to tell the president weve been handing this stuff to the enemy i know im not looking forward to it youre wrong i mind very much oppenheimer said slowly almost to himself then he turned to groves i didnt realize we thought russia was the enemy or are we just planning ahead i dont know about that and dont go putting words in my mouth im just doing a job here and so are you you can think about policy on your own time but ill tell you this whoever has this thing wont have any enemies oppenheimer looked up at him smoking thats a comforting thought connolly had watched this exchange as if it were the volley of a tennis match now looking at each other they seemed stuck or at least reluctant to press an advantage dont tell him connolly said breaking the moment groves turned to him puzzled who the president dont tell him they both looked at him shocked it was oppenheimer finally who spoke he has to mr connolly he said as if he were being patient with a child they now stood together in front of him and connolly saw in that instant a couple locked in some strange union that would always supersede quarrels and irritation married finally to the project why connolly said im going to forget you said that mister groves said this is the army dont you forget that im not suggesting anythingdisloyal what do you call it connolly hesitated for a minute a strategic advantage groves glared at him then backed down youve got two minutes and keep it simple im just a soldier look connolly began speaking to oppenheimer you asked me to think about what we should do here i have thought about it and every time i come back to where we started karl he turned to include groves you sent me here to find out who killed karl eisler didnt kill him any more than that kid theyve got locked up down in albuquerque did we still dont know who killed karl but now we know something else something even more important and it turns out the one leads to the other the same guy get who killed karl and we get the link outside agreed up until now weve been looking for a murderer instead we found a spy karl led us to eisler and now were stuck so we have to turn the thing around its like a crossword see weve been doing the horizontal and were out of clues so weve got to work downward instead fill it in that way look for a spy to find a murderer this make any sense to you groves said to oppenheimer or am i the only one who still doesnt know what hes talking about let him finish oppenheimer said interested what exactly am i not supposed to tell the president groves said well what exactly do you tell him connolly answered we cant prove anything i made a lucky guess and eisler confessed maybe he was crazy this is a guy who kills himself with radiation so how reliable is he maybe im crazy youve only got my word that he said anything he talked to me too oppenheimer said playing devils advocate and maybe he was lying for whatever reason who knows why maybe none of it happened can we prove it did he wasnt lying oppenheimer said no he wasnt but were the only ones who know that look around connolly said sweeping his hand toward the sunny mesa anything seem wrong to you any reason to thinkany proof that somethings wrong what do you believe general do you believe me do you think i was taken in by a crazy man telling stories maybe im telling storiesthats what i get paid to do all youve got is my word do you trust me that much youre wasting time groves said i dont have to trust you if dr oppenheimer says its true then it is we have to do something then let me finish what i started you know as well as i do that once they get hold of this well have a chinese fire drill around here everybodyll want to do something i can hear them already why didnt you tighten security how could it happen youve got a new president do you know him is he going to back you up when everybody starts jumping up and down hed have to do something maybe hed start at the top groves frowned not saying anything the point is we dont know but the odds are they wont be able to fix anything and theyll make one hell of a mess trying oppenheimer looked over at groves waiting groves stared at the ground moving his foot in thought youre a good talker he said to connolly but you dont know what youre asking i cant do it i have to tell him maybe but not quite yet all ive raised is a suspicion youd have to investigate to find out if theres anything to it youre not putting the project itself in danger this isnt about sabotage and you dont want to send out any false alarms if theres the possibility of a security leak youd have to try and plug it its your projectyoud have to decide the best way to go about that and thats you its not them its a chance i know but well never get it if this goes beyond the three of us i could delay telling you he said looking directly at groves im independent maybe i didnt want to come to you until i had more to go on i should have but it would be your head groves said yes i wouldnt have any choice no you wouldnt youd do that im not in the army its easier for me i justwanted to close the case groves looked around glancing over toward the jemez mountains but you werent the only one there that leaves you robert oppenheimer took a drag on his cigarette then looked at groves we wouldnt be here if it werent for connolly we wouldnt know any of it under the circumstances he paused i think he might be given a little more rope groves was silent you hang yourself with it he said finally dr oppenheimers out of it that understood connolly nodded youll have everything you need for the record if you need it i just delayed telling you both of you i dont like this oppenheimer said no hes right connolly said you cant have anything to do with this you know it could have happened this way he said turning to groves you wouldnt know anything about it if i hadnt told you why did you groves said i need your help he had been looking at groves but it was oppenheimer who said what do you have in mind first some classified papers something to hook him something eislers already handed over so they know its real but that somebody else might have access to bait could you do that oppenheimer nodded wait a minute groves said you want to pass classified documents something they already have connolly said or eisler said they have if we believe him but we do believe him dont we i cant allow this do you know what it means if yes but i wont get caught im not planning to go to jail how about first telling me what in gods name is going on groves said irritably wiping his forehead and do we have to stand out here in the sun connolly nodded and began leading them toward the shade of the water tower theres only one way to do this we have to give him another eisler we dont know how they put people here maybe there isnt anybody else but either way theyre going to need a new source its late theyre hungry just who did you have in mind oppenheimer said ive been thinking about that ideally a scientist of course but its too tricky and there isnt enough time we have to assume theyve got a list of the scientists working on the projectthat would be the first thing theyd ask for groves groaned out loud so its too easy to check connolly continued theyd spot a marker right away just from the list whos the new guy never heard of him and of course if they do have somebody else up here hed spot it as a ghost then theres the background we say our mans from berkeley they check berkeley its a fairly small community isnt it its unlikely youd have a spare physicist up here nobodys ever heard of quite oppenheimer said are you proposing to use a real person no youve got four thousand people up here technical support comes and goes we make up a dummy file in one of these areas maybe the special engineering detachment there are always new seds coming in but someone who could put his hands on the papers an idealist he said to groves who was watching him with growing discomfort you could set up some army records couldnt you ill make up a project folderbio clearance the usual just put it in the files if weve got a leak up here hell know where to go and well have it all ready for him he looked up at the giant tower crisscrossed wooden slats rising to support the broad tank los alamoss empire state building maybe well call him waterman theres a waterman in metallurgy oppenheimer said okay waters then steve i think that sounds about right corporal steve waters sed the rat you think this is funny groves said impatiently i fail to see anything funny about it i dont know what were playing at here this isnt some petty crime anymore connolly reddened at the schoolboy reprimand what makes a crime pettythe amount you steal dont start with me its the same connolly said same people who knock over a liquor store calling them agents doesnt make them smarter who do you think does this anyway masterminds im not trying to break up the rackets im just looking for a guy who got jumpy with a tire iron groves snorted and looked away his eyes following a coal delivery truck rumbling toward boiler no theres only one thing i dont understand oppenheimer said as if nothing had happened your phantom corporal waters has some valuable papers to offer how do you let them know put an ad in the papers i assume theres a network our rent collector may be only one link but no one works alone on that end you know like the numbers he said looking at groves i need to get access to the network someone to pass on the invitation if theyre as efficient as we think they are theyll come calling you know someone like that groves said why dont we just haul him in anyone can pass a message i thought of your brother he said to oppenheimer then turned to groves but i suspect youre already having him watched that would complicate things no one said a word groves already red and sweating flushed and looked away frank left the party oppenheimer said quietly some time ago and theyd probably think it was all a little too good to be true connolly continued theyd want to be very careful with anyone close to you and we dont have time for that theres someone else i dont know if hes involved in the partys extracurricular activities or not i doubt it but hed know someone who is or someone who knows someone we just need to get the ball started and hope they pick it up and run with it it may not work its only a chance hed be taking a chance too your friend oppenheimer said thoughtfully hed have to trust you would he connolly met his gaze yes he would hes here oppenheimer said tentatively no thats where i need your help general connolly said drawing the still sulking groves back to the conversation i assume you could get a section file without raising any eyebrows thats alien registration i know what it is i need an address current name connolly looked at him are we on with this or not groves hesitated for another minute then sighed name matthew lawson connolly said brit here since before the war new york maybe can you get it groves nodded if theyve got him on file i can get it who is he you dont want to know that in fact from now on you dont want to know anything you dont want to know what im doing youd need to be able to say that honestly im justlate telling you about eisler thats all groves nodded again then folded his arms across his chest one thing if i dont know i wont be able to say anything to army intelligence if they should get the idea to put you under surveillance i cant call them off i know the minute you take those papers out of here youre breaking the law lets see how good they are itll be a test for them test groves said grumpily i dont like any of this any of it this place it was easier building the pentagon but oppenheimer was looking at connolly with amusement mr connolly has a flair for the clandestine have you done this before connolly thought of motel rooms and glances avoided in fuller lodge just lately are we finished here can we go back and cool off before i change my mind groves said were finished connolly said im going over to the hospital to get eislers things ill go through his place one more time you never know when you get the address he said to groves maybe youd better send it through the telex line the codes safer one more thing groves said putting his damp jacket on you want me to go out on a limb for you no questions so just tell me one thing what do you think the odds are this can actually work connolly shook his head the odds are always good when its the only hand youve got his bravado evaporated as he walked toward the infirmary how many times did a long shot come in except this time it wasnt just the bet it was what hed have to use to make it everything would depend on her it wasnt right but it had sat there his only idea and hed had to pick it up he wondered in that moment why hed jumped at it excited by something he knew was wrong then caught in a tangle of inevitability deaf now even to himself could he lose her no hed stop if it came to that he thought of eisler in his lab those desperate seconds lowering the cube before it went critical the trick was to stop in time before the dragon turned but what if it took on a life of its own what if simply starting the process demanded its only conclusion he looked around the hillclothes near the mckee units flapping on lines in the bright dry air a repairman high up on one of the overhead transformers soldiers in jeepsand it seemed to him utterly ordinary everyone was just getting on with the day making a bomb in the infirmary someone was sitting on eislers bed he took in the bruised side of the face the bandage over the forehead cut before he recognized corporal batchelor what happened to you i walked into a door batchelor said his voice flat next to the neat pile of eislers effects his battered face was jarring the disorder of violence how did you hear he asked embarrassed i didnt i came for these are you all right the boy nodded that must have been some door connolly said moving toward eislers things you going to let him get away with it the soldier shrugged it was just a door ill live the unfriendly kind the boy smiled weakly wincing a little from the cut at the corner of his mouth yeah the big unfriendly kind ill have to be more careful at the px maybe next time you should just stay away connolly said then hearing the tone of his voice sorry i didnt mean it like that its all right the soldier said his face weary i had it coming nobody has it coming connolly said suddenly angry for him then aware that he didnt know anything about it what was it like living this way was every meeting a risk he thought again of the ordinary world outside so bright that it made any other invisible and then it occurred to him that it might have been a different kind of misstep the wrong question connollys fault this didnt have anything to do withi mean i hope you werent snooping the boy shook his head no nothing like that just a door i never heard a word by the way since you ask i know he wasntwe made a mistake the boy looked at him so what was it we know it wasnt that dont worry nobodys going to bother anybody he nodded his head again good im glad about that anyway so dont go banging into any more doors not because of that the soldier shrugged im just a bad judge of character thats all i never was good at that how about you the question caught connolly offguard as if it had come from another conversation not very sometimes he moved to gather up eislers things i still think youve got a lot of guts though the smile this time was fuller a wry grimace yeah thanks i also think youre a damned fool to let him get away with it you ought to turn the bastard in when batchelor looked up at him his eyes seemed almost pleading i cant dont you know that thats the way it works i cant connolly thought about him as he walked toward eislers apartment carrying the valise it shouldnt be that easy to get hurt he wondered what would happen to batchelor after the war when he would drift off the hill to some other life hidden from connolly and everyone else until it showed up again on his face at least his mystery had its bits of visible evidence eislers had receded with him here were the clothes the books the old pictures connolly sat smoking for a while in eislers living room peering at the walls as if some idea lurked there waiting to be found then he started going through the books he took them down from the shelves flipped through then made piles on the floor nothing he remembered that first night in karls room the presence in those few neat possessions someone who was still living there and had been delayed on his way back but eisler was gone perhaps had never been here at all all these objects rooms full of them pared away until finally there was only one idea those last weeks with connolly had been his one brief contact and then he had gone back into hiding what was it like to believe so completely to let everything go but one thing what was it like not to care who got hurt standing there with a meaningless german book in his hand connolly felt the room go empty an entire life for a single idea and it had been wrong i wont bloody do it she said sitting up youve got to i dont she had gathered the crumpled sheet around her as if she had been surprised by an intruder the room was warm closed against the afternoon light youre the only way it can work he said calmly she stared at him then jumped out of bed and grabbed the clothes off the floor she held them in front of her then turned to the bathroom door tripping in the dimness bugger she said stumbling toward the window when she jerked the cord of the shade the light of the room amber and erotic flashed harsh white a cheap rug and formica table connolly sitting up in the messy bed he watched her try to pull on her slip turning it around to find the opening anxious to be covered ill be with you every step he said she stopped frustrated with the slip and stood holding it youre lovely she said lovely waiting till wed done it before youd ask what did you think a good slap and tickle and then a bit of spying on the side theres a good girl you must be mad i wont emma please ive explained it badly have you she said struggling with the slip again cheat on one husband then go and trap another thats roughly it isnt it i wont thank you very much hes my husband or was is whatever he is im not sending him to jail he wont go to jail they dont want himhes the gobetween at the worst theyd ship him home yes funny i can hear the keys rattling already i dont understand you he walked out on you well thats not quite a prison offense yet is it they wouldnt have enough jails its not about him it is to me i dont want to see him hes dead and im not bringing him back to life just so you can put him away nobodys putting him away well whatever happens it would be my doing wouldnt it you wouldnt even know he existed if i hadnt told you before

i didnt know she went in for that sort of thing nobody knows nobodys going to what made you think id do it i thought youd want to he said evenly weve got to find out its important want to why for the good of the country dont make me laugh i thought youd do it for karl karl she said disconcerted karls dead so is eisler maybe somebody else for all we know maybe the whole bloody world look you carry the sword of vengeance youre good at it emma i need you to help me hell trust you what makes you think so old times sake or am i supposed to go to bed with him is that it maybe you want to watch dont is that it just like mata hari no of course not if youd let me explain oh you youd talk the birds from the trees to get your way i suppose well be saving the world next with me on my back will you listen you listen she said giving up on the slip and walking over to the bathroom listen to yourself you might be surprised what you hear she slammed the door behind her he sat on the bed for a minute waiting but there was only the sound of running water he put on his pants and went over to the window turning the slats of the blinds halfway to look out at the dusty parking lot her anger had surprised him it seemed to thrash and spurt like some well that bursts deep down thwarted till it reaches air he thought of that night at the square dance when it seemed no more than high spirits when he had first wanted her he wondered if she was douching washing him away he lit a cigarette and watched the smoke catch the light the awful thing was she was right hed waited till they were finished hed made love to her knowing he would ask when she came out of the bathroom she was in her slip and her face was still damp with water she brushed back her hair with her fingers and sat down crossing her legs with a theatrical calmness dont worry she said i wont bite do you have another one of those he handed her a cigarette not saying anything so that the silence was an apology the air in the room settled all the bad words seeping out the window with the smoke is it important to you she said finally yes yes it would be wouldnt it her lips curled in a kind of amused resignation as if she were laughing at herself what are you thinking about he asked about my father she said almost dreamily he got it right didnt he heres the roomseedy that would be his word for it in the middle of some american desert thats about nowhere or near enough and im sitting here smoking a cigarette in my slip like a slut emma no like a slut some mans sweat still all over me and a husband down the road and another somewhere elsemy god quite a sight and my lover well my lover all very much as he predicted no it isnt isnt it i love you and that makes it all different whatever that means it means i wont

never mind you cant promise but you would youd lie you couldnt help it i wont lie to you nothings going to happen to him i wont whore for you do you really think id ask you to do that no then whats this all about she turned away facing the room i dont know not wanting to rake up the past i suppose can you understand that you never know what youre going to find i dont want to go back its just this once youd have to sometime to straighten things out you mean oh thats good darling do lets get a friendly annulment meanwhile here are some lovely secrets for your trouble is that the idea my god i dont know if i can do it im not that good a liar its not a lie the papers are real i wouldnt be hed spot it in a minute why him of all people you didnt have anywhere else to turn you trust him he met her glance why now how did i know where to find him youve known for some time you just didnt want torake up the past but now im ready for a bit of gardening this was important you need his help for your lovers sake well at least that wouldnt be lying your lover corporal waters box santa fe whats he like this one an idealist like the first one what a bastard you are hell believe you these things run to type until you she said stubbing out the cigarette but she was interested now in spite of herself why not daniel hes real they could check what am i supposed to tell him by the way im off to new york for some shopping i dont know yet well have to come up with something maybe oppies asked you to help with some visiting brits its a chance to get away something emma got up and looked out the window ill have to tell him about us sometime you know maybe its now not yet she turned to look at him why out of curiosity its better to wait we dont know how hell react besides hes busy useful you mean to the project we wouldnt want to risk any complications now would we of a personal nature no we wouldnt she looked at him for a minute then began pacing across the room right so my new friendi suppose youve got a whole history worked out for him we can do that on the train my new friend the latest in that long line daddy predicted she put her hand up before he could speak you want me to get into the spirit of things dont you anyway hes all in a bother conscience connolly ignored the tone were building a terrible weapon he said deliberately so terrible it will change everything we thought the nazis were building one too but now theyre gone so he doesnt understand why its still secret some of the scientists dont want it used at all they want to get the word out but theres nothing they can do the whole place is sealed up tight the only hope theyve got of controlling it is if everyone knows if everyone gets scared otherwise the army can do anything it wants not just japan russia anywhere it likes why not tell our own allies unless we want to keep it for ourselves for afterward as long as we own the secret were a threat to everybody well be the nazis emma stared at him her face sober and quiet she had stopped pacing and was crossing her arms and holding herself as if she were huddling against a chill is that true its how corporal waters would see it the scientists i mean do they really want everyone to know they will right now all they can think about is getting it to work they think its theirs they dont realize theyre just doing piecework for the army do you believe it though or is it all just part of the story it doesnt matter but i think if youre the only guy holding a gun a lot of people will feel like corporal waters maybe theyd be right but you want to stop them even if theyre right i dont believe in handing someone else a gun either he might shoot people usually do like cowboys no like countries like show trials and wars and killing lots of people not just one i dont trust them with a gun im not an idealist yes you are she said quietly youre the worst kind you want to do it yourself she dropped her arms and slowly moved toward him i know i run to type he stood now facing her afraid to touch i wont ask if you dont want to she shook her head placing her hand on his arm no ask me nobody ever did before youd have to be careful remember karl careful if i were careful i wouldnt be here at all then you will you want me to dont you he nodded youll come with me i have to youre my cover he said what do you mean i told you nobody knows if i leave the hill our friends in g will follow me theyll wonder where im going they wont wonder after they see you you think of everything dont you and whats our story are we supposed to be having an affair we could be he said smiling do you think anybody would believe that anybody she was silent for a moment but no harm to matthew what if youre wrong what if he wont do it what if he sends me packing then well have a weekend in new york he wont though the stuffs real they wont be able to resist but no harm no he said reaching for her youre awfully loyal to your husband mm she said all of them but think what i do for you he kissed her holding her close to him now i just appeal to your better instincts youre a bastard youd even use this to get your way wouldnt you if it would work he said kissing her again would it ask me later i thought they canceled all leaves mills said civilians get special privileges connolly said its only four days dont you think im entitled to one listening to you all day two leaves were arranged mills said handing him the papers maybe youd better take both i dont think so i only need one connolly said taking it are you being cute or is it just my imagination anything special you want me to do while youre gone no check in with holliday though just to be nice see if anybodys gone to church tell him i still havent got a goddamn thing not even an idea maybe ill think of something while im away you intend to do a lot of thinking huh you know in security you get to know all kinds of things the tricks not to leap to any conclusions of course i dont have to tell youyoure a professional right mills said then grinned have fun anyway connolly smiled back do me one favor though will you when you talk to whoever it is you talk to would you leave her name out of it i wouldnt want anyone to get the wrong idea people get upset youre lucky you dont get shot you going to leave a number its procedure make one up id only leave a phony and id find out thats procedure too oppenheimer had pulled strings for a pullman an oasis of privilege on the crowded train but even so the trip was hot and dusty after the high new mexican plateau they went down into the flat bottomland of america where the heat was oppressive a furnace of hot air that left grit on the skin as it blew through the car drying sweat and scattering paper a group of servicemen rowdy and insistent had taken over the club car and their singing as they crossed the empty plains had the disruptive sound of a brawl chattanooga choochoo connolly thought irritably maybe the musicians who had written the happy train songs had been drunk in the club car too seeing the dingy interiors glow with a boozy shine dinner was chewy lamb chops and canned peas slapped down by harried waiters with an eye to the line already forming at the door for the next sitting they drank cold beer and went to bed exhausted without being tired waiting for the clicking of the rails to lull them to sleep instead connolly lay on top of the hot sheets squirming in the dark and finally dreamed of eisler standing at the blackboard studying his fate the next day was better emma sat leafing through magazines her skirt hiked up around her thighs to catch the breeze the landscape was green now and moist and connolly watched it lazily ignoring the magazine in his lap a gis account of okinawa filtered through another connolly at owi for the right polish no incontinence and night fears wounds to the abdomen never lower no one was ever hit in the genitals corpses in photographs were whole connolly had heard stories of loose body parts being removed from the ground so that the picture could be shot but that had been before when morale had been an issue now there was a new brutality to the layouts gis stared out from the slick pages glazed and slackjawed stunned by the fanaticism of the enemy the hills were pockmarked with thousands of handdug caves even at the end the war meant to go on and on there was still time for the gadget outside the window farms and wooded hills slipped by sleepy and unknowing a quick thunderstorm sent streaks of rain along the dining car windows during lunch blocking the view emma preoccupied picked at her chicken salad too listless to look out you all right connolly said she nodded youre not sorry you came i was sorry before i came now im curious about matthew she nodded again whats he like do you think do you know actually did they tell you an address he works in union square he still does some kind of work for the party i dont know what do you mind about him i mean i havent seen him yet he said lightly is he goodlooking he was maybe he just seemed that way because the comrades were so dreary she caught his look yes hes goodlooking fair thinhe never ate cheese and a biscuit that would do he likedyou dont really want to know all this do you no no she agreed anyway that was then people change she turned her fork thinking if hes still working for the party why is he allowed to stay its not illegal but they keep an eye out i guess do they know about me no you dont exist i like that like riding on trains isnt it no one knows who you are youre just a ticket ive always liked that even now i shouldnt i know but im rather enjoying this you dont look as if youre enjoying it i am though in a way watching you get all cross in the heat nobody to bother us not even having to talk not a care in the world she looked up at him all right not exactly were not exactly alone either what do you mean dont lookno really dont look why do people always turn when you say that when you get a chance the guy two tables behind you in the paisley tie what am i supposed to do drop a fork she said teasing i havent done that since school are you serious about this you might look for a waiter if you want some more iced tea you are serious she waited for a minute then turned to look her eyes resting only for a moment on the other table what the man with the ice cream she said as she turned back youre joking no hes tailing us how do you know did you see his hat they always put their hats where they can get them in a hurry its practically a calling card rubbish he hasnt looked at you once maybe im not his type not that way he hasnt looked at you at all i dont believe you fine all the better youll act naturally which is what we want not now i wont she said putting down her fork why all the mystery anyway its ridiculous isnt he one of yours i hope so then why army intelligence doesnt like me very much somebody comes in from the outside they have to think somethings going on they hate being left out so they watch its what they do but cant you have him called off then theyd know something was going on right now im just a bad boy taking advantage of some privileges they wish they had they have no idea what were doing except the obvious he smiled except the obvious then why did you say you hoped it was them well theres another possibility we still dont know whos on the hill karl was in intelligence and hes dead this guy may be one of ours but i dont recognize him so i hope its just somebody lansdales brought in to play house detective otherwise we could have a problem either way i dont want him around when you see matthew that could ruin everything emma thought for a minute stirring with her long iced tea spoon youre right im not enjoying this not anymore its not much fun is it everybody lying to everybody i wish you hadnt told me why did you youd have to know sometime we have to lose him i cant do that alone why bother youd just be looking for the next at least hes the devil you know we cant do this with an audience whoever he is one of ours one of theirs maybe both at the same time we cant take the chance matthew has to believe you or this wont work at all and what if hes just a man with a hat then he wont mind look nobody knows about matthew its the one chance we have of protecting him unless it works emma said turning her head to the window the rains stopped now its just steaming i said id do what i could connolly said why dont we take this one step at a time right what do we do first push him off the train its not a joke emma then stop enjoying it so much its all a game to you spot him lose him see how good they are see how good you are my god i wish we were done with this were almost there he said evenly calming her can i ask you something if no one knows were doing this that means no ones looking after us either doesnt it if anything happens i mean there wont be anyone not even the man with the hat thats right i hadnt thought about that should i be frightened are you no oddly enough but then im a wellknown fool nobody knows that here he said smiling youre just a ticket remember your friend knows she said moving her head slightly toward him he knows youre here he doesnt know what youre doing what am i supposed to be doing having fun being bad he reached across the table to cover her hand im not she said pretend smile back at me laugh a little if you can manage it i thought we were trying to lose him not put on a show not yet later first we have to establish you how do we do that finish your tea then well go back to the compartment and hang out a do not disturb sign and make lots of noise they listen at keyholes she said they bribe porters youre serious about the noise anyway its hot steaming well take some ice she laughed at him now a low murmur thats it he said just like that how long does all this take before im established we have all day we can lose him in new jersey people are always getting lost in new jersey they left the train in newark half hidden by a pool of servicemen greeting their families on the platform go to the ladies then meet me at the buses he said as they walked where out to the right follow the signs while he follows you no hell assume were still on the train what about the porter we left the tiphe wont care hell think were in the club car last call and if he does follow you then you wont see me at the bus station but he was waiting for her fanning himself with a newspaper on one of the wooden benches the air heavy and sticky smelled of cheap diesel what have you got in here anyway he said pointing to her suitcase my trousseau she sat down so are we alone i think so now what bus in ten minutes then we find a hotel you didnt book yes he said smiling but if we go there why did we bother to get off the train i told you i wasnt very good at this i just want a bath i dont care where it is what do you think that mans doing now our friend hes running around penn station sweating emma giggled goodness he must be angry unless youre wrong of course maybe hes just a man heading for a long soak in the tub and were the ones running around sweating either way connolly said the bus was crowded and connolly had to stand resting against the arm of her seat and holding on to the luggage rack as they bounced through the new jersey marshes when they swept around the great curve to the tunnel the city gleaming across the water he felt for the first time the excitement of homecoming then the overbright bathroom tiles of the tunnel and they were in the crowded streets turning down into the basement of the hotel dixie with its rows of storage lockers and shoeshine stands and people holding tickets on their way to somewhere out on the street he felt overwhelmed like a farm boy in the movies even in the heat everything moved quickly taxis and boys in navy whites and khaki and lights racing through neon tubes no one had even heard of los alamos they took a taxi to a hotel on lexington not far from grand central where he managed to wangle a room facing the side street when he opened the window soot blew in with the sound of the third avenue el but there was a fan and water gushed from the taps a world away from the drought on the hill not exactly the waldorf is it emma said we wouldnt get into the waldorf have a bath youll feel better its the same water at half the price care to join me she said undressing you go i have to make some calls old girlfriends no about tomorrow oh she said no longer smiling then went to the bathroom and closed the door he called tony at costellos to arrange the next days meetingyeah two booths i got it what you got going some skirtthen talked to a friend on the paper about the wire he placed a call to mills smoking a cigarette by the window as he waited for the longdistance connection i thought you were at the hotel pennsylvania mills said what makes you think im not there was a pause very funny mills said finally i never made it its hot back here i decided to cool off in the country instead which is why the operator said the call was from new york must be a mistake yeah howd you manage the disappearing act connolly was silent okay so im just wasting the governments money whyd you call anyway to hear what you just told me mills paused again you dont want to annoy people mike you really dont now what am i supposed to tell him tell him theres a good band on the pennsylvania roof hell enjoy it i just want some privacy out here in the country yeah privacy well youve got it unless i can trace the call dont even bother im in a booth but you probably figured that already shit mills said hanging up when he went into the bathroom she was lying back with her knees sticking out of the water like islands staring ahead at nothing you going to stay in there all night he said starting to undress everythings going to be all right isnt it she said still preoccupied yes i mean really all right she said looking up at him he nodded come on finish up and well go out somewhere youre joking i cant move okay he said climbing into the tub and falling on her splashing water over the side what are you doing she said laughing lets stay here he said kissing her stop oh look at the mess its water they expect that here oh its that sort of hotel is it sure no really we cant look at the floor she sat up water sliding off her breasts i thought you couldnt move he said holding her by the waist come on lie down you ought to cool off she said rolling over on top of him and pushing him under when he pulled his head up sputtering she was already out of the tub grabbing a towel he stood up playing a sea monster and reached out for her my god youre not going to chase me around the room she said laughing you look ridiculous he lunged for her she darted out of the room and ran over to the fan but he grabbed her by the waist pulling her toward the bed were all wet she said playing so what he lowered her to the bed the bedll be sopping well sleep in the tub he said moving his hand up along her leg soapy and slick anything else the curtain she said quickly her breath shallow he grinned at her then got up and flicked off the light he had thought she might move but she lay still the fan blowing over her body he stood at the foot of the bed looking at her white skin in the faint light that came from the bathroom then moved his hands along her legs passing over her belly until they rested under her breasts when he bent over and kissed them one after the other she shivered its not right she said this isnt supposed to be fun he moved his face from her breasts up to her neck lowering his body onto hers so that their wet skins slid against each other who says who made that up she took his head in her hands as he bent to kiss her tell me you love me tell me its all right its all right he said and then entering her he felt her clutch him inside as if her whole body were holding on to him afterward they showered separately suddenly shy with each other she toweled her hair by the fan rubbing it with a tropical laziness do you really want to go out she said cant we just have room service i dont think they have room service here maybe a bellboy with an ice bucket do you want a drink id fall over youll feel better after some food should i call him now she said unexpectedly no in the morning dont give him any time to think he said a hunters voice i mean i know what you mean she said dully and got up to dress they ate in a restaurant near times square oysters wedged in a plate of crushed ice and tall glasses of beer whose coating of frost evaporated in the heat outside the streets were crowded and steamy emma picked at her food barely making conversation and after a second beer connolly began to wilt too so that even the rattling noise of the restaurant became fuzzy want to go hear some music he said she smiled at him you always said wed do that and now that were here im too tired to go maybe tomorrow when its over all right he said not wanting to talk about it we could go to the top of the rca building theres always a breeze there you dont have to entertain me id be happy with bed but it was too hot to go back to the hotel so they went to an aircooled movie instead where the crisp refrigerated air reminded him of the hill the newsreel was still filled with clips of german atrocities and now the long lines of dps shuffling sadly past the bomb sites the feature something called pillow to post with ida lupino was bright and shiny oblivious to what had come before and halfway through connolly forgot what it was supposed to be about emma took his hand in the movie holding it lightly as if they were on a date the streets were as crowded as before people pouring out of the theaters and flirting and eating ice cream cones the lights were dazzling knickerbocker beer a giant pepsi in perpetual effervescence here anyway the war was over but everything familiar seemed to him suspended they had all come out to pass the time while they waited for the next thing the feature after the newsreel what could it be except brighter worth the wait he steered away from the theaters and they walked back on quieter streets still holding hands easy with each other listening to the sound of her heels on the pavement hed thought of a drink in the astor bar or now the biltmore but all that seemed curiously part of the past too nothing to do with them now they were a couple eager to get home when she smeared her face with cold cream back in the room it seemed to him more intimate than lovemaking a new familiarity he sat at the window while she drifted off to sleep restless and it occurred to him then looking at her that the trip wasnt about tomorrow anymore tomorrow would take care of itself but while he waited his life had changed this was what it meant to be married her help so casually asked for now bound him in some deep obligation if they stopped now they could be as they were idly suspended like the crowd hidden away in this cocoon of humid air instead he would compromise her as determined and heedless as oppenheimer to see his project through but they werent going to stopit was sleep talking the nighttime jitters this was the next thing she had understood before he did accepted it she turned over in bed no longer fitful breathing deeply he had always loved her fearlessness now she was offering it to him a secret marriage they could have something more than peace he thought of her leaping up the trail at chaco eager lending him a hand when he woke the next morning she was already up sitting by the window in her slip putting on red nail polish a coffeepot and cups sat on the table at last she said come and have your coffee they do have room service you see you just have to ask he put on a robe what are you doing you want me to look the part dont you she spread her nails in front of her a girl has to look her best for this sort of thing its pretty red he said pouring the coffee meaning too red darling a lot you know on johanna weber its too red on me itll be smart there see now well just wait for it to dry lets hope to god this fan doesnt give outits been going all night he drank the coffee shaking his head to wake up you always do that undressed of course until it dries if it streaks its hell to get out how many women have you actually been with she said smiling or dont you usually spend the night he lit a cigarette with the zippo then looked at her through the smoke are you always this cheerful or are you nervous she gave a halflaugh dont be so knowing a little of both i guess maybe a lot ill be all right do you want to run through it again no i know what to say at least roughly its not exactly a script is it i mean a lot depends on what he says okay lets call him no finish your coffee and go take a shower then ill call i really dont think i can do this with an audience he looked at her surprised she came over and took his cigarette in one of the nooks of her outstretched fingers taking a drag then holding it out for him to take back whats the matter dont you think i can ill be at the restaurant i know i cant think why just to be around in case you need me hovering i suppose all right but not now please i mean it hurry up and clear out connolly looked at his watch you think hes already at work you dont know the comrades up with the sun they are better watch the jokes he may not like it she glanced up at him you know i hate to point this out but he is my husband i already know what he likes connolly looked away and put out the cigarette right i keep forgetting i dont mean what you think i mean oh never mind come on move ive got a hair appointment does he like that i like it i dont want to go looking like a ranch hand he looked at her interested you want to impress him dont you she nodded a little is that so naughty of me i suppose it is you want to see if hes still attracted to you i just want to see if he notices he stood under the shower letting the water sting his face awake feeling apprehensive he hadnt expected to be a bystander but if he couldnt trust her what was the point when the shower stopped he heard her talking low and indistinct and he had to stop himself from flinging open the door instead he went over to the sink and started shaving his ears straining to make out her voice it had to be him what was taking so long he stood there his face half covered with soap listening then turned on the tap to rinse the razor so that he wouldnt hear any more when he came out of the bathroom a towel around his waist she was still sitting with the phone cradled in her lap looking out the window any problems twelve not twelvethirty she said still looking away that all right sure he said why she looked at him a wry smile at the corner of her mouth he has to be back for a meeting a meeting you overrate my charms still he did manage to fit me in her voice seemed light and wounded at the same time and he didnt know how to respond how did he sound surprised she got up and began putting on her dress did he know the place hell find it third and fortyfourth right he did wonder why we couldnt meet nearer the office but i said since id come halfway across the country he might manage a trip uptown my god do you think its possible for someone not to change at all did he ask why there yes i told him id always wanted to see the thurber murals you got that wrong thoughnever heard of him stop worrying its all right and you im all right too she said going over to the mirror to put on lipstick a little funny right now but ill be fine im even beginning to look forward to it she blotted her lips you neednt fret this is going to be easier than i thought a piece of cake well a piece of something right she said packing her handbag im off what do you think she flounced her hair something off the shoulders but not too gorgeous youre beautiful he said seriously she stopped by the door and looked at him her face soft thanks she said then determined to be light she winked at him next time try saying it with your clothes on shall i meet you back here weve still got the morning to get through no lets go for a walk ill meet you at the library over on fifth out in front by the lions patience and fortitude she looked at him blankly thats what theyre calledthe lions the things you know she said when she was gone the room was quiet and he walked around nervously at loose ends everything was different from the way he had imagined it back on the hill the air was close smelling of her perfume he went over to the suitcase and took out the envelope with oppenheimers papers he held it for a minute staring at it as if the weight of what was inside would ground him but now it seemed no more serious than a prop it was a piece of the greatest secret of the war and all he could think about was how shed feel when she saw him the first man shed loved she took hours he waited at the library hiding from the sun under the wispy trees on the terrace then pacing back toward the lions afraid he would miss her the day was hot but not as humid as before and occasional drafts of baked air would sweep down the avenue blowing skirts he stood for a long time watching the traffic streams of buses and shiny cars and not a military vehicle in sight shading his eyes against the glare everything seemed too bright and buoyant as if the city had opened up to the sun and even furtive meetings would have to be drenched in light he smoked impatient and then he saw her coming across the street and all the waiting disappeared he knew as she stepped off the curb that it was one of those moments that becomes a photograph even as its happening flashed into the memory to be taken out later still sharp she was wearing a white dress with padded shoulders spectator pumps a bag clutched under her arm her skirt moved with her as she walked outlining her legs her hair just grazing the back of her neck swung as she looked back and forth eager and expectant her red lips already parted in a smile when she caught his eye he felt he had never seen her before how do i look she said bright and pleased with herself a woman only asks that when she already knows the answer tell me anyway like a million dollars how do you feel not quite that rich these shoes she said grimacing they went behind the library to bryant park and watched people pretending not to look at the time she sat with her legs crossed one shoe dangling off the end of her foot hadnt you better give me the papers she said casually he reached into his breast pocket for the envelope and then unconsciously held it in front of him reluctant to let it go whats the matter think im going to run off and give it to the russians or something he handed her the envelope and watched her slip it into her bag none of this seems real does it he said ive just committed a crime and were making jokes sorry she said coolly its just nerves no not youeverything whats it supposed to be like he shrugged i dont know trenchcoats and fog i guess anyway not a nice ordinary day in the park you sound disappointed she said then looked up at the sky you might get your rain though would that help it might your trouble is youre stuck in some boys own story secret drawers and lemonjuice ink and all the rest of it but maybe its always like this really out here in the sun feed the birds exchange a little information and go about your business maybe theyre all up to something she nodded toward the people on the other benches they dont look it well neither do we neither did professor eisler i still cant quite believe it he didnt feel he was doing anything wrong he was just an altar boy you always feel something she said looking out at the park her voice was darker as if a cloud had passed over it and he was quiet for a moment not sure how to change the subject what about the woman over there in the straw hat he said a parlor game whats she up to her she doesnt look like an agent perhaps shes cheating on her husband not the same thing it feels like it emma said its exciting all the pretending and then always something awful underneath he turned to face her i wont cheat no dont she said smiling a little id know she looked down at her watch youd better push off now i think id like a few minutes alone get myself in the mood you know i cant concentrate with you around mooning and getting into a state whats it like anyway the restaurant gloomy noisy its a news hangout so much for your atmosphere she said laughing no dontyoull smudge okay he said getting up you remember where it is yes yes come on push off youre sure youll be all right she looked up at him ill be fine ive had lots of practice youre not going to get me in any trouble with that are you tony said watching connolly string the wire between the booths would i do that to you he sat in the corner of his booth cupping the earpiece in his hand so that he appeared to be merely leaning his head against the wall can you see anything trouble thats all i see how about a beer sure you want something to eat you got a whole booth whats cold fried clams connolly grinned fried when just bring me a tuna sandwich tuna sandwich tony said moving away for a whole booth the bar in front was beginning to fill up but connolly still had the dining room to himself he hid the earpiece behind a sugar canister and pretended to read the paper everything in him alert the thurber murals the pride of the house were the color of adobe oversized women and wary men chasing each other around the room in a plaster frieze while no one except the dogs paid the slightest attention there was a burst of laughter in the bar connolly had forgotten the sheer energy of new york he thought of the polite academic murmurs of meals on the hill here everyone seemed to be slapping everyone else on the back he had begun the crossword puzzle when emma appeared pointed in by tony who gave him a look when he saw her go past to the next booth connolly lowered his head to the paper so that all he saw was the streak of red nails at eye level her perfume stayed behind her in the thick air he was tempted to turn arounda last reassuring lookbut instead he imagined her sitting in the booth composed winning tony with a smile as he brought her iced tea she was right there was excitement in pretending absurdly he thought of her shoes being tight and the fact that no one else knew he glanced up as each new arrival entered the room then walked past to the back tables tony brought the sandwich but connolly let it sit there too anxious to eat how could lawson be late but they had been early when he did appear five minutes later connolly knew it at once he was tall his bony frame covered in rumpled clothes that seemed just thrown ondark cotton shirt damp at the armpits plain tie knotted tightly yanked down from the unbuttoned collar jacket held by two fingers over his shoulder a village look his pale hair receding but still full on top glistened with sweat his face the boyish soft face of a perennial teenager was red as if he had been running in the heat he looked around nervously then broke into a broad smile when he saw her emma he said coming over to the booth my god you look a treat he continued to stand for a second and connolly imagined him awkward staring at her what do i do do i kiss you connolly heard no response but she must have nodded because there was a rustle of clothing as he bent over then took a seat in the booth connolly leaned into the wall picking up the receiver and hiding it against his ear his crossword pencil lifted to write i cant believe it lawson said his voice still english and hurried enthusiastic all this time you turning up like this the bad penny emma said no its marvelous but what are you doing here how long have you been in the states how didwhere to begin tell me everything his words rushed out happily infectious with the guileless wonder of meeting an old school friend it has been a while hasnt it my god look at you he said again and connolly felt him lean back against the booth to take her in youre the same she said an appraisal but he took it for a compliment well the hair he said evidently brushing it back at the temple i expect itll all go one day but youi cant get over it hows your family my family she said disconcerted theyre fine i havent seen them in years im living here now im married married matthew i divorced you years ago she said smoothly surely you knew no you werent there to contest it you wouldnt have would you he was silent for a minute how could i look i never explained darling dont really it was all a very long time ago and it doesnt matter now i havent come for that i dont understand we havent much time i need to talk to you we can save all those happy days unter den linden for another time youre still angry with me im not really she said softly i was well i dont know what i wasnot angry but that was a lifetime ago before the war we were just children werent we anyway never mind wed better order connolly looked up surprised to see tony standing at the next booth they ordered sandwiches it wasnt all bad was it matthew said when hed gone we had fun in the beginning god your father his voice was bright again and connolly thought he could hear the mischief of those years the delight in provoking is this what shed liked the way he thumbed his nose at the world you were the most marvelous girl he said im still pretty marvelous what about you me still working with the comrades of course doing what exactly i work on the paper its quite good actually there was a falling off after the pactreporters jumping ship you know but of course the war changed all that shoulders together now well well see you mean to stay then if i can were not exactly uncle sams favorite publication but were still in business browders worked miracles anyway this is the place now politically its all a bit like your uncle arthur but everything will change after the war it has to the pressures will be enormous he stopped as the plates were put in front of them you are the same she said a smile in her voice still on the march i cant help that he said catching her tone it still needs doing i grant you its not spain he said reminiscent again its a different sort of fight but as you say were not young anymore i never said that i said i was still marvelous yes he said his voice lingering but married who did you marry by the way someone here a scientist no one you know matthew she said pausing i need you to do something for me anything no dont say that till you hear what it is something important is that why you looked me up yes funny i thought it might bei dont know about us what after all this time he didnt answer theres nothing about us do you understand i want to be quite clear about that why then i need somebody i can trust or maybe its the other way around somebody wholl trust me who knows me connolly cupped the receiver closer to his ear feeling literally like a fly on the wall the approach smooth and plausible was all hers i dont understand are you in some sort of trouble no not exactly we all are in a way thats the point god this is complicated im not quite sure where to begin itll seem fantastic to you it is fantastic sometimes i dont quite believe it myself emma what are you talking about right she said verbally sitting up here goes it wont make sense but hear me out do you have a cigarette you smoke now oh yes im all grown up connolly heard the match strike thats better my husband is a scientist you said a physicist working for the government were at an army base out west where i cant tell you that she said then caught herself with a nervous laugh sorry force of habit new mexico its a secret base you see theyre very strict about that theyre making weapons what kind of weapons he said his voice lower bombs do you know anything about atomic fission no i dont suppose you do nobody does it doesnt matter the point i know what fission is there was talk before the war nothing since do you mean to say theyve actually gone ahead i thought it was supposed to be impossible no theyve done it at least they think they have theyre going to test it very soon thats why there isnt any time do you know what youre saying its fantastic yes funny you get so used to it you stop thinking about it that way but its real twenty thousand tons of tnt jesus connolly had told her ten he wondered if she had simply forgotten or had begun to be swept up in her own story why not twenty its capable of wiping out a whole city she said berlin even berlins gone tokyo then theyll use it somewhere and theres something newits not just the explosive power they can reckon that but no one knows about the radiation effects theyre going to use it on people and they dont even know yet what it will do and theres no point now slow down no let me finish as long as its secret they will use it unless someone makes a stink the scientists canttheyre terrified but if we dont get the word out somehow itll be too late they mustnt you see were talking about thousands and thousands of lives and theyve already won someones got to stop them her voice slowed anyway i thought of you me i dont understand do you want me to put this in the paper no of course not theyd arrest you its a military secretno papers going to be allowed to print it otherwise the scientists would just leak it what then we need to get the information out of the country out of the country he repeated slowly to the russians they dont know thats not possible yes it is there isnt a single russian on the project brits galore even germans but not one russian i know i live there think what that means what do you think it means i think theyd make one unholy fuss if they found outmaybe enough to stop all this before its too late theyre the only ones who could now he was quiet for a minute do you know what youre saying yes i know its an awful chance but someone has to take it you for instance he said skeptically joan of arc no not me im just a messenger someone on the project your husband no someone else imim seeing someone else you neednt look that way im all grown up remember were you all grown up in berlin too he said ive often wondered no were you look dont lets start its a little late in the day for that will you help you cant be serious do you think im a spy do you think i am he paused i dont know what to think its all so extraordinary you coming here like this bloody thirtynine steps whats it to do with you anyway i told you im a messenger i want to help him it wouldnt be the first time would it surely you remember that that was different i never asked you to do anything like this anyway why you because i know you i couldnt think of anyone else do you think if i had id have come to you youre the last person id ask for help but as it happens you are the last person im not exactly on speakers with the other comrades theyd never believe me but i would i thought you might she said softly maybe i was wrong still it doesnt matter you dont have to believe me i have some papers here she said connolly heard her take out the envelope let someone else decide you are serious what is it scientific information about the project a part of it people only know parts but steven has more give them to somebody wholl know what they mean i wouldnt have the faintest and neither would you so dont even bother but theyll know and theyll know hes real he just wants to talk to somebody thats all while theres time what makes you think i can do this you know peopleyou were always good at that look matthew i never said you were a spy whatever that means maybe you arei dont care so much the better all the comrades are a little bit arent they they all like a bit of intrigue between meetings anyway you dont have to spy on anybody just pass it on and theres an end to it nothing to do with you nothing to do with me let the comrades decide you havent changed you always hated them i hated what they did to you and now you want to help them maybe i dont care what they do to you anymore in the silence connolly could hear a coffee spoon clank against the cup dont quarrel he wanted to shout not yet you havent got him yet i never meant to hurt you he said if i said i believed you would it make any difference he sighed youve become hard emma well for christs sake a voice boomed next to connolly i thought you were in washington how the hell are you anyway connolly looked up startled and annoyed palming the earpiece and lowering his hand not now jerry he said why didnt you tell me you were back been over to the paper yet im not back just for the day but jerry taking a seat wasnt listening oswalds gone you know keeled over right in the city room broad daylight i almost felt sorry for the bastard but what the hell are you doing up here jerry im waiting for somebody he said nervously behind him he could hear them talking oh yeah what some skirt for christs sake connolly when are you going to grow up hey youre looking good though you know they promoted that fuck levine if youre smart youll stay in washington and on connolly watched his mouth open and close the eager sounds a blur of distraction from the low voices on the other side of the booth why didnt he go connolly didnt have to talk just nod from time to time but he couldnt hear the others either so he sat there in an anxious limbo trapped while emma carried on alone what if they were fighting picking at old scabs while the envelope sat there ignored still what could he have done in any case she had always been alone here was she even aware of him was she explaining the earnest corporal waters what were they saying but she didnt need him any more than jerry did come on jerry blow he said finally im waiting for somebody he smiled a kind of leer shes the nervous type all right all right jerry said getting up hey kens in the bar too come and say hello on the way out okay have one on me nah ive got to go he said looking at his watch looks to me like she stood you up he grinned not a chance connolly lit a cigarette waving to jerry at the door and tried to calm himself what if jerry had seen the wire made a scene he picked it up anyway and cradled it against his ear there is one condition emma was saying what was this they hadnt talked about this had he agreed then you know i wouldnt lift a finger for your friends theyre as bad as the rest theyre not but go on he said this she said referring to the envelope its not for them to keep not another secret theyve got to talk about it do you understand yes people have to know what it is otherwise theres no point steven isntpolitical they have to know that i wont have him tricked will you promise me that she asked an impossible request people do things for different reasons we respect that he said oddly formal on duty no you have to tell them its not some windfall for your bloody army he wont do that then why this he said fingering the envelope theres not enough there to make a bomb you know hes not completely bonkers just enough to go public thats all he wants its not for him heshes a good man unlike the rest of us no she said thoughtfully in some ways hes very like the way you used to be i was always a fool for the goodofhumanity line wasnt i i thought you meant it i did yes it was caring for one person that was difficult emma never mind we havent time im supposed to be shopping or something this is importantthousands of people not just two promise me youll explain about steven theyll want to know more if this is really what you say it is yes hes prepared for that but they have to know the why of it thats the bargain they dont like to bargain no ones ever given them something like this before youll see they wont believe their luck god knows they dont deserve it then why hand it to them well its a funny old world isnt it theyre all weve got anyway its not me im just the postman but promise me about steven no tricks connolly waited for his answer the sensible evasion the obvious impossibility of taking any kind of responsibility for what would happen yes i promise he said it was as easy and expedient as a vow and it was then that connolly knew shed wanted him to lie to her a personal proof thats that then she said id better go do put that away now will you not the sort of thing one leaves lying about i cant tell you the relief getting rid of it emma he said is it true all this why she said disarming him dont you think id have the guts i dont know what youd do anymore youre different no still marvelous she said her voice bitter but i tell you what if you have second thoughts just chuck it in the bin and no ones the wiser but id have someone give it a look i really would who knows there might be a promotion in it for you just keep my name out of the thankyou speech come to think of it you dont know my name now do you maybe thats best you never used to be like this he said not really answering her how do i contact you you dont im finished with it now stevens address is inside a box number they read the post by the way so tell whoever it is to be carefulwell that sounds silly doesnt it of course they would just tell them to give him a time and a place and hell know somewhere in santa fehes not allowed to travel if he doesnt hear well then hell assume the comrades arent interested and well have to think of something else emma he said his voice low in berlin when ii was under orders i dont want to hear it no dont go you have to know what happened when i left i couldnt tell you i couldnt tell anybody they said lives might depend on it lives did she said sharply connolly heard her get up flustered he turned and looked up to see her standing there her padded shoulders pulled back rigid with anger he wanted to signal her but her eyes were fixed on matthew oblivious to the room around them i dont mean ours lawson was saying we were just kids the othersthey had a list the whole network i had to disappear i couldnt tell anybody they ordered me not to do you understand it was important there were people involved it wasnt my decision wasnt it no do you think id run away just like that they had something for me to do i couldnt say no its the disciplineevery link i had to do what they told me then after why are you telling me this she said her voice cold connolly had dropped the wire and was staring at her i dont want you to thinki couldnt help it do you see do you want me to forgive you what a bastard you are i just wanted you to know what happened he said hesitant now under her glare thats not all that happened in berlin matthew she said her voice so low and intense that the noise of the room seemed to step away from it afraid you left a child i cut it out connolly stared helpless as her eyes filled with tears she leaned in i saw it in a pan like a blood clot but they cut out all my children didnt mean to but they did you think im hard im barren matthew thats what happened in berlin here she said picking up the envelope and throwing it at his chest go save the world save it for your children for a minute no one moved then emma picked up her bag and walked quickly out of the restaurant her shoes clacking hard on the wood floor connolly watched her go expecting lawson to follow her but there wasnt a sound in the booth he waited another minute catching his own breath then got up to go when he looked over the partition he saw lawson sitting his face as red as if it had been slapped staring at the brown envelope then suddenly he got up bumping into connolly for a split second connolly met his eyes wide and frantic sorry he said automatically but lawson was already running out of the room connolly followed through the noisy bar and pushed the door out into the hot air lawson was halfway down the block walking quickly he stopped and shouted somethingher name but it was lost in the roar of the overhead train at the corner he had to stop for a light and connolly could see emma across third already far along the side street her white dress darting in and out of the crowd they crossed together connolly hanging back a little waiting for him to sprint but there were too many people now and he couldnt break through instead he sidestepped them jumping into the street then back again trying to keep her in sight when she turned right on lexington he quickened his pace pushing against the crowd emma hadnt noticed any of it when she reached the hotel she went straight in not looking around lawson followed her to the door dodging a car against the light and then finally there stopped unexpectedly connolly turned at the window of a deli watching to his left lawson stood for a second rooted in indecision then took a step toward the entrance and stopped again a soldier and a girl came out of the hotel carrying suitcases lawson took a handkerchief to wipe his face then his whole body slumping in some final resignation turned and started walking slowly away when he passed connolly in the deli window he was looking at the sidewalk glum and confused as if he had just missed a train then connolly lost him in the crowd emma was sitting on the bed breathing deliberately to calm herself she glanced up when he came in then looked away again obviously not wanting to talk he touched her shoulder then went into the bathroom and started putting things in his dopp kit did you hear she said finally from the bedroom im afraid i muffed it no he said coming out it was fine perfect his voice went low emma im sorry i didnt know no you didnt she shrugged shaking the hair off her neck now what now we wait like a message in a bottle she stood up and went over to the window anyway its done now good luck to him you all right she nodded funny how voices dont change everything else but not voices it gave me quite a turn at first we respect that my god she lit a cigarette still looking out the window promise me something will you when this is over all this karl business no more all right you see what its done to him always some war to fight whether there is one or not hes stuck in the trenches for good now its a promise you can count on this one she turned smiling a little he couldnt help himself could he what are you doing she said noticing the dopp kit going somewhere i thought we might change hotels our last night change of scene she smiled you dont have to do that im all right really actually i think wed better he said he followed you followed me not like that i think he probably wanted to make up but he didnt come in she said quietly no he said closing the kit but he knows youre here which means theyll know im here too if anyones interested and they might be once they get a look at his mail we cant afford to take that chance she folded her arms holding herself you think hed have us watched it wouldnt be up to him she took that in i thought this was over almost its just a precaution still on the job she said putting out her cigarette right and here i thought you were being romantic i can still be that where now she said brightly do you think you could manage something a bit grander the waldorf he grinned no i was thinking of the pennsylvania its the one place were sure to be alone unless that mans still there he wont be anywhere but there he was there however after dinner a little tight they went to the cafe rouge to hear the music and it was emma who spotted him sitting not far from the band its him she said he must be off dutyhes checked his hat and picked up a girl connolly said what do you know i dont think hes seen us come on lets dance emma giggled as connolly maneuvered her toward the other table youre torturing him she said watching the man pretend not to recognize them the girl all bright lipstick was drinking a highball just a little hell be furious because we ruined his little night on the town i doubt hell want to go into that looks bad on the report she giggled again but what will he think that weve been here all along and he should have kept his mouth shut now hes going to have to explain it who do you think she is he grinned theres a question she leaned her head against his shoulder now hell be on the train paying very close attention this time just think of him as your personal bodyguard look hes getting up to dance i didnt think there was anybody in g who could do that stop hell see you laughing we shouldnt be doing this you know its not supposed to be funny why is it he doesnt think hes funny and hes going to write a report and its going to sit in a file until its useful to someone who isnt funny either and there wont be a thing in it about his pumping his way across a dance floor and trying to get some girl into bed thats the way it works not funny at all no how do you feel i dont know from one minute to the next today dont think about it i did something i never thought id do deliberately harm someone that depends on how you look at it im not even sure it was wrong how is that possible not to know whats wrong and i didnt mind i wanted it to work and now were laughing at that man and dancing as if nothing had happened what sort of person does that make me he looked at her i dont care like the rest of us i suppose everybody has his reasons even matthew i dont know the answer to that emma some are better than others maybe so maybe you can be wrong for the right reasons i dont know that one either were not going to solve it here you know lets take a little time out youre still all keyed up she smiled weakly at him the wine no doubt at least you didnt say that i have to sort it out sometime though she looked up at him studying his face what about you what were you thinking about today in the restaurant that i wasnt helping you at all but you did you made it easy his eyes asked a question i didnt know how i would feel and then it was easyi knew i could do it its easy when you dont love somebody anymore he was a fool to let you go we let each other go anyway hes gone pretty quick divorce by the way she smiled i couldnt resist i wanted to hear what hed say i must say he might have protested a little she said lightly anyway theres our answer free arent you pleased he looked at her hes not the one im worried about oppenheimers voice came through the halfopen door as angry as connolly had ever heard it you picked one hell of a time jeff he was saying his tone almost witheringly sharp its the right time a voice answered so young it seemed adolescent therell never be a better one connolly could see oppenheimer standing behind his desk holding a bulletin board notice the gadget and the future he read disdainfully and just what the hell do you expect to accomplish with this little town meeting where do you think we are palo alto we cant just ignore it oppie the young man said holding his ground there are issues the scientific community has a right to a voice in this while theres still time there isnt any time weve got people working twentyfour hours a day we dont have time for seminars on civilization and its discontents we should oppenheimer at any rate must be working around the clock connolly thought his frame always frail was now alarmingly thin the eyes set deeply in their sockets the bony fingers clutching the cigarette nearly skeletal his voice dry and scratchy seemed to cry out for rest but instead his body was in constant motion pacing edgily his arms jerking involuntarily to relieve the tension of being awake is leo behind this he said suddenly leo szilard in chicago you know very well what leo dont fence with me jeff i dont know what youre talking about oppie oppenheimer looked up suddenly embarrassed you dont sorry i thought he might be thats all hes circulating a petition no doubt youll want to sign it meanwhile id appreciate it if youd cancel this damnfool meeting why security wouldnt like it so what it upsets them this is a sensitive time jeff you know that as well as anyone lets not make it more complicated than it is oppie were talking about scientists getting together to discuss the implications of what were doing thats all i know what were talking about oppenheimer snapped taking a puff on his cigarette im talking about a test scheduled for today thats now two weeks late im counting hours kistys down at s site fixing the explosive lenses himself you know that in fact why arent you down there helping instead ofinstead of his voice sputtered caught by the look on the mans face what scheduled for today the glorious fourth what was the ideathe biggest fireworks ever dont be a jerk not precisely the fourth this week nobody thought about fireworks he stopped and smiled to himself in fact nobody did think about that odd anyway whats the difference we didnt make it oppie are you ordering me not to have this meeting the man said calmly oppenheimer lit a fresh cigarette from the end of the other his body visibly backing down no he said finally i wouldnt order you to do that you were the one who started the open meetings yes and to hell with the security bozos remember all right jeff if the men want it so what happened we havent had a meeting in quite a while oppenheimer looked at him his eyes flaring in anger again i got busy jeff im busy now in fact youre welcome to attend by the way in fact people would really like thatto hear what you have to say were not trying to hurt the project i know oppenheimer said gently connolly knocked on the open door speak of the devil oppenheimer said one of your security bozos in the flesh jeff a young scientist in hornrimmed glasses flushed i didnt hear anything connolly said breezily we dont listen at keyholes yet oppenheimer said quickly sunday jeff said turning to leave if you can make it oppenheimer watched him go then looked back mr connolly he said wearily pleasant trip what was that all about its beginning to dawn on them that the gadget has implications he said his voice still taut what hath god wrought i havent been called that yet no they think we might be in league with the other one implications where has everyone been the implications were there from the start now the handwringing the chicago lab wants to talk to the presidentthe president if you pleaseabout a demonstration for the japanese blow up some little island somewhere and the emperor and the rest of the samurai will fall to their knees begging for terms and no one gets hurt its an idea dont be a fool its already decided the answer quick as whiplash stung connolly as if he had been sent to the childrens table sometime during the technical crises and the drought regulations and the personal tantrums oppenheimer had been to washington and watched while someone drew a target circle around a city already decided you dont think it would work connolly said tentatively theyre fanatics oppenheimer said flatly if its a dud wed actually end up prolonging the war you dont believe thatthat its a dud i dont know nobody does right now all weve got are numbers on paper numbers on paper yes he said to his secretary whod appeared in the door general groves on the line for you connolly made a sign question do you want me to go but oppenheimer waved his hand dismissively and pointed to the chair one minute he mumbled and picked up the phone turning his body halfway to the left creating the privacy of an imaginary booth general yes thanks its the lens castingshairline cracks even a few bubbles i dont know what the hell they thought they were doing weve got accuracy to one thirtieth and we need one threehundredth just to be safe were going to need a few more days a burst of talk from the other end no its not just a snag oppenheimer said waspishly its a problem ive got kisty working on it now hes down there himself he might make it he might not another burst i dont think you understand hes working with dentist drills and tweezers and anything he can lay his hands on filling in the bubbles just to get one decent set of explosive lenses two more days his face already drawn seemed to grow even tighter as he listened to grovess reply a dressingdown connolly guessed or at least a frustrated sputtering i know weve moved it once already and then he didnt speak again staring out the window at the tech area as groves went on hed clearly not expected an argument or he wouldnt have asked connolly to stay and now he was stuck with an audience connolly stood up and walked over to study the photos on the wall with lawrence at the berkeley cyclotron a group shot of the tech area division heads eisler looked straight at the camera his eyes dreamy and benign finally oppenheimer was giving in well thats that then well do what we can no i understand its a riskyou should know that yes the sixteenth youll be here i assume and then he was putting down the receiver still looking out the window the president wants to tell the russians at the meeting in germany he said partly to himself but they already know they dont know that we know they know he said toying with it a word game for that matter what do they know only that were trying he wants to tell them weve done it at the meeting ready or not so well be ready why at the meeting oppenheimer shrugged to give him some height at the table i suppose but if they already know oppenheimer turned to face him the president doesnt know that remember nobody does you know it if you can prove it can you do that before they sit down at potsdam connolly said nothing oppenheimer smiled but theyre sitting down anyway so theres your deadline too its out of my hands at this point you know oppenheimer nodded mine too he turned to the papers on his desk and i still have a picnic to get to theyll want a speech what is it now a hundred and sixtynine years what do you do with a number like that we were supposed to be having the test today not eating watermelon and making speeches history will have to wait a little today we deal with cookouts that was the good generals thought for todayno cookouts the whole mesas dry as dust a spark would do it i suppose hes got visions of the whole project going up in flames because of one fourth of july hot dog i have to say the man thinks of everything one minute international conferences the next lemonade and egg salad so now weve got campfire patrol he looked up as if hed noticed connolly for the first time anyway what was it you wanted you wanted to see me oppenheimer looked puzzled for a moment then remembering frowned yes right he lit another cigarette about this trip thanks for the pullman oppenheimer frowned again i know this is none of my business you want a report i thought we agreed to keep you in the dark till we had something i dont mean that oppenheimer said quickly i thought this trip was work it was you didnt tell me you were taking a lady i hear youre quite a dancer youre right connolly said evenly its none of your business it is when youre carrying on with one of the scientists wives thats all we need right nowa jealous husband im surprised at you the trip was work she was part of it oppenheimer raised his eyebrows is that the truth yes are you trying to tell me theres nothing going on no connolly said meeting his stare i didnt say that i see oppenheimer put down the paper in his hand it wouldnt be the first time you know put people together and theres always a certain amount of interest generated you have to expect that you have to expect trouble too hes a good man ive met him and that didnt deter you in the slightest connolly paused no oppenheimer smiled at least youre honest i guess may i ask what shes got to do with all this if you ask ill tell you but id rather you didnt ask not yet oppenheimer put out his cigarette i used to know everything that went on here looks like i wasnt as well informed as i thought murder adultery a vipers nest it turns out cookouts youre forgetting espionage yes oppenheimer said looking at him how could i forget that he picked up the paper again now what do i do with this dereliction of duty misuse of government funds authorized travel for personal purposes sexualwhat do they call it he referred to the paper sexual indiscretions with project personnel indiscretions ignore it youre a busy man not half as busy as you it seems i cant ignore a security request they want you out of here theyre just blowing smoke ignore them they wont let up you know you take your friends in security too seriously connolly said thinking of the young scientist and his meeting my friends oppenheimer said you seem to think theyre a joke did you know they refused to give me a clearance until groves personally vouched for me me did you know they still investigate my old associates my family theyve put my brother through hell he saw the look in connollys eyes but you knew that he was a member of the party at stanford given that we both must be disloyal they keep my file activethey never close it so ive learned to be a little sensitive about our friends i try not to annoy them connolly got up the lady in question helped me make contact with someone i hope will lead to karls killer the money was mine she shared my hotel room but i was sleeping there anyway our friends in security think we were off on a toot and its just what i want them to think youre not buying any favors with them you know youll always scare them youre everything theyre not oppenheimer was quiet for a minute then smiled faintly a tic is that supposed to be a compliment a small one you want me to vouch for you then groves vouched for you you forget i have a certain amount of responsibility to keep this project secure so did groves oppenheimer paused so he did he said taking the paper and letting it flutter to the wastebasket now will you do something for me keep your indiscretions discreet will you this particular husband is too valuable right now to be worrying about his wife i dont think he knows hes at trinity most of the time oppenheimer started and then jotted something down thank you for reminding me i almost forgot about the cables cables coaxial cables the rats are chewing the wires at the site we have to patrol the whole damn desert floor now night and day miles of wire its got everybody jumpy he caught connollys look sorry what were we saying nothing i was going to be more discreet yes thats right oppenheimer paused be careful they usually do know who kitty was married when we met we thought her husband didnt know but he did connolly looked up at him surprised then let it go you ought to get some sleep he said everybody says that but nobody tells me how the whole mesa seemed on edge like some extension of oppenheimers nervous system connolly had come back west with a sense of reliefthe high dry air was the air he breathed nowbut the hill had changed it was curiously deserted with hundreds gone to the test site and the usual traffic at the gates slowed by travel restrictions los alamos was left to bake in the arid july air the grass had long since dried up the little patch gardens scraggly and cracked children out of school played ball in a swirl of dust mothers spread blankets over bare dirt for impromptu picnics or sat in the shade of the hutments and prefab houses fanning themselves without being told they knew something was about to happen lab windows were bright all night with so many gone the summer should have been quiet and lethargic instead it was anxious wide awake as if everyone were waiting for forest fires to break out connolly checked the mail went for walks wandered in and out of the tech area looking for something to do eislers books were sold to raise money for the school his personal effects doled out by johanna weber to friends in the emigre community connolly had asked her for a picturethe theoretical team on an outing in the jemez mountainsand surprised she had given it to him with sentimental tears in her eyes he placed it on the bureau next to the photograph of karl two pieces in the puzzle he saw emma at the movies but they stayed away from each other afraid to divert their attention from the waiting finally after a week claustrophobic in all the wide space of the mesa he drove into santa fe to see holliday id just about given up on you holliday said pleasantly coffee in this heat old indian trick just pay it no attention and after a while you dont know its there its there connolly said wiping his neck they sat out behind the office where a table had been set up in the shade of a giant cottonwood tree sorry i havent been around i just havent had anything to tell you that you can tell me you mean thats all right i figure its hill business now i dont ask looks like well all know pretty soon what makes you say that well not much traffic into town these days real quiet but you got these explosions going off in the canyons every night now folks dont even complain anymoreno point meantime you got every hotel room in town booked for next week that nice mrs mckibbens onto the boarding houses now so you must have a crowd coming in so i figure youre about to do whatever it is youre going to do up there connolly smiled at him youre a good cop thats not hard in a small town nothing happens until you came along anyway i guess youll be relieved when i go holliday sipped his coffee looking at him you might be here quite a spell one thing you learn in police work is how to wait now you you hate to wait youd make coffee nervous connolly smiled again so what do you do while youre waiting mostly you turn things over in your mind connolly looked at him with interest such as well such as that car anybody bother it yet no but now youve got all these explosions going off nearby youd think somebodyd want to move it wouldnt you why should he nobodys found it yet its been months true but its funny about that car easiest thing in the world to drive it somewhere else then get a bus or something back to the hill that way nobodyd connect it at all nobody has connected it as far as he knows its still hidden maybe but that was before they started blowing those canyons all to hell if it was me id move it so what are you thinking well the way it makes sense is if he isnt on the hill anymore no hes there youre sure he has to be has to be isnt evidence hes there connolly said firmly i know it holliday paused well if you know it course theres one other way it makes sense whats that well id move it but maybe hes not as smart as i am thats another thing you learn in police worktheyre not the brightest bunch of guys we just like to think so cause it makes us look good connolly smiled what else do you get when you turn things over not much the funny thing about this one is that weve got the when and the where and it sounds like youve got the why but youre not telling he looked at connolly who nodded well in my experience at least one of these ought to lead us to who but not this time we have to come at it a different way that why youve got my boys watching those churches connolly nodded it might be a waste of time well it wont do them any harm good way to get to know your own town you take meive never been to the governors palace pass it every day but never been inside but thats usually the way isnt it youre leading up to something no im just teaching you how to wait holliday said his eyes enjoying a private joke ive been thinking and thinking about it and damned if i can come up with anything course i dont know the why connolly placed his coffee on the table and looked away somebody was passing military secrets and karl surprised them at the drop at san isidro but you didnt hear that okay holliday looked at him closely then nodded well i figured that much hows that everything top secret and mps walking around the place and people dropping in from washington what the hell else could it be still he said smiling its nice to know i appreciate that connolly didnt say anything and now youre arranging another drop holliday said quietly connolly got up and paced toward the tree ignoring him when did you figure all this out dont get excited not for a long time see he had me going there with that queer business you look at that youve got no reason to look at anything else smart but theres another thing howd he come up with that it was in the papers yeah but its smart i mean if hes too dumb to move the car how come hes smart enough to think up something like that connolly looked at him i dont know how is he well maybe its on his mind like you mean hes a homosexual after all doc weve been down that road and it didnt get us anywhere whats the difference now anyway maybe he just thinks about them there has to be some way to get to the who a trail somewhere everything counts in a murder i mean he thought of it now why is that i dont know doc maybe youd better turn it over some more ill tell you this though we got the guy who was passing the secrets holliday looked at him in surprise and neither of them liked guys not him not karl it was a blind huh holliday said a grunt of acknowledgment he sat for a minute thinking what about the one you caught hes dead holliday took another sip of coffee with an almost studied casualness you kill him no so hes not the one setting up the meeting no holliday mulled this over for a minute then stood up well i dont know im in over my head now maybe someday youll let me know how this works i may never be able to do that doc connolly said seriously you understand that holliday nodded then grinned you may never catch him either sometimes it happens that way even when you wait you understand that then my secrets safe with you it wasnt until the next day that for no specific reason hollidays conversation made connolly think of corporal batchelor he transferred out mills said hes up at oak ridge why i just wanted to see how he was doing can we get him on the phone are you kidding you cant call somebody at oak ridge just to pass the time of day family emergency maybe otherwise you write lets get him anyway whats going on ive never seen you so jumpy just call him mills picked up the phone with a shrug youre the boss it might take some time though amazingly it took a day and when connolly finally heard batchelors voice wary and apprehensive he felt foolish for having gone to the trouble it wasnt a loose end just a stray thought the man who beat you up he said who was it there was no response you still there i dont know batchelor said so quietly that connolly thought it was the connection look this is strictly confidential off the record i mean if youre worried about that no i really dont know but someone on the hill i dont know he repeated maybe a visitor id never seen him before a scientist no connolly frowned can you describe him dark mexican you mean i dont know maybe spanish how do you know did you talk to him i just thought he looked spanish is all he had black eyes connolly stopped feeling embarrassed would you recognize him again batchelor hesitated is this an official call no unofficial would you i dont want you to look for him nothing happened im not looking for him i was just curious why why indeed im not sure i dont want to talk about this anymore im sorry nothing happened okay connolly said i understand but youd recognize him batchelor hesitated yes he said finally if i had to connolly stared at the receiver when theyd finished wishing he hadnt called now batchelor would worry about what hed moved a thousand miles away to forget what are you up to mills said interrupting the thought nothing chasing my own tail cant we get this damn fan to work he said irritably crazy with the heat huh no stir crazy waiting for something connolly shot him a glance then looked away no here mills said holding out an envelope post office said to give this to you whos corporal waters connolly reached up for the letter meeting millss eyes as his hand touched it for an instant he stopped breathing friend of yours mills said he held the letter suspended between them one of my aliases connolly said taking it for filthy pictures millss eyes dropped in disappointment oh he said excluded sorry i asked connolly stared at the envelope in front of him typed no return address santa fe postmark now that it was finally here he couldnt quite believe it why a letter absurdly he realized that he had been expecting the guidebook page turned down at the corner mills mistaking his hesitation for secrecy moved away from the desk connolly fingered the envelope not heavy no more than a page no a single rectangle like a postcard he slit open the envelope an invitation a gallery opening on canyon road sunday from four to seven refreshments served two days from now connolly turned it over looking for a message something scrawled on the print a public reception not a private meeting at san isidro but what had he been expecting a conversation in the alley had there been a pattern to the other meetings he thought of hollidays men loitering at churches all over santa fe he looked up to see mills standing by the desk are you going to tell me he said simply his eyes frank and direct connolly slipped the card back into the envelope i cant in fact there was no one to tell except emma he walked her back from the px carrying grocery bags you said it would work she said whats the matter now they dont trust it why a party therell be people they just want to see who you are see if youre real how will they know youll be the one with me he looked at her dont even think about it he said i have to do this one alone he stopped her before she could interrupt he wont know you anyway theyd never tell the field contact about you if anything goes wrong the chain has to stop with him they cant afford to have this traced back if they believe it they must why would they send the invitation its worth the chance if its a trap they sacrifice the one guy in the field thats all then it really doesnt matter whether im there or not it does to me we dont know what might happen besides theyll be looking for a man alone for a uniform you mean corporal waters he stopped and looked at her a uniform if i told you id completely forgotten about that would you think id lost my mind she grinned at him i was never interested in your mind see how useful i can be but i dont want to have to worry about you he said seriously dont then well arrive separately ill just be a fly on the wall in case you need me i dont want to have to worry about you he decided not to argue the point now what sort of crowd is it likely to be the local gentry hats and things and the artsandcrafts crowd a few ladies in sandals and woven skirts loomers i call them soldiers enlisted men you must be joking dont worry hell spot you straightaway but i wont know who he is well thats rather the point isnt it mills said nothing that evening when he surprised connolly at the office trying on the uniform borrowed from one of the drivers the fit was baggy as if connolly had lost weight mills looked him over then without a word went to a locked drawer fishing a key out of his pocket embarrassed connolly turned and started to change back into his clothes so he was in his shorts when mills handed him the gun and the cartridge of bullets youd better have these he said connolly looked at the gun not knowing what to say i never think to look in that drawer mills said id no idea they were gone you dont have to do this im not hes already killed one man mills said simply im on your side you know i always have been later he remembered the day as overbright every piece of landscape sharp and hardedged under the white sun emma pretty in a pale blue dress that seemed part of the cloudless sky drove him in her car past the empty east gate and down the switchback road to the valley floor with the windows down the air smelled of juniper the afternoon had been still and expectant and even now toward its end santa fe seemed asleep connolly fidgeted in the unfamiliar uniform shifting the gun in his pocket to arrange its outline in a shapeless bulge his cap folded hung over his belt like a protective flap its not going to go away you know emma said can you see it only when i look shall i keep it in my bag then i would have something to worry about actually im a crack shot i grew up in the country you know crack shot with what he said skeptically well skeet she admitted you dont really think youll need it do you no should i leave it here its more trouble than its worth just keep your hand in your pocket you know playing with change playing with change well men do they were driving along the alameda approaching the castillo street bridge at the foot of canyon road ill walk from here he said at the corner two blocks she said goodness look at the crush the street was lined with cars some doubleparked near the gallery entrance it seemed the only party in town her voice cool and efficient cracked when he reached to open the door michael her eyes were suddenly bright with panic youll be careful nervous i am actually funny after all this i know this time its real it doesnt feel real she straightened her shoulders dont worry i wont let you down he smiled at her you couldnt anyway maybe its just an audition maybe nothing will happen she looked at him her eyes scanning his face that would be worse wouldnt it he nodded okay lets go act naturally look at the pictures and not at you i know ive got holliday outside just in case she looked up at him quizzically unfamiliar with the name the police oh she said is that supposed to make me feel better take your time parking he said moving away holliday out of uniform sat in a car in the next block connolly stopped to light a cigarette and when he spoke it appeared he was fiddling with his lighter everything all right couldve made a fortune in parking tickets here whats wrong with these people anyway no cops whats that in your pocket my wallet connolly said looking at him i like it in front you cant be too careful in a crowd holliday sighed just watch your back spot anybody hanging around not yet just you connolly grinned and continued walking glancing at both sides of the street the gallery doors were open and people had spilled onto the side courtyard talking in small groups their voices like the murmur of bees inside the noise was louder mixed with the tinkling of coffee spoons and ice cubes a long table had been set up in the front room with a coffee urn and plates filled with sugary sopapillas at the other end were bottles of wine and cheese cut into cocktail cubes the crowd was as emma had predicted the women in floppy hats and long skirts cinched with silverturquoise belts the men in suits with bolla ties connolly noticed with a little relief that there were a few other uniforms all officers presumably local friends unconnected with the hill he made his way slowly through the crowd feeling obvious and selfconscious but no one seemed to notice him busy with their friends or the paintings they assumed he belonged to someone else and after a while he began to feel the invisible anonymity of a large party as if he werent really there at all there were fewer people in the two rooms that led from the main room in a circle around the patio and he wandered through these looking at paintings aware that hed be more easily seen cowboys pueblo landscapes pricklypear cactus in flower no one approached him he circled back to the main room and took a glass of wine looking around suppose no one came or someone had already seen him and decided not to risk contact maybe thered be another message a proper one this time with a guidebook and a quiet place out of the corner of his eye he saw emma come in he stepped back into the second room between the paintings were pedestals with sculptures and wide terracotta pots painted in geometric indian designs there was a painting of the park by the alameda the river visible behind the trees and connolly stood in front of it as if hed found the prearranged meeting place there were the bushes where theyd found karl he peered at the lower righthand corner for the artists name lothrop in tiny block letters hello a voice said the gentleman with the turquoise isnt it he turned slowly prolonging the moment for a second he couldnt place him then he recognized the man from the jewelry shop chalmers something like that sonny behind the wire glasses his eyes were bright hello connolly said the man seemed slighter outside the shop connolly tried to imagine him with his arm raised holding a crowbar no it didnt seem possible unless the eyes had been furious the body coiled in surprise i thought it was you i didnt realize you were in the service chalmers said pleasantly do you like the pictures he glanced toward the wall to see what connolly had been looking at ah yes the park he turned to face him i often wondered did you find what you were looking for the question floated as casually as an inquiry about the weather connolly met his eyes yes i did good chalmers said good what happened to the turquoise pieces i still have them perhaps youre interested in selling them so this was how it was donethe new meeting a chat back at the store maybe i dont think i ever introduced myself my name is steven waters a pleasure chalmers said easily nodding just a name are youhe hesitatedwith somebody connolly caught offguard had the unexpected feeling that chalmers might be making a pass or was he just making sure connolly had come alone no he said why do you ask chalmers fluttered embarrassed forgive me i thought i knew everyone here thats all its my gallery you see youre very welcome i am supposed to be meeting someone here connolly said another try yes i see well i hope you enjoy the pictures if you do wish to sell the turquoise come and see me at the shop any particular time chalmers looked at him puzzled whenever its convenient for you connolly watched him move away turning to another group of guests like a concerned host but was he anything more connolly walked out to the patio to have a cigarette feeling oddly deflated had they made contact or not is that all that happened the suggestion of another time and place after all the waiting the anxious drive down did he turn now and go or had he imagined it all perhaps the man was simply checking his guest list or looking for a new friend the fact was connolly didnt want it to be chalmers so unprepossessing and ordinary that he seemed hardly worth the long search but why not him a drive to the church a quick meeting a meeting afterward with someone else and it was done no fog and trenchcoats just business as usual but what had chalmers really meant he went over the conversation in his mind was it possiblealmost a comic thoughtthat the language of espionage was no different from that of a pickup all the words that meant something else verbal sex the invitation not really offered until it was accepted he looked around all over the room people were making contact he put his hand in his pocket feeling the gun the late afternoon sun flooded the patio in broad daylight he thought maybe this was how it was done a nice middleaged man a harmless exchange that might mean anything but there had been nothing casual about the meeting at san isidro except theyd already known eisler this was just a sighting connolly tried to imagine himself as the other man what would he be looking for an amateur a soldier nervous looking around someone new to it who needed to be approached with more than the vague promise of the jewelry shop but carefully connolly realized then that if it was going to happen he was already being watched he went into the gallery rooms moving toward the refreshments then back again staring openly at people now a soldier looking for someone he caught chalmers glancing furtively at him but with no more purpose than a proprietor keeping an eye on the stock emma avoided him talking to a man in a doublebreasted suit who was probably asking her too whether she was with somebody a woman jarred his elbow brushing past toward the cheese so where was he hadnt he made himself visible enough he moved into the interior room empty now as people finished with the paintings clustered on the patio with drinks he walked slowly pretending to study the pictures on the wall the cathedral in the snow a soyer imitation of the bar at la fonda a heavy metal statue of a riderwhere had they got the scrap his horse reared back hooves sticking up a giant cob of corn do you like it a womans voice throaty he turned around the bobbed hair the eager eyes hannah he said she looked up at him startled for a minute then said oh its you emmas friend forgive me i didnt recognize her voice wavered still puzzled but have you joined the army hannah he felt the hair on the back of his neck she had approached a soldier he stared at her frozen as still as the moment on the trail at chaco hannah not a man just for the day he said but only he had made the leap i dont understand she said disconcerted by his stare then quickly catching herself but where is emma shes not here he said i was looking for you hannah eisler had been billeted at the ranch me she said a nervous laugh uncertain but i didnt know i was coming myself its so difficult to travel now back and forth to los angeles there would be people there the next link no need to risk another meeting in santa fe but you sent me an invitation no she said im sorry youre mistaken it must have been the gallery of course if i had known she looked away from him turning her head as if she wanted to be rescued from the conversation but there she is emma she said loudly calling her over but connolly had glanced up and caught her eye he shook his head stopping her at the door hannah turned back to him bewildered i thought you said she doesnt know connolly said evenly ive brought you a message from corporal waters did her eyes widen or was it his imagination and who is that me she looked at him for a moment in disbelief not saying anything is that your name she said finally polite im sorry i forgot there must be some mistake no the invitation was for me her eyes shrewd and cautious darted across his face trying to see behind the words then she closed herself off and looked away you are mistaken she said so simply that for an instant he wondered if he was wrong everything was supposed to fit everything counts in murder how could it be her another european story she had turned her head searching for something and he followed her look out onto the patio to the tall mexican in a denim jacket leaning against the adobe wall her right hand ajax a classical name no hector the constant companion as if he were taking snapshots connolly looked from the patio to hannah then again to the mexican his mind back at the blackboard connect everything the workboots hectors job on the hill of course hed be with her just in case strong enough to carry a man strong enough to kill one two people one to drive the car back a wrench some tool had she watched had she turned away like eisler or had she watched eisler was meeting her the person off the hill but hector had to return he worked there now the car the back gate when he turned back to hannah he saw that she had been following his eyes watching him fill in his crossword theres no mistake he said eislers dead he talked to me before he died i know and then he did know it was in her eyes one look one unguarded point of recognition who are you she said softly he didnt answer i know she said what does that mean i know what information eisler gave you all of it every detail i know about the meeting at san isidro i know what happened to karl for a second her face held a question and he realized she had never known karls name the man you killed there you and your friend she looked at him closely then shook her head phantastische she said poor friedrich a delirium why would he say such things but its often like that at the end the fantasies the paranoia and you believed him all this nonsense in his sleep he was wide awake connolly said flatly i interrogated him ah she said her voice wry with scorn so now we have the gestapo too like the movies the rubber hose the castor oil some drug is that how he died no he killed himself she looked up at him interested why remorse i think remorse not about you he was loyal to the end eisler a good party man but karlthat was something else i dont think hed ever seen a man killed before that shook him i guess he didnt know your lover was the hotblooded type my lover she said her voice cold with contempt and connolly thought of that day at the ranch something had happened between them not a lovers quarrel no shed been angry with him for putting them at risk maybe he just didnt know his own strength connolly said enough foolishness she turned slightly to go dont he said his voice hard she froze looking up at him thats right you dont want to make a scene not here not in front of the customers well go somewhere else then we can talk some more you must be crazy you come up to me here in this place with thesewhat accusations the rantings of a dead man i know i know you dont know anything leave me alone i have a gun he said quietly she stopped now the melodrama too its over hannah there was a witness at san isidro he said hes identified your friend and you she looked at him again assessing its a lie is it then why wait so long all this she spread her hand toward the room we wanted to see if theyd send someone else but they didnt did they your friends what if its a trap send hannah shes expendable now that eislers dead theyre closing you down too he had touched some anger you fool she said glaring at him do you think that matters therell be someone else always thats why we win yes we she said catching his look who do you think won this war the baby gis with their hershey bars we won it communists such a dirty word to you but we knew we stopped them you think politics is about elections nobodies so one more one less what difference then well start with you she tossed back her head yes start with me take your time you think you have so much time idiot she said in german its already too late what did you think we could sit by and watch you do this and not protect ourselves childrenyoure all children here do you think we would give a gun to a child do you think wed give one to a gangster she paused a flicker of a smile on her face no he would have to take it while the child was playing perhaps for his own good yes for everybodys good but very carefully so he wouldnt know we had to be very careful connolly paused and yet here you are for exactly one more minute then we are going to smileits very pleasant the gallery yes and people will say you see not so serious they must have been talking about the art you think you know something where is your proof friedrich i was always very careful with friedrich when they put him at the ranch i thought it was a trapi wouldnt even look at him and he thought i had arranged it so clever but you know there is luck in america not like germany everything is lucky here they thought hed feel at home speaking german but we never did all that time we were too afraid to talk we couldnt believe our luck you see but afterward that was more difficult so i had to be careful no paper no strings nothing nothing to connect us at all now what do you want to do arrest me with your gun over nothing at all i dont think so who would believe such a thing do you really think youre just going to walk out of here no i have to say goodbye to some people first she said coolly but thenits getting late you can follow me of course but what will you find friedrichs gone so there is no corporal waters then my workwell thats over you see i dont even have to be careful anymore unless you have something else to tell me then smoothly she began to turn away and connolly in an instant of panic looked around the roomemma still lurking by the doorway the kitschy art people laughing outsideand felt everything slip away without thinking he grabbed her arm jerking her back toward him its not about eisler its about karl youre not listening i dont have to prove a thing about your work im arresting you for murder let me go that wasnt careful killing karl let me go she said pulling her arm away but connolly held it what do you think youre doing on whose authority whose authority her voice louder now in the empty room caused a few people out on the patio to look up the police are outside on their authority you can say your goodbyes later her face gone white now twisted itself in a cold rage take your hands off me she said so selfpossessed that connolly obeyed the order and dropped her arm madman i never killed anybody yes you did technically you might get away with being an accessory he said i dont think so either way youll be gone for years and years ill see to it you she said almost spitting the word whats the problem a deep voice hector looming next to them come hannah said another order connolly looked up at him feeling suddenly dwarfed black eyes hannah says you killed karl all by yourself he said improvising again the question mark no one had known karls name the man in the alley at san isidro you shouldnt have done that hector hector glanced at her then stared at connolly stunned he seemed to lean back as if he had been struck dont listen to him hes crazy hannah said all by yourself we thought she helped but she said no you did everything hectors confusion made him jumpy connolly could see the tension creep into the broad impassive face the eyes as alert as an animals you should have thrown away those boots connolly said pointing at his feet we matched the prints a lie but would hector know just like a fingerprint all over the bushes when you pulled his pants down now the eyes no longer confused took on a shine of menace come hannah said foolishness you werent trying to kill him i know just knock him out the way you do as he said it another blackboard leap someone else looking up at the tall glowering man black eyes flashing like batchelor the soldier at the px you werent trying to kill him just teach him a lesson right shut up hector said his voice a low rumble you didnt kill him just roughed him up a little i cant blame you so whyd you kill karl we thought she told you to he nodded his head toward hannah but she says she wasnt there hector turned and looked at her obviously surprised dont say anything she said coldly we know you killed him connolly said quickly we didnt know you did it alone see the way we saw it you knocked him outhes just out messed up but she said you had to kill him you had to finish it did you even know who he was did she tell you eisler said you didnt know shut up hector said again louder now it was smart making it look like the murder in albuquerque to tell you the truth we thought that was her idea too hector come she said a pet command and took his arm to lead him away connolly glanced from one to the other feeling he had to do something say anything to hold him but that was you see i didnt put two and two together until you beat up the guy at the px i didnt realize you were queer too the fist exploding came up and smashed into connollys face he staggered back against the wall blood spurting out of his nose in a rush ill fuckin kill you hector said moving toward connolly and chopping his fist down against the side of connollys neck forcing him to drop to his knees stunned he heard a woman scream in the other room saw in a hazy flash of peripheral vision people turning on the patio to see what was going on connolly leaned forward for a second catching himself afraid he would black out hector no hannah shouted shut the fuck up he said pushing her aside heading for connolly but it gave connolly the second he needed he brought the gun out of his pocket and held it up before him with two hands he saw that they were shaking one of them smeared bright with blood stop he said the word garbled by the blood in his mouth more screams footsteps hector looked down at him hesitating for a split second then sneering brought up his foot and kicked from the side knocking the gun out of connollys hands it slithered across the polished wood floor toward the corner and connolly lost sight of it as the workboot came up again kicking him he fell over his face hitting the floor with another crack stop it emmas voice dimly connolly saw her pounding hectors back his face raging hector turned away from connolly and flung her aside as if her fists were nothing more than wasp stings she fell against the pedestal the scrapmetal cowboy crashing to the floor beside her connolly tried to stand but hectors foot caught him in the stomach and when he fell this time he put his hands around his head curling his body into itself to protect it from the blows stop it he heard emma scream again then there was another kick to his chest he groaned hector kicked him again a machine now uncontrollable connolly realized that if he didnt move he was going to die bludgeoned to death like karl then in some bizarre transference he turned to look up and saw not hector but emma her hand held high in the air swinging the metal down toward him just the way it must have happened at san isidro when he turned his head slightly to protect his eyes he heard the statue connect a crack a thud into flesh and heard hector grunt rearing his head back so that the force of the smash was strengthened and the horses hooves pushed into his scalp there was an explosion of blood from hectors head spattering in a circle around them an oil well of blood before he fell over partially covering connolly his body twitching in one long drawnout spasm connolly heard the statue fall to the side now there were lots of voices screams of surprise and he knew it was almost over he looked along the floor to the gun in the corner but it was gone raising his head to see better he felt the nausea that he knew meant he would black out he stretched his fingers to grasp the statue and drew it toward him by the hooves so that when the crowd finally arrived it was clutched in his hand and with his breath crushed by the weight of the body on top of him and his face sticky with blood he did pass out he couldnt have been out more than a minute he felt hectors body being lifted off him then hands hooked under his arms pulling him to his feet holding him from behind jesus christ someone said and connolly looked at hector too his head still oozing blood connolly weaved dizzy trying to draw breath through the dull pain in his chest for a moment nobody moved and connolly saw the drops of blood on the painting next to him the end of the arc one of the guests was leaning over hectors body turning it so that his face absolutely still stared up at them his legs twisted hadnt moved with the rest of him connolly tried to move toward him but someone still held his arms restraining him somebody get an ambulance the man kneeling over hector said feeling the side of his neck for a pulse connolly saw holliday run into the room people moving aside in a wave to let him through he stopped in front of the body taking in the sceneconnolly with his arms pinned the statue still dangling from one of his hands the giant body lying on the floor blood spreading out from the head in a small lake let him go he said to the man behind connolly and connolly his arms suddenly free slumped against the wall he watched holliday bend over and examine the pupils then close the lids of the mexicans eyes oh my god someone in the crowd said call my office holliday said to the man next to him get some of the boys over here quick then turning to connolly you all right connolly still breathing heavily nodded feeling another wave of nausea as he moved his head this the guy holliday said simply connolly nodded again the nausea was gone now and he took a handkerchief from his back pocket to stanch the blood in his nose broken holliday said connolly nodded anything else maybe a rib i dont know hes lucky to be alive a woman said he was kicking him kicking him it was awful everyone seemed to be talking holliday turned toward the guests you folks want to give me a little room here his voice easy and unhurried stopped them how about all of you wait outside till the boys get here but dont anybody run away now well need to make a report he said slipping into his smalltown police manner i saw everything the woman said beginning to cry it was awful awful someone took her arm to lead her away the room began to empty some people craning their necks to get a last look holliday looked at the body then up at connolly hes dead he said simply you kill him connolly nodded well thats a hell of a thing he come after you it was him he killed bruner an ambulance siren wailed outside rising over the voices on the patio who was the woman with him holliday said calmly hannah his boss but where was she connolly looked around the empty room suddenly panicked wheres emma he said but holliday didnt know what he was talking about doc come on he moved away from the wall but holliday stood up blocking him take it easy i dont want two bodies on my report im all right well we got a killing here doc shes got the gun who hannah he said impatiently the other one ill explain it later shes got the gun holliday stared at him as the ambulance crew rushed into the room carrying a stretcher connolly could see police uniforms moving through the crowd on the patio doc now he said shell kill her holliday looked at him for another minute deciding the ambulance crew swarmed around them then he said ill drive on the patio people moved away as connolly approached afraid to make contact with the violence ask them he said to holliday somebody must have seen them leave holliday glanced at him and turned to a group standing next to one of his men already reporting details of the fight but it was chalmers finally who came forward hypnotized by the blood on connollys face a black chevy yes emmas car heading down toward the bridge not the cerrillos road to albuquerque the bridge he thought theyd been too frightened to stay two of them yes he hoped it wasnt wrong their leaving the scene connolly grabbed holliday moving him toward the street so that a few people puzzled thought that it was the chief who was being taken into custody theyre going to her ranch connolly said getting in the car up past tesuque but when they reached the alameda one of hollidays men on traffic duty had seen the car going west hell of a way to get to tesuque holliday said the hill connolly said now why would they do that i dont know just in case holliday ordered the traffic cop to check the road to albuquerque then turned sharply onto the alameda wrenching the gearshift hard so that the car shuddered as they shot forward connolly was wiping his face the handkerchief stiff now with dried blood hows your rib it hurts maybe just a bruise you ought to get that taped you could puncture a lung then they were out of town rounding one of the low hills to an open stretch of yucca and gray mesquite cant you go any faster connolly said still anxious if theyre going that fast somebodys likely to pick them up save us the trouble she wouldnt be thinking that clearly she just wants to get away she capable of killing her yes connolly said grimly then we better not let her see us first rule of pursuitthe minute they see you theyll go that much faster that doesnt mean you have to slow down well that looks to be them up ahead in the distance connolly saw the dark speck of a car heading toward the jemez foothills how long have you known he said looking at holliday few miles you ought to calm downyoud see more course when you do this for a living you get a feeling for it now look at that he said as emmas car took a curve wide not a very good driver is she no someone special to you yes funny thing someone back there thought it was a woman hit him no me the statue was on the floor i grabbed it just in time he was on the floor was he bent over he was leaning over to pop me holliday was quiet for a minute it could have happened that way i guess it did connolly said looking at him i dont think anybody couldve seen it clearly he was blocking the way and of course it all happened so fast thats right whatd you say to him got him so excited i told him we had proof he killed bruner holliday paused that would do it the road was climbing now out of the rio grande valley and it was more difficult to keep the car in sight sure does look like theyre heading for the hill dont lose her but a huge cattle truck lumbering off a secondary road swung onto the highway to block their view pass him connolly said now just where in hell do you expect me to do that they crept up behind the truck close enough to see the cattle watching them through the slats the truck ground upward slowing at each incline spewing clouds of diesel exhaust connolly leaned over to beep the horn but there was nowhere for the truck to go the narrow shoulders rimmed the side of the hill there was an agony of waiting as the truck made its way up the high grades of highway trapping hollidays car and another behind it finally a few miles before the turnoff for frijoles canyon the truck slowed nearly to a stop and turned onto a dirt road that dropped precipitously to some canyon where lonely grazing land was waiting holliday in a hurry now lurched forward spinning around a curve so tightly that connolly was thrown against the door pine trees passed in a blur connolly craned his neck hoping to see the car around each turn but they still hadnt spotted it by the time they reached the turnoff for the west gate improbably a sign posted in the middle of the road announced that it was closed well what the hell holliday said they put it there so nobody would follow just drive in even as he said it he remembered the extra security sealing the hill before the test but where else would they go holliday drove around the sign and sped down the gate road the same georgia cracker was on duty at the sentry post he came out carrying a rifle clearly upset to see the car cant you fucking read he said his twang turned mean this roads closed black chevy come through here connolly said aint nobody come through here roads closed cant you read he took up the rifle holliday flashed his badge out the car window put your dick back in your pants he said now that car come through here or not two ladies no sir the soldier said sullenly holliday turned to connolly now what theyd been on highway hed seen them had they slipped into one of the canyons frijoles those were traps natures dead ends it had to be the hill but they didnt know the gate road would be closed theyd have no choice but to continue on maybe she had even planned it that way anybody trailing them would come here following the wrong scent theyre still on connolly said they could have turned off they could be anywhere shes not hiding shes running all the way to the pacific he thought come on just a little farther they saw nothing for miles they drove by the green valley of the caldera connolly thinking of that other drive to chaco when everything had changed if youre wrong were just going farther and farther in the wrong direction holliday said this roads a bitch they were driving into the sun and at this speed the curves and hills came at them like an obstacle course there was no other trafficsunday shes heading for connolly said why else would they come this way if they did and then minutes later coming down from the caldera the views began to open up and they saw the car below them moving through the landscape like a figure in a childs picture book get closer connolly said why he imagined the chevy for a minute on a canyon road a short detour one shot how long would hannah feel she needed her i want to see if theyre both still there holliday glanced at him then nodded quickly youre the boss the car already going fast speeded up taking one dip in the road so quickly that for a moment they felt suspended when their stomachs followed them down connolly groaned open the glove compartment holliday said connolly leaned over and pushed the button the door of the compartment flapped down he stared at the gun struck by its size the bulky carved handle and long thin barrel a western gun it was like looking at a snake threatening even when it was still he touched it as cold as dead flesh and held his hand there feeling another death but the violence ended with hector karl to eisler tothe chain had to stop now ever use one holliday said no connolly said taking it out a cowboy gun chasing the runaway stagecoach across the screen a prop heavy one shot we need her alive he said taking his hand away shes the key who both of them holliday took a breath leave it on the seat just in case could you hit one of the tires connolly said you dont want to do that not at this speed connolly placed it carefully on the seat next to holliday it wasnt finished guns go off for a second he wanted to stop the car stop everything in time before it moved the next notch hannah was bound to be caught somehow he saw her at a train station melting into the crowd leaving emma in the car but emma was still slumped against the door when he looked up he saw the sign for jemez springs everything now reminded him of that other drive they were still dropping literally putting a mountain between them and the dead man in santa fe they see us holliday said the car in front of them jerked with a new burst of speed connolly imagined hannahs panic her one chance was to lose herself in all the empty space leaving the past behind the mountain you could do that in the west now it was following her a bogeyman always just over her shoulder no time to be careful she would have the gun on emma watching her steer then looking out the window behind trapped not too close connolly said she has to stop sometime shes not going to stop holliday said quietly connolly saw the few buildings of town emmas chevy streaking through past the wide porch of the old hotel the gas station suddenly a police car pulled into the street behind her our old friend the speed trap connolly thought emma had been so annoyed but not now get out of the way he wanted to scream you dont know but the traffic cop jolted from his lazy afternoon watch kept on them his one chance for a ticket when they didnt stop he turned on his siren the noise cracked the air like a long scream connolly felt his own blood pump faster triggered by the sharp wail and he knew that hannahs would be racing the siren wouldnt stop it surrounded them louder and closer as if the air itself were chasing them he imagined hannah turning to seenot just connollys car now but the lights and the siren a whole posse she was being run to ground idiot hes got to stop connolly yelled to no one they flashed through the town and then they were back in the hills again but the cop kept going inching closer to the lead car its not speeding connolly wanted to shout youre ruining everything but that wasnt the point anymore now it was emma hands clenched on the wheel terrified the air shrieking around her and his own helplessness hed found out everything and it didnt matter he couldnt help her when they started climbing the long hill the police car gained on them the siren still furious and insistent holliday grim was pushing their car as fast as it could go flashing his headlights to get the cops attention nobody stopped when emma reached the top the car shuddered for an instant then banked into a sharp curve connolly saw it swerve then the squeal of tires as it slid toward the edge of the road the crack as it hit the tree so fast that it bounced away fishtailing back in an uncontrollable circle until it flew off the road plunging backward over the side he heard the sound of metal crashing louder even than the siren a roar connollys mind went blank he thought for a second that he could not see but that was only because the car was gone at the top he jumped from hollidays car even before it stopped the momentum pitching him forward past the traffic cop standing at the side of the road over the rim then down the hill in great leaps sending up clouds of dust the car was on its side drivers side up steam rising from the hood there was glass everywhere running connolly thought he heard a new siren but it was his own screaming shouting her name he was still screaming for her when he fell against the car unable to stop his run pain shot through his chest he yanked the door handle pulling with both hands until it finally came unstuck and popped open the angle of the car made it snap back hitting him on the shoulder and he groaned then pushed it again until it stayed open she was flung over the steering wheel her face covered with blood not moving he reached in to pull her body out her head fell back was she breathing he put his arm around her waist pulling her toward him straining with the weight she was wedged against the steering wheel so that finally he had to pull her out by her arms the lower part of her body dragged along like a twisted stuffed animal when she was halfway through the door holliday came to help lift her out is she dead is she dead connolly was yelling putting his ear against her mouth there was a lot of blood gashes along her arms from the windshield glass her face almost covered with it holliday quickly bent over feeling for a pulse checking for breathing shes unconscious he said briskly help me get her out of here were not supposed to move her connolly shouted out of his mind dont you know that youre not supposed to move her you could break something holliday looked up at him using the force of his stare to calm him bring him back youd better move her this is going to blow a small explosion not deafening then a whoosh of fire igniting connolly leaned over covering her as if they were being bombed when there was no afterexplosion he knelt back nodding to holliday who grabbed her other side to carry her away from the car they staggered uphill under the weight finally stopping halfway up connolly wiped his face thinking it was sweat then saw that it was tearshad he been crying hysterical and fresh blood shes breathing holliday said then to the traffic cop here give me a hand we have to get her to a hospital connolly out of the way thats not doing her any good he was wiping some of the blood away to see her face holliday touched him on the shoulder pressing him gently backward away from her body shes not dead connolly said absently not yet holliday said come on what about the other one the cop said connolly looked up surprised the other one flames were eating around the back of the car now the air pungent with oil smoke the one who would have killed her without thinking he plunged back down the hill stumbling his body shaking with a fury he had never felt before get away from there holliday shouted but he had to see she was lying flat against the passenger door her neck twisted millss gun still in her right hand he looked down into the car wanting to hurt her more and then suddenly felt nothing her skirt was hiked up thrown back when the car overturned and he felt oddly embarrassed had she died when the car hit the tree snapping her neck or had she had a few awful moments when the car tumbled over falling and she knew no more secrets but shed kept her last onenow shed never tell him anything and there was no one else connolly had lost them all there was another pop as the fire spread from the back seat he knew he should run but he stood there transfixed watching it creep along until it reached her and she too began to burn her clothes scorching and smoky he drew his head back away from the flames that had begun to engulf the car and through the smoke he thought he saw her body fold into itself curling up like a secret message burning in an ashtray the rain woke her the blinds in eislers old hospital room blew in with a small gust then flapped back against the halfopen window there had been hail earlier the nurse had told him but the violent clouds had passed leaving patches of evening drizzle she stared at him for a minute adjusting her eyes to the dim light to any light her face wrapped in bandages moved faintly in a dreamy smile sitting on the bed looking over her he was all she could see where am i she said in a whisper trying out her voice to see if it was still there on the hill the infirmary she tried to move and winced with pain whats wrong with me broken ribs dislocated shoulder leg fracture shock multiple lacerations some internal bleeding theyre watching he paused youll be all right she smiled at the medical report i must look a sight he felt her unbandaged hand terrible am i on drugs painkillers so im not dreaming this is all real she moved her eyes again focusing why do you have your clothes off he was shirtless his lower chest wrapped in white adhesive tape oh this he said fingering the tape hector her eyes clouded what happened to him hes dead dead she repeated dismayed i didnt mean to hit him so hard he said slowly it must have been the angle i dont understand she said confused i hit him with the statue he said looking at her directly it was selfdefense thats the way it makes sense there wont be any more questions he knocked you overdo you remember that he waited for her nod he killed karl she watched him as he spoke then closed her eyes for a second he thought she had drifted back to sleep you got your man she said we did so its finished yes finished she opened her eyes hannah she said remembering she was the contact the end of matthews chain but she neverat the ranch she didnt know she only knew eisler all this time emma said vaguely lost in her thoughts i thought she was my she was she liked you then why you got in the way like karl like karl she repeated trembling get some sleep he said but she grabbed his hand more firmly no dont go stay i dont want to dream about it i want to be awake you can be awake tomorrow youre really going to be all right you know youre lucky she smiled her eyes closing again yes lucky is there anything i can get for you call daniel i want to see him connolly nodded theyre putting a call through hes at the site its finished now she said not hearing him i can sort things out he looked at her nervously what are you going to do when i saw him hitting you she said slowly i knew so clear just like that i killed him didnt i he didnt answer she opened her eyes not the story the truth yes she nodded i thought so you see what that means to kill for someoneif i felt that way daniel must know maybe all along all those lies not his bed but he knew he never said anything he was waiting for me to see if it would pass like the others this time he was waiting for me it was all right you see until it was someone he raised her hand to his lips i can talk to him no me its time when its so clear we always think we have time for everything she said her voice drifting youre not dying no but look how fast when did all this happen this afternoon one afternoon well have lots of time she raised her hand to the side of his face well go dancing she said i thought you were dead in the car she moved her hand along his cheek soothing him marry me he said softly she smiled a proposal dont you think i have enough husbands not yet everybody always wants to marry me she said dreamily why is that do you think youre a nice girl she looked at him as he kissed her hand am i hm ill even ask your father a faint smile he hates the irish ill bring him around you wont i will promise me she said seriously no lies not even little ones he was leaning over brushing her lips when the nurse came in telephone she said looking at him with disapproval shes supposed to sleep you heard her he said to emma getting up from the bed dont worry him she said tell him im all right you are all right he turned to go but she stopped him one thing she said her eyes bright now that place they go reno do you think theyll do two at once he laughed at her use two judges on the phone at the nurses station he was asked to verify that the call was an emergency before he was patched through the connection was scratchy as if the rain were on the line with them this is michael connolly we met at i know who you are the voice said coldly look im sorry but your wife has had an accident a car accident shes all right but shes pretty banged up a silence you still there yes she is all right you said his inflections were still european she has a serious fracture shock another pause you were with her no

impossible im needed here thats it connolly said im sure you will look after her pawlowski said this time connolly heard the edge what do you want me to tell her then he paused shall i give her your love there was a silence then he said his voice cold again yes mr connolly give her my love he was still holding the phone disconcerted when mills appeared at the door something wrong mills said noticing his expression connolly shook his head just a bad connection he said putting down the receiver she going to be all right connolly nodded what about you mills said indicating his taped chest ill live he said absently youre up late for a moment neither of them spoke then mills moved further into the room whos hector ramirez he said finally is that his name i didnt know he looked up at mills youve been busy i mean who is he to you he killed karl mills looked at him steadily want to tell me why later connolly said turning back to the hospital room that can wait not for long connolly stopped his eyes raised in question lot of curious people over at the office mills said the switchboards been lighting up even the boys in washington seems everybody wants to talk to you all of a sudden connolly paused i have to see oppenheimer first why is that i wonder or is that something else im not supposed to know connolly said nothing mills shrugged anyway youre not going to see him tonight everybodys down at the site hadnt you heard all the cats are away connolly looked at him so all the rats got busy he said slowly you playing too they send you over here mills shifted leaning toward the desk they have a right to ask questions mike the guy was a project employee and hes dead that sets off a lot of bells van draseks in a latherwhat do you expect and hes got lansdale jumping on him you can practically hear him over the wire they want to know what the hells going on so they sent you connolly said you the advance party what are you supposed to do grill me or just keep me company till the big boys arrive christ a little friendly visit they pick on you for old times sake or did you volunteer for the job fuck you the sharpness of it caught connolly and he looked away embarrassed okay he said quietly so you didnt volunteer look im not ready for bedtime stories just yet not until i see oppenheimer and groves dont ask why there are reasons mills glanced at him then looked toward emmas room trying to work out his own puzzle oppies not back until tomorrow night i cant stall that long dont make this hard okay youre supposed to be working with us us mills hesitated them connolly smiled okay then lets make it easy you got here and i was already gone nobody knows where mike dont worry ill be back by morning connolly said just give me one night i need to see him to square things its not up to me you wont get off the mesa mike they have orders to stop you at the gate youre kidding mills shook his head remember new york theyre still pissed off about that they

wont stop your car and where are you going to bein the trunk mills said sarcastically just the back connolly said easily having a rest theyre not going to search your car besides youre in a hurry he lowered his voice come on mills take a chance for once mills colored stung why more games he said almost sneering just one more a little war game dont worry you wont get shot nobody gets hurt in fact thats the point theyre not the enemy mike mills said calmly theyre not on your side either you know connolly paused just help me finish the case mills stared at him finish how another rewrite is that what were talking about you going to rewrite this too if i have to for her sake mills said nodding toward emmas room connolly ignored the gesture everybodys its better this way how do you know just how do you decide what people ought to know i was trained in it remember its how i spent the war yeah i thought you gave all that up almost anyway i wont have to do it much longer the wars over everybody will rewrite it now pretty soon nobody will know what happened he moved again toward the door meanwhile i could use a ride just a ride they were still staring at each other not saying anything when the nurse came back she hesitated at the door afraid of interrupting then went over to the desk shes asking for you she said to connolly two minutes ive given her another shot mills broke the stare and wearily as if he had lost an argument with himself turned to the nurse you on night duty she nodded no other visitors thats g orders you understand she raised her eyebrows but nodded again a good soldier thanks connolly said to him she doesnt talk to anyone until i get back mills said to the nurse ignoring connolly i mean not anyone yes sir her husband might show up connolly said the nurse looked at mills i thought he was her husband him mills smiled no hes working with us when he went back into the room she seemed to be sleeping and he stood there for a minute watching her the sheet barely moving with her breathing he thought of her at costellos listening to the revisionist stories somebody elses berlin is he all right she said her eyes still closed did you tell him not to worry for a moment still distracted he didnt know what she meant daniel he said finally yes hes coming he looked at her hesitating of course he lied i have to go pick him up theres no other transport oh so far she said looking at him now you shouldnt be driving ill take mills dont worry he said leaning over i thought you were asleep you should be i was thinking about something hannah you know she had no family no i didnt know he said wondering where she was going what will happen to the ranch we could buy it do you have any money i have some would it bother you that it was hers not if you get rid of the corn paintings the nurse came into the room you really will have to go now she needs to sleep okay you hear he said to emma youre going to sleep whether you like it or not its an idea dont you think its beautiful land beautiful he said she looked up catching his tone you dont like it emma what would i do on a ranch you could ride me well talk about it tomorrow she smiled at him have you ever proposed to anyone before no no i thought so you dont know the form youre supposed to agree with everything whatever you say darling you see like that ill do whatever you want he took her hand stroking it with his okay he said softly ill do whatever you want it was pitch dark all the way to trinity the night sky obscured by black clouds after albuquerque it rained off and on brief shows of lightning followed by bursts of rain that puddled the road theyll call it off if this keeps up mills said leaning forward to see through the windshield the rainll spread the radioactive particles a good wind could blow stuff all the way to amarillo they wont risk that connolly looked at him surprised at the technical lesson mills shrugged you hear things connolly had dozed for hours his chest aching dully but as they neared the site he became alert jumpy with the tension of the thunderstorms what happened to the gun mills asked pretending to be casual its in the wreck the policell recover it i dont know in what shape you use it no i didnt get the chance so the mex killed karl connolly nodded i still dont know with what maybe with his hands he said feeling his sore neck why mills said quietly connolly thought for a minute jealousy near as i can make out karl was meeting the girlfriend the guy went into a rage when he caught them that why she ran she was hysterical she didnt know what she was doing maybe she thought wed nail her for starting the whole thing kind of a love triangle i guess and the business with the pantsthat was just to make us look in the opposite direction huh it did too how about the turquoise connolly hesitated thats still a mystery maybe she was generous to her friends older woman i dont know she took that one with her mills was quiet for a while he turned off the main highway onto the road to the site you used to be a better rewrite man than that he said finally i cant help it thats the way it happened what about all those security files i pulled they know about that the files that was connolly paused smiling to himself that was just a red herring mills started to respond then stopped seeing the roadblock ahead mps in jeeps and trucks were stretched across the road for what looked to be miles on either side a human security fence christ he said pulling up a flashlight shone into the car sorry youll have to turn back this road is closed jimmy mills said recognizing the guard its me mills we have to get to base camp not tonight you dont not even a snake gets through here tonight jimmy you see this ass its not in a sling yet you have a radio connolly asked suddenly the soldier looked at him suspiciously then nodded radio ahead tell oppenheimer that connollys got a message for him the soldier hesitated peering at him do it he went over to his jeep and they could see him operating the bulky field phone then nodding okay he said leaning into millss window looking only at him who the hell is he anyway mills grinned at him putting the car in gear better watch that ass he pulled the car around the jeep and headed into the flat waste of desert you sure you know what youre doing using his name like that he said to connolly were through arent we i mean this is probably the most important night of his life he might be a little highstrung were through connolly said again in the distance they could see the camp lights and beyond a single tower in the middle of the desert held in the beams of giant searchlights the base camp at trinity had grown barracks and tents had sprouted around the original buildings and the air hummed with the sounds of makeshift generators and voices pouring out of the mess cars and jeeps were scattered at angles to the buildings the rain had stopped but small puddles from the last storm still caught the reflected light connolly heard what sounded like the croaking of frogs it was nearly four in the morning but the mess was in full swing dishing out powdered eggs and coffee flat squares of french toast soldiers sat at tables playing cards and reading with the studied waiting of people in a bus terminal this time there were civilians too men in suits and ties and wirerimmed glasses dressed to watch history connolly recognized bush and conant mingled with the scientists from the hill the gangs all here he thought when oppenheimer saw him he detached himself from the crowd and walked over in a room of nervous people he seemed to be vibrating with tension his cigarette hand moving to his mouth in tiny jerks connolly had seen him jittery before now he seemed close to breakdown what the devil is it he said quickly im sorry i had to use your name to get in i need to see you he glanced around the crowded room alone now you want to see me now a hand on his shoulder interrupted him groves looking even heavier than usual a bulging mass of khaki turned him half around stopping him connolly was struck again by their odd disparity meteorology says its clearing another hour then seeing connolly what are you doing here after fivethirty theres too much light oppenheimer said the cameras they said an hour groves said calming him something wrong he said to connolly yes what is it oppenheimer said impatiently connolly looked at both of them waiting for him but it was impossible now there were two stories not one why had he thought oppenheimer would be alone i have to see pawlowski he said improvising oppenheimer stared at him amazed youve got a hell of a nerve coming here at a time like this with personal problems he said almost spitting the ps his wifes in the hospital what are you her nurse actually i need to see you too but that can wait it can we got the guy its over congratulations oppenheimer snapped now get the hell out of here then controlling himself pawlowskis at s thats the control bunker for the gadget you can get him after the test he looked at his watch if theres a test weve already postponed it once thirtymileanhour winds thirty anything more than ten and they said an hour groves said again reassuring then to connolly i dont understand you found yes mr connollys solved his case oppenheimer said dismissively lighting another cigarette he seems to think this is a swell time to make a report he spoke the slang word as if it were foreign if its really an hour wed better get kisty away from that tower we have to clear all personnel at least an hour beforehand groves looked puzzled in case a vehicle breaks down and they have to walk theyd need an hour its six miles to the bunker and no one guards the gadget groves said no well give your saboteurs a fighting chance he checked his watch again theyd better hurry groves glanced at him unamused then back at connolly uncomfortable with an audience lets get out to s then he said calmly to oppenheimer theres nothing more we can do here anyway weve got the brass all taken care of he gestured toward the washington visitors you get the driver and ill be right along he looked at oppenheimer the weathers going to be fine oppenheimer hearing the polite dismissal smiled okay he said then turned to connolly ill send pawlowski back after the test no one leaves there now as long as youre here you might as well go up to compania hill with the rest of the visitors get one of the men to take you you should be safe thereits far enough awayin case our calculations are wrong of course thats a relative thing isnt it if were really off enrico thinks its possible to ignite the atmosphere a chain reaction there that kind of talk is just out of line groves said annoyed i told him yes he told me you told him i think he might have been joking you know some joke oppenheimer turned to connolly ill send him back im sorry if ive been rude i still say you picked one hell of a time groves watched him walk out the door he hasnt slept in two days groves said were all keyed up this rain didnt help any he brushed his uniform and connolly noticed for the first time that it was covered in damp patches i didnt mean to bother him well bother me ive got the time this darn waitings the worst part nothing to do but go over the same thing over and over whats this about solving the case eisler was meeting a man called hector ramirez connolly began his new story spanish maybe mexicanwe dont know yet big guy laborer he even managed to get himself a job on the hillconstruction or maintenance i guess anyway not a scientist eisler appears to have been his only contact so he may have been trying to scout out some new business where is he now hes dead dead i killed him connolly felt the bandage on his forehead a fight his head got in the way of some scrap metal youre sure it was him absolutely thats why the fight he tried to kill me he tell you anything who his friends were who he passed connolly shook his head wonderful hes dead connolly said steadily it ends with him groves sighed now what now im going to need a story to tell the papers it was a public fight id say a woman probably theyre used to that here every saturday night theres some kind of trouble like that police chief in santa fe is a friend of mine i can fix it with him but youll have to call your boys off your friend lansdales already got the net out for me so give him a call and tell him to keep his hands to himself im a direct report remember groves peered at him you telling me a story too general im working for you youre working for your country mister and both of you are going to get what you wanted all along you had a security leak and now its plugged and nobody ever has to know just you and whoever else you want to tell if it were me id keep it to myself the guy who did it is dead and the guy who helped him is dead and nobody knows why theyre dead not even their bosses your case is closed now all you have to do is seal it groves looked at him turning this over theyll try again maybe make them work for it id say weve been lucky did you really think you could control a project like this thousands of people they know something but they dont know everything and they dont know that you know a poker player would kill for that thats what theyre doing in germany right now isnt it playing poker and youre giving our guy signals no mr connolly groves said looking at his watch in about an hour im going to give him the ace connolly hesitated then he wont need anything else groves looked at him such as a petty crime thats all this turned out to be a crime nothing else not enough to bother people about let me understand you nothing else happened not eisler not new york none of it why i think it might be best for the project for the project yes connolly said looking directly at him nobody needs to raise any questions now not when they have the ace he paused you won your hand groves stared at him they can turn on you too you give them a spy case and theyll take the project away from you groves stood still ive always played things by the book mr connolly connolly looked away i assume you want a report what do you intend to say general im writing it for you what do you want it to say groves still didnt move letting the crowded mess buzz around them papers a funny thing he said finally shifting his leg ill want another briefing before we decide connolly nodded officially you were brought here to investigate a murder nothing else connolly nodded again we had a break there too by the way our spanish friend liked to beat up queers we had another case right on the hill the victim identified him i can get him to testify if its necessary though to tell you the truth id like to keep him out of it you know how nervous it makes the guys in gthey start looking at everybody in the showers just in case anyway theres your link to bruner if you want to play that angle eisler doesnt have to come into it at all groves took a piece of candy out of his pocket and looked at it thoughtfully as he crinkled the wrapper nice and tidy isnt it he said its not often things end up being so neat almost never but thats the way it is he said a question and the way everybody wants it to be connolly said looking at him coolly isnt it what you asked for the first time we met i never thought youd do it i was lucky maybe were both lucky groves looked up at him why do i always feel im making a bargain with you because youre about to make one i need a favor what kind of favor he said guardedly i said before that no one knows about this except you but there is one other person me in fact im the only one whos public at all i killed a man im going to have to explain that and im going to have to make everybody believe just what we want them to believewhat happened to bruner what happened to ramirez all of it but you said and ill do it im good at it the manhattan project is the bestkept secret of the war maybe ever nothing ever happened you and oppenheimer can take a bow you deserve it but the wars never going to end for you not now maybe you like it that way but i want out groves looked at him puzzled are you asking for a discharge connolly smiled im not in the army general well but i do have a file now i want you to close it what do you mean just that lose me somewhere youve been spying on me ever since this started you didnt think i could do it but you couldnt trust me not to so somebody had to watch but then you couldnt trust them either so you got them watching each other youve got your own chain reaction going and its not going to stop now you watching oppenheimer too thats enough groves said angry your pal how else could it be theyd love to get their hands on him wouldnt they that would be quite a catch theres no reason to believe of course there isnt but theyll hound him anyway well thats between you and him just dont hound me you close that file and i close this one neat and tidy like you say he paused and one other a woman she almost died todayyesterday i think you owe her groves raised his eyebrows dont ask why just close her file too theyll be interested in her and she doesnt need any more trouble erase us both like that you can do it i trust you why is that because youre good at keeping secrets look at this connolly said spreading his hand toward the room a whole city this ones just a little secret mr connolly groves said with exaggerated patience this is a military project that means there are going to be procedures yeah i know you play it by the book but the book stinks its going to eat you up not me groves squinted a little anybody would think you had something to hide connolly looked up at him dont even be tempted you put those goons on me again or the ladythe papers would have a field day with this story any way i want to tell it believe me i know are you threatening me no im asking you for a favor let us out of the war groves paused then looked at his watch again i dont have time to argue with you then looking directly at him youre sure youve told me everything connolly nodded you can close the file a loudspeaker interrupted with the weather report jolting the room into activity youd better get up to the hill if you want to see anything groves said i dont make deals mr connolly i cant your word is good enough for me i havent given it connolly nodded again by the way whats s ten thousand yards south of the gadget groves said automatically distracted by the question the south bunker he paused you didnt know that general connolly said i dont know anything by the time he got to compania hill the wind had died down to the still hush before dawn busloads of scientists and visitors lined the sandy ridge talking in groups around the jeeps and trucks like guests at a tailgate party some were looking southeast toward the small tower in the distance waiting for the signal flares the rockets red glare connolly thought the bombs burstinga macabre new version of the song someone handed him a piece of welding glass and he held it up the barely visible light disappearing completely behind the tinted square was it really necessary did anyone know some of the scientists had smeared their faces with suntan oil so their skins gleamed he recognized teller pulling on heavy gloves like a good boy bundling up for the storm they were twenty miles from the gadget could it really burn the air like the ball of fire over hamburg sucking breath out of lungs carpet bombing but this was supposed to be something else most of the men had been there all night and were stiff with cold and waiting now they grew quiet fiddling with the squares of welding glass stamping their feet warm there was nothing left to say cameras had been set up at n here there were only people knotting together on a sandy grandstand anxious and expectant like romans at a blood sport connolly thought about the first time hed seen the tech areasecretaries passing through the fence men darting in and out of lab buildings as if they were late for class everyone too busy to stop an endless film loop now finally they were at an end waiting to see their work all those meetings and calculations go up in smoke mills handed him a thermos cup of coffee they say youre not supposed to look he said even this far whats that the rocket five minutes jesus this stuff goes right through you doesnt it he said agitated dark glass everyone someone shouted down the line the hell with that one of the scientists said excited im going to see this even if its the last thing i see thats a possibility howard a gruff hungarian voice connolly picked up his welding glass whats the matter he said to mills who was shaking goddamnit he said i have to take a leak connolly smiled just turn around i wont look now ill tell you if you miss anything fuck mills said then whirled around and took a step away connolly heard the tear of a zipper then the splashing on the ground and smiled to himself wondering if years from now in winnetka mills would tell his children how he peed the night they exploded the gadget or whether that story would have to be changed too no one else seemed to hear they stood as still as stone looking straight ahead the second rocket connolly was aware of mills beside him again holding the welding glass up like a mask there was nothing to see black space the tiny light of the tower they passed the last minute but it didnt go off nothing moved suddenly there was a pinprick whiter than magnesium a photographers bulb and he was blinded with light it flashed through his body filling all the space around them so that even the air disappeared just the light he closed his eyes for a second but it was there anyway this amazing light as if it didnt need sight to exist its center spread outward eating air turning everything into light what if fermi was right what if it never stopped and light was heat bodies would melt now a vast ball still blinding gathering up the desert at its base into a skirt that held it in place like a mesa made entirely of light the ball grew glowing hotter traces of yellow and then suddenly violet eerie and terrifying an unearthly violet connolly knew instantly no one had ever seen before eislers light his heart stopped he wanted to turn away but the hypnotic light froze him he felt his mouth open in a cartoon surprise then the light took on definition pulling up the earth into its rolling bright cloud a stem connecting it to the ground how long did it take for the sound to follow the hours of light were only a blink of seconds and then the sound bouncing between the mountains roared up the valley toward them tearing the air he staggered almost crying out what was it like near the blast a violence without limit inescapable no one would survive then he dropped the piece of welding glass squinting and watched the cloud climb higher rolling over on itself on and on its stem widening until the cloud finally seemed too heavy and everything collapsed into the indeterminate smoke he stared without thinking behind it now he could see the faint glimmer of dawn shy behind the mountain its old wonder reduced to background lighting he turned to mills but mills had dropped to the ground as if hed been knocked over by the blast had lost whatever strength it took to stand his eyes seemed fixed mesmerized by their glimpse of the supernatural connolly heard shouts loud whoops and spurts of spontaneous applause and looked at the crowd scientists shook hands or hugged someone danced but it was only a reflex the expected thing for then it grew quiet again solemn and people just stared at the cloud wondering what they had seen he felt an urge to swallow to make some connection with his body what had he thought it would bea bigger explosion a giant bonfire all this time on the hill they had talked in euphemisms what was it but a larger version of the terrible things they already knew a sharper spear a better bow and arrow but now he had seen it not just a weapon he felt himself shaking oppenheimer must have known maybe nobody knew it didnt have a name yet not death people had ideas about death pyramids and indulgences and metaphors for journeys connolly saw looking out at the cloud in the desert that none of it was true that all those ideas everything we thought we knew were nothing more than stories to rewrite insignificance this was the real secret annihilation nothing else a chemical pulse that dissolved finally in violet light no stories now we would always be frightened he heard a retching sound and looked over toward the trucks where one of the scientists was doubled over throwing up on the other side of the hood a relief from the long tension perhaps the first of the night terrors to follow the men nearby turned their heads away comforting him with privacy after a while people began getting into buses for the long drive back to los alamos there would be a party tonight the pulse would reassert itself otherwise they would have to admit to the fear in the morning light people looked haggard and drained pale under the shiny lotion their faces scratchy now with morning stubble they shuffled unsteadily like guests at an allnight party finally ready for bed but connolly couldnt move this is what they had been doing here all of them the cloud was beginning to disappear he stood watching it drift into the atmosphere not moving until he could pretend it hadnt really been there mills still dazed and vacant drove him back to base camp without saying a word here on the outer rim of the explosion there were twisted bits of metal and debris pulverized by the blast toward the center there was nothing at all the morning almost defiantly was lovely by noon trinity would be baking again the desert shimmering as it had that first time but everything would be dead connolly looked at things without thinking as exhausted as the scientists and wondered why he had come back everything that concerned him now seemed inconsequential this could never be a secret so what had it all been about a murder solved would oppenheimer care and it was oppenheimer he wanted to see one last thing hed forgotten about daniel they passed the group of soldiers outside the base collecting sensors and measuring devices in the desert then stood idly at the camp not quite sure where to go next when the man approached him he did not for a minute remember who he was the project had aged him connolly had thought of him as young a gentle student now his face was sharp and stern as if the blast had pulled back his skin leaving the cheekbones and receding hairline of an older man oppie said you wanted to see me yes connolly said surprised and then embarrassed had he really asked to see him he seemed a figure from before when nothing was inconsequential i thought youd need a lift back to the hospital youre very solicitous pawlowski said stiffly she thinks youre already on your way connolly said shell be worried you can tell her they sealed the base its true enough pawlowski narrowed his eyes i thought you were there wasnt that enough he said his voice unexpectedly arch she asked for you connolly said stop blaming her i dont blame her he said slowly i blame you connolly shrugged you want to take a poke at me its a good time for it i assure you i wouldnt feel a thing is that why you came here to fight no i came to help help me mills over there can drive you connolly said nodding his head toward the car youd never forgive yourself what are you trying to do get even with me i dont matter pawlowski glanced over at the car then back again i wish that were true he said his body slumping a little tired so a car is that the american custom its just a car and you think i would accept this from you just go see her she needs to see you so she can tell me everything the guilty conscience i already know mr connolly i always know you the others do you think youre the first but you stay he paused yes i stay he said quietly you wonder how i can do that no i think youre in love with her pawlowski stared at him his eyes dull with fatigue why have you come here connolly said nothing so its over now the apologies no its not over connolly said pointedly pawlowski moved toward the building and leaned against it deflated she wants to leave me she wants you to let her go he looked down at the ground then up at connolly a last spurt of anger for you and i have no feelings in the matter is that what you think no connolly said quietly for a minute pawlowski said nothing looking at the drying street i was right he said finally youre not like the others its not enough for you just to take you wantwhat a collaborator i want her to be happy she wont be happy if she hurts you so you want me to pretend sometimes its better pawlowski looked at him the faint trace of an ironic smile on his lips than the truth yes he said slowly perhaps each time you know i thought why am i not enough each time he pulled himself up moving away from the building youre embarrassed to hear this you want me to pretend to you too im sorry connolly said maybe its a relief for me to say it once pawlowski straightened himself to go emmas not a prisoner shes free to do as she likes he looked out toward the blast area it seems a small point now not to her help her he looked straight at connolly and then over toward mills ah he said wearily i forgot in america always the happy ending better than the truth and so easy even a car and driver he took a step then turned but always theres the loose end you know even here he looked away then pointed to a jeep farther along the road that needs to go back to the bunker youll return it connolly nodded straight out that road you cant miss it theres nothing else there now connolly watched him walk heavily over to the car and open the back door nodding to mills as he got in not turning around the road to s was busy with vehicles visitors returning from the blast area and soldiers still collecting sensors connolly saw oppenheimers porkpie hat outside the door of the control station bobbing in a sea of heads somebody was taking a picture he parked the jeep and sat for a few minutes not wanting to interrupt looking out across the waste when the group broke up oppenheimer spotted him and walked over his face no longer pale as if it had colored with excitement and was just calming down how about a lift he said sure where out there oppenheimer said indicating the far edge of the blast area i want to get away for a bit its quite safe as long as we dont go near the crater you need a leadlined tank for that the paved road ended a short distance past the bunker out on the dead sand connolly looked toward the huge blast crater the sun reflecting off what seemed to be pieces of green glass the ground fused in the heat oppenheimer said calmly there was no destination after a while they simply stopped and got out looking around at the empty desert there was no sound at all in the new silence not even the faint scratching of lizards and insects oppenheimer stood still looking at nothing the worst part is i was pleased he said suddenly still looking away when it went off it worked connolly looked down to where the funhouse mirror of the morning glare stretched their shadows out along the ground theyll blame you he said oppenheimer turned to him slowly surprised you think so prometheus no fire was a gift this is a curse oppenheimer was quiet it need not be it doesnt have to bethis he said spreading his hand anyway its the end of war they wont dare now oppenheimer looked down youre an optimist mr connolly thats what alfred nobel said about dynamite he was wrong im not well see i hope so that would be quite a thingto be blamed for ending war theyll honor you first and then oppenheimer looked at him and connolly saw that his usual ironic glint had faded get out while you can connolly said after this oppenheimer said looking around again do you want me to leave the generals in charge no connolly said reluctantly you cant he turned away kicking at the sand anyway it worked numbers on paper you found it is it what you expected it was waiting to be found mr connolly a problem and then a trace of smile like yours perhaps waiting to be found you said you solved it is it what you expected i didnt expect anything connolly said i just wanted to know yes oppenheimer said almost to himself thats all i ever wanted too he walked away lighting a cigarette and how did it come out you were going to tell me groves will fill you in a worker on the hill theres one thing he doesnt know oppenheimer raised his eyebrows in question he was working for hannah beckman she was eislers contact hannah oppenheimer said blankly as if he had misheard your old friend we used to go riding when i first came out to the ranch but its impossible hannah she had no politics at all its possible it was her oppenheimer took this in not saying anything was theyre both dead theres no need for anyone to know about her part in it oppenheimer looked at him curiously why because youd be walking into a buzz saw theyre after you as it is and this ones too close to home youd be handing them a gun you and eisler if it comes out that the project was being sold out by old friends of yours theyll smell the blood all the way to washington the truth wont matter theyll destroy you oppenheimer held his eyes with a flicker of the old intensity according to you theyre going to do that anyway not with my help theyre not oppenheimer smiled involuntarily then frowned so i justsay nothing you dont know anything to say you never heard a word you want to rewrite history just a little youve made plenty of it to go around now just change a little piece for yourself oppenheimer looked at him thinking why are you doing this because i want to keep you out of trouble i think were going to need you oppenheimer said nothing for a minute then nodded thank you okay connolly said holding his eyes and nodding back then uncomfortable he turned away wed better get back its a great day for the project you dont want to miss any of it yes oppenheimer said wearily i was pleased he said again still wondering at himself and then pointed the tower was over there it evaporated justevaporated can you imagine that he looked around now lost in his thoughts everythings dead connolly waited were going to use it on people i know once twice oppenheimer said correcting him there are two thats what the general said to me right after it went off two of these and the war is over why not just one weve only tested the plutonium gadget he said a scientist again the uranium bomb needs and then he caught himself and shrugged i suppose he wants to scare them to death they started for the jeep this is what theyll remember oppenheimer said looking at the desolation not the rest of it theyll wonder what we were doing all this time what am i going to tell them he paused my god i was never happier in my life not just you everybody oppenheimer glanced at him yes he said the time of our lives it wont be convenient to remember that that we enjoyed doing it he stopped god help me its true for a minute connolly thought he would break down his thin body finally overcome by contradiction people do funny things when theyre scared to death im worried about you connolly said unable to keep the intimacy out of his voice he looked at the frail figure beside him the hollow cheeks and anxious eyes and suddenly wished him back at the blackboard at gottingen thinking out puzzles im worried about all of us oppenheimer said i cant think about that many right now im just worried about you but oppenheimer had recovered and had moved his chalk to the larger problem they wont stay scared he said a little learnings a dangerous thing a lot isnt maybe its what we needto know this much to change it wont change anything theyll hate you for trying well he said then looked over at connolly an almost jaunty gleam in his eyes you know the trouble with you mike is that you dont trust people connolly flushed it was the first time oppenheimer had ever used his name and it took him by surprise the pleasure of it sometimes you have to have a little faith oppenheimer was saying and connolly felt that he was losing him that he was drifting away unwilling to be distracted from his new theorem not them he said urgently taking oppenheimers elbow as if he were trying to anchor him you dont know them they cant stop now you have to be careful you have to protect yourself oppenheimers eyes wandered to the tower site how do you do that he said then he looked down at connollys hand and gently pulled his elbow away you know you may be wrong im not oppenheimer looked at him his eyes tired and knowing well well see he said im going to hope for the best turn the page for a preview of the exciting new joseph kanon novel
