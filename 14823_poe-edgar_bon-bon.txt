bonbon by edgar allan poe quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac je suis plus savant que balzac plus sage que pibrac mon brass seul faisant lattaque de la nation coseaque la mettroit au sac de charon je passerois le lac en dormant dans son bac jirois au fier eac sans que mon coeur fit tic ni tac premmer du tabac french vaudeville that pierre bonbon was a restaurateur of uncommon qualifications the culdesac le febvre at rouen will i imagine feel himself at liberty to dispute that pierre bonbon was in an equal degree skilled in the philosophy of that period is i presume still more especially undeniable his pates a la fois were beyond doubt immaculate but what pen can do justice to his essays sur la nature his thoughts sur lame his observations sur lesprit if his omelettes if his fricandeaux were inestimable what litterateur of that day would not have given twice as much for an idee de bonbon as for all the trash of idees of all the rest of the savants bonbon had ransacked libraries which no other man had ransacked had more than any other would have entertained a notion of reading had understood more than any other would have conceived the possibility of understanding and although while he flourished there were not wanting some authors at rouen to assert that his dicta evinced neither the purity of the academy nor the depth of the lyceum although mark me his doctrines were by no means very generally comprehended still it did not follow that they were difficult of comprehension it was i think on account of their selfevidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse it is to bonbon but let this go no farther it is to bonbon that kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics the former was indeed not a platonist nor strictly speaking an aristotelian nor did he like the modern leibnitz waste those precious hours which might be employed in the invention of a fricasee or facili gradu the analysis of a sensation in frivolous attempts at reconciling the obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion not at all bonbon was ionic bonbon was equally italic he reasoned a priori he reasoned also a posteriori his ideas were innate or otherwise he believed in george of trebizonde he believed in bossarion bonbon was emphatically a bonbonist i have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of restaurateur i would not however have any friend of mine imagine that in fulfilling his hereditary duties in that line our hero wanted a proper estimation of their dignity and importance far from it it was impossible to say in which branch of his profession he took the greater pride in his opinion the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities of the stomach i am not sure indeed that he greatly disagreed with the chinese who held that the soul lies in the abdomen the greeks at all events were right he thought who employed the same words for the mind and the diaphragm by this i do not mean to insinuate a charge of gluttony or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the metaphysician if pierre bonbon had his failings and what great man has not a thousand if pierre bonbon i say had his failings they were failings of very little importance faults indeed which in other tempers have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues as regards one of these foibles i should not even have mentioned it in this history but for the remarkable prominency the extreme alto relievo in which it jutted out from the plane of his general disposition he could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain not that he was avaricious no it was by no means necessary to the satisfaction of the philosopher that the bargain should be to his own proper advantage provided a trade could be effected a trade of any kind upon any terms or under any circumstances a triumphant smile was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance and a knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity at any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the one i have just mentioned should elicit attention and remark at the epoch of our narrative had this peculiarity not attracted observation there would have been room for wonder indeed it was soon reported that upon all occasions of the kind the smile of bonbon was wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes or welcome an acquaintance hints were thrown out of an exciting nature stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at leisure and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities vague longings and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil for wise purposes of his own the philosopher had other weaknesses but they are scarcely worthy our serious examination for example there are few men of extraordinary profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle whether this inclination be an exciting cause or rather a valid proof of such profundity it is a nice thing to say bonbon as far as i can learn did not think the subject adapted to minute investigation nor do i yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical it is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive discrimination which was wont to characterize at one and the same time his essais and his omelettes in his seclusions the vin de bourgogne had its allotted hour and there were appropriate moments for the cotes du rhone with him sauterne was to medoc what catullus was to homer he would sport with a syllogism in sipping st peray but unravel an argument over clos de vougeot and upset a theory in a torrent of chambertin well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the peddling propensity to which i have formerly alluded but this was by no means the case indeed to say the truth that trait of mind in the philosophic bonbon did begin at length to assume a character of strange intensity and mysticism and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie of his favorite german studies to enter the little cafe in the culdesac le febvre was at the period of our tale to enter the sanctum of a man of genius bonbon was a man of genius there was not a souscusinier in rouen who could not have told you that bonbon was a man of genius his very cat knew it and forebore to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius his large waterdog was acquainted with the fact and upon the approach of his master betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment a debasement of the ears and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether unworthy of a dog it is however true that much of this habitual respect might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the metaphysician a distinguished exterior will i am constrained to say have its way even with a beast and i am willing to allow much in the outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of the quadruped there is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the little great if i may be permitted so equivocal an expression which mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in creating if however bonbon was barely three feet in height and if his head was diminutively small still it was impossible to behold the rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering upon the sublime in its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of his acquirements in its immensity a fitting habitation for his immortal soul i might here if it so pleased me dilate upon the matter of habiliment and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician i might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short combed smoothly over his forehead and surmounted by a conicalshaped white flannel cap and tassels that his peagreen jerkin was not after the fashion of those worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day that the sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted that the cuffs were turned up not as usual in that barbarous period with cloth of the same quality and color as the garment but faced in a more fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of genoa that his slippers were of a bright purple curiously filigreed and might have been manufactured in japan but for the exquisite pointing of the toes and the brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery that his breeches were of the yellow satinlike material called aimable that his skyblue cloak resembling in form a dressingwrapper and richly bestudded all over with crimson devices floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a mist of the morning and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the remarkable words of benevenuta the improvisatrice of florence that it was difficult to say whether pierre bonbon was indeed a bird of paradise or rather a very paradise of perfection i might i say expatiate upon all these points if i pleased but i forbear merely personal details may be left to historical novelists they are beneath the moral dignity of matteroffact i have said that to enter the cafe in the culdesac le febvre was to enter the sanctum of a man of genius but then it was only the man of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the sanctum a sign consisting of a vast folio swung before the entrance on one side of the volume was painted a bottle on the reverse a pate on the back were visible in large letters oeuvres de bonbon thus was delicately shadowed forth the twofold occupation of the proprietor upon stepping over the threshold the whole interior of the building presented itself to view a long lowpitched room of antique construction was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the cafe in a corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician an army of curtains together with a canopy a la grecque gave it an air at once classic and comfortable in the corner diagonary opposite appeared in direct family communion the properties of the kitchen and the bibliotheque a dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser here lay an ovenful of the latest ethics there a kettle of dudecimo melanges volumes of german morality were hand and glove with the gridiron a toastingfork might be discovered by the side of eusebius plato reclined at his ease in the fryingpan and contemporary manuscripts were filed away upon the spit in other respects the cafe de bonbon might be said to differ little from the usual restaurants of the period a fireplace yawned opposite the door on the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable array of labelled bottles it was here about twelve oclock one night during the severe winter the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity that pierre bonbon i say having turned them all out of his house locked the door upon them with an oath and betook himself in no very pacific mood to the comforts of a leatherbottomed armchair and a fire of blazing fagots it was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice during a century it snowed fiercely and the house tottered to its centre with the floods of wind that rushing through the crannies in the wall and pouring impetuously down the chimney shook awfully the curtains of the philosophers bed and disorganized the economy of his patepans and papers the huge folio sign that swung without exposed to the fury of the tempest creaked ominously and gave out a moaning sound from its stanchions of solid oak it was in no placid temper i say that the metaphysician drew up his chair to its customary station by the hearth many circumstances of a perplexing nature had occurred during the day to disturb the serenity of his meditations in attempting des oeufs a la princesse he had unfortunately perpetrated an omelette a la reine the discovery of a principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew and last not least he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a successful termination but in the chafing of his mind at these unaccountable vicissitudes there did not fail to be mingled some degree of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well calculated to produce whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large black waterdog we have spoken of before and settling himself uneasily in his chair he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible to himself he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and papers and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous manuscript intended for publication on the morrow he had been thus occupied for some minutes when i am in no hurry monsieur bonbon suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment the devil ejaculated our hero starting to his feet overturning the table at his side and staring around him in astonishment very true calmly replied the voice very true what is very true how came you here vociferated the metaphysician as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at full length upon the bed i was saying said the intruder without attending to the interrogatives i was saying that i am not at all pushed for time that the business upon which i took the liberty of calling is of no pressing importance in short that i can very well wait until you have finished your exposition my exposition there now how do you know how came you to understand that i was writing an exposition good god hush replied the figure in a shrill undertone and arising quickly from the bed he made a single step toward our hero while an iron lamp that depended overhead swung convulsively back from his approach the philosophers amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the strangers dress and appearance the outlines of his figure exceedingly lean but much above the common height were rendered minutely distinct by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago these garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their present owner his ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches in his shoes however a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress his head was bare and entirely bald with the exception of a hinder part from which depended a queue of considerable length a pair of green spectacles with side glasses protected his eyes from the influence of the light and at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color or their conformation about the entire person there was no evidence of a shirt but a white cravat of filthy appearance was tied with extreme precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by side gave although i dare say unintentionally the idea of an ecclesiastic indeed many other points both in his appearance and demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature over his left ear he carried after the fashion of a modern clerk an instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients in a breastpocket of his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps of steel this book whether accidentally or not was so turned outwardly from the person as to discover the words rituel catholique in white letters upon the back his entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine even cadaverously pale the forehead was lofty and deeply furrowed with the ridges of contemplation the corners of the mouth were drawn down into an expression of the most submissive humility there was also a clasping of the hands as he stepped toward our hero a deep sigh and altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be unequivocally preposessing every shadow of anger faded from the countenance of the metaphysician as having completed a satisfactory survey of his visiters person he shook him cordially by the hand and conducted him to a seat there would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous transition of feeling in the philosopher to any one of those causes which might naturally be supposed to have had an influence indeed pierre bonbon from what i have been able to understand of his disposition was of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of exterior deportment it was impossible that so accurate an observer of men and things should have failed to discover upon the moment the real character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality to say no more the conformation of his visiters feet was sufficiently remarkable he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall hat there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his breeches and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact judge then with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all times entertained the most unqualified respect he was however too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in regard to the true state of affairs it was not his cue to appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed but by leading his guest into the conversation to elicit some important ethical ideas which might in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication enlighten the human race and at the same time immortalize himself ideas which i should have added his visitors great age and wellknown proficiency in the science of morals might very well have enabled him to afford actuated by these enlightened views our hero bade the gentleman sit down while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire and place upon the now reestablished table some bottles of mousseux having quickly completed these operations he drew his chair visavis to his companions and waited until the latter should open the conversation but plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of their application and the restaurateur found himself nonplussed by the very first words of his visiters speech i see you know me bonbon said he ha ha ha he he he hi hi hi ho ho ho hu hu hu and the devil dropping at once the sanctity of his demeanor opened to its fullest extent a mouth from ear to ear so as to display a set of jagged and fanglike teeth and throwing back his head laughed long loudly wickedly and uproariously while the black dog crouching down upon his haunches joined lustily in the chorus and the tabby cat flying off at a tangent stood up on end and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment not so the philosopher he was too much a man of the world either to laugh like the dog or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the cat it must be confessed he felt a little astonishment to see the white letters which formed the words rituel catholique on the book in his guests pocket momently changing both their color and their import and in a few seconds in place of the original title the words regitre des condamnes blazed forth in characters of red this startling circumstance when bonbon replied to his visiters remark imparted to his manner an air of embarrassment which probably might not otherwise have been observed why sir said the philosopher why sir to speak sincerely i i imagine i have some faint some very faint idea of the remarkable honor oh ah yes very well interrupted his majesty say no more i see how it is and hereupon taking off his green spectacles he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat and deposited them in his pocket if bonbon had been astonished at the incident of the book his amazement was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to view in raising his eyes with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain the color of his guests he found them by no means black as he had anticipated nor gray as might have been imagined nor yet hazel nor blue nor indeed yellow nor red nor purple nor white nor green nor any other color in the heavens above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth in short pierre bonbon not only saw plainly that his majesty had no eyes whatsoever but could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous period for the space where eyes should naturally have been was i am constrained to say simply a dead level of flesh it was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon and the reply of his majesty was at once prompt dignified and satisfactory eyes my dear bonbon eyes did you say oh ah i perceive the ridiculous prints eh which are in circulation have given you a false idea of my personal appearance eyes true eyes pierre bonbon are very well in their proper place that you would say is the head right the head of a worm to you likewise these optics are indispensable yet i will convince you that my vision is more penetrating than your own there is a cat i see in the corner a pretty cat look at her observe her well now bonbon do you behold the thoughts the thoughts i say the ideas the reflections which are being engendered in her pericranium there it is now you do not she is thinking we admire the length of her tail and the profundity of her mind she has just concluded that i am the most distinguished of ecclesiastics and that you are the most superficial of metaphysicians thus you see i am not altogether blind but to one of my profession the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance liable at any time to be put out by a toastingiron or a pitchfork to you i allow these optical affairs are indispensable endeavor bonbon to use them well my vision is the soul hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table and pouring out a bumper for bonbon requested him to drink it without scruple and make himself perfectly at home a clever book that of yours pierre resumed his majesty tapping our friend knowingly upon the shoulder as the latter put down his glass after a thorough compliance with his visiters injunction a clever book that of yours upon my honor its a work after my own heart your arrangement of the matter i think however might be improved and many of your notions remind me of aristotle that philosopher was one of my most intimate acquaintances i liked him as much for his terrible ill temper as for his happy knack at making a blunder there is only one solid truth in all that he has written and for that i gave him the hint out of pure compassion for his absurdity i suppose pierre bonbon you very well know to what divine moral truth i am alluding cannot say that i indeed why it was i who told aristotle that by sneezing men expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis which is hiccup undoubtedly the case said the metaphysician while he poured out for himself another bumper of mousseux and offered his snuffbox to the fingers of his visiter there was plato too continued his majesty modestly declining the snuffbox and the compliment it implied there was plato too for whom i at one time felt all the affection of a friend you knew plato bonbon ah no i beg a thousand pardons he met me at athens one day in the parthenon and told me he was distressed for an idea i bade him write down that o nous estin aulos he said that he would do so and went home while i stepped over to the pyramids but my conscience smote me for having uttered a truth even to aid a friend and hastening back to athens i arrived behind the philosophers chair as he was inditing the aulos giving the lambda a fillip with my finger i turned it upside down so the sentence now read o nous estin augos and is you perceive the fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics were you ever at rome asked the restaurateur as he finished his second bottle of mousseux and drew from the closet a larger supply of chambertin but once monsieur bonbon but once there was a time said the devil as if reciting some passage from a book there was a time when occurred an anarchy of five years during which the republic bereft of all its officers had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power at that time monsieur bonbon at that time only i was in rome and i have no earthly acquaintance consequently with any of its philosophy ils ecrivaient sur la philosophie cicero lucretius seneca mais cetait la philosophie grecque condorcet what do you think of what do you think of hiccup epicurus what do i think of whom said the devil in astonishment you cannot surely mean to find any fault with epicurus what do i think of epicurus do you mean me sir i am epicurus i am the same philosopher who wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by diogenes laertes thats a lie said the metaphysician for the wine had gotten a little into his head very well very well sir very well indeed sir said his majesty apparently much flattered thats a lie repeated the restaurateur dogmatically thats a hiccup a lie well well have it your own way said the devil pacifically and bonbon having beaten his majesty at argument thought it his duty to conclude a second bottle of chambertin as i was saying resumed the visiter as i was observing a little while ago there are some very outre notions in that book of yours monsieur bonbon what for instance do you mean by all that humbug about the soul pray sir what is the soul the hiccup soul replied the metaphysician referring to his ms is undoubtedly no sir indubitably no sir indisputably no sir evidently no sir incontrovertibly no sir hiccup no sir and beyond all question a no sir the soul is no such thing here the philosopher looking daggers took occasion to make an end upon the spot of his third bottle of chambertin then hiccup pray sir what what is it that is neither here nor there monsieur bonbon replied his majesty musingly i have tasted that is to say i have known some very bad souls and some too pretty good ones here he smacked his lips and having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket was seized with a violent fit of sneezing he continued there was the soul of cratinus passable aristophanes racy plato exquisite not your plato but plato the comic poet your plato would have turned the stomach of cerberus faugh then let me see there were naevius and andronicus and plautus and terentius then there were lucilius and catullus and naso and quintus flaccus dear quinty as i called him when he sung a seculare for my amusement while i toasted him in pure good humor on a fork but they want flavor these romans one fat greek is worth a dozen of them and besides will keep which cannot be said of a quirite let us taste your sauterne bonbon had by this time made up his mind to nil admirari and endeavored to hand down the bottles in question he was however conscious of a strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail of this although extremely indecent in his majesty the philosopher took no notice simply kicking the dog and requesting him to be quiet the visiter continued i found that horace tasted very much like aristotle you know i am fond of variety terentius i could not have told from menander naso to my astonishment was nicander in disguise virgilius had a strong twang of theocritus martial put me much in mind of archilochus and titus livius was positively polybius and none other hiccup here replied bonbon and his majesty proceeded but if i have a penchant monsieur bonbon if i have a penchant it is for a philosopher yet let me tell you sir it is not every dev i mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher long ones are not good and the best if not carefully shelled are apt to be a little rancid on account of the gall shelled i mean taken out of the carcass what do you think of a hiccup physician dont mention them ugh ugh ugh here his majesty retched violently i never tasted but one that rascal hippocrates smelt of asafoetida ugh ugh ugh caught a wretched cold washing him in the styx and after all he gave me the cholera morbus the hiccup wretch ejaculated bonbon the hiccup absorption of a pillbox and the philosopher dropped a tear after all continued the visiter after all if a dev if a gentleman wishes to live he must have more talents than one or two and with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy how so why we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions you must know that in a climate so sultry as mine it is frequently impossible to keep a spirit alive for more than two or three hours and after death unless pickled immediately and a pickled spirit is not good they will smell you understand eh putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls are consigned to us in the usual way hiccup hiccup good god how do you manage here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence and the devil half started from his seat however with a slight sigh he recovered his composure merely saying to our hero in a low tone i tell you what pierre bonbon we must have no more swearing the host swallowed another bumper by way of denoting thorough comprehension and acquiescence and the visiter continued why there are several ways of managing the most of us starve some put up with the pickle for my part i purchase my spirits vivente corpore in which case i find they keep very well but the body hiccup the body the body the body well what of the body oh ah i perceive why sir the body is not at all affected by the transaction i have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day and the parties never experienced any inconvenience there were cain and nimrod and nero and caligula and dionysius and pisistratus and and a thousand others who never knew what it was to have a soul during the latter part of their lives yet sir these men adorned society why possession of his faculties mental and corporeal who writes a keener epigram who reasons more wittily who but stay i have his agreement in my pocketbook thus saying he produced a red leather wallet and took from it a number of papers upon some of these bonbon caught a glimpse of the letters machi maza robesp with the words caligula george elizabeth his majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment and from it read aloud the following words in consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to specify and in further consideration of one thousand louis dor i being aged one year and one month do hereby make over to the bearer of this agreement all my right title and appurtenance in the shadow called my soul signed a here his majesty repeated a name which i did not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally querearouet a clever fellow that resumed he but like you monsieur bonbon he was mistaken about the soul the soul a shadow truly the soul a shadow ha ha ha he he he hu hu hu only think of a fricasseed shadow only think hiccup of a fricasseed shadow exclaimed our hero whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of his majestys discourse only think of a hiccup fricasseed shadow now damme hiccup humph if i would have been such a hiccup nincompoop my soul mr humph your soul monsieur bonbon yes sir hiccup my soul is what sir no shadow damme did you mean to say yes sir my soul is hiccup humph yes sir did you not intend to assert my soul is hiccup peculiarly qualified for hiccup a what sir stew ha soufflee eh fricassee indeed ragout and fricandeau and see here my good fellow ill let you have it hiccup a bargain here the philosopher slapped his majesty upon the back couldnt think of such a thing said the latter calmly at the same time rising from his seat the metaphysician stared am supplied at present said his majesty hiccup eh said the philosopher have no funds on hand what besides very unhandsome in me sir to take advantage of hiccup your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation here the visiter bowed and withdrew in what manner could not precisely be ascertained but in a wellconcerted effort to discharge a bottle at the villain the slender chain was severed that depended from the ceiling and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the lamp
