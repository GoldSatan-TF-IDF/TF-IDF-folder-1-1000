brian lumley deadspawn necroscope when harry put his hand on her claycold brow she recoiled as from a serpent not physically for she was dead but her mind cringed shrank down withdrew into itself like the feathery fronds of some strange sea anemone brushed by a swimmer the necroscope felt his blood turn to ice and for a moment stood in horror of himself the last thing hed wanted was to frighten her still more wrapping her in his thoughts in the warmth of his deadspeak he said its all right dont be afraid i wont hurt you no one can ever hurt you again it was as easy as that without even trying hed told her that she was dead but in the next moment he saw that she had already known keep off her deadspeak was a sobbing shriek of torment in harrys mind get away from me you filthy thing prologue resume harry keogh inherited the psychic skills of his mother and grandmother which in him have evolved to unparalleled heights of parapsychological power he is a necroscope he talks to the dead like other men talk to their friends and neighbours and indeed the teeming dead are harrys friends for he is the one light in their eternal darkness their only contact with the world they have left behind for the common perception of death is incorrect the minds of the dead do not accompany their bodies into corruption and dust but go on to explore the myriad possibilities of their leanings which were unattainable in life the writers continue to write great works that can never be published the architects design fabulous nearperfect cities which will never be built the mathematicians explore pure number to exponentials whose only boundary is infinity as a boy harry utilized his esoteric talent to help with his studies since he himself did not appear academically inclined certain of his deceased specialist friends were able to show him the short cuts around otherwise impossible classroom problems as a result of which he discovered his own affinity for instinctive or intuitive maths harry keogh was not the only one who talked to the dead in the ussr the soviet ebranch espbranch made use of boris dragosani a necromancer to tear the secrets of corpses from their violated bodies but where harry was beloved of the great majority they feared and loathed dragosani the difference was this where the necroscope merely conversed with the dead befriending and consoling them and asking nothing in return the russian necromancer simply reached in and took having been instructed in his obscene talent by a longburied but still undead vampire whose seed had been passed on to him nothing could be hidden from dragosani he would find his answers in the blood the guts the very marrow of his victims bones in all other instances the dead cant feel pain but that was part of dragosanis talent too for when he worked he made them feel it they felt his hands his knives his tearing nails they knew and felt everything he did to them it was never his way simply to question the dead for their secrets for then they might lie to him no his way was to rend them apart and then read the answers in torn skin and muscle in shredded ligaments and tendons in brain fluid and the mucus of eye and ear and in the very texture of the dead tissue itself while avenging the cruel death of his murdered mother harry keogh became aware of the existence of the espagencies of east and west recruited to the aid of british espintelligence in the secret war with russias mindspies he pitted himself against boris dragosani and now his intuitive maths came into play with the assistance of august ferdinand möbius harry gained access to the möbius continuum a fifth dimension running parallel not only to the mundane four but to all other material planes he could now in effect teleport instantly to anywhere in the world just as long as he had the mathematical coordinates or a dead friend in that location to act as a beacon in addition he had discovered his terrible power to call up the dead from their graves to rid the world of the vampire dragosani harry used the möbius continuum to invade the chateau bronnitsy russias secluded ebranch hq there he called up from death an army of mummified tartars whose bodies had been preserved by the peaty ground dragosani was destroyed and along with him many of the staff and much of the apparatus of the soviet mindspy agency but harry paid the price too and his body was also destroyed except as the necroscope knew well enough from personal experience death is not the end incorporeal pure mind he escaped to the möbius continuum and later by involuntary metempsychosis came to inhabit the braindead body of a british esper by then however harry had also come to realize the role he must play in the eradication of vampire spawn from the world of men this recognition of his purpose his destiny came about through the discovery of a vampires scarlet thread among the pure blue lifethreads of humanity where they permeate the past and future timelanes of the möbius continuum yulian bodescu contaminated with vampirism by thibor ferenczy the same centuriesdead vampire who infected dragosani threatened both harrys life and the life of his baby son but this time it was harry jr who turned the tables and made possible bodescus destruction for he too was born a necroscope with talents the same as or greater than those possessed by his father following the bodescu affair harry jr vanished apparently from the face of the earth and took his poor demented mother with him harry sr searching far and wide for his wife and infant son despaired of ever finding them in the möbius continuum their lifethreads disappeared mysteriously into some otherworldly place where even he could not follow harry quit british ebranch and devoted himself to his search which soon became an obsession years passed and the necroscope turned recluse living in a rambling ramshackle house some miles outside edinburgh then ebranch contacted him again they were badly in need of harrys help and guessed hed be reluctant but there was also a carrot the branch had a similar case on its hands a secret service agent had gone missing not presumed dead just like harry jr and his mother so now a young spy had disappeared into thin air the mindspies had reason to believe he was alive but still they couldnt find him harry checked it out with the great majority who denied that the missing man had joined their ranks and yet ebranch swore that he wasnt here on earth so where was he could it be he was in the same place as the necroscopes wife and child eventually harrys inquiries led him to the perchorsk projekt a russian experiment buried deep in a ravine under the ural mountains in an attempt to create a forcefield barrier as a counter to the usas star wars scenario the soviets had accidentally blasted a wormhole out of this spacetime dimension into a parallel plane of existence and in so doing they had also discovered the ancient source of all vampiric infestation of earth things were coming through the perchorsk gate into our world unbelievable things unbelievable except to the necroscope and certain members of the british and soviet ebranches through his contacts with the dead and especially with the assistance of august ferdinand möbius harry discovered a second gate and used it to venture into the world of the wamphyri whose skyscraper aeries gloomed gaunt and nightmarish over all starside the world where the vampire lords held sway there he discovered his son grown now to a young man but alas infected with vampirism known as the dweller in this weird parallel world harry jr had so far managed to hold his vampire metamorphosis in check he commanded a small band of travellers the original gypsies and a regiment of trogs the aboriginal men of starside but his enemies were monstrous and far outnumbered him only his magic his mastery of the möbius continuum and of superior science had so far kept him safe but under the guidance of the great and sinister lord shaithis the warlike wamphyri had recently put aside all personal grievances and banded together into an awesome alien army jealous of the dweller his garden and works they would move in unison against him the two harrys must stand alone against this force of monsters else total wamphyri domination of starand sunside would become a grim and horrific reality but they did not stand entirely alone in the bloody battle for the dwellers garden the lady karen joined sides with them a vampire indeed wamphyri karen was as beautiful as she was clever she could read the minds of the vampire lords and forecast their every move still shaithis and his fellow lords their lieutenants and all the vast and terrible warriorcreatures they had created from the flesh of men and trogs alike must surely have won the battle had it not been for the awesome powers of the necroscope and his son using the raw light of the sun itself the gardens defenders defeated shaithiss vampire army and went on to level the towering stacks of stone and bone which were the aeries of the wamphyri all except karens who had been their ally afterwards harry keogh visited karen in the grimly forbidding aerie which was her place she was not long a vampire the thing within her had not yet gained full ascendancy if the necroscope could drive out her vampire and destroy it perhaps there was yet a chance for harry jr harrys method was crude cruel even brutal but hideously effective except how could he have foreseen the consequences karen had been wamphyri and now without her vampire she was nothing but a pretty empty girl where was her power her freedom her raw unfettered wamphyri spirit now gone and when harry awoke from his exhaustion gone too was karen from on high he saw her body wrapped in the white sheath she wore for a gown bloody and broken on the flanks of her aerie where she had thrown herself down from the uppermost levels the dweller saw what his father had done and knew why if harry sr had found a cure for karen he might well have applied the principle to harry jr too fearing that one day his father might return to starside with just such a cure the dweller used his superior vampire powers to reduce harrys skills to nothing he took away his deadspeak his ability to talk to the dead and also his numeracy and then he returned harry keogh exnecroscope to his own world the world of men forbidden to speak to the dead a rule he must obey or else suffer terrible mental and physical agony and denied the use of the möbius continuum as a result of his enforced innumeracy harry keogh was as close as he had ever been to being a normal man which after what he had known equated almost to a prefrontal lobotomy he had been the necroscope and was now powerless but although incapable of conscious communication with the teeming dead still they could speak to him in his dreams and their message was monstrous another great vampire had come to stalk the world harry had dedicated himself to the eradication of vampirism but what could he exnecroscope do now as the worlds foremost expert on vampires he could at least advise he must do something for unless he and ebranch found the vampire first then sooner or later the undead monster would surely find him for harry had grown into a legend he was the vampireslayer and locked in his crippled mind were all the secrets of the great majority and mathematical formulae governing the möbius continuum itself if the bornagain monster should use its necromancy to steal his forbidden metaphysical talents the result would be unthinkable the dead forbidden to talk to harry except in his dreams rallied to him they used other methods to get their messages across to tell him that a vampire was at work in the islands of the aegean once more in league with ebranch harry keogh and the girl who loved him went out to the mediterranean to see what could be done but two british espers had already been vampirized and their esoteric talents added to those of janos ferenczy the bloodson of faéthor and brother to thibor the old thing in the ground janos was back to reclaim his territories and dig up again certain antique treasurehoards which he himself had long ago buried as a safeguard against the changes which centuries of immobility in undeath would bring treasures which would lie lost in the earth until his planned resurrection these preparations had been made back in the fifteenth century when janos had known that his powerful vampire father faéthor was returning again to wallachia after almost three hundred years of bloodthirsty adventuring with the crusaders then with genghis khan and finally with the moslems for faéthor hated janos and would try to kill him as he had already put down his brother thibor undead into the earth for which reason janos had made these provisions against an uncertain future when harry saw what he was up against with janos and after the vampire had taken harrys woman for his own then he knew he must somehow regain his deadspeak and his command over the mysterious möbius continuum without these powers he just wouldnt stand a chance the ghost of faéthor ferenczy whose place was the crumbling deserted overgrown ruins of a house close to ploiesti in romania contacted harry and offered to help the damage done to harrys mind was the work of the dweller harry jr a vampire with hugely enhanced mentalist powers if harry would now allow faéthors spirit into his mind perhaps that father of vampires could remove the blockage and unlock the closedoff regions harry did not like the idea to allow a vampire this vampire into his mind and knew it was an experiment fraught with the most terrifying dangers but beggars cant be choosers as to why faéthor should want to help he could not bear the thought of his bloodson janos up and about in the world while he was nothing but a fading memory shunned even by the dead he wanted janos put down again indeed he actively desired to be the instrument of that termination and harry keogh was the only one who could do it at least this was the explanation which faéthor offered to harry in romania harry slept overnight in the ruins of faéthors last refuge and while he slept the father of vampires entered his mind and reopened certain mental doors which harry jr had closed there waking up harry discovered his deadspeak returned to him now he could contact the longdead mathematician möbius and have him enter his mind and he hoped give him back his numeracy and mastery of the socalled möbius continuum but faéthor had lied once inside harrys mind the vampire would not leave it the necroscope now had an unwelcome tenant finally at janoss castle in the zarandului mountains of transylvania harry recovered his powers in full returned janos to dust and committed the spirit of faéthor to an eternity of emptiness and utter loneliness in the infinite future timestreams of the möbius continuum but his victory was not without cost strange urges are part of harry now and stranger hungers his lifethread unwinds as before into the unending future of möbius time except where once that lifethread was pure blue as are the threads of all entirely human beings now it is tinged with red part one charnel knowledge harry darcy clarkes voice was twitchy on the phone but he was trying hard to control it theres a problem we could use some help with your kind of help harry keogh necroscope might or might not know what was bothering the head of british ebranch and it might or might not have to do with him directly what is it darcy he said speaking softly its murder the other answered and now his twitchiness came on strong shaking his voice its bloody awful murder harry my god i never saw anything like it darcy clarke had seen a lot in his time and harry keogh knew it so that this was a statement he found hard to believe unless of course clarke was talking about my kind of help you said harrys attention was suddenly riveted to the phone darcy are you trying to tell me that what the other didnt understand him at first but then he did no no christ no its not the work of a vampire harry but some kind of monster certainly oh human enough but a monster too harry relaxed a little but a very little hed been expecting a call from ebranch sooner or later this could be it some sort of clever trap except darcy had always been his friend harry didnt think he would act on something not even something like that without checking it out every which way first and even then harry couldnt see darcy coming after him with a crossbow and hardwood bolt a machete a can of petrol no hed have to talk to him first get harrys side of it but in the end the head of the branch knew almost as much about vampires as harry did now and hed know too that there was no hope theyd been friends fighting on the same side so harry guessed it wouldnt be darcys finger on the trigger but someones certainly harry clarke was anxious are you still there where are you darcy harry inquired the military police duties room in the castle the other answered at once they found her body under the walls just a kid harry eighteen or nineteen they dont even know who she is yet that alone would be a big help but to know who did it would be the biggest bonus of all if there was one man harry keogh could trust it had to be darcy clarke give me fifteen minutes he said and ill be there clarke sighed thanks harry wed appreciate it we harry snapped he couldnt keep the suspicion out of his voice eh clarke sounded startled taken aback why the police and me murder the police not a branch job at all so what was clarke doing on it if it was real how did you get roped in and suddenly the other was caught on the hop cagey anyway i i was up here on a duty run visiting an old scottish auntie something i do once in a blue moon shes been on her last legs for ten years now but wont lie down keeps on tottering around i was scheduled to go back down to hq today but then this came up its something the branch has been trying to help the police with a set of god gruesome serial murders harry an old scottish auntie it was the first time harry had heard of darcys old auntie on the other hand this had to be a good opportunity to find out if they knew anything about about his problem harry knew he would have to be careful he knew too much about ebranch just to go walking right into something yes and they knew too much about him but maybe they didnt know everything not yet anyway harry clarkes voice came back again tinny and a little distorted probably the wires swaying in the winds that invariably blew around the castles high walls where will i see you on the esplanade at the top of the royal mile the necroscope growled and darcy yes nothing well talk later he replaced the telephone in its cradle and went back to his breakfast in the kitchen an inchthick steak raw and bloody to look at darcy clarke was possibly the worlds most nondescript man nature had made up for this physical anonymity however by giving him an almost unique talent clarke was a deflector he was the opposite of accidentprone only let him get close to danger and something some parapsychological guardian angel would intervene on his behalf which meant that if all of clarkes similarly esptalented team of psychics were photographs hed be the only negative he had no control over the thing he was aware of it only on those occasions when he stared deliberately in the face of danger the talents of the others telepathy scrying foretelling oneiromancy liedetecting were more pliable obedient applicable but not clarkes it just did its own thing which was to look after him it had no other use but because it ensured his longevity it made him the right man for the job the anomaly was this that he himself didnt quite believe in it until he felt it working he still switched off the current before hed even change a lightbulb but maybe that was just another example of the thing at work to look at him then no one would suppose that clarke could ever be the boss of anything let alone head of the most secret branch of the british secret services middleheight mousyhaired with something of a slight stoop and a small paunch and middleaged to boot he was middling in just about every way he had sort of neutralhazel eyes in a face not much given to laughter and an intense mouth which you might remember if you remembered nothing else but other than that there was a general facelessness about him which made him instantly forgettable the rest of him including the way he dressed was medium these were harry keoghs perfectly mundane thoughts in the few seconds which ticked by after he stepped out of the metaphysical möbius continuum on to the esplanade of edinburgh castle and saw darcy clarke standing there with his back to him hands thrust deep in the pockets of his overcoat reading the legend on a brass plaque above a seventeenthcentury drinking trough the iron fountain depicting two heads one ugly and the other beatific stood near the site on which many witches were burned at the stake the wicked head and serene head signify that some used exceptional knowledge for evil purposes while others were misunderstood and wished their kind nothing but good the bright may day would be warm but for the gusting wind the esplanade was almost empty two dozen or so tourists stood in small groups at the higher end of the broad walled tarmac plateau looking down across the walls at the city or taking photographs of the great grey fortress the castle on the rock behind its facade of battlements and courtyards harry had arrived in the moment after clarke vainly scanning the esplanade for some sign of him had turned to the plaque a moment ago clarke had been alone with his thoughts and no living person within fifty feet of him but now a soft voice behind him said fire is an indiscriminate destroyer good or evil everything burns when its hot enough clarkes heart jumped into his throat he gave a massive start and whirled about the colour rushing from his face and leaving him pale in a moment hahaharry he gasped god i didnt see you where did you spring but here he paused for of course he knew where harry had sprung from because the necroscope had taken him there once into that everywhere and when place that within and without which was the möbius continuum shaken heart hammering clarke clutched at the wall for support but it wasnt terror just shock his talent read no sinister purpose into keoghs presence harry smiled at him and nodded touched his arm briefly then looked at the plaque again and his smile at once turned sour mainly they were exorcizing their own fears he said for of course most if not all of these women were innocent indeed we should all be so innocent eh clarke hadnt quite recovered his balance yet wasnt focusing on keoghs meaning innocent he too looked at the plaque completely harry nodded again oh they may have been talented in their way but they were hardly evil witchcraft why today youd probably try to recruit them into ebranch suddenly truth flooded in on clarke and he knew he wasnt dreaming no need to pinch himself and start awake it was just this effect which harry always had on him three weeks ago in the greek islands was that all it had been three weeks it had been the same except at that time harry had been nearimpotent he hadnt had his deadspeak then hed got it back and set out on his double mission to destroy the vampire janos ferenczy and regain his mastery of clarke snatched a breath you got it back he grabbed harrys arm the möbius continuum you didnt get in touch with me harry accused albeit quietly or youd have known i got your letter clarke quickly defended himself and i tried a dozen times to get you on the phone but if you were home you werent answering our locators couldnt find you he threw up his hands give me a chance harry ive only been back from the med a few days and a pile of stuff to catch up with back here too but wed finished the job in the islands and we supposed youd done the same at your end our espers were on it of course reports were coming in janoss place above halmagiu blown off the mountain like that it could only be you we knew youd somehow won but the möbius continuum too why thats wonderful im delighted for you harry wondered oh really but out loud he only said thanks how in hell did you do that clarke was still excited if it was all a sham he was good at it i mean wreck the castle that way if weve got it right it was devastating is that how janos died in the explosion slow down harry told him taking his arm we can talk while you take me to see this girl the others excitement quickly ebbed yes he nodded his tone subdued now and thats something else too you wont like it harry so whats new the necroscope seemed as calm resigned soulful sardonic as ever and though he tried not to show it clarke suspected he was wary too did you ever show me anything i did like but clarke had an answer to that one if everything was the way wed like it harry he said then wed all be out of work me id gladly retire tomorrow i keep threatening to but when i see something like like im going to show you then i know that someone has to do it as they started up the esplanade harry said now this is a castle his voice was more animated now but as for the castle ferenczy that was a heap long before i got started on it you asked how i did it he sighed then continued a long time ago toward the end of the bodescu affair i learned about an ammo and explosives dump in kolomyya and used stuff from there to blow up the chateau bronnitsy well since the easy way is often the best way i did it again i made two or three trips möbius trips and put enough plastic explosive into the foundations of janoss place to blow it to hell im not even going to guess what was in the guts of that place but im sure there was stuff there which even i didnt see and still dont want to you know darcy even a fingerend of semtex will blow bricks right out of a wall so you can imagine what a couple of hundredweight will do if there was anything there that we might call alive he shrugged and shook his head it wasnt when id finished while harry talked the head of ebranch studied him but not so intently that he would notice he seemed exactly the same man clarke had come to edinburgh to see just a month ago a visit which had ended for clarke in rhodes and the islands of the dodecanese and for harry in the mountains of transylvania he seemed the same but was he for the fact was darcy clarke knew someone who said he wasnt harry keogh was a composite he was two men the mind of one and the body of another the mind was keogh and the body was it had once been alec kyle and clarke had known kyle too in his time the strangest thing was this that as time progressed so the kyle face and form got to look more like the old harry whose body was dead but that was something which always made clarkes brain spin he skipped it put the metaphysical right out of his mind and studied the purely physical the necroscope was perhaps fortythree or fortyfour but looked five years younger but of course that was only the body the mind was five years younger again even thinking about someone like harry keogh was a weird business and again clarke forced himself to concentrate on the physical harrys eyes were honeybrown occasionally defensive and frequently puppysoulful or would be if one could see under those wedgesided sunglasses he was wearing in the shade of his broadbrimmed s hat if there was one thing in all the world clarke hated to see it had to be harry wearing those darklensed glasses and that hat anyone else no problem but not harry and not now especially the sunglasses they were something clarke had told himself to look out for for while it was a common enough thing to wear such in the greek islands in late april or early may it was quite another to see them in edinburgh at that time of year unless someone had weak eyes or different eyes grey streaks so evenly spaced as to seem deliberately designed or affected were plentiful in harrys russetbrown naturally wavy hair in a few years the grey could easily take over even now it lent him a certain erudition gave him the look of a scholar a scholar yes but in what fabulous subjects but in fact keogh hadnt been like that at all hadnt used to be what harry a black magician a warlock lord no just a necroscope a man who talked to dead people keoghs body had been wellfleshed maybe even a little overweight once with his height however that ought not to have mattered a great deal but it had mattered to harry after that business at the chateau bronnitsy his metempsychosis hed trained his new body down brought it to a peak of perfection or at least done what he could with it considering its age thats why it looked only thirtyseven or thirtyeight years old and inside harrys body and behind his face an innocent or someone who had used to be innocent he hadnt asked to be the way he was hadnt wanted to become ebranchs most powerful weapon and do the things hed done but hed been what he was and the rest had come as a matter of course and now was he still an innocent did he still have the soul of a child did he have any soul at all or did something else have him now the pair had passed under the archway of the military guardroom where several police officers had been interviewing a group of uniformed soldiers into the cobbled gantlet which was the approach alley to the castle proper all of the officers in the guardroom seemed aware that clarke was something big harry and he werent challenged suddenly the bulk of the castle loomed before them and now darcy said so i dont need to do any tidying up you left nothing undone right nothing harry told him what about janoss setup in the islands gone said the other with finality all of it all of them but i still have a few men out there just looking just to be on the safe side harrys face was pale and grim but he forced a strange sad smile thats right darcy he said always be on the safe side never take chances not with things like that there was something in his voice clarke looked at the necroscope out of the corner of his eye carefully unobtrusively examining him yet again as they entered the shade of a broad courtyard with gaunt buildings rising on three sides are you going to tell me how it was no harry shook his head later maybe and maybe not he turned and looked clarke straight in the eye one vampires pretty much like another hell what can i tell you about them that you dont already know you know how to kill them thats a fact clarke stared directly into the black enigmatic lenses of the others glasses youre the one who showed us how harry he said harry smiled his sad smile again and apparently casually but clarke suspected very deliberately reached up a hand and took off his glasses not for a moment turning his face away he folded the glasses and put them into his pocket and well he said clarkes jaw fell open as he backed off a stumbling pace barely managing to contain the sigh of relief which he felt welling inside caught off balance again he looked into the others perfectly normal unwavering brown eyes and said eh what well well where are we going harry answered with a shrug or are we already there clarke gathered his wits were there he said almost he led the way down stone steps and under an arch then through a heavy door into a stoneflagged corridor as they emerged into the corridor a military policeman came erect and saluted clarke didnt correct his error merely nodded led harry past him halfway along the corridor a middleaged man unmistakably a policeman for all that he wore civilian clothing guarded an ironbanded door of oak again clarkes nod and the plainclothes man swung the door open for him and stepped aside now were there harry preempted clarke causing him to close his mouth on those selfsame words unspoken harry keogh needed no one to tell him there was a dead person close by and with one more glance at the necroscope clarke ushered him inside the officer didnt follow them but closed the door quietly behind them the room was cool two walls were of natural stone a rocky outcrop of volcanic gneiss grew out of the stoneflagged floor in one corner and into the walls there this place had been built straight on to the rock a storeroom steel shelving was stacked on one side on the other beside the cold stone wall a surgical trolley with a body on it and a white rubber sheet covering the body the necroscope wasted no time the dead held no terrors for harry keogh if he had as many friends among the living then hed be the most loved man in the world he was the most loved man but the ones who loved him couldnt tell anyone about it except harry himself he went to the trolley drew back the rubber sheet from the face closed his eyes and rocked back on his heels she had been sweet and young and innocent yes another innocent and she had been tormented and she still was her eyes were closed now but harry knew that if they were open hed read terror in them he could feel those dead eyes burning through the pale lids that covered them crying out to him in their horror she would need comforting the teeming dead the great majority would have tried but they didnt always get it right their voices were often mournful ghostly frightening to anyone who didnt know them in the darkness of death they could seem like night visitants nightmares like wailing banshees come to steal a soul she might think she was dreaming might even suspect that she was dying but not that she was already dead that took time to sink in and the freshly dead were usually the last to know that was because they were the least able to accept it especially the very young whose young minds had not yet properly considered it but on the other hand if she had actually seen death coming if she had read it in the eyes of her destroyer felt the numbing blow or the hands on her throat closing off the air or the cutting edge of the instrument of her destruction slicing into her flesh then she would know and shed be cold and afraid and tearful tearful yes for no one knew better than harry how the dead could cry he hesitated wasnt sure how best to approach her not even sure if he should approach her not now for harry knew that shed been pure and that he was impure true her flesh was heading for corruption even now but theres corruption and theres corruption angrily he thrust the thought aside no he wasnt a defiler not yet he was a friend he was the only friend he was the necroscope be that as it may when he put his hand on her claycold brow she recoiled as from a serpent not physically for she was dead but her mind cringed shrank down withdrew into itself like the feathery fronds of some strange sea anemone brushed by a swimmer harry felt his blood turn to ice and for a moment stood in horror of himself the last thing hed wanted was to frighten her still more he wrapped her in his thoughts in what had once been the warmth of his deadspeak its all right dont be afraid i wont hurt you no one can ever hurt you again it was as easy as that without even trying hed told her that she was dead but in the next moment he knew that she had already known keep off her deadspeak was a sobbing shriek of torment in harrys mind get away from me you filthy thing as if someone had touched him with naked electric wires harry jerked where he stood beside her jerked and shuddered as he relived with her the girls last moments her last living breathing moments but not the last things she had known for in certain mercifully rare circumstances and at the command of certain monstrous men even dead flesh can be made to feel again in a nightmarishly subliminal sequence a series of flickering kaleidoscopic vividly ghastly pictures flashed on the screen of the necroscopes metaphysical mind and then were gone but afterimages remained and harry knew that these wouldnt go away so easily indeed that they would probably remain for a long time he knew it as surely as he now knew what he was dealing with because hed dealt with such a thing before that ones name had been dragosani this one this poor girls murderer had been like that like dragosani a necromancer but in one especially hideous respect hed been still worse than that for not even dragosani had raped his corpse victims but its over now he told the girl he cant come back youre safe now he felt the shuddering of her thoughts receding replaced by the natural curiosity of her incorporeal mind she wanted to know him but for the moment felt afraid to know anything she wanted too to know her condition except that was probably the most frightening thing of all but in her own small way she was brave and she had to know for sure am i her deadspeak voice was no longer a shriek but a shivery tremor am i really yes you are harry nodded and knew that shed sense the movement even as all the teeming dead sensed his every mood and motion but he stumbled i mean it could be worse hed been through all of this before too often and it never got any easier how do you convince someone recently dead that it could be worse your body will rot and worms will devour it but your mind will go on oh you wont see anything it will always be dark and youll never touch or taste or smell anything again but it could be worse your parents and loved ones will cry over your grave and plant flowers there seeking to visualize in their blooms something of your face and form but you wont know theyre there or be able to speak to them and say here i am you wont be able to reassure them that it could be worse this was harrys expression of grief meant to be private but his thoughts were deadspeak she heard and felt them and knew him for a friend and youre the necroscope she said then they tried to tell me about you but i was afraid and wouldnt listen when they spoke to me i turned away i didnt want to to talk to dead people harry was crying great tears blurred his vision rolled down his pale slightly hollow cheeks splashed hot where they fell on his hand on her brow he hadnt wanted to cry didnt know he could but there was that in him which worked on his feelings and amplified them lifting them above the emotions of ordinary men safe so long as it worked on an emotion such as this one which was grief and entirely human darcy clarke had come forward he touched the necroscopes arm harry harry shook him off and his voice was choked but harsh too as he rasped leave us alone i want to talk to her in private clarke backed off his adams apple bobbing it was the look on harrys face which brought tears to his eyes too of course he said he turned and left the room and closed the door after him harry took a metalframed chair from beside the stacked shelving and sat by the dead girl he very carefully cradled her head in his arms i i can feel that she said wonderingly then you can feel too that im not like him harry answered out loud he preferred simply to talk to the dead for that way it came more naturally to him most of her terror had fled now the necroscope was a comfort he was warm a safe haven it might even be her father stroking her face except she wouldnt be able to feel him only harry keogh could touch the dead only harry and her terror welled up again but he was quick to sense it and fend it off its over and youre safe we wont i wont let anything hurt you again ever it was more than just a promise it was his vow in a little while her thoughts grew calm and she was easy or easier again but she was very bitter too when she said im dead but he that thing is alive its one of the reasons im here harry told her for you werent the only one there were others before you and unless we stop him therell be others after you so you see its very important that we get him for hes not just a murderer but also a necromancer which makes him more far worse than the sum of his parts a murderer destroys the living and a necromancer torments the dead but this one enjoys the terror of his victim both before and after they die i cant talk about what he did to me she said shuddering you dont have to harry shook his head right now im only interested in you im sure therell be people worrying about you until we know who you are we wont be able to put their minds at rest do you think their minds will ever be at rest harry it was a good question we dont have to tell them everything he answered i might be able to fix it so that they only know well that someone killed you they dont have to be told how can you do that if thats the way you want it he nodded then do it she offered a breathless sigh that was the worst harry thinking about them my folks how theyd take it but if you can make it easier for them i think im beginning to understand why the dead love you so my name is penny penny sanderson and i live lived at and so it went she told the necroscope all about herself and he remembered every smallest detail that was what darcy clarke had wanted but it wasnt everything hed wanted when finally penny sanderson was through harry knew he still had to take her that one step further penny listen he said now i dont want you to do or say anything dont try to talk to me at all but like i said before this is important about him penny when i first touched you and you thought it was him come back for more you remembered how it had been parts of it anyway you thought about it in brief flashes of memory that was deadspeak and i picked it up but it was all very chaotic kaleidoscopic but thats all there is she said thats how it was harry nodded ok thats fine but i need to see it again see the better i remember it the more chance i have of finding him so really you dont have to tell me anything not as a conscious act i just want to shoot a few words at you at which youll picture the bits i need do you understand word association something like that yes except of course that in this case the association will be hell for you but easier than just talking about it she understood harry sensed her willingness before she could change her mind he said knife a picture hit the screen of his mind like a mixture of blood and acid the blood incensed him and the acid burned etching the picture there for good this time harry reeled before her horror which was unbearable and if he hadnt been seated would have fallen the shock was that physical even though it lasted only a fraction of a second when she stopped sobbing he said are you ok no yes face harry fired at her face his face he tried again and a face red leering bloated with lust with an open salivating mouth and eyes insensate as frozen diamonds went skittering across the necroscopes minds eye but not so fast that he didnt catch it and this time she wasnt sobbing she wanted this to work wanted him brought to justice where a picture of a car park a motorway restaurant darkness pierced with points of light a string of cars and lorries speeding down three lanes with oncoming lights whose glare momentarily blinded and windscreen wipers swinging left right left right left but there was no pain in the last and harry guessed that wasnt where it had happened no it had been where it started to happen probably where she met him he picked you up in a car a rainblurred picture of an iceblue screen with white letters superimposed or printed there frid or frig the screen had many wheels and puffed exhaust smoke it was the way she remembered it a large vehicle a lorry articulated penny harry said i have to do this only this time i dont mean where you met him where ice bitter cold dark the whole place softly vibrating or throbbing and dead things everywhere hanging from hooks harry tried to fix it all in his mind but nothing was clear only her shock and disbelief that this was happening to her she was sobbing again terrified and harry knew that hed soon have to stop he couldnt bring himself to hurt her any more but at the same time he knew he mustnt weaken now death he snapped hating himself and it was the knife scene all over again and harry knew he was losing her could feel her withdrawing before that could happen and afterwards god he didnt want to know he didnt want to know penny sanderson screamed and screamed and screamed but the necroscope got his picture and wished he hadnt bothered upon their backs to bite em harry stayed with her for a further halfhour calming soothing doing what he could and in so doing managing to get a few more personal details out of her enough to give the police something to go on anyway but when it was time to go she wouldnt let him without his promise that hed see her again she hadnt been there long but already penny had discovered that death was a lonely place the necroscope was jaded or thought he was by life death everything he believed he needed motivation before leaving her he asked if shed mind if he looked at her she told him that if it were anyone else she couldnt care less because she wouldnt even know they were looking not any longer but with harry she would know because he was the necroscope she was just a shy kid hey he protested but gently im no voyeur it wasnt if he hadnt if i was unmarked then i dont think id mind she said penny youre lovely harry told her and me after alls said and done im only human but believe me im not putting you down when i tell you that right now im not interested in that side of things its because youre marked that i want to see you i need to feel angry and now that i know you i know that to see what he did would make me feel angry then ill just have to pretend youre my doctor she said harry very gently took the rubber sheet off her pale young body looked at her and tremblingly put the sheet back again is it bad she fought down a sob its such a shame mum always said i could be a model so you could he told her you were very beautiful but not now and though she kept from actually sobbing he could feel her despair brimming over but in a little while she said harry did it make you angry he felt a growl rising in his throat suppressed it and before he left her said oh yes yes it did darcy clarke was still outside the door with the plainclothes man looking washed out harry joined them and closed the door after him ive left the sheet off her face he said and then speaking specifically to and glaring at the officer dont cover her face the other raised an indifferent eyebrow and shrugged who me he said his accent nasal glaswegian less than sympathetic ah had nothing tae do wi it chief its just that when theyre dead uns people usually cover them up harry turned swiftly towards him eyes widening and nostrils flaring in his pale grimacing face and darcy clarkes instinct took over the necroscope was suddenly dangerous and clarkes weird talent knew it there was a terrible anger in him which he needed to take out on someone but clarke knew that it wasnt directed at him wasnt directed at anyone but simply required an outlet quickly forcing himself between harry and the specialduty officer he grabbed the necroscopes arms its ok harry he said urgently its ok its just that these people see things like this all the time it doesnt affect them so much they get used to it harry got a grip of himself but not without an effort of will he looked at clarke and growled they dont see things like that all the time no ones ever going to get used to the idea that someone something could do that to a girl and then seeing clarkes bewildered expression ill explain later he turned his gaze across clarkes shoulder and in a tone more nearly civil now more civilized asked the officer do you have a notebook mystified not knowing what was going on just trying to do his job the other said aye and groped in his pocket he scribbled quickly as harry fired pennys name address and family details at him following which and looking even more mystified youre sure about these details sir harry nodded just be sure to pass on what i said right i dont want anyone to cover her face over penny always hated having her face covered you knew the young lady then no said harry but i know her now they left the officer muttering into his walkietalkie and scratching his head and went up into the courtyard and the fresh air as they moved into sunlight harry put on his dark glasses and turned up the collar of his coat and clarke said to him you got something else right harry nodded but in the next moment never mind what i got what have you got do you have any idea what youre dealing with clarke threw up his hands only that hes a serial killer and that hes weird but you know what he does clarke nodded yes we know its sexual a sort of sex anyway a sick sort of sex sicker than you think harry shivered dragosanis kind of sickness that pulled clarke up short what a necromancer harry told him a murderer and a necromancer and in a way worse than dragosani because this ones a necrophiliac too clarke somehow succeeded in grimacing and looking blank at the same time then refresh my mind he said i know i should be getting something but im not harry thought about it for a few moments before answering but in the end there was no way to tell it other than the way it was dragosani tore open the bodies of dead men for information he finally said that was his talent just like you have yours and i have mine necromancy it was his job when he worked for gregor borowitz and soviet ebranch at the chateau bronnitsy to examine the corpses of his countrys enemies he could read their passions in the mucus of their eyes tear the truths of their lives right out of their steaming tripes tune in on the whispering of their stiffening brains and sniff their smallest secrets in the gases of their swollen guts clarke held up a hand in protest christ harry i know all that the necroscope nodded but you dont know what its like to be dead and thats why youre not getting it its because you cant imagine what im talking about you know what i do and accept it because you know it for a fact but deep inside yourself you still think its just too way out to think about so you dont and i dont blame you now listen i know i always protested i was different from dragosani but in certain ways he and i were alike even now i dont like admitting it but its true i mean you know what the bastard did to keenan gormley the mess he made of him but only i know what gormley thought about it and now clarke got it he snatched air in a great gasp and felt the short hairs stiffen at the back of his neck as an irrepressible shudder wracked his body and jesus youre right he breathed i just dont think about it because i dont want to think about it but in fact keenan knew he felt everything dragosani did to him right harry was relentless torture is the necromancers principal tool the dead feel the necromancer working on them just like they hear me talking to them except unlike the living theres nothing they can do about it not even scream not and be heard anyway and penny sanderson clarke went pale in a moment she could feel everything harry growled and that bastard whoever he is knew it so you see while rape is one thing and bad enough when its done to the living and while necrophilia is something else an outrage carried out upon the unfeeling dead what he does hits new lows he tortures his victims alive then tortures them dead and he knows while hes doing it that they can feel it he uses a knife with a curved blade like a tool for scooping earth when youre planting bulbs its razorsharp and and he doesnt use it for scooping earth it had been clarkes intention to stop at the guardroom and speak to the policemen there but now pale as a ghost he reeled to the castles low wall clutching its masonry for support he gulped at the gusting air and fought down the bile he felt rising from the churning of his guts and jesus jesus he choked for he could see it all now and there was nothing he could do to cleanse the picture from his minds eye weird sex god what an understatement harry had followed clarke to the wall the head of ebranch looked at him sideways from a watery eye he he digs holes in those poor kids then makes love to the holes love the necroscope hissed his flesh ruts in blood like a pigs snout ruts in soil darcy except the soil cant feel didnt the police tell you where he leaves his semen clarkes eyes were swimming and his brow feverish but he felt his nausea being replaced by a cold loathing almost as strong as the necroscopes own no the police hadnt told him that but now he knew he looked out over the blurred city and asked how do you know he knows they feel it because he talks to them while hes doing it harry told him mercilessly and when they cry out in their agony and beg him to stop he hears them and he laughs clarke thought christ i shouldnt have asked and you you bastard harry keogh you shouldnt have told me with fury in his eyes he turned to face the necroscope and faced thin air a wind blew up the esplanade and tourists leaned into it balancing themselves overhead seagulls cried where they spiralled on a rising thermal but harry was no longer there later with clarkes help harry fixed it that penny sanderson would be cremated her parents wanted it and it wouldnt hurt them that it was all a show they wouldnt know it anyway that penny was already ashes when their tears fell on her empty box before it slid away from them behind swishing curtains and became wood smoke clarke hadnt wanted to do it but he owed harry for a good many things and he wanted very badly to catch the maniac who had done this thing to penny and too many other innocents harry had told him if i have her ashes her pure ashes not damaged or spoiled by burned linen or charcoal then ill be able to talk to her any time i want to and maybe shell remember something important it had seemed logical at the time if anything about the necroscope could ever seem logical and so clarke had pulled strings as the head of ebranch he had that sort of power but if hed known the whole story of what had happened at the castle of janos ferenczy in transylvania maybe he would have thought twice about it and then not done it at all he certainly wouldnt have gone along with it if zek föener had stood firm on her first accusation or if not an accusation a premonition at least zek was a telepath and as loyal to the necroscope as they came in the greek islands at the end of the ferenczy business shed had occasion to try and contact harry with her mind during the course of which something had shocked her rigid but it had been a while before she could tell clarke what it was they had been on the island of rhodes at the time less than a month ago and their conversation was still fresh in his mind what is it zek hed said to her when he could talk to her in private i saw that change come over your face when you contacted harry is he in some sort of trouble no yes i dont know shed answered fear and frustration audible in her every word visible in her every move then shed looked at him and it was that same strange disbelieving look hed seen when she tried to contact harry as if she gazed on alien things in a distant world beyond the times and places we know and he remembered that indeed she had once been in just such a world with harry keogh a world of vampires zek hed said then if theres something i should know about harry its only fair that only fair to who she had cut him off to whom to what and is it fair to him at which clarke had felt an icy chill in his blood and i think youd better explain hed said i cant explain shed snapped at him or maybe i can and then the empty expression in her beautiful eyes had filled itself in a little and her tone had become more reasonable even pleading its just that every other mind ive touched in the last few days has seemed to be one of them so maybe ive started to find them where where there arent any where they cant possibly be and then hed known for certain what she was trying to tell him you mean that when you contacted harry you sensed yes yes shed snapped again but i could be mistaken i mean isnt that what hes doing at this very moment going up against them hes close to vampires right now even as we talk it could be one of them i sensed god it has to be one of them end of conversation but it hadnt been out of clarkes mind from that day to this when it was time to leave the islands and come home again he had asked zek if shed like to visit england as a guest of ebranch her answer had been more or less what he expected youre not fooling anyone darcy and anyway i dont like the idea that you would want to fool me not after all of this so ill tell you straight out i detest the ebranches whether theyre russian british whoever they belong to no not the espers themselves but the way theyre used the fact that they need to be used at all as for harry i wont go against the necroscope and shed given her head a very definite shake we were on different sides once before harry and me and he gave me some good advice never again go up against me or mine he said and i never will ive seen inside his mind darcy and i know that when someone like harry says something like that to you youd better listen to him so if there are problems well theyre your problems not mine it had been the kind of answer to make him worry all the more back in london after the greek expedition at ebranch hq a mass of work had built up during the first few days back at his desk clarke had cleared or at least begun to clear quite a lot of it and had also managed to clear his mind of much of the horror of the ferenczy job but nightmares kept him awake most nights one in particular was very bad and very persistent this was the essence of it they clarke zek jazz simmons ben trask manolis papastamos most of the greek team with the important exception of harry keogh were in a boat that lolled gently on an absolutely flat ocean it was so blue that sea that it could only be the aegean a small stark sloping island of rock floating on the blue made a goldrimmed black silhouette against the blinding refraction of a halfsun where it prepared to dip down beyond the slanting rock of the island into a shortlived twilight the serenity of the scene was immaculately structured vivid real with nothing in it to hint that it was prelude to nightmare but since the thing was recurrent indeed a nightly event clarke always knew what was coming and where to look for the start of it he would look at zek gorgeous in a swimsuit that left little to the imagination stretched out along a narrow sunbathing platform attached to the upper strakes at the stern she lay on her stomach her face turned sideways with one hand dangling in the water and the sea so calm that her fingers made ripples but then she glanced sharply at her hand in the water snatched it out and stared at it gave a cry of disgust and tumbled herself inboard her hand was red bleeding no not bleeding but bloody as if it had been dipped in someone elses blood by which time the entire crew had seen that the sea itself was sullied by a great crimson swath an elongated splotch like an oilslick a bloodslick which had drifted to surround the boat with its thick red ribbons but drifted from where they looked out across the sea followed the swath to its source previously unnoticed the warty barnacled prow of a sunken vessel stuck up in grotesque salute from the water only fifty yards away its figurehead was a hideous but recognizable face mouth gaping hugely disproportionate fangs jutting and blood spewing in an unending torrent from the silently shrieking mouth and the vessels name as she gurgled down out of sight into her own blood clarke didnt need to read all of those black letters daubed on her scabby hull as they disappeared in reverse order one by one into the crimson ocean o r c e n no for he already knew that this was the plagueship necroscope out of edinburgh contaminated in strange ports of call and doomed for ever to oceans of gore or until like now she sank aghast he watched her go down then jumped to his feet as papastamos cursed and leaped to snatch up a speargun the swath of blood beside the boat was bubbling fuming as some nameless thing drifted to the surface a body naked facedown floated up and lolled like some weird jellyfish dangling its tentacle arms and legs and feeble as a jellyfish it tried to swim then papastamos was at the side of the boat aiming his gun and clarke was starting forward screaming no but too late the steel spear hissed through the air and thwacked into the lone survivors back and he jerked in the water and rolled over and his face was the face on the figurehead and his scarlet eyes glared and his scarlet mouth belched blood as he sank down out of sight for the last time which was when clarke would start awake he started now as his telephone chirruped then sighed his relief that his morbid chain of thoughts had been broken he let the telephone chirp away to itself for a few moments and considered his nightmare in the light of cold logic clarke was no oneiromancer but the dreams interpretation seemed simple enough zek to her own dismay had pointed the finger of suspicion at harry as for the aegean backdrop and the blood these were hardly inappropriate in the circumstances and considering the occurrences of the recent past and the dreams conclusion papastamos had put an end to the horror but that wasnt significant hadnt been the point of it it didnt have to be papastamos but could have been any one of them except clarke himself that had been the point of it that darcy clarke himself hadnt done it and didnt want it to happen in fact he had tried to stop it just like right now he was less than eager to start anything the telephone was starting its fifth ring when he reached for it but the relief hed felt at the first chirrup was shortlived his nightmare was right there on the other end of the wire darcy the necroscopes voice was calm collected about as detached as clarke had ever heard it harry clarke pressed a button on his desk ensuring the conversation would be recorded and another which alerted the switchboard to start a trace id thought i might have heard from you before now oh why harry asked good questions and this one stopped clarke dead for after all ebranch didnt own harry keogh why he thought quickly because of your interest in the serial killer case i mean its been ten days since we met in edinburgh weve spoken only once since then i suppose id been hoping youd come up with something pretty quick and your people harry returned your espers have they come up with anything your telepaths and hunchmen spotters precogs and locators have the police come up with anything no they havent because if they had you wouldnt be asking me hey im only one man darcy and you have a whole gang clarke decided to play the other at his own circuitous game ok so tell me to what do i owe the pleasure harry i cant believe its a social call the necroscopes chuckle normal however dry brought a little more relief with it you make a good sparring partner he said except you cry uncle too quick and before clarke could counter he went on i need some information darcy thats why im calling who am i talking to clarke wondered what am i talking to god if only i could be sure it was you harry i mean all you just you but i cant be sure and if its not all you then sooner or later it will be my job to do something about it which of course was what his nightmare was all about but out loud he only said information how can i help you two things harry told him the first ones a big one details of the other murdered girls oh i know i could get them for myself i have friends in the right places right but this time id prefer not to put the teeming dead to the trouble oh clarke was curious suddenly harry sounded cagey put the great majority to the trouble but the dead would do anything for the necroscope even rise from their graves weve asked enough of the dead harry tried to explain himself almost as if hed read clarkes mind now its time we did them a few favours still puzzled clarke said give me half an hour and ill duplicate everything we have for you i can mail it or but no that would be silly you can simply pick it up yourself right here again harrys chuckle you mean via the möbius continuum what and set off all those alarms again he stopped chuckling no mail it he said you know im not struck on that place of yours you espers give me the shivers clarke laughed out loud it was forced laughter but he hoped the other wouldnt notice and whats the other thing i can do for you harry thats easy said the necroscope you can tell me about paxton it was delivered like a bolt out of the blue and quite deliberately pax the smile slid from clarkes face was replaced by a frown paxton what about paxton he didnt know anything about him only that hed done a few months probation as an esper a telepath and that the minister responsible had found cause to reject him something about a couple of small kinks in his past record apparently yes paxton harry said again geoffrey paxton hes one of yours isnt he there was an edge to his voice now an almost mechanical precision which was cold and controlled like a computer waiting for some vital item of information before it could begin its calculations was clarke finally answered was going to be one of ours yes but it seems he had a couple of black marks against him and so missed the boat how do you know about him anyway or more to the point what do you know about him darcy the edge on harrys voice had sharpened it wasnt menacing there was no threat in it no way but still clarke could sense its warning weve been friends of sorts for a long time ive stuck my neck out for you youve stuck yours out for me id hate to think you were shafting me now shafting you clarkes answer was instinctive natural even mildly affronted with every right for he wasnt hiding anything or shafting anyone i dont even know what youre talking about its like i said geoffrey paxton is a middling telepath but developing rapidly or he was then we lost him our minister found something he didnt like and paxton was out without us he wont ever be able to develop to his full potential well give him the onceover now and then just to make sure hes not using what he has to take too much of an advantage on society but apart from that but hes already taking advantage the necroscope plainly angry now cut in or trying to and of me hes on my back darcy and he sticks like glue he tries to get into my mind but so far ive kept him out only that takes effort gets tiring and im getting pissed off exerting so much effort on something like this on some sneaking little bastard whos doing someone elses dirty work for a moment clarkes mind was full of confusion but he knew that to hesitate would only make him look suspect what do you want me to do he said find out whos running him of course harry snapped and why ill do what i can do better than that harry came back like a shot or ill have to do it myself why havent you already clarke wondered are you afraid of paxton harry and if so why ive told you he isnt one of mine he said out loud now thats the truth so you cant threaten me through him but like i said ill do what i can there was a pause then and youll get the details of those girls to me thats a promise ok the necroscopes voice had slackened a little lost some of its tension i i didnt mean to come on so strong darcy clarkes heart at once went out to him harry i think youve a lot on your mind maybe we can speak sometime in person i mean what im saying is dont be afraid to come to me afraid it had been the wrong word apprehensive then i mean dont worry that there might be something you cant tell me or we cant talk about there isnt anything you cant tell me harry again that long perhaps indicative pause then but right now i dont have anything to tell you darcy however ill get back to you if i ever do is that a promise yes thats a promise too and darcy thanks clarke sat and thought about it for long minutes and while he sat there behind his desk drumming his fingers in a continuous monotonous tattoo so he became aware of the first small warning bells growing to an insistent clamour at the back of his mind harry keogh had required him to find out who was running paxton but who could be running him if not ebranch and to what end the last man to occupy this desk had been norman harold wellesley a traitor wellesley was gone now dead but the fact that hed ever existed at all and in this of all jobs must have caused ructions further up the line what a doubleagent a spy among mindspies something which must never be allowed to happen again obviously but how to stop it from happening again could it be that someone had been appointed to watch the watchers it reminded clarke of a ditty his mother had used to say to him when he was small and had an itch she would find the spot and scratch it reciting big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite em and little fleas have smaller fleas and so ad infinitum was clarke himself under esper scrutiny and if so what had been read from his mind he got on to the switchboard said get me the minister responsible if hes not available leave a message that hes to call me back soonest also id like someone to run me off a duplicate set of police reports on those girls in that serial killer case half an hour later the reports were delivered to him and as he was putting them in a large envelope he got his call from the minister yes clarke sir he said i just had harry keogh on the phone oh he asked for a set of reports on the girls in the serial killer case as youll recall we asked for his help on that i recall that you asked for his help clarke yes but in fact im not so sure it was a good idea indeed i think its time to rethink our attitude towards keogh oh yes i know hes been of some assistance to the branch and some clarke had to cut in some assistance wed have all been goners long ago without him we cant ever repay him not just us but everyone and i do mean everyone things change clarke said that unseen unknown other you people are a weird lot no offence and keogh has to be the weirdest of all also hes not really one of you so as of now i want you to avoid contact with him but well talk about him again later im sure the warning bells rang even louder talking to the minister responsible was always like talking to a very smooth robot but this time he was just too smooth and the police reports does he get them i think not lets just keep him at arms length for the moment right is there something to worry about maybe clarke came straight out with it do you think perhaps we should watch him why you surprise me said the other smooth as ever it was my understanding that keogh had always been a good friend of yours he has well and doubtless that was of value at the time but as i said things change i will get back to you about him one way or the other in good time but until then was there anything else one small thing clarke kept his tone neutral but scowled at the phone about paxtonit was a leaf straight out of harry keoghs book and it worked just as well for clarke paxton he actually heard the minister catch his breath then more cautiously perhaps curiously paxton but were no longer interested in him are we its just that i was reading through his records clarke lied his progress reports you know and it seemed to me we lost a good one there is it possible youve been maybe a bit too thorough a shame to lose him if theres a chance we can bring him on we really cant afford to waste talents like his clarke the minister sighed you have your side of the job and i have mine i dont question your decisions do i dont you and i really would appreciate it if you wouldnt question mine forget about paxton hes out of it as you wish but i think ill at least keep an eye on him if only from a distance after all were not the only ones in the mindspy game id hate it if he were recruited by the other side the minister was getting peeved for the moment you have quite enough work on your plate he snapped leave paxton be a periodic check will suffice when i say so clarke was only polite when people were polite to him he was far too important to let himself be stepped on keep your shirt on sir he growled anything i say or do is in the branchs best interest believe me even when i step on toes of course of course the other was at once conciliatory but were all in the same boat clarke and none of us knows everything so for the time being lets just trust each other all right oh yeah lets sure fine clarke said im sorry ive taken up so much of your time thats all right well be speaking again soon im sure clarke put the phone down and continued to scowl at it a while then sealed the envelope containing the police reports and scrawled harry keoghs address on it he erased his and keoghs recent conversation then asked the switchboard if theyd traced the call they had and it was harrys edinburgh number he phoned it direct but got no answer and finally he called a courier into his office and gave him the envelope post it please he said but before the courier could leave no repackage the whole thing and send it off special delivery and then forget you ever saw it right in a little while he was alone with his dark suspicious thoughts again and an itch between his shoulderblades which he couldnt quite get at and his mothers ditty about fleas which was equally persistent changeling harry keogh necroscope didnt know darcy clarkes ditty but he did have a flea on his back several in fact and they were biting him geoffrey paxton was only one and probably the least of them but because he was reachable and immediate he was the most frightening harry wasnt frightened of paxton rather of what he might do to paxton if he lost control and of what losing control might conceivably do to him to the necroscope himself he knew how easy it would be to betray himself and reveal that he was no longer an innocent but that some great and as yet undeveloped but developing certainly darkness had entered him that was what paxton was looking for harry knew proof that the necroscope was no longer a fit citizen or habitant of earth no longer indeed a man not entirely but an alien creature and a monstrous threat and when he knew it for sure when there was no longer any doubt then paxton would report that fact and there would be war harry keogh versus the rest the rest of mankind and that was the last thing harry wanted to be at odds with a world and its peoples which he had fought so long and so hard to keep safe paxton then was a flea on harrys back a niggle at the edge of attempting to dig its way deeper into his mind an irritation and because paxtons presence was representative of an even greater threat which must ultimately challenge the necroscopes very existence it was something harry could well do without for to the wamphyri the single honourable answer to any challenge may only be written in blood wamphryri the word itself was a power it was a tingling in the core of his being an awareness of passions beyond the feeble fumbling emotions of men a savage explosive nuclear energy contained but barely in his seething blood it was a chainreaction which was happening to him even now whose catalyst was blood and in itself it too was a challenge but one which he must resist which he must not dare not answer not if he desired to remain ascendant and for the most part human a flea then this paxton an invader who would stick his proboscis in that most private and inviolable of all human territories the mind itself and siphon out its thoughts a spy a thoughtthief a parasite come to sup on harrys secrets a flea but only one flea of several and not one whose bites he could afford to scratch another unbearable itch was the fact that the dead the great majority of mankind who yet lay apart from and unknowable to mankind with the sole the soul exception of harry keogh were withdrawing from him he was losing his rapport the change in him had wrought a change in them their trust was weakening oh there were many among them who owed him beyond their means to repay and many more who had loved him for his own sake to whom the necroscope had always been the one glimmer of light in an otherwise everlasting darkness but even these were wary of him now for when he had been simply harry unsullied and unsullying innocent and gentle why then it had been a marvellous thing that he could touch the dead and they touch him but all of that was yesterday and now that he was more than harry there are certain things which even dead men fear and limits to what even they will lie still for since the destruction of janos ferenczy and his works harry had been busy other than the constant irritation of geoffrey paxton the only intrusion hed allowed the single distraction from his purpose because he had no control over it was the knowledge that a necromancer lived and practised his abominations in england it distracted him because penny sanderson was now his friend his ward even and because he was privy to what she and others like her had gone through of the fact that the forces of law and order would track down and apprehend pennys torturer murderer and then violator eventually harry had little doubt but they would never charge him with the full range of his offences because they had no yardstick by which to measure them they neither knew nor were capable of defining a full range of offences not in this case and certainly there was no punishment which would fit the crime not in law but the necroscope fully understood the nature of this beast and his crimes and his ideas of punishment were rather more stringent even before his contamination hed had that it was a flame which had been sparked in him by the murder of his own sweet mother and which burned just as lively to this day an eye for an eye as to what harry had been doing since removing the last of the ferenczys forever from the world of men his works had been weird and wonderful and the thoughts in his möbius mind even more so to begin with hed brought back trevor jordans ashes from rhodes the incorporeal telepath had wished it death might have some sort of meaning with harry to talk to but not even jordan had suspected harrys real purpose by themselves however the essential salts of a man were insufficient to put harrys plan into action not and achieve the entirely satisfactory result which he sought which was why before reducing further the ruins of janos ferenczys castle the necroscope had removed from them certain chemical substances by means of which janos had performed his own monstrous brand of necromancy not all of the dead would wish for such a resurgence harry knew the thracian warriorking bodrogk and his wife sofia whose world had lain two thousand years in the past had been happy to collapse in each others arms and return to dust a merciful release for them who had prayed for it so often but what of the much more recently dead like trevor jordan for instance the answer might seem easy why not ask him but in fact that was the hardest thing of all i intend to return you to life i have the apparatus but im not one hundred per cent sure of the system it worked perfectly well for another but he had the advantage of many hundreds of years of experimentation in the event all goes well you will be as you were except well youll recall that you did put a bullet through your brain im not entirely sure how that will affect you if when i call you up from your ashes i discover that youre a complete gibbering fucking idiot then however reluctantly ill be obliged to put you down again now provided youre perfectly happy with all of this or in penny sandersons case penny i think i can bring you back but if i get the mixture wrong it could be that youll not be as lovely as you were i mean your skin and features could be imperfect or blemished or pocked hideously for example some of the things i called up in the castle ferenczy were quite monstrous there were depletions inconsistencies er anomalies wherefore i reserve the right to erase you if things go wrong but of course well always be able to try again later when with a bit of luck ill get it right no he couldnt tell them what he had in mind not yet if he gave them the bare bones of the matter theyd require him to flesh it out and if he elaborated theyd fret about every smallest detail and from now until the actual resurrection theyd mix anticipation with dread alternating shivers of excitement with shudders of terror most extreme theyd climb high mountains of hope only to tumble back into black lakes of deepest despair and depression i have a shot which may cure your cancer but it just might give you aids that was how it would feel to harry if the roles were reversed but at the same time he knew that of course it wasnt like that when youre dead youre beyond hope and so any hope has to be better than none or does it or was that simply the vampire in him tenacity aspiring to immortality doing his thinking for him or perhaps he hesitated for another far more elemental reason something which warned him that with his small talents small yes in the scale of a universe or parallel multiverses he must not dare not usurp one of the greater talents of that other whom men called god historys necromancers among which janos had been a latecomer had dared it and where were they now had there been avenging angels before harry to put right the wrongs of these wizards and if so would there be one after him to chastise him in his turn harry had been the necroscope was becoming a vampire and now would be a necromancer in his own right how dare he seek out pennys murderer to punish him on the one hand and on the other pursue the practice of that same black art what would be his punishment perhaps the gears were already engaged the wheels even now turning perhaps the necroscope had already gone too far disturbing the delicate balance between good and evil to such an extent that it now required radical readjustment had he simply become too powerful which is to say corrupt how did the old saying go absolute power corrupts absolutely ridiculous was god himself corrupt no for the maxims of men are like their laws they apply only to men such arguments were endless in the metamorphosis of the necroscopes mind and body until sometimes he thought he was mad but when his thoughts were clear he knew that he was not mad it was just the thing that was in him altering his perceptions along with everything else and then he would remember how he used to be determine that he must always be that way and know that he hesitated only out of consideration for his friends among the dead it was simply that he didnt want trevor and penny to suffer agonies of protracted uncertainty only to let them down when the waiting was over to die once is enough as had been made perfectly plain by janoss many thracian thralls in the bowels of the castle ferenczy as for god if there was such a one and harry had never been sure then the necroscope supposed he must consider his talents godgiven and use them accordingly while he could harry had spent a good deal of his time arguing not least with himself if a subject took his fancy almost any subject he would play wordgames with himself to the point of distraction and delirium a sort of mental masturbation but it wasnt just himself he was jerking off in conversations with the dead he was equally argumentative even when he suspected that they were right and he was wrong indeed he seemed to argue for the sake of it out of sheer contrariness he thought and argued about god also about good and evil about science pseudoscience and sorcery their similarities discrepancies and ambiguities space time and spacetime fascinated him and especially mathematics with its inalienable laws and pure logic the very changelessness of maths was a constant joy and relief to the necroscopes changeling mind in its changeling body within a day or two of returning from the greek islands he had used the instantaneous medium of the möbius continuum to go to leipzig and see speak to august ferdinand möbius where he lay in his grave möbius had been and still was a great mathematician and astronomer indeed he was the man whose genius had saved harrys life on several occasions again through the medium of his möbius continuum but while harrys primary purpose in visiting möbius was to thank him for the return of his numeracy instead he ended up arguing with him the great man had happened to mention that his next project would be to measure space and as soon as the necroscope heard this he threw himself headlong into an argument this time the argument was space time light and the multiverses wont universe suffice möbius had wanted to know not at all harry had answered because we know there are parallels ive visited one remember and east german students with their notebooks had wondered at this peculiar man who stood by a dead scientists tomb muttering to himself very well then lets concentrate on the one we know best möbius had been logical about it this one youll measure it i propose to but since its constantly expanding how will you go about it i shall stand at its outermost rim beyond which there is nothing transfer myself instantaneously through the universe to the far rim beyond which there is likewise nothing and in so doing measure the distance between then i shall transfer myself instantaneously back here and perform the same experiment exactly one hour later and again an hour after that good harry had answered but to what purpose a sigh why from that time forward and whenever i require to know it a correct calculation of the size of the universe will be instantly available harry had stayed grudgingly silent for a moment until i too have given the matter a little thought he said though purely on the theoretical level because the physical measurement of a constantly changing quantity seems rather fruitless to me whereas to understand what is happening how and to what degree the age of the universe is tied to its rate of expansion a constant incidentally and so forth seems so much more satisfying an astonished pause oh indeed and harry had almost been able to see möbiuss eyebrows joining in a frown across the bridge of his nose you have thought about it have you theoretically you say and might i inquire as to your conclusions you want to know all about space time light and the multiverses if youve the time for it möbius had been scathing in his sarcasm to which the necroscope had answered your initial measurement will suffice no other is necessary knowing the size of the universe and not only this one incidentally but all the parallels too at any given moment of time we will automatically know their exact age and rate of expansion which will be uniform for all of them explain now the theory said harry in the beginning there was nothing came the primal light possibly it shone out of the möbius continuum or perhaps it came with the colossal fireball of the big bang but it was the beginning of the universe of light before the light there was nothing and after it there was a universe expanding at the speed of lightr eh do you disagree the universe was expanding at the speed of light actually at twice the speed of light said harry that was the essence of your problem remember which sparked the return of my numeracy switch on a light in space and a pair of observers miles away from it on opposite sides would both see its light one second later because the light expands in both directions now do you disagree of course not the primal light as any light must have expanded just as you say but the universe at the same speed said harry and it still is expanding at that speed explain and make it good before the light there was nothing no universe agreed does anything travel faster than light no yes we can but only in the möbius continuum and i suppose thought is likewise instantaneous now think said harry the primal light is still travelling outwards expanding on all frontiers at a constant speed of miles per second tell me does anything lie beyond those frontiers and i do mean any thing of course not because in the physical universe nothing travels faster than light exactly wherefore light defines the extent the size of the universe thats why i called it the universe of light a formula au ru c do you disagree möbius had looked at the thing scrawled on the screen of harrys mind the age of the universe is equal to its radius divided by the speed of light and after a moment but very quietly now yes i agree hah said harry its hard to get a decent argument going these days everyone cries uncle möbius had been angry he had never seen harry like this before certainly the necroscopes instinctive maths was a wonderful thing an awesome talent in its own right but where was harrys humility what on earth had got into him perhaps möbius should let him continue to expound and then try to pick holes bring him down a peg or two and time and the multiverses but harry had been ready for him the spacetime universe which has the same size and age as any and all of the parallels is coneshaped the point of the cone being the big bangprimal light where time began and the base being its current boundary or diameter is that feasible logical desperately seeking errors still möbius had been unable to discover them yes he was obliged to answer eventually feasible logical but not necessarily correct grant me feasible said harry and then tell me what lies outside the cone nothing since the universe is contained within it wrong the parallels are coneshaped too born at the same time and expanding from the same source möbius had pictured it but then each cone is in contact with a number of other cones is there evidence of this black holes said harry at once which juggle with matter and so perform a necessary balancing act they suck matter out of universes which are too heavy into universes which are too light white holes are of course the other ends of the black holes in spacetime such holes are the lines of contact between cones but in space they are simply a shrug holes möbius was tired but cones are circular in crosssection hed argued put three together and you get a triangular shape between them and harry had nodded his agreement grey holes theres one at the bottom of the perchorsk ravine and another up an underground river in romania and so hed made his point and won his argument if there had been one to win in the first place for the fact was hed only argued for the sake of it and neither knew nor cared if he was right or wrong but möbius had cared because he didnt know if harry was right or wrong either another time the necroscope had talked to pythagoras again his principal reason for going to see him was to convey his thanks the great greek mystic and mathematician had been of some assistance in his quest for numeracy but again the visit had ended in argument harry had thought to find the greeks grave at metapontum or if not there then at crotona in southern italy but all he found was a follower or two until by pure chance he stumbled upon the forgotten yearold tomb of a member of the pythagorean brotherhood on the island of chios there was no marker it was a stony ochre place where goats ate thistles not fifty yards from a rocky shore looking north on the aegean pythagoras no not here that one informed in a hushed and very secretive manner when harrys deadspeak broke into his centuried thoughts he is elsewhere waiting out his time his time until his metempsychosis into a living breathing man but do you converse are you able to contact him he will occasionally contact us when a thought has occurred to him us the brotherhood but i have said too much begone leave me in peace as you wish harry had told him but he wont thank you that you turned away the necroscope what the necroscope astonishment and awe you are that one who taught the dead to speak out in their graves so enabling them to talk to one another as in life the same and do you seek to learn from pythagoras i seek to instruct him that is a blasphemy blasphemy harry had raised an eyebrow and is pythagoras a god then if so a painfully slow one consider this i have already achieved my metempsychosis even now i embark upon a second phase a new condition your soul is in process of migration i may say that a change is in the offing certainly and after a while if i speak to our master pythagoras on your behalf and if you have lied to me be sure he willdamn you with numbers aye and possibly me with you no i dare not first prove yourself perhaps i can show you some numbers harry had contained his impatience as best he could as a member of the brotherhood im sure you will appreciate their importance do you seek to seduce me with your puny figures what the work of a mere lifetime are you suggesting that in the two thousand years and more which have passed since i was lain to rest here ive dreamed no numbers or equations or formulae of my own necroscope or none you are presumptuous presumptuous harrys anger had been aroused equations formulae why i have formulae such as you could never dream and hed displayed the computer screen of his mind and covered it with the endlessly mutating algebraics of möbius mathematics then hed formed a möbius door and let the other gaze a moment upon the nowhere and everywhere across the threshold until gaspingly what what is that the big zero harry had growled then letting the door close on itself the place where all numbers begin but im wasting my time i came to talk to a master and ended up chatting with a mere student and a middling one at that now tell me do i get my audience with pythagoras or dont i he he is in samos where he was born the same the last place anyone would think to look for him he thought and then frantically necroscope plead with him for me i have betrayed him he will exclude me rubbish harry had growled but without scorn exclude you he will elevate you for you have gazed upon the secret mathematical door to all times and places you dont believe me and hed shrugged well its your choice my thanks anyway and farewell and conjuring another möbius door hed stepped through it and out again on samos twenty miles away where pythagoras had spent his childhood two and a half millennia ago and to which his bones had been returned in secrecy when at last he died pythagoras however introvert secretive diffident could hardly escape or ignore the necroscopes deadspeak probe at such close range that thought in itself had been deadspeak and as such the recluse in death even more than in life had heard it and answered what is your number any you choose for me harry had shrugged homing in on the mystics mental whisper and when hed located him definitely one further möbius jump took him from a deserted wooded shoreline straight there to a small olive grove on a terraced hillside above a headland with a tiny white church down the coast a little way scarcely glimpsed through pines and windwarped oaks tiganis harbour glinted turquoise blue silver music from a taverna came drifting on the bright summer air it was cool in the shade of the trees and the necroscope had been grateful to take off his widebrimmed hat also the darklensed spectacles which protected his now delicate eyes and because pythagoras had remained silently thoughtful there are numbers galore im not fussy then you should be the mystics whisper was tremulous fevered they are the all the gods themselves are numbers though no man knows them when i have discovered the numbers of the gods then my metempsychosis may commence if you truly believe that then youve a long time to wait harry had answered at once you can know all the numbers in all their combinations from now to eternity and it wont change anything not for you it isnt a magical thing pythagoras however many numbers you employ your soul wont fly into a new body theres no science or sorcery can help you now hah the other was filled with wrath and not a little scorn only see who utters these blasphemies and is this the necroscope who was impotent and innumerate to whom the simplest sum was a mystery are you the one they pleaded for the legions of dust the teeming dead möbius came to me on his knees for you and what are you after all but an ingrate harry had been needled but hid it from the greek likewise he hid his thoughts pompous old fart while out loud i came to thank you for my numeracy without it id be like you dust in a grave or perhaps not like you for there was a man who would have called me up to torture me for my secrets a necromancer just so it is a black art not always it has its uses what i am doing now is a sort of necromancy after all for i am a living man talking to one who is dead pythagoras gave this a moments thought and i overheard your conversation with one of the brothers he said is blasphemy your byword you alleged reincarnation transmigration metempsychosis i stated a fact said harry i was one man in his own body and when it died i inhabited another dont take my word for it but ask the dead who have nothing to gain from lying theyll tell you its true moreover if your ashes were pure i tell you i could even call you up from the dead not with numbers but with words and this isnt blasphemy pythagoras but simple truth or perhaps the act itself would constitute blasphemy i cant be sure if so then youre right and i am a blasphemer and plan to be again you could call me up from my ashes only if they were pure unsullied were you buried in a jar i was buried in soil in secret here beneath your feet where as a boy i ran among the trees my flesh and bones are now one with the earth anyway i cannot believe you words and not numbers words are from the lips frivolous things which are spoken and change while numbers spring from pure mind and are immutable its academic after all harry had shrugged in two thousand years your salts have been washed into the soil there are no words and certainly no numbers which can help you now blasphemy and sedition do you seek to turn my followers against me harry could contain himself no longer pythagoras youre a charlatan in your world you guarded your small pointless mathematical secrets basic discoveries which any child under instruction knows today from his schoolbooks as if they were life and death and true death has not changed you i gave you deadspeak since when you could have conferred with more modern more genuine masters if youd wished it to galileo galilei isaac newton albert einstein to roemer maxwell and enough the other had been outraged i should have ignored möbius i should have but you couldnt ignore him harrys turn to cut in you dared not what do you mean that i know your real secret that you were a fraud that you not only made fools of your precious brotherhood in life but continue to deceive them in death there is no mysticism in numbers pythagoras and you must know it if only because youre a learned man why you yourself have told me that numbers are immutable unchanging and unchangeable which means that they are solid truth not flights of fancy iron truth not ethereal magic liar liar pythagoras had raged you twist words change meanings why do you hide yourself even from the dead because they have no understanding because their ignorance is contagious no because they know more than you your followers would desert you you told them they would migrate return again to men and meet with you in worlds of pure number and now you know that this was false i thought it was truth but that was two and a half thousand years ago and are you returned how long does it take to admit you were wrong i have dreamed numbers that would blast you blast me then by this time pythagoras had been sobbing he hurled a catalogue of numbers at harry which shattered against the wall of the necroscopes metaphysical mind but at least they shocked him into recognition of his predicament that again the thing inside was striving to replace him this time by use of convoluted wamphyri logic on this occasion it was his salvation for it had never been harrys desire to hurt or even alarm the dead and i im sorry he said sorry you are a fiend pythagoras had sobbed but you are right no i merely argued perhaps i am right perhaps not but i was wrong to argue for the sake of it and lets face it i stand in contradiction of my own argument how so i know that numbers are not immutable ahhh a long drawnout sigh would you could you demonstrate at which harry had shown him the screen of his mind with all of möbiuss configurations crawling on its surface mutating and sprawling into infinity and for a long time the old greek had been silent then i was a clever child who thought he knew everything he said his voice broken time has passed me by but it will never forget you harry had been quick to point out we remember your theorem books have been written about you there are pythagoreans even today my theorem my numbers if i hadnt done it others would have but its your name we remember and anyway that could be said of anyone and anything except the necroscope but im not even sure about that harry had answered i think that perhaps there were others before me and certainly there was one after me they dwell in other worlds now and will you dwell there too possibly probably and perhaps soon whats it like now pythagoras had asked after a while and harry had suspected it was the first thing hed inquired of anyone in a long time upon this island the necroscope had answered lie many of the more recently dead but youve shunned them you could have asked them about samos the world the living but you were afraid to know the truth and do you know the last thing of any importance to the living on this island is number well perhaps not entirely true im sure theyre interested in the quantities of drachmae to the pound to the deutschmark and the dollar he explained his meaning the world is so small now harry had put on his hat his glasses and gone out from the shade into sunlight with his hands in his pockets the latter didnt bother him too much but he must go slowly or lose his balance on the rough tracks and roads into tigani pythagoras had gone with him his deadspeak anyway distance wasnt too important once contact had been established ill open up the brotherhood dissolve it entirely put it aside theres so much to learn men have landed on the moon said harry pythagorass mind had flown in circles they have calculated the speed of light the old mystics thoughts were one huge astonished question mark but you know among the dead are those mathematicians who could benefit greatly from your knowledge what mine i am an infant not a bit of it you stuck to pure number why in two thousand and more years by now youre a lightning calculator may i test you by all means but please a simple thing not the dizzy designs inscribed upon your secret mind then give me the sum of all the numbers between one and one hundred inclusive five thousand and fifty pythagorass answer had been instantaneous a lightning calculator harry had been right among the less practical mathematicians the theoretical mathematicians why youd be like a talking sliderule i think that for a dead man youve a great future pythagoras but it was such a simple thing the greek had been flattered and known by heart multiplication division addition and subtraction aye and trigonometry too ive done it all so often there isnt an angle i cant calculate there you are harry had smiled and however drily believe me there arent many today who know all the angles and you harry are you a lightning calculator harry hadnt wished to shatter him ah but with me its different intuitive between one and a million then the necroscope had answered almost in the same breath take ten and multiply it by itself as many times as you like and it works every time half of ten is five put the two halves together again half of a hundred is fifty put the halves together and so on magic to some intuition to me pythagoras had been downcast why would they need me when they already have you because as ive stated i may not be here too long its like you said the world is a small place and its hard to find a hiding place on the outskirts of tigani hed found a small taverna and seated himself in its shade and ordered ouzo with a dash of lemonade english girls splashed in the warm blue waters of a small rocky bay their breasts were shiny and harry could smell the oil of coconut from here pythagoras had picked the picture from harrys mind and scowled at it perhaps its as well im unbodied to stay hed commented darkly like vampires they deplete a man for a moment the necroscope had been caught off guard but then ah hed answered but there are vampires and there are vampires someone dying the necroscopes vampire as yet a mere tadpole of alien parasitic contamination was immature as such it had no desire for conflict either internal or external but wished only to evolve and get on with the long process of its hosts conversion which was why its influence was mainly enervating keep harry mentally and emotionally drained and hed be less likely to jeopardize himself which by definition meant that hed be less likely to jeopardize his horrific tenant hence his flashes of wamphyriawareness halfglimpsed knowledge of burgeoning ungovernable power and the burning need to argue and crossexamine even to engage his own mind in long spells of intense selfinquisition despite the bouts of inwardlydirected anger and mental exhaustion which invariably resulted but quite apart from the necroscopes mind his blood was also aware that the invader was here it seemed filled with a weird psychic fever which kept him jumpy and constantly on guard he was a man with a volcano inside him which for now merely simmered and let off a little steam not knowing when the volcano was set to go off he couldnt relax but must hold the cap firmly in place and listen with a rapt horrified and yet curious intentness to the rumbling within on the one hand harry would like to test out his wamphyri talents to the full for they were part of him even now while yet the physical side of the thing was still embryonic but on the other he knew that to do so would be to accelerate the process for one thing was certain however immature his symbiont might be it was also fastgrowing and fastlearning no slow starter this vampire but while the parasite like all its kind would be dogged the necroscope was no less tenacious in his own right his son had managed to keep his vampire in order hadnt he like son like father harry would do his damnedest to follow suit except that would be hard enough in itself without the current recalcitrance of the great majority and the knowledge or at least strong suspicion that ebranch was gearing itself for war and the fact that despite all of this harry had determined to bring a certain fiend to justice but first must find him previously he would have been able to work out a logical system of approach like writing down an order of priorities but his mental confusion and the weariness it produced obfuscated so that while he was aware of the passage of time and of forces mobilizing against him still he felt incapable of rising above and proceeding beyond his personal miasma which in turn brought frustration more anger and the first gale warnings that his whirling gusting emotions craved physical release like an alien autism incapable of selfexpression harry could feel his violence lying just beneath the surface his violence yes for the vampire in him was neither violent nor emotional it merely amplified these properties in its host perhaps most frustrating of all he knew that none of the things he was doing or would do if he felt capable was of the slightest importance to his own personal survival another in his position might seek to change his identity find a safe place extricate himself permanently from all dangerous sources and focuses or would he would he even be able to for as harry had pointed out to pythagoras the world is a small place and by definition any other in harrys position would likewise be wamphyri and territorial this was his world this house not far from edinburgh was his house especially his thoughts and actions were his territory most of them most of the time at least when others werent snooping on them yesterday he had gone to the ruins of the castle ferenczy and spoken to bodrogk the thracian bodrogk was too recent a friend to have known harry before the start of his transition he accepted him for what he was now also bodrogk was fearless and in any case could not possibly fear the necroscope nor for that matter any other living man his dust and the dust of his wife sofia was scattered to the winds and only their spirits remained in the carpathians now they were quite beyond earthly harm the subject of harrys inquiry had been the composition and proportions of the chemical ingredients of janos ferenczys necromantic potions he would retrieve trevor jordan and penny sanderson from their essential salts only if he could bring them back perfect or as close to perfect as possible bodrogk because he had been subjected to just such experiments was an authority even so hed inquired at length into the necroscopes purpose before passing on the necessary information and so today harry had been ready to become a true necromancer in his own right and would have proceeded but at the last moment hed felt that twinge that covert tweaking at the corner of his mind which had warned him that geoffrey paxton was close by and watching him knowing that paxton was seeking to prove just such unnatural activity in him harry had been obliged to postpone the experiment and then barely able to control his rage hed spoken to darcy clarke at ebranch hq it had come as a relief to know that paxton wasnt darcys man but if not his whose maybe darcy would find out and let him know and maybe not and in any case what odds for harry knew that sooner or later darcy and the others must all join forces against him the hell of it was that the boss of ebranch had been a good friend once the necroscope couldnt see any way that he would ever be able to hurt darcy but how to explain that to the thing inside him at two in the afternoon harry had sat quite still in his study and listened but his vampire awareness was still a fledgling thing and hed detected nothing or maybe he had the very briefest wriggle of something on the outermost rim of his perceptions whatever it was suspicious enough that hed put back his experiment yet again then rammed his widebrimmed hat on to his head and gone outdoors to talk to his mother now sitting on the crumbling river bank harry dangled his legs and looked down into the gently swirling water which had been mary keoghs grave for most of his life and let his deadspeak thoughts reach out to her since there was no one here to see him he simply spoke to her which was also deadspeak and felt far more natural ma im in a mess if shed answered so whats new he would understand it seemed he was always in a mess but mary keogh loved her son as all mothers do and death had not diminished that harry her voice seemed very faint now very distant as if shed been washed away downriver along with her physical shell oh harry i know you are son well and that was only to be expected hed never been able to hide anything from his ma who had warned him often enough that there are some things you darent get too close to this time hed let himself get too close do you know what im talking about theres only one thing you can be talking about son she sounded so sad so sorry for him and even if you hadnt come to speak to me still i would know all of us know harry he nodded theyre not so keen to talk to me any more he said maybe a little bitterly and yet i never harmed a single one of them but you should try to understand harry she was at pains to explain the great majority were once living and now are dead they remember what life was and they know what death is but they dont understand and want nothing to do with anything that lies between they cant understand something which preys on the living to make them undead which takes away true life and replaces it with soulless greed and lust and and evil the children and grandchildren of the teeming dead are still in the world of the living and so are you and thats what worries them it makes no difference how long people are dead harry they still worry about their children but you know that son dont you harry sighed her deadspeak however faint and possibly even chiding was as warm as ever it covered the necroscope like a blanket kept him safe made it easier to think and plan and even dream it was so alien to the nightmare thing inside him that that part of harry could neither understand nor interfere with it namely it was the love of his mother soothing as nothing else could ever be but the point is he said in a little while that ive one more thing to do before i before im finished here and its important ma important to me and to you and the teeming dead alike theres a monster running loose and i have to nail him a monster son her voice was very soft but he knew what she meant who was he to talk about monsters ma ive done nothing wrong he answered and so long as im me im not going to harry she said son im all used up and she wasnt only faint but very tired too were not inexhaustible left alone wed just go on thinking our thoughts gradually fading as all things do we do fade in the end be it ever so long but torn by outside influences we go that much faster i think thats how it works anyway you were a light in our long night son and it was like we could see again but now we have to let you go and suffer the darkness alive we used to wonder is there anything on the other side well there was and then you came and joined us up and there was a kind of life again so now i wonder whats next what im telling you is i havent long here but id hate to leave you not knowing you were all right what are your plans harry and for the first time he realized that he really did need a plan as simply as that his mother had cut through all of his confusion well theres a place i can go he finally answered not much of a place but better than dying i think and theres someone there who can teach me things if hes willing he had problems too but the last time i saw him he was coping maybe he still is maybe i can learn something from him she knew where who and what he meant of course but isnt that a sinister sort of place harry it was he shrugged maybe it still is but at least i wont be hunted there i would be hunted here eventually if i stayed which means id be forced to hunt too and thats what im afraid of and what im trying to avoid im a plague in a bottle ma safe only so long as no one shakes or tries to break me but in that other place the plague has already run its course whats unthinkable here is understood there not acceptable never that but a reality all the same she sighed im glad youre not just giving in son and with something of her old fondness youre a fighter harry you always were i suppose i was he agreed but i cant fight here that would only bring it on and in the end im afraid it might be stronger than me there are still things i have to do here thats all business that needs clearing up which is how ill occupy myself until its time you asked about my plans theyre simple really when my heads on straight i can read them like words in a book theres a girl who died horribly and didnt deserve it because no one deserves to die like that and theres the creature who killed her and other innocents like her who does deserve it theres a long talk an explanation which i owe to darcy clarke and oh there are talents id like to gather which might be useful to me in the other place thats all of it a few things to do something i have to straighten out and one or two new things to learn and then it will be time i walked id rather walk than be chased and youll never come back i might if i learned how to hold the thing permanently in check but if i cant no never how will you deal with this man murderer monster youre looking for as quick and as cleanly as hell let me you dont know what he does ma but i can tell you i wont soil my hands on him not if i can help it killing him will be like cutting out a tumour in the flesh of humanity youve cut out a few of those son and one more to go harry nodded and the girl who doesnt deserve to be dead that was a strange way of putting it harry its such a recent thing for her ma harry knew hed strayed into a minefield looked in vain for a safe landmark shes not used to it yet and and she doesnt have to get used to it i mean i can help her youve learned a new thing harry she answered but very slowly and he sensed something different in her voice which was never there before fear you learned it from janos ferenczy and i can feel it yes and its what puts you apart from us now we can all feel it and suddenly her deadspeak was wracked with small shudders his ma too had he alienated even his warm sweet ma suddenly he had the feeling that if he let her go shed just drift away from him and keep on drifting perhaps into that beyond place which she sensed waiting there but he had one trump card left and now played it ma am i good or bad was i born good or evil she read the anxiety in his deadspeak and returned at once oh you were good son how can you doubt it you were always so good well nothings changed ma not yet and not here i promise you i wont let anything change me not here if and when i feel it as soon as i feel i cant hold it any longerthen ill go but if you bring that girl back what will she be beautiful just as she was maybe not physically beautiful though its a fact she was lovely but alive and thats to be beautiful you know that but for how long son i mean will she age will she die what will she be what will she be harry he had no answer just a girl i dont know and her children what will they be ma i dont know i only know shes too much alive to be dead are you doing it for yourself no just for her and for all of you he sensed her shaking her head i dont know son i just dont know trust me ma well i suppose ill have to so how can i help harry was eager now except ma i dont want to weaken you you said you were all used up so i am but if you can fight so can i if the dead wont talk to you maybe theyll still talk to me while they can he nodded his gratitude and in a little while said there were others before penny sanderson i know their names from the newspapers but i have to know where they were laid to rest and i need an introduction see they were badly hurt and probably wont trust someone like me who can touch them from this side i mean the one who killed them he could do that too while i do need to talk to them i dont want to frighten them more than they already are so you see without you it would be just too difficult so you want to know which graveyards theyre in right right it probably wouldnt be too hard to find out for myself but there are so many things on my mind that keep getting in the way and so time goes by all right harry ill do what i can but i dont want to have to track you down any more so it would be better if you came to see me that way i she paused cut off abruptly ma didnt you feel that son i always feel it when theyre close by like that what was it someone joining us she answered sadly someone dying some thing anyway a medium in life in death mary keoghs contact with death was that much sharper but what had she meant it wasnt clear and harry felt the short hairs prickle on the back of his neck some thing he repeated her a pet a puppy an accident she sighed and some poor childs heart broken in bonnyrig just this minute the necroscope felt his own heart give a start hed lost so much during his life that the thought of anothers loss however small stung him with its poignancy or maybe it was just the way his mother had reported the occurrence so soulfully or there again it could be an effect of his heightened emotional awareness maybe there was someone he could comfort bonnyrig did you say ma ill be going now ill come and see you tomorrow maybe youll know something by then take care son harry stood up looked up and down the river and across it to the other side the bright sun had passed behind fluffy drifting clouds which was a relief he climbed a tottering fence and entered a small copse and in the dappled heart of the greenery conjured a möbius door a moment later and he emerged in a back alley close to the high street in bonnyrig and letting his deadspeak sensitivity spread out around him like a fan or cobweb he searched for a newcomer among the ranks of the dead and there it was close by a whining yelp in memory of the panic and pain of a few moments ago and a certain astonishment that the pain was no longer here and disbelief that the bright day could so quickly turn black and blacker than night a dumb animals perception of sudden death harry understood it very well for it wasnt too dissimilar to the reaction of a human being the only difference being that dogs have neither foreknowledge of nor preoccupation with death so that their surprise is that much greater but strike or kick a dog unjustly or cruelly and it will draw back with just the same astonishment the same disbelief taking a chance that he wasnt observed the necroscope used the möbius continuum to follow the pups thoughts to their source a kerbside in the main village street at a junction where the street turned left on to the main road into edinburgh a workday there werent many people about the handful which had gathered had their backs to harry anyway where he emerged on to the pavement as if from thin air and the first thing he saw was the long dark skidmark burned into the roads surface the pups deadspeak thoughts were more desperate now as it realized that it couldnt extricate itself from this new predicament there was no feeling no contact no light where was its god its young master shh harry hushed its ok boy its all right shh he moved to the forefront of the handful of onlookers saw a young boy kneeling there in the gutter his cheeks shiny with tears the broken pup dead in his arms one of the pups shoulders was askew and its spine kinked its right foreleg flopped like a rubber band its crushed head oozed brain fluid from a torn right ear harry got down on one knee put an arm round the boy and stroked the dead pet and again shh boy he comforted both of them and in his mind the pups whines and yelps quietened to a panting whimper it could feel again it felt harry but the boy couldnt be comforted hes dead he kept moaning hes dead paddys dead why didnt the car hit me and not paddy why didnt the car stop where do you live son harry asked the boy a towhead of maybe eight or nine the other glanced at him through blurredblue eyes down there he nodded vaguely over his right shoulder number seven we live there paddy and me harry took the dog gently into his arms and stood up lets get him home then he said the crowd parted for them and harry heard someone say its a shame what a terrible shame paddys dead the kid clutched the necroscopes elbow as they turned the corner into a narrow deserted street dead yes he was but did he really have to be you dont have to be do you paddy the deadspeak answer which came back wasnt quite a bark and it wasnt quite a word but it was an agreement a dog will usually agree with his friends and rarely if ever disagree with his master while harry wasnt paddys beloved master he certainly was a new friend and the decision was made as quickly as that before they reached the small garden in front of number seven harry looked down at the lad and said whats your name son peter the other could scarcely get it out past his tears and the lump in his throat peter i harry jerked to a halt playacting for all he was worth he glanced at the pet in his arms i think i felt him move the boys mouth fell open paddy moved but hes so bad hurt son im a vet harry lied maybe i can save him you run quickly now and tell your people whats happened and ill take paddy to the surgery and whatever happens ill be in touch just as soon as i know how bad he is or how good ok but dont waste time peter harry urged its paddys life right the other gulped nodded once flew to the gate of number seven and through it and as he vanished pellmell into the garden harry conjured a möbius door by the time peters ma came out of the house wringing her hands came flying to see the vet harry was at a different address entirely the necroscope had perhaps too few friends among the living but one of them was an old potter up in the pentlands who fired his own kilns paddy was absolutely dead no doubt about that when harry handed him over to hamish mcculloch for calcination in one of his ovens its worth a twenty to me hamish he told the old scot if you can bring him down to ashes well if not to me to his master a young lad with a broken heart and ill pay you for one of your pots too to keep him in i reckon we can manage that harry hamish nodded only one thing said the necroscope be careful how you gather him up i mean the young lad wants to know he has all of him right just as you say another nod and harry waited for five hours until the job was done but stayed calm and patient and controlled throughout for now he was the old harry who while he had little enough time left of his own nevertheless had all the time in the world for this and anyway it would serve his wider purposes too wouldnt it a little preview of what was to come a chance to observe any possible discrepancies for trevor jordans brain had also been shattered and pennys flesh had been torn at pm harry was down in the spacious dusty cellar of his old house a mile or so out of bonnyrig hed cleaned the place out as best he could and scrubbed an area in the centre of the stone floor until it was smooth as glass old hamish had told him the weight of the dead pups body before calcination so that even if harrys grasp of maths had been meagre it wouldnt be too difficult to calculate pound for pound the various amounts of chemicals required his knowledge was anything but meagre and hed calculated it down into grams finally ashes and chemicals were poured together making a very small mound in the scrubbed floor space and harry was ready and this time there was no pausing to check if his own personal mindflea was up and jumping for this time he wasnt worried for himself but for a little kid who wouldnt be sleeping easy tonight except now that he was ready it all seemed so ridiculously easy was this all there was to it had he perhaps forgotten something had those weirdly esoteric words hed uttered down in the bowels of janos ferenczys ruined castle that formula out of hideous aeons really sufficed to bring about resurrection and if so had it been an act of blasphemy on the other hand where was the profit in worrying about that now if the necroscope was to be damned for his works then he was already damned and purgatory has to be something like infinity if youre to suffer for all eternity theres no way you can be made to suffer twice as long is there as always his arguments went in a circle making his head spin but suddenly he knew that it was the vampire in him working to confuse him and in that same moment he acted and so broke the thread directing a rigid finger and his thoughts at the pile of ingredients he spoke the words of evocation yai ngngah yogsothoth heelgeb fai throdog uaaahr it was like putting a lighted match to a pile of incendiary materials there was phosphorescent light coloured smoke a notquitesulphur stench and there was a yelp paddy called up from his ashes came staggering from a mushrooming smokering of rapidly dispersing gas or vapour his ears and stump of a tail were down trembling and he wobbled on legs of jelly which seemed incapable of supporting him he had returned from death and weightlessness from incorporeity to life and substantiality in a moment but his pups legs were already unused to it paddy the necroscope whispered going down on one knee paddy here boy and the little dog fell down stood up shook himself so as almost to fall again and came to him black and white short in the leg floppyeared a mongrel entirely and entirely alive was he paddy the necroscope spoke again this time in deadspeak but there was no answer paddy lived truly half an hour later harry delivered paddy to house number seven of a row of neat terraced houses in bonnyrig he didnt mean to stay would escape immediately if he could but there were things he needed to know about paddy about paddys character was he the same dog exactly and apparently he was certainly peter thought so paddys master had been ready for bed for an hour but he wouldnt go until hed heard from his vet and paddys return was a miracle to him though only the necroscope knew how much of a miracle peters father was a tall thin callused man but a kind one the boy told us he thought paddy must be dead he said pouring harry a liberal whisky after peter and his pup had disappeared for the night broken bones blood and brains from his ear a spine all out of joint it had us worried he loves that pup it looked a lot worse than it was harry answered the pup was unconscious which made his limbs flop there was some blood from a few scratches and that always looks bad and hed coughed up some slaver shock mostly and his shoulders the other raised an eyebrow peter said they werent working that they were definitely broken dislocated harry nodded once we fixed that everything else came right were grateful to you thats ok what do we owe you nothing thats very kind of you i just wanted to be sure that paddy was the same dog said the necroscope i mean that the bump he took hadnt changed his personality did he seem the same to you there came a yelp and a bark and laughter from peters bedroom playing the boys mother nodded and smiled understandingly they shouldnt be but tonights special oh yes mr keogh said harry oh yes paddys just the same peters father saw harry to the garden gate thanked him again and said goodnight when he went back inside his wife said what an uncommonly decent nice person his eyes so soulful hmm her husband was thoughtful didnt you think so oh aye certainly but but didnt you like him then is there something you cant trust in a man who wont accept payment for a job well done no no its not that but his eyes soulful werent they were they down at the garden gate in the darkness when he looked at me yes but nothing said peters father shaking his head a trick of the light thats all back home harry felt good better than at any time since greece when hed got his deadspeak and numeracy back maybe he could feel even better and cause others to feel better too in his study he sat in an easy chair and talked to an urn where it stood shadowed in one corner of the room or it would appear that he talked to an urn but urns dont talk back trevor you were a telepath and a good one which means that you still are so i know that even when i dont speak to you still youre listening to me you listen to my thoughts so you know what i did tonight right i cant help what i am harry trevor jordan answered his deadspeak voice breathless with excitement no more than you can yes i know what you did and what youre planning to do i cant believe it yet and dont suppose will for quite some little time after it has happened if it happens its like a wonderful dream that i dont want to wake up from except theres a chance it will be even more wonderful when i do wake up there was no hope none and now there is but surely you knew my intention all along knowing what someone wants to do doesnt make them capable of doing it the other answered but now after the dog harry nodded but a dogs a dog and a mans a man we still cant be sure until were sure do i have anything to lose i suppose not harry any time youre ready then so am i boy am i ready trevor just a second ago you said you cant help being what you are any more than i can did that mean more than it sounded you must have read quite a lot in my mind and after a long pause i wont lie to you harry i know whats happened to you what youre becoming you dont know how sorry am pretty soon said the necroscope the whole damn rat pack will be after me i know and i know what youll do then and where youll go again harrys nod but its like my ma told me he said its a strange and sinister place any help i can get ill probably need it is there something i can do not much i reckon not from where i am right now actually yes said harry we could do it right now but i wont take that sort of advantage if the thing works that will be soon enough and even then especially then the decision will still be yours so when again jordans breathlessness tomorrow jesus but dont the necroscope cautioned him then curse all you want but be careful who you name after that they talked generally and remembered old times a pity there wasnt anything good to remember oh good had come out of it but it had been evil as hell at the time and after a lull in their deadspeak conversation harry you know that paxtons still watching you dont you it was jordan who had first brought the mindspy to the necroscopes attention harry remembered that with gratitude but ever since the initial warning a week ago it had been his own intuition which alerted him to the telepaths proximity his first instinctive reaction to the problem had been to invoke a talent hed inherited from harold wellesley an exboss of ebranch who had suicided after being found out as a doubleagent wellesleys talent had been a negative sort of thing his mind had been better than the vaults of a bank literally impregnable but it had seemed to make him the ideal candidate for head of the british mindspy security organization had seemed to anyway by way of atonement hed passed on his talent to harry but wellesleys talent was sometimes a twoedged sword if you bolt your doors against your enemies your friends get locked out too also when you blow out the candle in a deep cave everyone goes blind harry would prefer the light prefer to know paxton was there and what he was about and in any case it was draining to have to keep his guard up like that power all power has to be generated somewhere and with the necroscopes constantly increasing emotional stress his batteries were already sufficiently drained now it was the business of harrys intuition to keep tabs on the mindspy his intuition and the expanding intelligence of the thing inside him its waxing talents eventually these would develop into a sort of telepathy in their own right into telepathy and other forms of esp but it could do no harm to have jordans brand of the art as an optional extra jordan heard that too harry theres no sweat on that i know youre different anything i can give you take it now or after you try it out on me it makes no difference im not going to change my mind youll use it to protect yourself of course you will but not to hurt us im sure us people harry i dont think you could hurt people i wish i could be so sure but the thing is it wont be me or it will be but i wont think the same any more so all you have to do is stick to your plan when you know its coming or when circumstances force you to take defensive or evasive action thats when you get the hell out of it chased out of my own world the necroscope growled that or let the genie out of its bottle yes youre a straight talker trevor isnt that what friends are for but in a way youre a kind of genie in a bottle yourself right harrys contrary wamphyri side was surfacing his need to argue the point any point jordan hadnt sensed it yet but in any case he was trying to keep the conversation light maybe thats where those old moslem legends spring from eh a man with the power who knows the magic words calling up a powerful slave from dust in a bottle what is your wish o master my wish harrys voice was gaunt as his face sometimes i wish to fuck id never been born and now jordan sensed it harrys duality the strange tides in his blood eroding the coastline of his will the horror which challenged his human ascendancy even now whose challenge was strengthening hour by hour day by day youre tired harry maybe you should take it easy for a while get some sleep at night the necroscope chuckled but drily darkly its not my nature trevor you have to fight it ive been fighting it harrys growl was deeper all i do is fight it jordan was silent for a moment then maybe maybe we should give it a break now his deadspeak was full of trembling harry could feel his fear the terror of a dead man and to his innermost self where jordan couldnt reach oh god even the dead are afraid of me now he stood up abruptly starting to his feet so as almost to topple his chair and lurching to the curtains he looked out through an inch of space where the drapes came together across the river and into the night at which precise moment on the far river bank and under the trees there someone struck a match to light a cigarette just for a second harry saw the flare before it was cupped in the windshield of a hand and then there was only a yellow glow brightening when the watcher took a deep drag the bastards out there right now harry spoke almost to himself it might as well be to himself for jordan was too frightened to answer the resurrected at midnight harry was still seething he invoked wellesleys talent crept out into his garden and down the path to where the old gate in the wall sagged on its rusting hinges the night was his friend and like a cat he became one with the shadows until it would seem there was no one there at all looking through the gapped gate across the river his nightsensitive eyes could plainly see the motionless figure under the trees the mindflea paxton paxton the word was like poison on harrys lips and in his mind his mind or that of the creature which was now a growing part of him for harrys vampire recognized the threat even as did the necroscope himself except it might deal with it differently if he would let it paxton he breathed the name into the cool night air and his breath was a mist that drifted to the path and swirled around his ankles the dark essence of wamphyri was strong in him now almost overpowering you cant hear me you bastard can you he breathed mist which flowed under the gate across the overgrown river path down among the brambles and on to the glassy water itself you cant read me you dont know im here at all do you but suddenly coming from nowhere there was a gurgling monstrous voice unmistakably that of faéthor ferenczy in harrys mind instead of shrinking back when you sense him near seek him out he would enter your mind enter his he will expect you to be afraid be bold and when he yawns his jaws at you go in through them for hes softer on the inside a nightmare voice but one which harry himself had drawn from memory for wellesleys talent made any other sort of intrusion impossible faéthor was gone now where no man could ever reach him he was lost for ever in future time that father of vampires had been talking about his bloodson janos but it seemed to the necroscope that the same techniques might well apply right here right now or perhaps it didnt seem so to harry but to the thing inside him paxton was here to prove harry was a vampire since he was a vampire there seemed no way he could disprove it but must he simply sit still and wait for the consequences of this fleas reports the urge was on him to even the score a little to give the mindspy something to think about not actually to scratch his itch no for that would be conclusive proof in itself and could only drag the necroscope further into an already unwelcome light ultimately to the minute scrutiny of bigger fleas whose bite might even prove fatal also harry was obliged to forcibly remind himself it would be murder the thought of that evoked visions of blood and the thought of that was something he must put aside entirely he stepped back from the gate in the old stone wall conjured a door and passed through it into the möbius continuum and out again onto a secondclass road where it paralleled the river on its far side there was no one in sight the sky was clouded over down through the flanking trees the river was seen as a ribbon of lead carelessly let fall in the darkness a car paxtons car stood halfon halfoff the road under overhanging branches a recent model and expensive its paintwork gleamed in the dark its doors were locked windows wound up tight it pointed slightly downhill towards a walled bend where the access road joined the main road into bonnyrig harry stepped from the potholed tarmac past the car and into the cover of the trees and where he went the mist followed no it didnt simply follow for he was the source and the catalyst it boiled up from the ground where he walked fell from his dark clothes like weird evaporation poured from his mouth as breath he went silently flowingly unaware of his own feet unerringly seeking soft ground stepping between the places where brittle betraying twigs lay in wait for him and he felt his tenant flexing its muscles and securing its hooks more deeply in his will it would be a fine test of the things power over him to take control here and now causing him to do that from which there could be no return until now harrys fever had been more or less controlled his angers had been more violent true his depressions deeper and his snatches of joy poignant but on the whole he had felt no real craving or compulsion or at least nothing he couldnt fight but now he felt it it was as if paxton had become the centre of all that was wrong with his life a point he could focus upon a large wen on the already imperfect complexion of existence some surgery was required harrys mist crept ahead of him it sprang up from the bank of the river and the boles of trees where they joined the damp earth and cast swirling tendrils about paxtons feet the telepath sat on a tree stump close to the rivers rim his gaze fixed firmly on the dark shape of the house across the water where light spilled out from an upstairs window harry had left that light on deliberately but while the necroscope was unaware of it still there was a halfscowl halffrown on paxtons face for the mindspy had lost his quarrys aura he supposed that harry was still in the house but for all his mental concentration he no longer had contact with him not even the tenuous contact which was his minimum requirement it didnt mean a great deal of course not because paxton was well aware of harrys talents the necroscope could be literally anywhere or on the other hand it could mean quite a bit it isnt everyone who will just go flitting off in the midnight hour putting himself beyond the reach of men and mentalists alike keogh could be up to almost anything paxton shivered as a ghost stepped on his grave only an old saying that of course but for a moment just then hed felt something touch him like an unseen presence come drifting across the water to stand beside him in the silence of the mistshrouded river bank mistshrouded where in hell had that sprung from he stood up looked to left and right and began to turn around and harry not five paces away stepped silently into darkness paxton turned through a full slow circle shivered again and shrugged uncomfortably and continued to stare at the house across the river he reached inside his coat and brought out a leatherjacketed flask tilted it and let strong liquor gurgle into his throat in a long pull watching the esper empty the flask harry could feel something dark swelling inside him it was big maybe even bigger than he was he flowed forward came to a halt directly behind the unsuspecting telepath what a joke it would be to let go of wellesleys shield right now and deliberately aim his thoughts into the back of paxtons head why the esper would probably leap straight into the river or perhaps hed just turn round again very slowly and see harry standing there looking right at him into him into his quivering quaking soul and then if he went to scream the dark alien hateswollen thing was in harrys hands now lifting them towards the back of paxtons neck it was in his heart too and his eyes and his face he could feel it pulling back his lips from drooling teeth it would be so easy to sweep paxton up and into the möbius continuum and and deal with him there there where no one would ever find him harrys hands only had to close now and he could wring the espers neck as if he were a chicken ahhh the thing inside sang of emotions as yet unattained which could be his he thrilled to its message to the ringing cry which echoed through his innermost being even now wamphyri warn and paxton hitched back the sleeve of his overcoat and glanced at his watch that was all his movement had been such a natural thing so mundane so much of this world that the spell of an alien plane of existence was broken and harry felt like a twelveyearold boy again masturbating furiously over the toilet bowl and ready to come and his uncle had just knocked on the bathroom door he drew back from paxton conjured a möbius door and almost toppled through it too late and mercifully so the mindspy sensed something and whirled about and saw nothing there but a swirl of fog drenched in his own pungent sweat the necroscope vacated the möbius continuum into the back seat of paxtons car and he sat there shuddering retching and being physically ill on to the floor until hed sicked the thing right out of himself at last looking at the stinking mess of his own vomit his anger gradually returned but now he was mainly angry with himself hed set out to teach the esper a lesson and had almost killed him it said a hell of a lot for his control over the thing inside him which as yet was what a baby an infant what hope would he have later then when the thing was fullfledged and still paxton was there under the trees by the river bank there with his thoughts and his cigarettes and whisky and hed probably be there tomorrow too and the day after that until harry made a mistake and gave himself away if he hadnt done so already fuck him harry said out loud bitterly yes screw him shaft the bastard which had to be better than murdering him at least he climbed over into the front seat of the car and took off the brake and felt the wheels slowly turn as she began to roll he guided the car fully on to the road and let gravity take her along rolling down the gentle gradient the vehicle gained momentum harry pumped at the accelerator until he could smell the heavy petrol fumes pulled out the choke and pumped some more a quartermile later he was still pumping and the car was doing maybe twentyfive thirty the curve was corning up fast with its grass verge and high stone wall harry let go the wheel conjured a möbius door out of the seat beside him and slid over into it and two seconds later paxtons car mounted the verge hit the wall and went off like a bomb just that moment returning from the river to the road the esper stared uncomprehendingly at the spot where his car had stood then heard the explosion farther down the road and saw a ball of fire rising into the night and what he said what by then harry was home again dialling he got an emergency operator in bonnyrig who put him through to the police station police how can we help ye the voice was heavily accented theres a car just burst into flames on the access road to the old estate behind bonnyrig harry said breathlessly and passed on full details of the location and theres a man there drinking from a hip flask and warming his hands on the fire whos speaking please the voice was more authoritative now alert and very officialsounding cant stop said harry have to see if anyones hurt he put the phone down from his upstairs bedroom window the necroscope watched the fire steadily brightening and ten minutes later saw the bonnyrig fireengine arrive along with its police escort and for a little while there was the eerie wailing of sirens where blueand orangeflashing lights clustered around the central leap of flames then the fire winked out and the sirens were silenced and a little after that the police car drove off with a passenger harry would have been happy to know that the passenger was paxton furiously swearing his innocence and breathing whisky fumes all over the hardfaced officers but he didnt because by then he was fast alseep whether sleep at night was right or wrong for his character made no difference trevor jordans advice had been sound in the morning the rising sun scorched harry from his bed coming up beyond the river it crept in through his window and seared a path across a twitching left hand which he dreamed was trapped in one of hamish mccullochs kilns starting awake he saw the room flooded with glowing yellow sunlight where hed mistakenly left the curtains open he breakfasted on coffee just coffee and immediately proceeded to the cool cellar he didnt know how long he had left so it might well be a case of now or never and anyway hed promised trevor jordan it would be today jordans and pennys urns were already down below along with the chemicals harry had taken from the castle ferenczy trevor he said as he weighed and mixed powders i went after paxton last night no not seriously but almost all i did in the end was toss a spanner in his works which should keep him out of our hair a while i certainly dont feel him near but that could be because its morning and the sun is up can you tell me if hes out there the newsagent in bonnyrig has just opened his shop and theres a milkman doing his rounds jordan answered oh and a lot of perfectly ordinary people in the village are having breakfast but no sign of paxton it seems a pretty normal sort of morning to me not exactly normal harry told him not for you anyway ive been trying not to hope too hard jordan answered his deadspeak shivery trying not to pray i still keep thinking im dreaming i mean we actually do shut down and sleep sometimes did you know that the necroscope nodded finished with his powders and took up jordans urn i was incorporeal myself one time remember i used to get tired as hell mental exhaustion is far worse than physical for a while as he carefully poured jordans ashes there was silence then harry im too scared to talk scared harry repeated the word almost automatically concentrated on breaking the urn with a hammer and lying its pieces with the insides uppermost around the heap of mortal remains and chemical catalysts so that anything clinging to them would get caught up in it when he spoke the words scared excited you name it but if i had guts id throw them up im sure it was time trevor you have to understand that if youre not right i mean i know what you mean i know ok harry nodded and moistened his dry lips so here we go the words of evocation came as easy as his mother tongue and yet with a growl which denied his human heritage he used his art with pride certainly in the knowledge that it was a very uncommon thing and that he was a most uncommon creature uaaah the final exclamation wasnt quite a snarl and it was answered a moment later by a cry almost of agony the necroscope stepped back as swirling purple smoke filled the cellar stinging his eyes it gouted mushroomed spilled from or was residue of the chemical materia it was the very essence of jinni its massive volume spilling from such a small source and staggering forward out of it crying out the pain of his rebirth came the naked figure of trevor jordan but the necroscope was ready in case this birth must be aborted for a moment harry could see very little in the swirl of chemical smoke and for another only a glimpse a wild staring eye a twisted gaping mouth head only partly visible only partly there jordans arms were reaching for harry his hands shuddering almost vibrating his legs gave way and he fell to one knee harry felt the chill of absolute horror and the words of devolution sprang into his mind were ready on his desiccated lips then the smoke cleared and it was trevor jordan kneeling there perfect harry sank to his knees and embraced him both of them crying like children then it was pennys turn she too thought she was dreaming couldnt believe what the necroscope told her with his deadspeak but it was one dream from which he soon awakened her she fell into his arms crying and he carried her up out of the cellar to his bedroom laid her between the sheets and told her to try to sleep all useless there was a maniac in the house running wild laughing and crying at the same time trevor jordan came and went slamming doors rushing here and there pausing to touch himself to touch harry penny and then laughing again laughing like crazy like mad mad to be alive penny too once the truth sank in once she believed and for an hour two hours it was bedlam stay in bed she dressed herself in harrys pyjamas and one of his shirts and danced she pirouetted waltzed jived harry was glad he had no neighbours eventually they wore themselves out almost wore the necroscope out too he made plenty of coffee for them they were thirsty they were hungry they invaded his kitchen they ate everything now and then jordan would leap to his feet hug harry until he thought his ribs must crack rush into the garden and feel the sunshine and rush back again and penny would burst into a fresh bout of tears and kiss him it made him feel good and it disturbed him even now their emotions were no match for his then it was afternoon and harry said penny i think you can go home now he had told her what she must say how it couldnt have been her body the police found but someone who looked a lot like her how she had suffered amnesia or something and didnt know where shed been until she found herself in her own street in her own north yorkshire village that was all no elaboration and no mention not even a whisper of harry keogh necroscope he made a note of her sizes möbiustripped into edinburgh and bought her clothes waited while she frantically dressed herself he had forgotten shoes no matter shed go barefoot she would go naked if that were the only way he took her home almost all the way only breaking the jump for a final word of warning on the rolling moors via the möbius continuum which was something else for her not to believe in and he cautioned her penny from now on things will be normal for you and eventually you may even come to believe this story weve concocted for you better for you me everyone if you do believe it most certainly better for me but ill see you again the realization of what she had found and what she must lose and for the first time the question did she have the better of the bargain he shook his head people will come and go penny through all your life its the way it is and through death youve promised me youll forget that it isnt part of our story right and then the rest of the jump to a street corner shed known all her life goodbye penny and when she looked around as a small child shed followed the rerun adventures of the lone ranger who was that invisible man back at the house near bonnyrig jordan was waiting he was calmer now but still radiated awe and wonder which made him look beautiful freshscrubbed newly returned from a holiday in the sun or a swim in a mountain stream all of these things harry im ready any time you are just tell me what i must do you nothing just dont shut me out thats all i want to get into your mind and learn from it like janos did harry shook his head unlike janos i didnt bring you back to hurt you i didnt even bring you back for me its still up to you if you dont like the idea of me going in there just say so this has to be of your own free will very significant words jordan looked at him you didnt just save my life he said but returned it to me anything you want harry the necroscope sent his developing wamphyri thoughts directly into jordans head and the other cleared the way for him drew him in harry found what he wanted it was so like deadspeak that he knew it at once the mechanism was easy a part of the human psyche mental in action it was purely physical in operation a part of the mind people most people havent learned how to use identical twins sometimes have it because they come from the same egg but discovering it wasnt the same as making it work harry withdrew said your turn for jordan it was easy he already was a telepath he looked inside harrys mind and found the trigger which the necroscope had pictured for him it only required releasing after that like a switch harry could throw it any time it was required and try it jordan said when hed withdrawn harry pictured zek föener a powerful telepath in her own right and reached out with his new talent he no she was swimming in the blue warm waters of the mediterranean spearfishing off zakinthos where she lived with her husband jazz simmons she was twenty feet down and had lined up a fish in her sights a fine red mullet where it finned on the sandy bottom and ogled her testing testing testing said harry with more than a hint of dry humour she sucked in salt water down the tube of her snorkel triggered off her spear and missed dropped her gun and kicked frantically for the surface and she trod water there coughing and spluttering staring wildly all about until suddenly it came to her that the words could only have been in her head but the mental voice had been unmistakable finally she had her breath back and got her thoughts together ha ha harry and from his house in bonnyrig fifteen hundred miles away the one and only he answered harry you you a telepath her confusion was total i didnt mean to startle you zek just wanted to find out how good i am well youre good i might have i might have drowned a swimmer like zek there was no way she might have drowned but suddenly she backed off and the necroscope knew that shed sensed the other thing that was harry keogh she tried to shut it out of her thoughts but he cut right through her confusion with its ok zek i know that you know about me i just think you should also know that it wont be like that with me im not staying here not for long anyway i have a job to do and then ill be on my way back there shed read it in his mind to begin with but there may be other places you of all people know i cant stay here harry she was quick anxious to return you know i wont go up against you i know that zek she was silent for a long time then harry had a thought zek if youll swim back to the beach theres someone here would like a word with you but better if you have your feet firmly on the beach because you wont believe who it is and what he has to say and this time you really might drown and he was right she didnt believe it not for quite some time about the middle of the afternoon when jordan had finally accepted everything and the glow had gone off him a little he said what about me harry can i just go home i may have made a mistake the necroscope told him then darcy clarke knows i had that girls ashes he might figure it out if he does hell know i have a couple more talents now which will be confirmed and how if you show up and anyway i have this feeling that everything is going to blow up soon you can go any time you like trevor but id appreciate it if youd stay here and out of sight a while longer how long harry shrugged i have a job to do that long not much more than four or five days i should think thats ok harry jordan nodded i can stand that or four or five weeks if i have to what will you do anyway back to the branch it was a good living it paid the bills we got things done then its best that you leave it until ive gone you have to know that theyll be coming after me after all youve done for us for everybody again harrys shrug when an old faithful dog savages your child you have him put down his services in the past dont cut it whats more if you knew for certain he was going to savage the child youd put him down first right and afterwards you might even feel sorry for the old guy and cry a little but hell if you also knew he had rabies why you wouldnt even think twice youd do it for him as much as for anyone else jordan played it straight face to face does it really worry you that much i mean lets face it harry it wont be an easy job taking you out janos ferenczy had a lot going for him but he wasnt in the same league as you are now thats why i have to go if i dont ill be forced to defend myself which can only hasten things and then thered be a chance for this curse to go on for ever i didnt spend all that time doing all of that dragosani thibor janos faéthor yulian bodescu just to end up the same way they did in that case maybe i should go i mean now oh i can stay out of sight keep an eye on them for you they have paxton watching you but they wont know that im watching them they dont even know im alive i mean they do know im dead harry was interested go on darcy will be the man to watch not in the office but when hes home i know where he lives and i know how he thinks youll be on his mind a lot both ways because of what you are but also because hes a good sort of bloke and hell just be well thinking about you so when everything looks set to go down ill know it and then ill get back to you youd do that for me harry knew he would dont i owe you harry nodded slowly its a good idea he finally said ok go after nightfall ill drive you into edinburgh and then youre on your own and he did and then the necroscope was on his own too but not for long the next morning paxton was back his presence turned harrys mood sour in a moment but he promised himself that later he would turn the tables and take a look inside paxtons mind for a change he relished the thought of that but first he would go and see his ma and find out if she had anything for him the sky was overcast and he stood on the bank of the river with his coat collar turned up against a thin but penetrating persistent drizzle any success ma harry is that you son her deadspeak was so thin so faroff sounding that for a moment the necroscope thought it was simply background static the whispers of the teeming dead conversing in their graves its me ma yes but youre awfully faint i know son she answered from afar just like you i dont have a lot of time now not here anyway its all fading now everything did you want something harry she seemed very weary and wandering ma he was patient with her just like in the old days since ive been having some difficulty with the dead wed decided that you would help me out and see if theyd be a bit more forthcoming with you about those poor murdered girls i mean you said i should give you a little time then come and see you again so here i am i still need that information ma murdered girls she repeated him however vaguely but then harry sensed the sudden focusing of her attention as her deadspeak sounded sharper in his unique mind of course those poor murdered girls those innocents except well they werent all innocents harry in my book they were ma for my purposes they were but tell me what do you mean well most of them wouldnt speak to me she answered it seemed theyd been warned off warned about you when it comes to vampires the dead arent very forgiving harry the one who would speak to me shed been one of the first of his victims whoever he is but by no means an innocent she was a prostitute son foulmouthed and foulminded but she was willing to talk about it and said she wouldnt mind talking to you in fact she said more than that oh yes she said that it would make a nice change to just to just talk to a man harrys ma tuttutted and so young so very young ma said harry im going to go and see that one soon but youre getting so faint that i dont know if well ever get to talk again so i just thought id tell you right now that youve been the best mother anyone could ever have and and youve been the best son harry she cut him off but listen dont you cry for me and i promise i wont cry for you i lived a good life son and despite a cruel death ive not been too unhappy in my grave you were responsible for what happiness i found harry just as youve been for so much of what passes for happiness in this place that the dead no longer trust you well thats their loss he blew her a kiss i missed a lot when you were taken from me but of course you missed a lot more i hope there is a place beyond death ma and that you make it there harry theres something else she was fading very quickly now so that he must give her all of his attention or lose her deadspeak entirely about august ferdinand august ferdi about möbius harry remembered his last conversation with the great mathematician ah he chewed his lip well it could be that i insulted möbius ma inadvertently you understand i mean i wasnt quite myself that time he said you werent son and that he wouldnt be speaking with you again oh said harry a little crestfallen möbius had been one of his very best and closest friends i see no you dont see harry his mother contradicted him he wont be speaking to you because he wont be there i mean here he too has somewhere else to go or believes he has anyway he talked about a lot of things i didnt much understand space and time spacetime the coneshaped universes of light i think that covers everything and he said your argument left one big question unanswered oh yes the question of the ius continuum itself he said thinks knows what it is he said was mind she was breaking up her deadspeak scattering for the last time harry knew ma he was anxious möbius said was the mind harry the mind ma did you say the mind she tried to answer but couldnt quite make it all that came back was the faintest of all fardistant fading whispers haarrry haaarrrry then silence paxton had read the necroscopes casefiles and knew quite a lot about him most of it would seem unbelievable to people of entirely mundane persuasions but of course paxton wasnt one of them on the far bank of the river he watched harry through a pair of binoculars and thought the strange sods talking to his mother a woman dead for quarter of a century and long since turned to slop jesus and they say telepathy is weird harry heard him and knew that hed been eavesdropping on his conversation with his mother on harrys part of it anyway and suddenly he was furious but coldly furious not like the other night and again faéthors words of advice sprang to memory he would enter your mind enter his paxton saw the necroscope step behind a bush and waited for him to come out on the other side but he didnt taking a leak the esper wondered actually no said harry softly from directly behind him but when i do id like to think its in private who the mindspy whirled about stumbled staggered on the very rim of the river harry reached out easily and caught the front of his jacket steadied him grinned an utterly mirthless grin at him he looked him up and down a small thin witheredlooking stick of a man in his middle to late twenties with the face and eyes of a weasel his telepathy must be old ma natures way of making up for several sorts of deficiency paxton harry said his voice still dangerously soft a hot breath squeezed out of burning bellows lungs youre a scumsucking little mindflea i reckon that when your father made you the best part leaked from a ruptured rubber down your mas leg onto the floor of the brothel youre a scumbag bastard who has invaded my territory stepped on my toes and is making me itch and i have every right to do something about you dont you agree paxton flapped his mouth like a landed fish finally got his breath and his nerve back i im doing my job thats all he gasped trying to free himself from harrys grip but the necroscope just held him there at arms length held him that much tighter with no real expenditure of energy at all doing your job he repeated paxtons words who for scumbag thats none of your busin paxton started to say harry shook him glared at him and for the first time the esper noticed a flush of red light colouring the necroscopes gaunt cheeks where it escaped from behind the thick lenses of his dark glasses an angry red light from his eyes for ebranch harrys voice was lower still a rumble almost a growl yes no paxton blurted the words out soft as jelly all he wanted now was to get away from here to that end hed say anything at all the first thing that came to mind harry knew it could read it in his pale face and trembling lips but where lips may lie the mind usually tells the truth he went inside scanned it all and more and got out again like squelching from the sucking quag of a sewer even through the acrid odour of paxtons fear still hed been able to smell the shit it was a relief to know that such minds were in the minority otherwise the necroscope might be tempted to declare war on the entire human race right now but paxton knew hed been in hed felt harry in there like slivers of ice in his mind he started imitating a fish again so now you know for sure said harry and now youll report to your boss well you go and tell the minister that his worst nightmare has come true paxton tell him that and then quit get out and stay out i know you dont warn too easily but this time take some good advice and run while you can i wont be warning you again and while that sank in he released the other released him violently tossed him back and over the lip of the riverbank and down into the gently swirling water it was only then that the necroscope saw paxtons briefcase lying open on a tree stump close by several white junkmail envelopes and one large manila envelope were like magnets to his eyes they were addressed to harry keogh no the riverside etc etc harry glared once more at the floundering esper where he gagged gurgled and splashed in the cold river water beyond his reach for the moment just out of harms way then snatched up his mail and took it home with him paxton could swim which was as well for the necroscope didnt much care one way or the other red alert harry flipped quickly through the murder files discovered the young prostitutes name home town and place of interment and made his way at once to her graveside in a small cemetery on the northern outskirts of newcastle and the necroscope had moved so quickly that as he seated himself in the shade of a tree close by pamela trotters simple headstone so paxton was still catching his breath where hed dragged himself up on to the river bank a hundred miles away pamela said the necroscope im harry keogh i believe my mother might have mentioned my name to you your mother and others she came back at once ive been expecting you harry and ive been warned off you too harry nodded perhaps ruefully my reputation has suffered a bit lately its true mine suffered a lot she chuckled for nearly six years in fact ever since i was fourteen and a nice uncle showed me his little pink sprinkler and told me where it went actually i seduced him for id noticed that whenever he was near me he had a hard on but if it hadnt been him it would have been someone else because i was just naturally like that we played around a lot until his old lady caught us at it one day the jealous old bat i was going bouncybouncy on him when she walked in he whipped it out but was too far gone and spurted on the carpet i dont think shed seen him spurt for a long time and shed certainly never had it like that come to think of it i dont think he had either not before me but i liked it all ways it helps when you enjoy your work harry was silent for a moment surprised even a little taken aback he really didnt know how to answer her didnt your ma tell you i was a tart a trollop a whore there was no bitterness in her not even much of sadness and harry liked her for it something like that he answered eventually not that i think it matters a great deal there have to be a hell of a lot of you down there by now she laughed and harry liked her even more the oldest profession she said but one night nearly eight weeks ago it caught up with you right he felt that with her he could get right to it her assumed indifference fell away from her at once that wasnt why it happened she said i didnt fetch him on and anyway he didnt want me like that it was just an assumption harry told her quickly i meant no offence and im not eager to bring back hurtful memories but its hard to see how i can track this bloke down if no one is able to tell me about him oh id like to see him get his harry she answered and ill help you any way i can i just hope i can remember enough thats all you wont know until you try where do you want me to start first show me how you were or how you thought you were he said for he knew well enough that the dead retain pictures of themselves as they were in life and he wanted to try and draw some sort of comparison with penny sanderson in short he wondered if his necromancer quarry followed a pattern from her mind he immediately got back a picture of a tall darkeyed leggy brunette in a miniskirt with slightly loose breasts unsupported under a blue silk blouse and a shapely backside but there was nothing of character in the picture her picture nothing to suggest quality of mind or personality it was all sensual or outright sexual which didnt fit with his first impressions so how was i very attractive he told her but i think youre selling yourself short often she agreed but without her customary laugh then she sighed and that was something harry was used to in the dead it was the realization of a time and a thing done and finished with which could never return but she brightened up at once and here am i actually talking to a man and for once not wondering what hes got in his pants in the front and in the backpocket was it always like that for money and sometimes for fun ive told you i was nympho do you want to get on now harry was embarrassed shed given him a stock answer had obviously heard that question before often was i prying its ok she answered all men wonder about it about what goes on in a pros mind but suddenly her deadspeak was very cold all men except that one anyway he doesnt have to wonder for he can always find out for himself afterwards when theyre dead and with that the necroscope was sure shed give him all she could tell me about it he said and she did it was a friday night and i went to the dance being freelance my time was my own i didnt need a pimp touting for me taking my money and bringing his friends round for freebies but the dance was in town and i lived quite a few miles out after the midnight hour taxis are expensive cinders needed her coach home that was ok there are always a handful of likely lads wholl buzz a girl home on the chance of a grope and if i liked the guy and if he wasnt too pushy maybe he could get more than a grope a ride for a ride as the saying goes on this occasion i picked the wrong one no not our man but an armful all the same once i was in the car his polite concerned attitude went right out the window he didnt know what i was thought i was just a straight kid but easy meat he could hardly drive for drooling and wanted to stop in every layby and back alley i was wearing expensive clothes and didnt want them ripped up and anyway i didnt like him he said he knew a place just off the motorway and before i could tell him i didnt need it he took the flyon for edinburgh in a layby under some trees he made his move and got my knee in his soft bits for his trouble when he could drive again he did but left me stranded there there was a service station a quartermile up the motorway i went there and had a coffee i wasnt shaken up or anything just dehydrated too many ginandits at the palace but sitting there in this little booth i was joined by a driver that was how i saw him a driver a longdistance man shaking off his weariness with a mug of coffee dont ask me what he looked like the place was threequarters empty and theyd turned the lights low to keep the bills down and there was still a lot of gin in me i spoke to him but i didnt really look at him you know anyway he didnt seem a bad sort and he wasnt pushy when he finished his coffee and made to stand up i asked him which way he was heading where do you want to go he said his voice was soft not unfriendly i told him where i lived and he said he knew it your lucks in he told me i go past it on the motorway about five miles from here theres a flyoff where i can drop you a couple of hundred yards and youll be at your door cant take you any closer than that im afraid because my miles and fuel are monitored anyway its up to you maybe youd feel safer calling a taxi but i wasnt one to look a gift horse in the mouth we left the cafeteria and went out into the lorry park he was cool and calm in no hurry i felt perfectly safe with him in fact i didnt give it a thought his vehicle was one of these big articulated jobs which we approached from the side and the rear the headlights of a passing car as it flashed by on the motorway lit it up in a swath of light the lorry had iceblue panels with white lettering saying frigis express i remember it well because the white paint had peeled off one leg of the x making it look like eypress but at the back of the lorry my driver paused and looked at me and said i just have to make sure this door is secure i stood beside him as he unlocked and slid up this roller door across the full width of the truck a blast of icecold air came out which made me shiver as it turned to a cloud of mist inside there seemed to be rows of things hanging in there but it was dark and i couldnt see what they were he reached inside with both hands and did something then looked over his shoulder and said its ok and i think it was then i realized that i hadnt seen him smile not once he indicated we should go to the cab and as he started to pull the door down again i turned away from him that was when he grabbed me from behind one arm went round my neck and the other hand held something over my face of course i gasped for air and got chloroform i kicked and struggled but that only makes you gasp all the more and then i passed out when i came to i was lying or slithering about on a patch of ice thats what it felt like anyway there was a smell but i couldnt quite make out what it was i was much too cold all my senses were numb from the cold and i felt dizzy and nauseous from the chloroform then i remembered everything and knew i was in the back of the truck slipping and slithering when he applied his brakes or accelerated and of course i also knew i was in trouble in fact dead trouble whatever my driver wanted he was going to get it and then there was a fair chance that hed kill me id seen his truck i could more or less describe him if not now certainly later it was odds on i was a goner i propped myself in one corner of the dark refrigerator i suppose thats what it was a large mobile fridge a freezer truck and tried to get some warmth back into my body i hugged myself blew on my hands beat my arms about but i was weak from the cold and the aftereffect of the chloroform i didnt have the strength of a kitten then after oh i dont know how long maybe fifteen minutes there was a bumpy patch and i heard his airbrakes go on to this day i dont know where we were for i never did see the outside again the truck stopped in a little while the door rolled up and it was dark outside a dark figure clambered up panting into the rear of the trailer he pulled the door shut again and put on a dim interior light just a single bulb under a grille in the ceiling and then he came for me he was wearing a long coat which was all darkstained leather on the outside and brown fur inside he took it off as he approached me and threw it down on me get on it he said panting with some weird emotion but his voice was just as cold as the place where he planned to have me which i now saw was a meat safe beast carcases all grey brown and red hung from rows of hooks and the layer of ice on the floor was frozen beast blood there there doesnt have to be any rough stuff i told him we can do it just as you say and freezing cold though i was i opened my blouse and hitched up my mini to show him my frilly panties he looked down on me in that unsmiling way of his and i saw that his face was all puffy and bloated and his eyes winking like little lumps of shiny coal in the swollen red mask of his face just as i say he repeated my words any way at all and i swear it will be good only just dont hurt me and you can trust me afterwards i wont say a word i lied like hell i wanted to live take em off he panted everything god there was no soul behind his voice nothing behind his eyes there was just the steamheat of his body and the pounding of his feverish blood i could feel how strong he was and how weird and different quickly he said and his voice was a croak and his gorged face was wobbling with strain and horrible excitement i had to do what he told me keep him happy but i was so cold my fingers wouldnt obey me i couldnt get my clothes off he got down on one knee and i could see tools glinting in the loops of his wide leather belt one of them was a meathook which he took out and showed me when i gasped and turned my face away he tore my jacket right off my back my blouse too then he put the hook in the top of my skirt and ripped it down through the plastic belt and material laying it open he ripped open my panties in the same way and all i could do was huddle there as cold as one of the dead animals on its hook and i thought what if he uses that hook on me but he didnt not the hook then he was tearing his clothes off not his upper clothes just his pants and i knew this was it but a man as strong and as dangerous as this could hurt me badly i had to make it as easy for him as easy for myself as possible i opened my legs and stroked my bush of cold hair and god help me i tried to smile at him its all here i said my words turning to snow as they came out all for you eh he grunted looking at me his penis huge and jerking about on its own with a life of its own all for me all for johnny that and then he smiled and he took up another of his tools this one was like a knife but it was hollow and had been cut from steel tubing about an inch and a half in diameter cut at an angle to give it a sharp point and its edges had been sharpened to razor brightness oh god i gasped then for i couldnt hold my terror any longer and i clutched at myself and tried to cover my nakedness but my driver my alltoosoontobe murderer that that thing he only laughed there was no emotion in it not as i understood emotion but he laughed anyway yes cover yourself he gurgled at me the saliva of his lust overflowing from his wobbling grimacing mouth cover it up girlie for johnny doesnt want your ugly little fuckie hole johnny makes his own holes he moved closer and his flesh was alive and leaping bursting for me and then and then its ok it was as much as harry could bear his voice was trembling broken i know what then youve said enough i ill go on what i have pamela was crying now spilling out her poor mutilated soul all of her defiance and resilience crushed and drained from her by the horror of what shed forced herself to remember for the necroscope he he made my body ugly she sobbed he made holes in me before i was dead he was into me and after i was dead i could still feel him grunting on me hurting me its not right that when youre dead someone should still be able to hurt you harry its ok its ok was all harry could say to comfort her but even saying it he knew it wasnt knew it wouldnt be until he himself had put this thing right she took this from his deadspeak understood his resolve reinforced his anger with her own get him for me harry get that dogs bastard for me and for myself he told her for if i dont i know hell always be there clinging like slime to the walls of my mind but pamela yes simply killing this one wont be enough i mean its just not enough but if youre willing theres a way you can help me youre strong pamela in death just as you were in life and what i have in mind i believe its something you would enjoy even more than you did in life he explained his meaning and for a little while she was silent then i think i know now why the dead are afraid of you harry she said wonderingly and is it true that youre a vampire yes no he said not like that not yet anyway and not here but somewhere else i will be or may be one day yes he sensed her nod i think you must be or will be for nothing human could ever think the thought you thought just then nothing entirely human anyway but youll do it oh yes she answered him at last with a grim emphatic deadspeak nod who or whatever you are ill do anything you tell me harry keogh vampire necroscope anything everything and whatever it takes to get even whatever you ask and whenever you ask it anything harry nodded so be it he said for the next thirtyodd hours the necroscope was busy not only him but ebranch too and the next day a warm evening in midmay the minister responsible caused the branch emergency callin system to be brought into play first acting on disturbing information received from geoffrey paxton concerning among other things the files darcy clarke had mailed to harry keogh the minister had relieved clarke of all duties and placed him under what amounted to house arrest at clarkes own north london flat in crouch end second he must now attend the ogroup briefing hed called at ebranch hq the espers would know of course that something big was in the offing all available agents were to be present paxton was there to meet the minister on the ground floor even as they exchanged curt greetings ben trask just back from a job came in from the street through the swing doors trask looked drawn even haggard the minister took him to one side where they conversed in lowered tones for a minute or two and for once paxton knew enough to keep his nose out then they all three took the elevator upstairs and went directly to the ops room the calledin agents were silent seated waiting for the minister he took the podium and his eyes swept the mainly ordinarylooking faces of the espers britains espendowed mindspies where they stared back at him he knew them all from photographs in their files but only darcy clarke and ben trask had ever met him and paxton of course if clarke had been here perhaps he would have stood up as a sign of respect and maybe the rest of them would have followed suit or there again maybe not the trouble with this lot had always been that they thought they were special but here the minister knew he wasnt fooling anybody least of all himself they were special bloody special and looking at them he felt as several before him must surely have felt physics and metaphysics robots and romantics gadgets and ghosts two sides of the same coin were they really science and parapsychology the mundane and the supernatural and he wondered what was the difference anyway isnt a telephone or radio magic to speak with someone on the other side of the world even on the moon and has there ever been a more powerful more monstrous spell or invocation than emc these were some of the ministers thoughts as he scanned the faces of ebranchs espers and put names to them ben trask the human liedetector blocky overweight mouseyhaired and greeneyed slopeshouldered and lugubrious possibly trasks sad expression sprang from the knowledge that the whole world was a liar or if not all of it a hell of a lot of it it was trasks talent to recognize whatever was false show him or tell him a lie and he would know it at once he wouldnt always know the truth of the thing but he would always know when what was represented as true wasnt so no facade however cleverly constructed could ever fool him the police used him a lot to crack stone killers also he came in handy in respect of international negotiations when it was good to know if the cards on the table made a full deck david chung a young londoner a locator and scryer of the highest quality he was slight wiry slanteyed and yellow as they come but he was british loyal and his talent was amazing he tracked soviet nuclear stealth subs ira units in the field drugrunners especially the latter chungs parents had been addicts and their addiction had killed them thats where his talent had started and it was still growing anna marie english was something else but werent they all twentythree bespectacled enervated pallid and dowdy she was hardly an english rose that was a direct result of her talent for she was as one with the earth her way of defining it she felt the rain forests being eaten away she knew the extent of the ozone holes when the deserts expanded she felt their desiccation and the mass erosion of mountain soil made her physically sick she was ecologically aware beyond the five senses of mundane mankind greenpeace could base their entire campaign on her except no one would believe the branch did believe and used her as it used david chung as a tracker she tracked illicit nuclear waste monitored pollution warned of invasions of colorado beetle and dutch elm disease cried aloud the extinction of whales elephants dolphins other species and she knew that the earth was sick and growing sicker she only had to look in the mirror each day to know that then there was geoffrey paxton a telepath one of several an unpleasant person the minister thought but his talent was useful and it takes all sorts to make a world paxton was ambitious he wanted it all better to employ him where he too could be watched than have him turn to highstakes blackmail or become the mindspy agent of some foreign power later paxtons would be a career worth following and closely sixteen of them gathered here under one roof and eleven more out in various parts of the world guiding that world or at least watching over it they were paid according to their talents handsomely and they were worth every penny it would cost a lot more if they ever decided to work for themselves sixteen of them and as the ministers eyes roved over them so they studied him a man who so far had kept himself to the shadows and would prefer to stay there except that now some affair of the utmost moment had lured him out he was in his midforties small and dapper dark hair brushed back and plastered down and he had no nerves to speak of or none that was visible anyway he wore patentleather black shoes a darkblue suit and lightblue tie his brow had a few wrinkles but other than these his face was normally unlined and his eyes were bright clear and blue right now though and especially since his conversation with ben trask he was looking harried ladies gentlemen he wasnt one for preamble what i have to say would seem fantastic to almost anyone outside these walls as would almost everything that goes on within them but ill try not to bore you with too many things you already know mainly ive gathered you together to tell you we have one hell of a problem first ill tell you how it came to be and how it came to light then youll have to tell me how were going to deal with it in which instance i know that even the least of you if there is such a thing has more practical experience than i have in fact youre the only people with practical experience of these things and so the only ones who can deal with the matter in hand he took a deep breath then continued some time ago we appointed a traitor as head of ebranch im talking about wellesley yes well he cant do any more harm but after him it was my job to make sure it couldnt happen again in short we needed someone who was capable of spying on the spies now i know you people have an unwritten code you dont spy on each other so i couldnt use one of you not in situ anyway i had to take one of you out of the branch and make him responsible to myself alone and i had to do it before he could build up too many loyalties so i chose geoffrey paxton a relative newcomer as my watcher over the watchers he at once held up his hands as if to ward off protests though none was forthcoming as yet none of you and i do mean none of you was suspect in any way but after wellesley i couldnt take any chances still id like to have it understood that your personal lives are still yours and no tampering paxton has always been under the strictest instructions not to interfere or pry into anything extraneous but confine himself solely to branch business which is to say branch security a few weeks ago we had some business in the mediterranean two of our members layard and jordan had come up against unpleasant opposition it was the worst sort of business but not without precedent the head of ebranch darcy clarke went out there with harry keogh and sandra markham to see what could be done later trask and chung joined them and they also had help from other quarters as for qualifications clarke and trask both had experience of that sort of thing and keogh well keogh is keogh if he could be reactivated get his talents back that would be a wonderful bonus for the branch but initially he went out as an observer and adviser for no one knew more about vampirism than he did and here he paused perhaps significantly now we still dont know exactly what happened out there in rhodes the greek islands romania but we do know that we lost trevor jordan ken layard and sandra markham i mean lost them dead so it can be seen they had a real problem one which darcy clarke would have us believe is now resolved harry keogh of course could tell us everything but so far hes chosen to tell us very little by now the breathing of the ministers audience was quite audible perhaps even heavy impatient and he saw that someone had stood up since the light was on the podium he had to squint to see who it was on his feet back there in the shadows but in a little while he made it out to be the very tall skeletally thin hunchman or prognosticator ian goodly yes mr goodly minister goodly answered his highpitched voice shrill but not unnaturally or unusually so i know you wont be offended by any sort of imagined implication when i say that so far every word youve said has been spoken with absolute honesty and integrity it came straight from the heart was told the way you see it and with the best of intentions i dont think anyone here doubts that or that it takes a brave sort of man to come in here and try to tell us anything especially in the knowledge that there are people here who could pick your mind clean in a moment the minister nodded i dont know about the bravery bit but everything else is correct whats more it puts any sort of subterfuge right out of the question it can be seen you people can surely see that i have no axe to grind so are you making a point mr goodly the point is that i do have an axe to grind sir goodly answered quietly we all do and the way this briefing is going it strikes me as likely we could have several axes to grind before youre through not with you you understand that would be pointless anyway for my talent tells me that youre going to be our minister responsible for a long time to come so not with what youve said or what you think but maybe with what youve done and plan to do or plan to ask us to do unless of course there are some damn good reasons do you mind explaining the ministers confusion was mounting but briefly because i really do have to get on and explanations are easy someone else was on his no her feet millicent cleary a pretty little telepath whose talent was as yet embryonic she merely glanced at the minister but scowled furiously at the back of paxtons head where he sat in the first row of seats some explanations anyway i mean it was inevitable wed be monitored eventually but by that and still scowling she tossed her head to give the final word extra emphasis she was pointing at paxton miss er in his confusion the minister had forgotten her name he prided himself on not forgetting names he looked at her looked at paxton cleary she said millicent and she breathlessly continued paxton didnt follow your instructions he simply ignored your orders branch security branch business oh that was the handy excuse you gave him which he scarcely needed but other peoples business more like and his nose right in it the minister was frowning he looked harder at paxton can you be more specific miss cleary but she wouldnt she could but wouldnt what and tell everyone here that during paxtons first month with the branch shed caught the shrivelled little scumbag in her mind one night playing with himself to the purr of her vibrator and the tingling of her senses he looked at all of us someone else saved her his voice strong and gravelly he looked at the juicy bits which like it or not we each and every one of us have and he was doing it before you gave him his brief since when why by now hes probably looked at your juicy bits too and back to the gangling goodly again minister if you hadnt taken paxton out of the organization we would have hes about as trustworthy as a defective contraceptive if aids was a psychic disease all our brains would be shrivelling to shit right now all of them he paused to let that sink in and after a moment so it seems to us that what youve done is to take away the one man we all trust while at the same time giving us a watchdog who snaps at his keepers yes and youve chosen one hell of a time to do it that was twice hed cursed and it wasnt goodlys style to swear at all not even mildly paxton had been cleaning his fingernails apparently unconcerned but now his ears reddened up a little he stood up and turned round glared at the others where they all stared at him in silent accusation my talent is unruly he snapped also its eager full of all the enthusiasm which you jealous bastards have lost im still finding out about it still experimenting it isnt some bloody bonsai tree you can just force into any old shape almost as one person they shook their heads they were the last people he should ever try to convince his pallid lame excuses wouldnt work on them each and every one of them they had it in for paxton finally ben trask spoke up giving their single unified thought shape and substance youre a liar paxton he said quite simply and because trask was what he was he didnt have to enlarge upon his accusation the minister felt as if hed bumped into a hornets nest and for his pains or by them was being driven off course which he really couldnt afford to let happen he held up his hands took on a harder more authoritative tone of voice for gods sake put your feuding and personal feelings aside he cried at least for the moment or for as long as it takes whatever else any one of you is or isnt theres one thing we can at least be sure of youre all human which hit them like a truck seeing that he now had their attention and while he retained the upper hand the minister turned pleadingly to ben trask mr trask but levelheaded if you please will you repeat what you told me downstairs trask looked at him grudgingly but nodded only first let me finish telling them what you started they already know most of it and have probably guessed the rest so ill get straight to it and it just might come easier if they hear it from me very well the minister replied sighing his relief and trask began zek föener gave us a helping hand in the greek islands he said youll know who she is from the keogh files what happened at perchorsk and on starside etc shes a powerful telepath one of the worlds best but like the necroscope himself shes opted out of cloak and daggery anyway it was dodgy out there in the med we were killing vampires and there were plenty of times when they nearly killed us but harry took the brunt of it and went up against the big one janos ferenczy himself and i know i dont have to tell you about the ferenczys when harry was in romania that last time just before the end zek tried to get in touch with him to see how things were going but telepathy over great distances isnt easy and she didnt get too much at least thats what she told us but we could see that what she did get shocked her rigid i know darcy clarke has been worried stiff about it for the fact is darcy thinks the necroscopes the best thing since sliced bread i know several of you also think so and hell so do i or i used to so we did the job and came back and as far as we know harry was successful too it seems he made a great job of it except hes been a bit cagey about what actually happened up in the carpathians now me i havent read too much into that nor has darcy clarke for after all harry did lose sandra markham out there so darcy was going to let him get it off his chest in his own good time for which or so it would seem darcys been sort of reduced to the ranks decommissioned bust etc but for what thats what id like to know for inefficiency in that he maybe didnt want to prejudge an old friend for holding back awhile and not going off halfcocked for having shit just a little faith both the minister and paxton opened their mouths as if to butt in but trask cut them out with the thing you have to remember about darcy clarke is this that his talent doesnt go sneaking into other peoples minds eavesdropping or spying from a distance all it does is look after darcy but hes kept in touch with the necroscope and so far theres nothing to report darcys talent didnt warn him of any immediate danger if it had you can bet your life hed have been the first to yell the last thing hed want is for another yulian bodescu to be out and about but paxton started shut your face trask told him these people are still listening to someone telling the truth only the truth and he eventually continued anyway that was all yesterday and today is today and now things seem to have changed he paused and looked at the minister did you want to take it from there sir the minister gave him a grim look and raised an eyebrow but you havent told it all mr trask trask gritted his teeth but nodded and after a moment im just back from a job he said its this serial killer thing weve been working on these brutal horrific murders of young women the thing is darcy had approached harry for his help on this one because you know thats what the necroscope is the one man in the world who can talk to a victim after shes dead and darcy told me how harry had been especially upset by the death of the latest one a girl called penny sanderson well two days ago penny turned up like a bad penny eh but he wasnt grinning now this girl was dead and gone for ever and yet suddenly here she is right as rain back home with her old folks and the point is she couldnt even convince them that she hadnt been murdered they had seen her body theyd known it was their daughter they regarded her return as nothing short of a miracle the police werent happy with any of this oh she had a story to tell but it rang like a cracked bell and if she really was penny sanderson then who had been cremated so the minister sent me up there to sit on a standard police procedure interview of course i was their liedetector well she was is penny sanderson she wasnt lying about that but she was lying about her loss of memory and what all so knowing the keogh connection i just sort of thought to ask her if she knew him had she ever heard of him or met him and she said no never and just looked blank a barefaced lie which led to my next question except i didnt frame it like a question i simply shrugged and said youre a lucky girl it might easily have been you who was dead and not your double and she looked me straight in the eye and said im sorry for her whoever she was but she had nothing to do with me i didnt die and again she was lying through her teeth well i trust my talent it never has let me down she wasnt sorry for the other girl because there wasnt another girl and her statement that she didnt die a funny way of putting it at best right so the only conclusion i can come to is that penny sanderson did die and that shes now back from the dead the gathered espers let their air out in a concerted sigh all of them and trask finished off with of course i couldnt tell the police shed been what the hell brought back resurrected so i simply said she was ok just how ok she is well thats a different matter at which point the minister responsible took his best yet opportunity to introduce a further item of damning information clarke sent keogh the files on all those murdered girls and up in the castle on the mount in edinburgh he actually let the necroscope talk to penny sanderson er in his own way you understand ben trask despite what he himself had just related still wasnt one hundred per cent convinced but at the time wasnt that the idea so that harry could find out who killed her the minister nodded that was the idea he dabbed at his face with a handkerchief but a bad one it now seems it was paxtons turn hes a telepath he said his voice hardedged defiant harry ben trask stared at him paxton nodded he was into my mind like a ferret down a rathole he warned me off and told me he wouldnt be warning me again also his eyes were feral they shone behind those dark glasses he wears and he doesnt much care for the sunlight youve really been hard at work havent you trask growled but this time he couldnt accuse him of lying look said the other i was given a job to do like the minister said after wellesley he couldnt take any chances so when clarke came back from the greek islands i hooked into him and i learned about his suspicion that maybe keogh was a vampire another thing keogh told me to tell the minister that his worst nightmare had come true ergo keoghs a vampire the minister was quick to add that last isnt proven yet but it is starting to look that way the thing is keogh has had a lot of contact with these creatures close contact maybe this last time there was a little too much contact paxton again look i know im a relative newcomer and you dont much like me and in the past youve all had reason to be grateful for harry keogh but have these things blinded you to the facts ok so you dont want to believe me dont even want to believe yourselves but just think what were up against if were right he can talk to the dead who apparently know a hell of a lot he uses the möbius continuum to go anywhere he wants to instantly like we take a step into another room hes a telepath and now he not only speaks to the dead but calls them back too he could do that before said ben trask not without a shudder but now he calls them back to what looks like life paxton was relentless from their ashes life or undeath at which david chung gave a mighty start reeled like someone had hit him and choked something out in cantonese most of the espers were on their feet by now but chung gropingly found a chair and flopped down again frowning the minister responsible said mister chung chungs pallor gave his face a sickly lemon tint he wiped his shining brow and licked his lips and again mumbled something to himself in chinese then he looked up and his eyes were wide you all know what i do he said his words a little sibilant and clipped in his fashion im a locator sympathetic i take a model or a piece of something and use it to find the real thing its branch policy that i take and keep safe from each one of you a small item of your personal belongings this is for your own safety if you go missing i can find you well i also have several items belonging to harry keogh stuff hes left here from time to time i was out in the mediterranean with the others i knew zek föener had been worried about something and so i too have been keeping tabs on harry i told myself it was for his own good but i knew what i was doing and what i was looking for at first when i scried on him it was just him there was nothing different it felt right i got a picture of him you know not doing anything just a picture of him as i knew him up there at his home in edinburgh or wherever he was but recently the picture has been dim misty and last night and this morning there wasnt much of harry there at all just a mist a fog i was going to submit a report on it tomorrow in the old days trask said we used to call that mindsmog its what you get when you try to scan a vampire i know chung nodded he was more nearly recovered now it was partly that which hit me and partly something else paxton said that harry could call dead people up from their ashes thats what hit me the most what the minister was frowning again chung looked at him i also have things which used to belong to trevor jordan he said and this morning just by accident i happened to touch one of them it was like trevor was right here right next door or down the street and i thought it was something out of my memory it was there and then it was gone but it just struck me that he very well could have been here just down the street the minister still hadnt taken it in but trask soon took care of that pale as a ghost he whispered my god jordan was cremated out in rhodes burned to ashes in case hed been infected with vampirism but jesus now that i think of it i remember how it was harry keogh who insisted on it part two four years earlier the icelands the great wamphyri lords belath lesk the glut menor maimbite lascula longtooth and tor tornbody were no more all of these and many lesser wamphyri lights their lieutenants and warriorcreatures all wiped out by the dweller and his father in the battle for the dwellers garden that battle was lost the kilometrehigh aeries of the wamphyri all except the lady karens reduced to so much stone and bone and cartilage rubble by the massed explosions of methanebelching gasbeasts and the wamphyri masters of starside themselves brought low in the aftermath of their humiliating defeat now shaithis onceleader of the vampire army turned his hybrid flyers head into a wind whistling out of the bitter north and rising on its waft set course for the icelands he was not the first of the wamphyri to venture that way over the centuries others had gone before him exiled or fled there and after the battle at the garden certain survivors of his army had headed that way too better the icelands whatever they held in store than the awesome weapons of the dweller and his father aye those two father and son mere men but men with talents men come out of the helllands beyond the spheregate who used the power of the sun itself to blow away the protoplasmic metamorphic flesh of the wamphyri into superheated gas and stinking evaporation harry keogh and his son called the dweller they had destroyed shaithiss army ruined his plans reduced him almost to nothing but almost nothing is still something and in all creation there does not exist anything more tenacious than a vampire shaithis if it were at all possible and given even the smallest opportunity would build on the vestigial power which he still was to become something again and if and when that day should come then the helllanders would pay yes and all who had stood alongside them in the battle for the garden the lady karen had stood with them treacherous wamphyri bitch shaithis jerked hard on the leather reins yanking the gold bit in his flyers mouth until it tore the flesh there the creature once a man a traveller but hideously changed now through shaithiss mutative art uttered a complaining grunt through pluming nostrils and flapped its manta wings more rapidly lifting higher still in the frosty air as if to reach for the cold diamond stars behind shaithis suddenly the mountains were split by a golden bombburst of searing light a sliver of sunlight struck like a spear at him from beyond the barrier mountains from sunside he felt it glance against his robe of black bat fur and cringed and knew that hed flown too high sunup the suns slow creep was bringing its molten yellow rim into view cold as he was shaithis could feel it burning on his back mindlinked to a flying beast made in large part from a man now shaithis instructed his weird mount glide a waste of mental effort however small for the flyer too had felt the suns menacing rays its enormous manta wings tilted upwards at their tips and stilled their pulsing its head went down as it slid into a shallow glide shaithis sighed his relief and returned to his black brooding the lady karen a mother some said whose vampire would one day bring forth a hundred eggs out of her body there would be aeries again on starside in some unforeseen future and all of them inhabited by karens black brood and the bitch herself hivequeen of all the wamphyri doubtless there would be a truce between karen and the dweller peace between them even bonds of flesh how that could ever be shaithis was at a loss even to think but hadnt he with his own eyes seen harry keogh and karen together in her stack her aerie on starside which alone stood where all the rest were tumbled into ruins karen without exception each and every vampire lord had lusted after her body and her blood and if things had gone their way in the battle for the dwellers garden shaithis would have been first with her now there was a thought to savour karen shaithis remembered her as he had once seen her at a meeting of all the wamphyri lords in karens aerie her hair was burnished copper seeming to burn it bounced like fine spun gold on her shoulders competing with the golden bangles she wore on her arms gold rings on a slender golden chain around her neck supported her clinging sheath of a gown which left her jutting left breast and right buttock exposed or very nearly so that with no undergarments the effect had been explosive if the lords who saw her like that had worn wargauntlets and if the meetings agenda had been anything less than of the utmost importance then certainly the lustier lords might have fought over her and who among the wamphyri was not lusty from one pale perfect shoulder had depended a smoky black cloak skilfully woven from the fur of desmodus which shimmered with a weave of fine golden stitches on her feet sandals of pale leather similarly stitched in gold and dangling from the lobes of her ears golden discs fretted with her sigil which was the head of a snarling wolf she had been breathtaking shaithis had felt the thoughts of his fellow lords turn hot as their blood and hed known they all wanted to be into her even the thoughts of the slyest most devious of them shaithis himself had been diverted which of course had been the witchs purpose aye a clever one karen he could still see her burning on his minds eye her body had the sinuous motion of traveller women when they danced which yet seemed so unaffected as to be innocent her face heartshaped with a lock of that fiery hair coiled on her brow likewise could have been innocent except her red eyes gave her away her mouth was full curved in a perfect bow the colour of her lips like blood was accentuated by her pale slightly hollow cheeks only her nose marred looks otherwise entirely stunning it was a fraction tilted stubby with nostrils just a little too round and dark and perhaps her ears halfhidden in her hair showing whorls like the strange orchids of sunside beautiful but wamphyri aye shaithis shivered even shaithis not from the cold but from his lust and from his loathing it was a tremor which coursed through him like the vibrating burn of electricity and it was the sure recognition of his ambition to destroy the dweller had been all of it upon a time but now there was more one day karen shaithis promised himself out loud his voice a low rumble one day if there is justice i shall have you ah and while i fill you to brimming on the one hand on the other ill empty you to the last drop i will feed a straw of gold directly into your heart and for every milky driblet your sex drains from me i shall suck a spurt of scarlet from you thus of our depletions mine will be temporary while yours yours alas will be permanent so shall it be it was his wamphyri oath and scowling into the bitter wind shaithis flew north the suns slow rising over sunside could not catch shaithis of the wamphyri flying however slowly around the curve of the vampire world toward its roof still his going was faster and farther than the sun could chase him so that in a little while he reached and passed that margin beyond which the suns rays never fell and after that he knew that he was in the icelands shaithis had never been much of a one for legends and histories of the icelands he knew only those details which were items of gossip or matters of common knowledge that the sun never shone there was selfevident but rumour also had it that if one crossed the polar cap and kept going then that hed find more mountains and fresh territories for the conquering no one in living memory had tested the legend however at least not of his own free will for the great stacks of starside had been the places of the wamphyri their homes and aeries since time immemorial but that was yesterday and now it appeared that the myth would be tested in full as for the creatures of the icelands in the margins of its oceans some said great hotblooded fishes spouted vast as the mightiest warrior and with shovel mouths that scooped the sea for smaller prey they swam there from some eastern ocean along a warm river that ran in the sea itself it sounded like a lie to shaithis aye and there were bats too which also ate the smallest fishes these were miniature albinos and dwelled in caverns of ice and were attuned to wamphyri minds as were their kith and kin in more hospitable parts another myth to be tested other than the whales and the snowbats shaithis had heard of bears like the small brown bears of sunside but huge and pure white which hid indistinguishable in the snow and ice to leap out on unwary wanderers but again he would see what he would see none of these things held anything of terror for him they were life and life is blood and conversely as in an old wamphyri saying the blood is the life for the equivalent of two and a half days earthtime shaithis flew steadily north until at the end of one huge glide and when it was time for his flyer to climb again he spied bears basking in starlight on a floe at the rim of an icecrusted sea shaithiss flyer was tired its fats liquids and metamorphic flesh depleted starside had been cold but the icelands were colder far this place would be as good as any to stop and rest a while for shaithis was tired too and hungry where a cliff of ice towered over the sea he brought his flyer down commanding it to remain there while he strode out along the frozen shore the elevation of the place would make it a good launching platform when it was time to get under way again a quartermile away the bears sensed him coming a pair of them towered to their hind feet on the tilting floe sniffing the air suspiciously and grunting their annoyance they were females and cubs tumbled from underfoot as they commenced to roar their furious warnings shaithis smiled grimly and came on their roaring was a challenge his wamphyri nature reacted to it his face elongated and needle teeth scythed through the cartilage of his jaws and gums like an eruption of bone daggers his mouth filled with the salt taste of his own blood and that too served to speed his monstrous metamorphosis the vampire lord was only an inch or two less than seven feet tall but the shebears where they rumbled and roared on the float of ice and threatened to tip it over were all of that and twelve inches more at least their paws were three times the size of shaithiss hands and tipped with claws sharp enough to spear fish dead in the water at a thrust and ah he thought good strong flesh and ferocious fighters born what warriors i could build from such as you now he was only a hundred yards away and that was too close for the nursing mothers plunging into bitter slapping wavelets they struck out for the shore theyd see this creature off or kill him if the first good enough and if the second well hed make good red meat for the cubs shaithis fifty yards away from them where they left the water and shook themselves on all fours like huge white shaggy dogs took his wargauntlet from his hip and thrust his right hand into it come on then ladies he urged with his telepathic mind not knowing if they heard him and caring less for ive come a long hungry way and a cold hungry way yet to go still his hand was only twothirds the size of one of theirs but deadlier far he spread wide his fingers inside the gauntlet and the grotesque palm was a great rasp of cutting edges blades and scythes and clenching his hand as nearly as possible to a fist razor spines stood up inches from the knuckles and four sharpfiled iron punches sprang out to point forward like ramrods the bears were charging the smaller one but only inches smaller leading the larger on shaithis had chosen the site of the battle he shrugged off his cloak stood tall and central on a flat cake of ice frozen in a field of sharp jumbled iceboulders the bears were disadvantaged came slipping and sliding over the rough terrain they roared and the vampire lord roared back which served to increase their fury before shaithis had appeared more or less human now he was anything but human his skull had elongated to that of a wolf the gape of his mouth was enormous where white needle teeth meshed like those of a shark his long and sloping nose had broadened and flattened to his face growing convoluted and sensitive as the snout of a bat even if he were blinded that snout and his whorllike ears would track the movements of his opponents as surely as his scarlet eyes his right hand inside its gauntlet had expanded to fill that fearsome weapon and give it yet more weight while his left hand was now lizardlike and taloned whose fingers were tipped with sharp chitin chisels so that for all his manlike silhouette in fact he had become a composite warriorcreature wamphyri the leading shebear came at a shambling run rearing upright as she entered the arena of battle shaithis let her come and at the last moment crouched low and hurled himself forward into her massive legs he clung there reached round behind hamstrung her with one clawing rake of his gauntlet howling she crashed down on him and before he could escape the tangle tore open his back to the spine the moment he felt the pain he killed it willed it away and kicking himself free of the crippled bear he looked for its larger companion she was on him huge paws groped for him where he skidded on his damaged back and crushing jaws fastened in the left forearm he held up before his face for protection but as her great head worried at his arm and her claws tore his body so shaithis swung his gauntlet in a deadly arc it smacked against her head demolishing her left ear and slicing into the eye so that she at once reared upright and away dragging shaithis to his feet his left arm had been released but was crushed temporarily useless if she should fasten those great jaws of hers around his neck or shoulder hed be finished bloodied and roaring her pain and fury she shook her red torn head and sent pearls of blood flying in shaithiss eyes he ignored them and as she lowered her jaws towards his face thrust his gauntlet direct into her yawning cave of a mouth teeth like the heads of clawhammers sheared as the gauntlet crunched through them shaithis drove that terrible weapon in deeper yet wrenched it to and fro enlarging her throat then tore downwards into her gullet she staggered this way and that her great arms beating uselessly shaithis opened his gauntlet in her mouth wrenched it free dislocated what was left of her bottom jaw shed not bite him now and while still she flailed he swung his gauntlet again this time with its iron punches extended they slammed into her skull through the red debris of her ear and crushed the delicate bone inwards penetrating to her brain she was done she puffed and snorted and swayed pawing uselessly at empty air shaithis gathered all his remaining strength to drive his gauntlet one last time through the ruin of her flapping jaw and into the back of her throat where he gripped crushed and severed the spinal column virtually decapitated she was dead on her feet for a single moment and in the next the ice shook as her great body thudded down upon it shaithis leaped on her buried his awful face in the pulp of her head filled himself with steaming crimson the blood is the life in a while he stood up a small distance away the other bear left a trail of blood where it crawled in crazy patterns on the ice dragging its useless rear legs behind it shaithis fought down his own pain as he went to the crippled creature when chance permitted he ripped away the muscles and tendons first from one foreleg then the other when finally the bear was totally incapacitated he tore open its throat and let out the remaining bulk of its life steaming onto the ice and again he took hot reeking blood and felt himself growing strong some little distance away his flyer nodded its great swaying diamondshaped head at the top of the icecliffs shaithis stood up and commanded it come the thing came slipping and slithering at the rim its many legs uncoiled like whipping snakes to thrust it into its launch and it soared out over the sea then dipped one huge manta wing turned and came back it settled to the ice a respectful distance away then at shaithiss insistence came flopping to where the carcases waited meanwhile the vampire lord had cut out the great smoking hearts of the bears and put them in a pouch for later he backed off and sat down on a stump of ice and eat he commanded his flyer fuel yourself and in the streaming moon and starlight the changeling beast took back much of its lost heat fats and liquids aye eat well shaithis told it therell be no more strong meat like this awhile not until im healed anyway and then gradually he let all his pain free to creep in on him the agony of his split back and crushed arm and his broken ribs where theyd tested the bears pummelling pain great pain his vampire felt it all the more spur to that thing within him to be about the healing i pain aye there were times like this after a battle hard j fought and won when pain was warmer than the warm succulent core of a woman it was shaithiss pride to let it wash over him and to feel the scars of his body start to heal perhaps he would keep some of them open or scabbed at best as mementoes of his victory except who would there be to admire them after a flight as long again finally shaithis spied the icecastles where they gleamed under the serpentine writhings of polar aurora they could only be stacks aeries surely his heart beat faster in his great breast wamphyri here what manner of creatures would they be dwelling in the subzero temperatures of the icelands albinos like the mythical bats growing their own white fur for warmth what would be their sustenance and perhaps more to the point how would they react to the lord shaithis he took his flyer up to higher altitudes the better to spy out the icelocked land around farther north possibly at the northernmost extreme a string of dead volcanoes thrust up their crater cones through ice and drifted snow in both directions east and west they dwindled away as far as shaithiss eyes could see marching out of view across glittering icy horizons some were cased in ice others showed their naked stone from which shaithis deduced that the unclad mountains must still retain a measure of their former fire to reinforce his opinion he noted that the central and largest cone even appeared to issue a little smoke but the effect came and went and could be an illusion of the general dazzle stardazzle and auroradazzle the entire roof of the world was lit as by some weird blue daylight not that light was especially important to the wamphyri no for the night was their element eyes such as theirs could see even in the darkest places as for the icestacks shaithis gave them his keenest possible scrutiny they were mere molehills compared to the oncemighty bone and stone stacks of starside and even the tallest would be less than half the height of the lowliest aerie where they were not coated with snow it could be seen that their ice was of the purest like vast inverted icicles they grew up in concentric circles away from the central volcano also where the light struck through them at their peaks he saw that they were pure ice through and through but at their bases many seemed to have stony cores perhaps in its heyday the central volcano had thrown out great gobs of stuff all around forming splashes of hot rock in these rippling rings like a handful of mud tossed into a pool and then through the centuries icesheaths had accumulated gradually building into these jagged sharplypointed stacks it seemed as likely an explanation as any that the icecastles were not fit habitation seemed obvious at first and shaithis might well have flown on but then he saw what looked like an exhausted indeed frozen flyer at the base of one such castle and went down for a closer look again choosing an icecliffs rim for a landing site he left his flyer and walked a halfmile to that which he had seen from on high lying crumpled in frozen snow a flyer aye much rimed emaciated and seemingly dead seemingly but no one knew better than shaithis of the wamphyri how hard it was actually to kill such a creature like the vampire lords who made them they were created to endure he sent a telepathic message to the brain of the great diamondshaped blanket of a thing all of fifty feet across its wingtips that it should stir itself rise up it did no such thing which hardly surprised him their small brains were rarely attuned to any mind other than their masters but he might have expected a small twitch of curiosity at least if only for the fact that some strange wamphyri lord had issued the beast an instruction however invalid there had been no such twitch wherefore its brain must be dead likewise of course the great envelope of flesh which enclosed it then clambering over the cold humped ridge of its central body to the base of its neck at the forward junction of wings shaithis spied its saddle and trappings and recognized the familiar blazon of its makermaster tooled into the leather a face in caricature grotesque and distorted from its weight of mighty wens and warts and then shaithis smiled his sardonic smile and nodded the flyer had been the lord pinescus creature volse pinescu that most ugly of all the wamphyri whose habit it had been to foster running sores and festoons of boils all over his face and body in order that his aspect would be that much more terrifying so volse was here eh shaithis was somewhat surprised for he had seen the lords pinescu and fess ferenc crash their crippled flyers in clouds of dust on starsides plain of boulders after the battle at the dwellers garden and hed thought that must be the end of them either that or theyd have to travel north on foot in volses case obviously hed been wrong patently the wily old devil had kept a flyer in reserve just in case and what of the ferenc as that one liked to be known could he also be here fess ferenc aye one man or monster of which to be exceedingly wary standing at a hundred inches tall the ferenc would have dwarfed even the great shebears which shaithis had killed for meat and he alone of all the wamphyri carried no gauntlet no need for his hands were murderous talons well well things might yet prove interesting in these terrible icelands shaithis sat in volses saddle and chewed on bearheart and he called to his flyer come eat as his creature arrived and settled to the ice shaithis got down and strode the circumference of the dead beasts body and so discovered a great hole eaten into its side where blood vessels as fat as his thumb had been sliced through and sucked upon then tied off with knots at which he rightly guessed that volse pinescu had survived his stricken mount which begged the question where was volse now shaithis extended his vampire awareness sent out a sweeping telepathic probe not to speak to anyone but to listen for someone he heard nothing or perhaps the echo of a minds or minds shutters swiftly slammed shut if volse and fess were here they werent speaking and again shaithis smiled his sardonic smile no one applauds a loser it would be different if he had won the battle for the dwellers garden but of course it would for if hed won then he wouldnt be here while his flyer feasted shaithis looked up at the icecastle the cold glittering sculpture was mainly natures work but not all of it the rims of crude steps in the ice had been rounded by time but upon a time they had been cut they led up to an arched entrance under a facade of mighty icicles inside the core was of stone dark and uninviting shaithis climbed the steps entered the icecastle was aware of crusted rime crunching under his feet where at first he strode then crept through a mazy ice labyrinth for as he went so he became aware that there was something dreadful here or that something dreadful had happened here and for the first time since the dweller he felt himself in awe of the unknown the place echoed and moaned the echoes were mainly his but changed by the cavities and convolutions of the icecastle into dull bass grindings and slidings like floes crushing together in a heaving sea or great icedoors rumbling shut and the moaning was the freezing wind echoing in the spires of the place distorted and amplified by the ice into the agonies of dying monsters unless he were acclimatized shaithis spoke to himself in a whisper for company if for nothing else i cannot see how a man even a vampire might live here oh he could for a while possibly through a span of a hundred sunups except here it is always sundown but finally the cold would get him yes and i can see how that would be the aching cold creeping into his bones until eventually even wamphyri flesh would freeze his heart beating ever more slowly pumping thickening icecrystal blood through shivering veins and arteries at last he would stiffen and lose all mobility and the ice wax upon him until finally he sat upon an icethrone within a glassy stalactite thinking slow frozen thoughts from the core of his icebrain being wamphyri if he were wamphyri he would not die at least not until the ice shifted and sheared him or ground him away but what would that be for life my ancestors disposed of their enemies in three ways those whom they scorned they buried undead to become fossils in their graves those who worked mischief against them they banished to the icelands and those whom they feared were driven into the sphere gate on starside who can say which penalty was the most severe to go to hell to turn to ice or to stiffen into a stone i for one would not care to be a block of ice these thoughts breathed aloud were carried away as whispers amplified and thrown back as gales of sound it was like whispering in some echoing cavern or grotto except that these caves of ice were that much more resonant in the high vaulted ceilings icicles tinkled then shivered into shards and came crashing down some were quite large so that shaithis must leap aside at that and when things had quietened a little he decided to vacate the place at which precise moment there sounded in his telepathic mind a far faint quavery voice is it you shaitan come after all this time to discover and devour me then you should know that i welcome it im here up here come get it over with the cold centuries have chilled even my oncefierce wamphyri passions so come make haste and snuff this last lowflickering flame exiles startled shaithis fell into a defensive crouch turned in a slow circle gazed all about he saw only ice but knew now for certain that this place contained more than that and at last crimson eyes slitted he concentrated his own thoughts into a probe who speaks what the infirm quavery voice spoke again in his mind and shaithis sensed a derisory snort dont make me laugh shaitan you know well enow who speaks or have the long lonely years addled your wits kehrl lugoz speaks old fiend we were exiled together we dwelled awhile in the caves of the cone we were companions for as long as there was meat but when the meat was finished our friendship went with it and i fled while i could kehrl lugoz shaithis frowned as he strove to remember wamphyri legends almost as old as the race itself and this shaitan which the hidden speaker referred to not the shaitan surely he frowned again and as suspicion turned to curiosity asked where are you where ive been for how long preserved in the ice undead thats where i am dreaming in my frozen hell of endless time and you shaitan how has it been for you has the cone kept you warm or are its fires returned to drive you out dreaming in a frozen hell the very scenario shaithis had conjured only a moment or two ago yes and he believed that whoever this kehrl lugoz was who spoke to him indeed he spoke from a dream perhaps the crashing of great icicles had roused him up somewhat from his sleep youre wrong he said then relaxing a little for im not shaitan a son of his sons perhaps but my name is shaithis not shaitan oh ha ha ha the other seemed to find his words bitterly amusing the lord of liars even to the end eh shaitan perverse as ever aye you were the worst of a bad lot well what does it matter now come for me if you will or begone and let me return to my dreaming the voice faded as its owner sank down again into permafrost dreams but shaithis concentrating all of his vampire senses to their full believed hed located its source im up here that mental voice had told him at the onset somewhere up above shaithis was in the heart of the carved windfretted icecastle now there locked in clear ice all of three feet thick he could see a massive central core of volcanic rock thrusting raggedly up like the ossified root of a glass tooth a splash of stony spittle from the ancient volcano and there climbing the face of the icesheath where it covered the castles lava foundations carved into its cold crystal contours glassy steps wound up out of sight into grottoes of gleaming ice there was nothing for it but to follow them the vampire lord mounted the frostrimed stairs and climbed to the jagged peak of the core where its last black igneous fang pointed straight up as if threatening to break out of its sheath and staring through ice hard as stone finally shaithis spied the author of the mindmessages hed heard in the corridors below there in bluegleaming heart of ice seated upright in a lava niche with one hand resting lightly upon a ridge of rock as upon the arm of a favourite chair a man ancient as time weary withered and weird encased as surely as any fly in amber his eyes were closed his frozen body motionless his mien severe as his fate and yet he sat there proudly with his head held high upon a scrawny neck and with that certain something in his aspect which spoke mutely but definitely of his origin the fact that he was wamphyri kehrl lugoz whoever he had been no whoever he still was shaithis put out a hand to the wall of smooth ice pressed down hard until his palm was cold and flat a minute went by then another until finally thud it was faint so very faint and farseeming but it was still there and after a pause of two more minutes thud and so on kehrl lugoz lived however protracted his heartbeat however fossilized his body and it was very nearly fossilized still he lived except and as shaithis had already inquired of himself what was this for life he stared hard at the shrivelled thing studying it through three feet of ice which however pure nevertheless blurred the picture and shifted its focus with shaithiss every smallest motion and now he believed he knew the answer to that other question hed recently asked himself which was worse to be buried undead or sent into the helllands or banished here and the vampire lord shivered at the thought of all the nameless centuries gone by since kehrl lugoz had come up here and sat himself down and waited for the ice to form thud and this time because hed been lost in his own thoughts and was startled shaithis snatched back his hand kehrl lugoz was too old even to guess at his age the wamphyri when they age do not necessarily show it shaithis himself was more than five hundred years of age yet looked no older than a wellpreserved fifty but in the face of privations such as this one had known it simply couldnt be hidden yes lugoz looked almost as old as time the eyebrows above his closed steeply slanted eyes were bushy white locked in ice like the rest of him his hair was white as a halo of snow over a brow wrinkled and brown as a walnut with white sideboards which frizzed out wildly to halfobscure his conchlike ears his ancient face was not so much wrinkled as grooved mummified like a trog kept overlong in its cocoon until wasted the grey cheeks were sunken in the chin pointed with a thin wisp of white beard fluffing there eyeteeth like fangs overshot the withered lower lip they were yellow and the one on the left was broken thered been insufficient strength in the frozen vampire to grow another the nostrils in the squat convoluted nose more properly a bats snout than was usual in most of the wamphyri showed signs of fretting disease shaithis supposed and a huge purple wen was visible bulging under the chin like the puffed mating wattle of one of sunsides birds as for kehrl lugozs garb he wore a simple black robe its hood thrown back wide sleeves floppy about his scrawny wrists and hem loose around his chickens calves except of course the sleeves and hem were not loose but frozen in ice hard as stone his hands where they protruded from his robe were extremely longfingered with sharp pointed nails and upon his right index he wore a large ring of gold shaithis could not make out its sigil veins stood out white in the backs of his hands instead of olive or purple before he froze himself this one had gone without blood for long and long wake up shaithis sent i want to know your history your secrets indeed for it would seem to me that you are wamphyri history this shaitan you speak of do you mean shaitan the unborn he and his disciples were banished to the icelands in the very dawn of legends but still here how no i cannot believe it wake up kehrl lugoz answer my questions nothing came back the old thing in the ice had returned to his dreaming his shrivelled heart continued to thud but it seemed to shaithis more slowly yet he was dying longevity even suspended animation is not immortality damn you shaithis snarled out loud his curse echoed back to him along with other echoes from the bowels of the icecastle he waited until the echoes had died away and only the weird moaning of icewinds remained then sent out his vampire awareness all around was anyone there well if there was someone then he was adept at shielding his presence except suddenly shaithis remembered his flyer which hed left feeding if someone should find it out there he reached out his mind to the creature discovered it gorging still cursed long and loud but this time silently and to himself hed never get the beast aloft now but at least he could send it away from here go he commanded it flop waddle squirm slither but go westward half a mile at least and there hide as best you can anyway and in his mind he felt the stupid creature moving instantly to obey him then satisfied that the flyer would put distance between itself volses dead creature and what or whoever else might possibly be in the vicinity shaithis returned to the problem at hand earlier the old thing in the ice had been awakened by a fall of icicles so be it exploring an upper terrace the vampire lord found a vast spout of ice like a frozen waterfall and at its fringe many lesser formations one of these icicles some four feet long and nine inches through its stem he snapped off and carried back to the iceencased husk of kehrl lugoz since the petrified old fool couldnt be roused by mental means let him start awake at the entirely physical shattering of this great blade of ice against his sheath fully absorbed in his task shaithis failed to detect the furtive approach of others up the ice staircase he shouted telepathically at the frozen icedistorted figure where it sat kehrl lugoz wake up then swung back his icicle hammer to smash it against the face of lugozs sheath but the great icicle refused to swing because something was impeding it hissing and spitting his shock from the redribbed vault of his throat out over the glistening vibrating arch of his forked tongue eyes bulging and crimson and with his less than human features instinctively flowing into a fearsomely inhuman wolfmask shaithis glanced back over his shoulder then dropped the great icicle and reached for his gauntlet but in that same instant a huge talon of a hand fell upon his wrist and trapped it and shaithis stared into the grim grey faces of two fellow survivors from the battle for the dwellers garden fess ferenc and volse pinescu he snatched back his hand and stumbled away from them damn your hearts he snarled panting but youve learned stealth you two weve learned a great many things volse pinescu choked the words out past a huge scab of crusted pus which halfsealed his lips impeding his speech not least how the invincible vampire army of shaithis of the wamphyri could be burned and blasted and crushed its aeries destroyed and its survivors banished like whipped dogs into eternal wastelands of ice volses boilfestooned face turned purple with fury as he took a heavy threatening step closer to shaithis but the ferencs temper was less volatile with his great height and strength and with his terrible hands he didnt much need to work up a rage in himself weve lost a great deal shaithis he rumbled since coming here its dawned on us just how much aye for this is a cold and lonely place cold shaithis blustered what is cold to the wamphyri youll get used to it volse strained his head forward aggressively and a batch of boils on the left side of his neck burst and spurted their yellow pus on to the ice oh he gurgled like he got used to it dyou mean he inclined his loathsomely decorated head sharply towards kehrl lugoz seated motionless as a mountain not three impenetrable feet away him and all the others weve found encysted in their echoing fortresses of ice others shaithis looked uncertainly from volse to the ferenc then back again dozens of them fess ferenc finally answered nodding his huge acromegalic head all taken to the ice clutching at straws waiting out their time until some magical thaw shall come and free them into a land filled with life or until they die for the cold of this place is not like the cold of starside shaithis here it goes on for ever get used to it now he echoed volse pinescu resist it warm ourselves stoke up our internal fires against it but fires need fuel the blood is the life and with what do we sustain ourselves while were getting used to it blood cools shaithis trickle by trickle hour by hour limbs stiffen and even the stoutest heart runs slow now volse took it up you ask what is cold to the wamphyri hah how often were you cold on starside shaithis ill tell you never the heat of the hunt kept you warm the blaze of battle the hot salt blood of trog or traveller your bed was warm and welcoming at sunup as were the breasts and buttocks of the lusty women who sucked the sting from your tail all of these things you had to keep you warm we all had them and we had a leader who said to us lets band together and take the dwellers garden and now what have we got shaithis looked at the ferenc who shrugged and said we have been here longer than you it is cold and we grow colder worse we grow hungry his voice was now a growl volses hand touched the ugly gauntlet at his hip tentatively perhaps thoughtfully it could mean anything but shaithis backed away and as the threatened lord plunged his hand into his own gauntlet and flexed it there displaying its gleaming knives rasps and cutting edges fess ferenc raised an eyebrow and rumbled two to one shaithis do you like such odds then not especially shaithis hissed but ill make sure you lose at least as much blood as you drink wheres the profit in that volse grunted coughed up yellow phlegm and spat it out i say it would be worth it he went into a crouch and now he too wore his gauntlet but the ferenc only relaxed stepped aside shrugged again and said fight if you wish you two myself id prefer to eat full bellies are less fierce and brains with blood in them more capable of clever scheming his maxim might not fit men but certainly it was applicable to the wamphyri volse seeing he stood alone thought twice and hah he snorted this time at the ferenc but it seems your mind schemes just as well when youre hungry fess for if we were to fight shaithis and i why youd sup on the loser and so make yourself stronger than the winner he nodded and removed his gauntlet im no such fool the ferenc scratched his jutting jaw and grinned however grimly strange but i had always considered you just such a fool shaithis still wary hung his own gauntlet at his belt finally nodded and took out from his pouch a purple heart as big as his fist here if youre so hungry and he tossed it volse snatched it from the air and closed slavering jaws upon it but the ferenc only shook his head red and spurting for me he said while i can get it anyway shaithis frowned and narrowed his eyes suspiciously as the giant started down the icesteps whats your plan he snapped who will you kill not who but what the ferenc answered over his shoulder and ill not kill it but merely deplete it little by little i should think its obvious shaithis and volse went skidding after him what volse questioned round a mouthful of bear heart somethings obvious the ferenc glanced back at him what did you eat when you crashed your exhausted flyer here he said ahhah volse spat out chunks of cold dark flesh what shaithis grabbed the ferencs huge shoulder are you talking about my flyer would you maroon me here for ever the ferenc paused turned looked him straight in the eye two steps lower than shaithis still the giant looked him in the eye and why not he answered since it seems to me that youre the reason were all marooned here no shaithis spat at him and stabbed again for his gauntlet and the ferenc at once swept him from the stairs shaithis fell too depleted and restricted for metamorphosis into an airfoil he could only grit his teeth and wait for gravity to do its worst on the way down he struck several iceledges but suffered no real damage until at the last he crashed down on his shoulder and chest in snow merciful snow blown in through an arched icewindow the drift was three or four feet deep with a thick crust of ice shaithis crunched through the latter compressed the former wrenched his right shoulder and broke a pair of recently healed ribs and then he lay there in his agony and cursed fess ferenc from the depths of his black heart curse me all you will shaithis the ferenc had heard him but im sure youll think better of it of course you will for it was you or your flyer after all volse would have chosen you for theres a vampire in you ah the very essence but personally i think it were better if you live a little while longer at least shaithis stood up staggered away looked for a place to hide he allowed his hurt to wash over him deliberately conjuring all the agonies of his crash on starside when hed broken his body and face and of his fight with the shebears to add to the pain of this latest tumble and these were the false impressions of severe damage which he let flood out of him to be picked up and hopefully wrongly translated by the ferencs vampire mind volse might conceivably read them too but shaithis doubted it the boilfancier was a dullard too much obsessed with the manufacture of abscesses what the ferenc seemed surprised however uncaring that much pain did you crash down facefirst shaithis he offered a grim mental chuckle well and now you know how ive felt all this time for your face has always been hurtful to me aye shaithis could not restrain himself laugh long and loud fess ferenc but remember he who laughs last the ferencs chuckling faded in shaithiss mind and not too seriously hurt then a pity or perhaps you merely put a brave face on it but in any case i think a warning is in order dont interfere shaithis if you think to command your flyer into flight forget it for if we cant find your creature then be sure well come back for you order it to attack us still well triumph in the end for as you know well enow flyers make poor warriors and our thoughts would stab it like arrows and then wed come back for you but only let it be our way and make no protest and for some little time to come well at least youll know where to go when youre hungry and for as long as your flyer lasts and provided we are not in the vicinity when you go to feed then you shall last just precisely so long shaithis of the wamphyri shaithis found a deep sheltered iceniche in the castles labyrinth and hid himself away he wrapped himself in his cloak and toned down his vibrant vampire aura now must be a time of healing perhaps he would sleep and conserve his energy and there was still a little bearheart left over for when he awakened so long as he guarded his thoughts and his dreams alike volse pinescu and fess ferenc would not find him but first there was something he must know why fess he sent out one last telepathic question you could have killed me yet let me live not out of the goodness of your heart surely so why halfway down the icestairs the ferenc smiled with a mouth almost as wide as his face you were ever a thinker shaithis he answered aye and a clever one at that oh youve made mistakes certainly but the man who never made a mistake never made anything the way i see it if theres a way out of this place youll find it and when you do ill be right behind you and if i dont the ferencs mental shrug blood is blood shaithis and yours is good and rich let one thing be clearly understood if this is as far as we go if the ice is our destiny then at the last i shall be the one who sits encased awaiting the great thaw fess ferenc and none other but i shall not go hungry to my fate two exiled wamphyri lords one grotesque and huge and the other hugely grotesque left the glittering icecastle and sniffed the bitter air then let their snouts guide them to shaithiss doomed beast meat was not the flyers usual fare its diet would normally consist of crushed bone grasses from sunside honey and other sweet liquids and some blood having metamorphic flesh however it was capable of consuming almost anything organic on this occasion having gorged itself on the frozen flesh of another flyer it must now rest until the food was digested and converted bloated it no longer lay where the exlords had first spied it beside the gnawed carcass of volses flyer but had found shelter slumped in the lee of a great block of ice half a mile to the west where shaithis had sent it forming great saucer eyes in its leathery flanks the dull stupid thing gloomed on the ferenc and volse pinescu and lolled its diamond head at them as they approached moist and heavylidded its eyes saw but could scarcely comprehend until the flyer was instructed to do something and then by its rightful master shaithis himself it would do nothing not even think oh it would seek to protect itself to a degree but never so far as to harm one of the wamphyri for stabs of concentrated vampire telepathy could sting such creatures like darts bringing them to trembling submission in a moment thus while the flyer would not fly for fess or volse it would lie still for them even when they sliced into its warm underbelly to sever great pipes of veins which they would then suck open shaithis in his niche in the icecastle heard the huge creatures first mental bleat of distress and was tempted to issue orders such as roll crush these men who torment you bound up and fall upon them even now at a distance he could transmit such commands and know that the flyer would instantly instinctively obey him but he also knew that while the beast might injure the lords it could not kill them and he remembered the ferencs warning to set the flyer upon them unless it could be guaranteed to incapacitate them utterly would be to place himself in direst jeopardy which was why he ground his teeth a little but otherwise lay still and did nothing to shaithis it seemed a great waste his good flyer used for food especially since volses flyer literally two tons of excellent if not especially appetizing meat already lay out there going to waste except even that were not entirely true frozen the creature would not waste but remain available for long and long but shaithis knew that there was more than mere hunger in it the ferenc had a purpose other than to fill his belly for one the beast would be left so depleted by this first gluttonous visit of fess and volse that any further aerial voyagings would be out of the question which meant that shaithis was now stuck here no less than the others it was partly the ferencs way of paying him back for his failure in the battle for the dwellers garden but it was mainly something else for the fact was that indeed shaithis had been the great thinker with a capacity for scheming which had set him above and apart even from his own kind the universally devious wamphyri if any man could find his way out of the icelands then shaithis had to be the one an escape which must likewise benefit fess ferenc who would doubtless follow his lead and as fess had so vividly pointed out this was the reason shaithiss life had been spared so that he could concentrate on survival to the benefit of all the exiles that all of course meaning fess ferenc specifically for shaithis had no doubt but that eventually unless there should occur some large and unforeseen reversal the entirely loathsome volse pinescu must surely go the way of all flesh as to why the ferenc had so far suffered volse to live perhaps he simply couldnt abide the thought of eating him shaithis allowed himself a grin however pained and bitter before reexamining the question of volses survival a much more likely explanation would be the loneliness and boredom of these icelands perhaps the giant fess craved companionship certainly shaithis in the short time hed been here had felt a great weight of loneliness pressing down upon him or had he for all that this place appeared utterly dead and empty of any noteworthy intelligence still he was not convinced even here in his iceniche with his thoughts well shielded still there was this instinctive tingle of awareness in his vampire being a suspicion in his vampire mind that someone observed him in his trials possibly but to know or suspect it was one thing and to prove it another entirely wherefore he would now sleep and let his vampire heal him and later turn his attention to matters of more permanent survival not to mention a small matter of revenge of course battening his mind more securely yet shaithis settled down and for the first time felt the cold the physical cold beginning to bite and he knew that the ferenc and volse pinescu had been correct even wamphyri flesh must eventually succumb to a chill such as that of these icelands there could be no denying it not in the face of such evidence as kehrl lugoz then even as shaithis made to close his right eye for the left would remain open even in sleep something small soft and white hovered for a moment before his face finally darting away with tiny nearinaudible chittering cries into upper aeries of undisclosed ice but not before shaithis had recognized it pinkeyed that tiny flutterer with membrane wings and a wrinkled pinkveined snout a dwarf albino bat it gave shaithis an idea by now volse pinescu and the ferenc would be absorbed in their meal probably numb from their gluttony shaithis would risk opening his mind again he reached out and called to the icecastles bats which eventually came to him fearful at first finally they settled to him singly then in twos and threes and at last almost buried him in their soft snowy blanket an entire colony of the creatures they crowded into shaithiss niche and with their small bodies warming him so he slept the minion bats of shaitan the unborn also called the fallen not only warmed shaithis where he slept but also watched him as they had since his arrival they had watched fess ferenc and volse pinescu too also arkis leperson and his thralls both of whom within a period of just two auroral displays arkis had drained before secreting their bloodless corpses in coldstorage in a glacier and a pair of menor maimbites lieutenants released from thraldom by menors death in the battle for the garden all of these had wended their various ways here whose subsequent activities the miniature albinos had faithfully reported back to their immemorial master shaitan the lastmentioned duo extravellers vampirized by menor had been the first of this fresh crop of exiles to get here having exhausted their dead masters finest flyer they had crashed its panting desiccated carcass in the salt sea at the edge of the icelands and covered the last thirty miles afoot then theyd seen the smoke which shaitan deliberately sent up from his chimney and dragged themselves to what might possibly be a warm place well and it had proved warm enough now they turned slowly on bone hooks suspended from the low ceiling of an ancient lava blowhole which opened on the volcanos westfacing flank shaitans icecavern larder the lieutenants had been easy meat they had no vampires in them their minds and flesh had been altered but they were not yet wamphyri given a hundred years or more and they might have been harder to take but time had run out for them right here and now along with all of their rich red blood as for the four wamphyri lords shaitan was rather more leery of them let them fight among themselves first wear themselves out it seemed only prudent in his youth which shaitan scarcely remembered ah it would have been different then hed have had the measure of all of these and four more just like them but three and a half thousand years is a long time and time takes its toll of more than memory indeed of almost everything now he was tired if it must be admitted even his vampire was tired and his vampire was by far the greater part of him not ailing frail or dying tired just tired of the unrelenting cold which periodically would cut through the volcanic rock to the mountains heart even to the blowhole caverns in its roots of the interminably dull routine of existence quite simply of the sameness and emptiness of being in these eternal ageless icelands but not yet tired of life not utterly certainly not to the extent that shaitan would advertise his presence to such as fess volse shaithis and arkis leperson no for when you came right down to it there were plenty of better ways to die aye and now that the exiles were here there might be more and better reasons to stay alive too especially this shaithis indeed with a name like that he might even prove to be the realization the embodiment of a totally new existence this last was only a dream of shaitans true but it had not faded with time while all else had turned grey his dream had stayed clear and bright and red a dream of youth renewed vigour a victorious return to starside and sunside and of laying them waste and then the invasion of worlds beyond shaitans belief his instinctive conviction that indeed such worlds existed had sustained him through all the monotonous centuries of his exile giving purpose to that which was otherwise untenable but while the dream remained young and bright the dreamer had grown old and somewhat tarnished not in his mind but in his body the human parts of shaitan had wasted been replaced by inhuman tissues the metamorphism of his vampire had transcended the deterioration of the host body until the manpart had disappeared almost entirely leaving only rudimentary or vestigial traces of the original flesh organs and appendages but the fused mind of man and vampire remained and for all that a great deal had been forgotten still the accumulation of that minds contents its knowledge was vast and evil shaitans evil was fathomless but he was not mad for intelligence and evil are not incompatible indeed they are complementary the murderer requires a mind to construct his clever alibi an idiot cannot build an atomic weapon evil is the perverse rejection of goodness which in shaitan was absolute his was an evil which might put the universe itself to the torch then gaze upon the cinders and find them good he was darkness lights opposite he could even be said to be the primal darkness which opposed the primal light which was the reason why even the wamphyri had banished him but he knew without knowing how he knew that hed been banished long before that banished by good by some benevolent god no metagnostic still shaitan could conceive of such a one for how may evil exist without good but for now he put such thoughts aside hed thought them for long enough in three and a half thousand years a mind has time to think many things from the remotely trivial to the infinitely profound for the moment his origin was not important but his destiny was and his destiny might well be part and parcel of this man this being called shaithis in the old times the wamphyri had named their sons after themselves bloodsons eggrecipients common vampires all had adopted the name of their sire the custom had changed somewhat but not entirely arkis leperson was the recipient son of his leper father radu arkis arkis the leper theyd called him wherefore his son a traveller lieutenant who more than a century ago found favour in radus scarlet eyes was now arkis leperson he carried radus egg similarly fess ferenc was the bloodson born of woman of ion ferenc his traveller mother died giving birth to the giant whose size was such it impressed his father to let him live a great error that while yet a youth fess had killed ion then opened his body to steal and devour his vampire egg whole this way ion could not pass it to any other and his aerie on starside must devolve naturally to fess shaitan in his day had sired many offspring and by various means but his egg had gone to shaithar shaitanson who in his turn had become a father of vampires and shaitans bloodspawned children had been named shaithos shailar the hagridden shaithag and so on while among shaithar shaitansons spawn had been one called sheilar the slut and possibly others with similarsounding names derived from the one original and all of these before shaitan himself was banished wherefore was it too much to ask too improbable that three thousand years later this one this shaithis should now appear banished like his forebear before him shaitan thought not but a direct descendant the blood is the life and only blood would tell yes blood would tell take from him shaitan commanded the miniature officers of his law just one of you a nip the merest sip take from him and bring it to me he said no more and in his icecrevice hiding place shaithis scarcely felt the fishhooksharp needles that punctured the lobe of his ear and drew blood and was only faintly aware of the whir of small wings making away from him into the frozen labyrinth of the icecastle then out of that amazing sculpture and into the starbright night of the world some short time later the albino swooped down inside the all but extinct central cone to shaitans sulphuryellow apartments and there hovered waiting on his command from his dark corner he commanded it come little one i wont crush you the tiny creature flew to him folded its wings and fastened to shaitans hand it coughed up spittle and mucus into what passed for a palm and one small bright splash of ruby blood and good said shaitan now go only too pleased to obey the bat hastened from its master and left him to his own devices fascinated for a long while shaitan gazed at the ruby droplet it was blood and the blood is the life he waited impatiently for the vampire flesh of his hand to open into a tiny mouth and sip the droplet in an automatic thing born of hideous instinct from which he would know that this was just the blood of a common man but he waited in vain for like himself shaithis was uncommon very much like himself and mine said shaitan at last in a croaking shuddering delighted whisper flesh of my flesh at which the droplet quivered and soaked through the leprous skin of his hand and into him as if he were a sponge the ferencs story shaithis slept long and long the bats kept him warm at least kept him from freezing solid in his iceniche his wounds healed his thoughts like shaithis himself remained hidden until it was time to rouse himself and be up and about which was when his hiding place was discovered what who the astonished involuntary mental exclamations brought shaithis starting awake echoing in his mind while still the echoes rang he was on his feet his blanket of albino bats breaking up in chittering disarray whirring away from him like a shock of sentient snow another moment and his hand filled his gauntlet he let his wamphyri senses reach out but cautiously tentatively to discover who was there whoever he must be near else he wouldnt have sensed shaithiss emergence while sleeping shaithiss thoughts had flowed inwards an art in which he was adept his dreams could not be heard by any other but during the transition from deep healing sleep to waking they had escaped like a yawn and someone had been close enough to hear it too close by far shaithis allowed his mental probe to touch that of the other and immediately snatched it back contact had been brief but recognition mutual insufficient to detail specific identities but enough that each creature was certain of the others presence shaithis glanced this way and that there was only one way out of his niche if he was trapped then he was trapped so be it who is it he sniffed the cold air with his bats snout is it you fess come for your supper or must i soil my good gauntlet in pus to tear out the loathsome heart of the odious volse pinescu and back came the answer like an astonished gasp in the vampires mind hah shaithis you survived the dwellers deathbeams then arkis leperson shaithis knew him at once he breathed his relief watched curiously for a moment while his breath fell as snow then made for the exit along the way he flexed his muscles swung his limbs inhaled deeply and tested his ribs all seemed in order pah what had those minor dents and scratches been for wounds anyway repairs had been minimal his vampire flesh had scarcely been overtaxed he was left with an ache here a bruise there arkis stood close to the foot of the icestaircase he was squat for a lord of the wamphyri scarcely more than six feet tall ah but a good three feet broad too a massive barrel of a man his strength had been prodigious now it seemed hed lost a little weight shaithis moved towards him closing the distance between with the easy flowing glide of the vampire sinister to ordinary men but normal by wamphyri standards in another moment they were face to face well said shaithis and is it peace or are you too hungry to think straight ill be frank i could use a friend and by the look of you huh our circumstances are much the same the choice is yours but i know where theres food the others entirely instinctive reaction was a single belched word food his eyes opened wide and his flaring convoluted snout plumed icecrystal breath plainly arkis was starving shaithis offered him a grim smile took from his pouch the last piece of cold bearheart and devoured half in a single bite then tossed the rest to the lepers son who snatched it from the air with a cry almost of pain and without pause he crammed his mouth full arkis had been sired by morgis griefcry out of a traveller waif shed been a leper and her infection had taken morgis in his member which along with his lips eyes and ears had been among the first of his parts to slough the disease had been like a fire in him burning him faster than his vampire could replenish finally with cries of grief echoing his name to the full morgis had taken a firebrand and hurled himself and his traveller odalisque into a refuse pit whose accumulation of methane gas had done the rest his suicide had left arkis the youthful lord and heir to a fine aerie even better arkis had not contracted his forebears disease not yet anyway perhaps he never would it had all been many sundowns agone while arkis ate shaithis studied him squat in the body arkiss skull was likewise squat as if it had been crushed down a little his face seemed pushed out in front and his bottom jaw farther yet with boars teeth curving upward over his fleshy upper lip and yet the overall effect wasnt so much swinish as wolfish especially with the inordinate length of his furred tapering ears aye somewhere in his lineage thered been a grey one for sure moreover he was lean as a wolf well by the standards of former times at least now eyes ablaze with the lust of feeding upon however small a morsel he nevertheless narrowed them to gaze on shaithis and when he was done til grant you it was a bite he grunted but was that the food you promised i made no promises shaithis answered i stated a fact i know where theres food by the ton ah the other grunted and cocked his head on one side volses flyer dyou mean ah but they guard it well volse and the ferenc its a mousetrap shaithis only approach their private pantry too closely and youll end up in it no chivalry here my friend cold crystallized meat can never taste as good as red juice of meat spurting from a severed artery but beggars cant be choosers i have tried and failed theyre never too far away i know they lust after my blood are you reduced to this shaithis raised a black spiky eyebrow scavenging after each other he knew of course that they were knew that he would be too soon enough the chivalry of the wamphyri was at best a myth but in any case his insult the word scavenging was lost on arkis leperson shaithis said the other ive been here four going on five sundowns five auroral displays anyway which i reckon amounts to much the same thing reduced to hunting each other let me tell you that if it moves ill hunt it i had bats by the handful at first squeezed em to pulp so theyd drip into my mouth then ate the pulp too but now they wont come anywhere near me they have minds of their own these tiny albinos right now im on my way to see the shrivelled old granddad frozen in the ice up top id have tried to get at him before if i was desperate enough which now i am so dont talk to me about being reduced to this or that were all reduced shaithis and you no less than anyone else so maybe shaithiss insult had got through after all that came as something of a surprise the lepers son had always seemed such a dullard perhaps the cold had sharpened his wits arkis shaithis said there are two of us now and weve shared food thats good for it strikes me well do better as a team while youve been here youve learned things and must know many of the pitfalls such knowledge has value also the disgusting volse pinescu and gigantic fess ferenc will think twice before coming on the two of us together now what say we leave this echoing shell of ice and find our breakfast the lepers son sighed his impatience which angered shaithis a little he wasnt used to dull squat creatures playing the equal with him now let me repeat myself arkis grunted they guard volses flyer and guard it well theyre likewise wellfuelled which were not and as you yourself have just this minute pointed out the ferencs a bloody giant shaithis flared his nostrils and for a moment thought to leave the fool to his own devices except that would also mean leaving him to the tender mercies of the others eventually and shaithis wanted arkis for himself eventually but these were thoughts he steered inwards lest arkis hear them and can they guard two beasts he said and did you think id walked here arkis diredeath the idiots other name it stopped arkis dead eh another flyer i havent seen it but then ive not dared venture too far out on the ice lest they see me where then this flyer where i sent it said shaithis still good and fresh and wait a moment he sent out a beastoriented thought do you hear me and in return sensed life flickering still but burning very low aye and not yet bled to death not quite they know its there that great vat of filth and the ferenc of course else id not require assistance from you hah arkis cried i might have known it something for nothing what think again arkis my lad this is the grand lord shaithis youre talking to oh lets be friends arkis because ive need of you so be it shaithis shrugged i merely envisaged a joint venture which would furnish joint returns thats all equal shares but something for nothing what and did you think this was sunside at sundown with plenty of sweet traveller game afoot he made as if to turn away starve then wait the other took a pace closer and in a more reasonable tone whats your plan none said shaithis except to eat eh shaithiss turn to sigh listen and ill ask you again can they guard two flyers volse and the ferenc certainly a man to each but we are two men and if theyre both together then one beast goes unguarded has the cold numbed your once agile brain arkis that last was a lie but a little flattery wouldnt hurt hmm the lepers son thought about it for a moment then scowled and stabbed a finger at shaithis very well but if we come upon volse pinescu on his own we kill him and i want his heart is it a deal agreed said shaithis actually i should think its the only part worth eating hah arkis snorted and har har oh ha ha haaar he laughed in his way and go on laugh shaithis kept his thoughts hidden but when volse and fess are done for youre next bonebrain and out loud now guard your thoughts we go out onto the ice volse pinescus flyer was rimed with frost stiff as a board still arkis leperson would have set to but shaithis cautioned him lets not waste valuable time here what why youd wear those tusks of yours to stumps on this arkis turned to him with a scowl its food isnt it aye shaithis nodded and half a mile over there a lot more of it but thick red and flowing in juicy pipes good beasts i breed arkis of the finest flesh now listen do you sense our enemies no neither do i so today theyre not doing much guarding right arkis sniffed the icy air it worries me what are they up to dyou suppose time for supposing after weve filled our bellies shaithis had already set off across the blue foxfire ice and arkis came shambling after shaithis glanced back once and nodded then faced forward and grinned his sly grin as of old ever the leader shaithis and how easy once more to take up the mantle and behind him arkis leperson like a dog to heel a wind came up while shaithis and arkis leperson called diredeath sat in a cave carved by volse and fess in the underbelly of shaithiss flyer and sipped the feebly pulsing juices of that now insensate beast the radiant stars were blotted out by dark scudding clouds snow came down in a shortlived blizzard which loaned the ice a thin soft coating when the wind died down again the cannibalized flyer was dead and its arteries already stiffening cold fare from this time forward commented shaithis sticking up his head to spy out the land around he looked towards the spine of volcanic peaks then looked again and frowned his concern arkis what do you make of this arkis stood up belched noisomely looked where shaithis pointed eh that a whirlwind a snowdevil the last flurry in the wake of the storm whats this great fascination with nature shaithis fascination with whats natural none whatsoever with whats unnatural plenty especially in a place like this unnatural by natures mundane standards aye if not by those of the wamphyri he continued to study the phenomenon a whirling cloud of snow forming a squat cylinder twenty feet high and the same in diameter something seemed to move in its heart like a tadpole in a jelly egg and the whole device making a beeline their way it threw off whips of snow which quickly settled to the ground without diminishing the central mass shaithis nodded he knew what it was fess ferenc he whispered grimly what fess arkis gaped at the thing now only a hundred yards away across the shining ice coming at walking pace and beginning to thin out a little how fess thats a vampire mist said shaithis donning his gauntlet on starside it would creep flow drift outwards from him here it turns to snow fess was a fine mistmaker his great mass during the hunt ive seen him cover an entire hillside they both threw out their vampire senses towards the weird earthbound cloud only one creature inside it the ferenc aye but weary as never before he hadnt the strength to hide himself ahhahr growled arkis we have him but lets first discover what goes on shaithis cautioned him isnt it obvious what goes on the lepers son was scowling again why hes finally burst that monstrous boil volse pinescu but in the fight depleted himself so now hes at our mercy of which i have precious little twenty paces away the cloud fell as a final flurry and fess stood there naked entirely naked and not only of his snowcloud cover arkis gawped but shaithis called out well fess and how fortunes change eh it would seem so the others deep bass voice echoed over the iceplain but there was a shiver in it he was freezing and yet under one arm he carried his clothes in a bundle shaithis couldnt see the sense of it there must be a story here and he wanted to know it arkis sensed shaithiss curiosity me im not interested he snarled i say we kill him now you say too much shaithis hissed you think only of your own survival now without a thought for the future myself i think of my continued survival now and however long i may sustain it so you bide your time or our partnership ends here am i to die the ferenc stood tall glooming on shaithis across that short distance if so then get it over with for ive no wish to turn to a block of ice but he threw down his clothes and hunched forward a little and his talons were sharp as razors hanging at his sides it seems i have the advantage said shaithis also a score to settle you caused me not a little pain the ferenc made no answer however shaithis continued we may yet come to an agreement as you see arkis and i have formed a team of our own safety in numbers you know but two against the icelands the odds are too high three of us might fare better some kind of trick fess couldnt believe it if their roles had been reversed shaithis would have been already dead no trick shaithis shook his head like diredeath here you have knowledge of this place and just as the blood is the life so is knowledge that has always been my conviction to fight among ourselves is to die sharing knowledge pooling our resources we might yet survive say on said fess his voice more shivery than ever nothing more to say shaithis shook his head come out of the cold and replenish yourself and tell us whats happened that you go naked as a babe in such a place hidden in a weird and very unsubtle mist aye and then perhaps youd advise us on the whereabouts of the unlovely volse pinescu your erstwhile companion the ferenc had no choice flee and they would catch him for they were well fuelled stand still and freeze and theyd thaw him out and eat him go forward and talk and perhaps he could yet make his peace with shaithis as for arkis that one was something else he came on got down in the lee of the stiffening flyer tore a vein from the wall of flesh and bit through it nothing was forthcoming the creatures blood was finished or frozen in the outer regions of its bulk so he merely stripped the pipe down with his teeth and swallowed the pulp it was sustenance if nothing else between mouthfuls he commented perhaps we should have stayed on starside at least the dweller would have made a quick end of it still blaming me fess shaithis stood over him watched him fuelling himself arkis sat well away scowling as usual i blame all of us the ferenc answered perhaps bitterly hotheads we rushed in like blind men over a precipice fools we went to murder and instead committed suicide it was your plan aye but we all fell in with it he stood up and went back on to the ice to his garments there crouching and cleaning them thoroughly with snow at least there was that to be said for the giant hed always been scrupulous when he was done he returned again to the cave of cooling flesh and lay his clothes aside to dry or freeze out some strange contamination shaithis wondered out loud you could say that the other wrinkled his already much convoluted snout those stinking stains were volse and as he continued to eat so between mouthfuls he told them about it volse and i wed noticed smoke from the central cone also some strange activity now and then in a high cave and we thought if that old mountain contains heat and fire its only reasonable that someones settled there but who common men exiled wamphyri perhaps no way to discover unless we went to see oh we cast our probes ahead of us of course but whoor whatever lived in the volcano he kept his thoughts to himself the way is longer than it looks maybe five miles to the foot of the mount then a rising climb of two more to its cone but near the top where the way gets steep there was this cave and that was where wed seen signs of activity like mirrors glinting in the starlight dwellers wed thought snowtrogs or the like meat anyway aye there was meat all right the ferencs aspect was suddenly grim a ton of it but best if i tell it as it happened and not go ahead of myself so we arrived at the mouth of this cave all craggy and yellow with sulphur an old lavarun i fancied but hardly fit habitation and no jot warmer than any other place around here we cast our probes ahead of us there was life in there some dull intelligence far back in the cave we hardly felt threatened and it seemed likely the bore hole passed right through the mountain all the way to the core and if thats where the warmth was thats where wed find the life so we went in the tunnel had its twists and turns and it was dark and smelly as a refuse pit in there but what is darkness to the wamphyri volse who had fashioned the most incredible pustules to enhance his already hideous appearance took the lead hed stripped off his jacket and his upper body was entirely festooned with all manner of morbid things whoor whatever he said only let them see me or feel me near and theyll know theres nothing for it but to faint and hope its a bad dream i thought he was probably correct and had no objection to his going first then ah i fess gave a small start as he spied a miniature albino bat hovering near under the overhang of the dead flyers side in a lightning swipe he scythed it in two parts in midair and ah yes he said and perhaps i should mention volse and i we had companions all along the way these damned bats they get everywhere why treat them so harshly shaithis cut in on starside they were our small familiars these arent the same fess shook his great head they lack obedience shaithis frowned theyd obeyed him hadnt they arkis growled never mind the bats but finish your story it interests me partially replenished invigorated from his feeding the ferenc began to don his clothes generating body heat to complete the job of drying them out he was adept at this as he was at mistmaking and while he dressed so he continued with his story volse went first then into the heart of the riddled rock and ill be honest we thought there was nothing there nothing to alarm or threaten us anyway and yet i sensed that the picture we had of that place of its suspected dweller or dwellers was probably a false one it seemed to me that my mind was watched even though id failed to detect the watcher but the deeper we proceeded into the mountain the more the conviction grew in me that our progress was monitored even minutely as if each step led us closer to some terrific confrontation some contrived and monstrous conclusion in short an ambush arkis grunted and nodded his head the very way i felt he remarked in a low dark mutter on those several occasions when id approach volses flyer for a bite to eat just so fess nodded without taking offence and perhaps deliberately failing to find anything of accusation in arkiss statement and i knew fear well no not fear for were none of us bred that way shall we simply say then that i experienced a new sensation which was not pleasant nor was this presentiment without foundation as will be seen and all the while those damned albinos tracking our course until their fluttering and chittering had grown to be such an annoyance that i stayed back a little to strike out at them where they swooped overhead which probably saved my life ahead of me volse had gone striding on but he sensed it coming in the same instant that i sensed it and he said one word before it struck the word he said was what yes he questioned it and even questioning it never knew what hit him explain arkis was breathless and shaithis was intent rapt upon the ferencs story fess shrugged fully dressed again he sliced gobbets of flesh from the flyers alveolate ribs sliding them one by one down his throat hard to explain he said after a while fast it was huge mindless terrible but i saw what it did to volse and i determined that it would not do the same to me i never fled from anything in my life before well except the dweller and the awesome destruction he wrought in the battle for his garden but i fled from this it was white but not a healthy white the white of hiding in places too dark like some cavern fungus it had legs a great many i think with clawed webbed feet its body was fishlike its head too with jaws ferocious but the weapon it bore a weapon arkis thrust his face forward but you said the thing was mindless and now mind enough to carry a weapon the ferenc glanced at him scornfully then held up his own talon hands and are these not weapons this things weapon was part of it fool just as your own boars tusks are part of you yes yes understood said shaithis impatiently say on fess settled down again but his eyes were uneasy wide in his massive malformed face its weapon was a knife a sword a lance but with tines like thorns all down its length from tip to snout a barbed rod for stabbing and once stabbed the victims hooked with no way to free himself except tear his own flesh wide open and at the tip of that boneplated ram twin holes like nostrils but not for breathinghe paused for what then volse could not contain himself for sucking said the ferenc a vampire thing shaithis seemed convinced a warrior but uncontrolled with no rightful master a creature created by some exiled wamphyri lord which has outlasted its maker he said these things but he did not necessarily believe them no he uttered them aloud to cover the nature of his true thoughts which were different again fess fell for shaithiss ploy anyway these are possibilities aye the giant nodded stealthy sly as a fox and all unheralded it crept out from a side tunnel but when it struck ah lightning moves more slowly it slid into view and its spear stabbed at volse three times the first blow ripped him open through boils and all and spattered me and the walls of the tunnel with all of his pus whose amount was prodigious he was like one huge blister bursting and wetting everything with his vile liquids i was drenched the second thrust hit him while he was still reeling from the first it almost sawed his head off and the third that sank into him into his heart where it commenced to suck like a great pump and while the thing held him upright impaled on its weapon against the wall sucking at him so the creatures saucer eyes fixed me in their monstrous glare so that i knew i was next that was when i fled and fess actually shuddered which amazed shaithis you couldnt have saved him arkis sneered questioning fesss manhood a dangerous line of inquiry at best but the other took it well i tell you volse was a goner what and so much of his liquids used up his head half shorn away and the things great siphon in him emptying him save him and what of myself you diredeath have not seen this creature why even lesk the glut in whichever hell he now resides would not stray near such a monster no i fled and all the way out of that long long tunnel i could hear the things slobbering as it drained volses juices also by the time i struck light and open air i fancied it slobbered all the louder perhaps hot on my trail in something of a panic yes i admit it called a mist out of myself and hurried out onto the slopes and down to the plain of snow and ice there i stripped off for volses drench was poisonous and without further pause hurried back here and found you two waiting for me the tale is told arkis and shaithis sat back narrowed their eyes and fingered their chins shaithis kept his thoughts mainly to himself though truth to tell there was nothing especially sinister or vindictive about them but diredeath feeling that he still had the ferenc at something of a disadvantage was somewhat loath to let the giant so lightly off the hook times and fortunes change the lepers son eventually said i went starving went indeed in fear of my life when you and the great wen had the upper hand but now you are only one man against myself and the lord shaithis these things are true fess answered standing up and stretching and flexing the mighty talons which were his hands but do you know i cant help wondering what the lord shaithis sees in you lepers son for it seems to me theres about as much use in you as there was in that mighty bag of slops called volse pinescu also and now that i come to think of it it strikes me i sat still for a good many hurtful slights and insults while relating my story of course i was hungry and cold as death and a man will sit still for a lot while theres a chance he can fill his belly but now that my bellys full and im warm again i think youd do well to back off diredeath or come to just such an end as your name suggests aye said shaithis with a quick nod coming between them well and enough of that for lets face it weve all we can handle in the icelands themselves without were at each others throats too he took their arms and sat down drawing them down with him now tell me he said what are the secrets of these icelands for after all im the newcomer here but the two of you why youve explored and adventured galore and so the sooner i know all that you know the sooner well be able to decide on our next move shaithis let his gaze wander to and fro from one to the other finally allowing it to settle on arkiss dark and twitching countenance his coarse lips and the yellow ivory of his tusks so how about it arkis he said youve had a little less freedom than fess its true but still youve managed to explore a few icecastles well the ferenc has told us his tale of the horror in the cone so now i reckon its your turn what of the iceaeries eh what of these ancient exiled iceencysted wamphyri lords arkis scowled at him you want to know about the frozen ones the sooner all is known said shaithis nodding the sooner we may proceed arkis shrugged however grudgingly i have no problem with that he said so you want to know what ive seen done discovered it wont take long in the telling i promise you tell us anyway said shaithis and well see what we make of it again arkiss shrug so be it he said the frozen lords after the mayhem in the dwellers garden arkis commenced when it was seen how the dweller and his helllander father had destroyed our armies shattered our centuried stacks and brought our aeries crashing down there seemed no alternative but flight the dweller had our measure the wamphyri were fallen to remain in the ruins of starside would surely bring these great enemies down upon us one last time in a final venting of their furious might however it is the immemorial right of the fallen to quit starside and forge for the ice lands thus in the lull which followed on the destruction of our aeries those survivors who had the means for flight forsook their ancient territories and headed north aye and i was one such survivor along with a pair of aspiring lieutenants extraveller thralls of mine twin brothers named goram and belart largazi who vied with each other for my egg i cleared away the debris of my fallen stack from the deeply buried entrance to subterranean workshops so freeing one flyer and one warrior kept aside and safe against the event of just such a calamity as the dwellers victory these beasts we saddled and mounted i myself took the warrior an illtempered creature personally trained to my tastes finally fleeing on a course roughly northward from the wrack and ruin of the aeries our heading was not true north perhaps a little west of north what odds the roof of the world is the roof of the world to left or right it is still the roof we paused only once where a shoal of great blue fishes had got themselves trapped in the formation of a shallow icelake and there glutted ourselves before proceeding further not long after that the largazi brothers flyer burdened as it was with two riders became exhausted it went down at the rim of a shallow sea and left its riders floundering i landed on the frozen strand sent my warrior back to the largazis to let down its launching limbs and tow them ashore and then it was that we found ourselves in a very curious place hot blowholes turned the snow yellow bubbling geysers made warm pools in the ageless ice sea birds came down to feed on the froth of small fishes where they spawned at the oceans rim it was the furthest reach of these selfsame volcanic mountains which are active still in those weird western extremes after the largazis were dragged ashore and while they dried themselves out i looked for a launching place and discovered a glacier where it sloped oceanward there i ordered my creature down on to the ice aye for by now that warrior mount of mine was likewise sore weary its valiant efforts in saving the twins from drowning had scarcely buttressed its vitality they need to kill and devour a deal of red meat warriors else rapidly fade away to nothing and so i thought to myself which will prove most useful to me in the icelands a powerful warrior or a pair of bickering unimportant and everhungry thralls hah no contest it was my thought to slaughter one of the brothers there and then and feed him to my warrior except well ill admit it id underestimated that fine pair of wamphyri aspirants they too had been busy weighing the odds and their conclusions had likewise favoured my fighting beast now they backed off to a safe distance and descended into deep narrow crevasses from which i could neither threaten nor tempt them to come out and approach me mutinous dogs very well let them freeze let them starve let them both die i climbed aboard my warrior and spurred the creature slithering down the glaciers ramp until at last it bounded aloft and spurted out over the sea and not before time the launching of that depleted beast had been a very closerun thing so that i could almost taste the salt spray from the waves against the glacier however i was now airborne i turned inland swept high overhead where the treacherous largazi twins had emerged from the ice to angle their faces up to me waved them a scornful farewell and set course for a line of distant peaks standing in silhouette against the skys weaving auroral pulse those same peaks which stand behind us even now with their central volcanic cone whose lava vents are guarded according to the ferenc at least by swordsnouted monsters aye the very same nor would i nor could i call fess a liar in that respect in the matter of volses death by some strange and savage creature for certainly my warrior came to a sad suspicious end and who can say but that volse and my poor weary warrior were not victims of the selfsame bloodbeast i will tell you how it was my warrior was weary to death well perhaps not so weary for as you know well enow they dont die easily and rarely of weariness but the creature was depleted and panting and complaining i scanned the land about and saw lava runs on the higher slopes of the central cone good slippery launching ramps if the warrior should ever again find itself fit for flight alas the landing was awkward and the beast threw me it cracked its armoured carapace wrenched a vane and tore a propulsion orifice on a jagged lava outcrop many gallons of fluids were lost before its metamorphic flesh webbed over the gashes and sealed them my own injuries were slight however and i ignored them but such was my anger that i cursed and kicked the warrior a good deal before its mood turned ugly and it began to bellow and spit then i was obliged to calm the brute and finally i backed it up and hid it from view in the mouth of a cavern tunnel much similar perhaps identical to that of the leprous white bloodbeast as described by the ferenc for this tunnel was likewise an ancient lavarun from the once molten core and perhaps i should have explored its interior a little way but at the time there was no evidence of anything suspicious about that central cone i ordered the warrior to heal itself left it there in the cavern entrance let my curiosity get the better of me and came down by foot on to the plain of the shimmering icecastles to see what they contained for as youve seen they looked for all the world like wamphyri stacks or aeries formed from ice as for what i discovered it was a very strange very awesome indeed a frightening thing expatriate lords all frozen in suspended animation icelocked in the cores of their glittering castles a good many were dead crushed or sheared by shifting ice but there were some too many i thought who had variously succumbed others were preserved however sleeping still within impenetrable walls of ice hard as iron their vampire metabolisms so reduced that they seemed scarcely changed over all the long centuries ah this was a false impression their dreams were fading ephemeral things mere memories of the lives they had known in the old times when the first of the wamphyri inhabited their stacks on starside and waged their territorial wars there all of the exlords were dying ah slowly so slowly but dying nevertheless of course they were the blood is the life and for centuries without number all they had had was ice some of them fess ferenc broke in most of them aye but one at least had not gone without this was the conclusion which volse pinescu and i arrived at when we examined the icecastle stacks shaithis looked at him then at arkis will one of you or both elaborate arkis shrugged i take it the ferenc is talking about the matter of the breaking and of the empty icethrones for its a fact as ive hinted that certain of the frozen keeps and redoubts indeed a good many have been broken into and their helpless refrigerated inhabitants removed but by whom to where for what the huge hulking slopeskulled ferenc broke in again with ive reached certain conclusions about these things too should i say on and again arkis lepersons shrug if you can throw some light on the mystery by all means and shaithis said aye say on the ferenc nodded and continued as youll have noted for yourselves the icecastles number between fifty and sixty forming concentric rings about the extinct volcano which is the central cone but is the volcano truly extinct and if so why is it that a little smoke still goes up from that ancient icecrusted crater also we have seen myself far too clearly how there is at least one monstrous warrior creature guarding the cones access tunnels ah but what or who else does it guard when his pause threatened to go on for ever finally it was shaithiss turn to shrug pray continue he said were in the very palm of your hand fess entirely fascinated indeed the ferenc was somewhat flattered one by one he very deliberately very loudly cracked the bony knuckles of his taloned hands fascinated eh well and rightly so and so you see shaithis youre not the only thinker who survived the dwellers wrath eh shaithis hummed in his convoluted nose perhaps a little indecisively and swung his head this way and that finally he said ill give credit where credits due when i can see the whole picture very well said the ferenc so heres what ive seen and what i reckon me and that foul festerer volse pinescu we explored the innermost iceaeries and discovered each and every one looted following which and especially now that volse is no more sucked dry by the thing in the lavarun i find it easy to piece together a fairly accurate picture of whats been happening here the way i see it some ancient wamphyri lord or lady is master or mistress of the slumbering volcano in ages past and whenever outcast vampires have happened this way he or she has fought them off from taking possession of the volcanos comforts it would seem to have some residual warmth at least then as the vampires lying in siege have succumbed to the cold and put themselves into hibernation so the crafty master of the volcano has emerged from time to time to pillage their icechambers and live off their deepfrozen flesh in effect the icecastles are his larder hah arkis slapped his great thigh it all comes clear the ferenc nodded his swollen grotesquely proportioned head you agree with my conclusions then how can it be otherwise said arkis what say you shaithis shaithis looked at him curiously i say you blow like a pennant in the wind now this way now that first you wished to kill the ferenc and now you agree with his every word is your mind so easily changed then the lepers son scowled at him i know truth when i hear it he said also i can see the sense in sound scheming the ferencs reckoning about the state of things sounds right enough to me and your plea that we run together for our mutual safety seems similarly wise so whats giving you grief shaithis i thought you wanted us to be friends so i do shaithis answered its just that i worry when loyalties change so fast thats all and now would you care to finish your own story the last we heard youd left your injured warrior in the mouth of a lavarun and gone down onto the plain to examine the icecastles that i did arkis agreed and i found things pretty much as the ferenc described them the icelocked thrones of all those unknown wamphyri lords out of time all cracked open and empty like sunside hives raped of their honey aye and in those icecastles which stood more distant from the central cone there too i found evidence of attempted robbery except in many an instance the ice had been too thick and the aeonshrivelled lords remained safe unburgled intact which meant that they were also safe from me finally i wearied of my eerie explorations i was hungry but unable to break into these ancient permafrost pantries the small albino bats no longer trusted me but avoided my crushing hands if my former thralls the largazis still lived by now theyd be halfway here theyd be exhausted too and unable to outrun me ah but that was a thought it was time i returned to my warrior creature to see how it was holding up and so i climbed up to the high cavern where id hidden the beast away except it was not there several small pieces of it were there but that was all the sucking thing the ferenc nodded the bloodbeast with the hollow swordlike cartilage snout but how so shaithis wasnt so sure for a mindless beast to suck a man or given time even a warrior dry this i can understand but then to cut the carcase of so huge a creature into small pieces and drag them away the ferenc only shrugged these are the icelands he said they harbour strange creatures with stranger habits and food is scarce here now think on starside would we ever have dreamed of chewing on the rubbery arteries of a flyer what with trogs in our larders and travellers on the hoof just across the mountains not likely but here hah it didnt take us long to learn oh we lowered our sights soon enough and what of the mainly conjectural creatures and beings which have possibly spent their entire lives here if the loathsome leprous bloodbeast hunts only for itself then perhaps it has its own pantry somewhere and if it hunts for a master yet again his shrug perhaps hes the one who butchered arkiss warrior and dragged its bits away and shaithis turning his private thoughts inwards to guard them thought a master aye youre right fess a master of evil the very source of evil in the shape of a timeless vampire lord indeed one of the first true lords the dark lord shaitan shaitan the unborn shaitan the fallen well said arkis leperson does the ferenc make sense or what and if he does whats our next move and perhaps cautiously shaithis answered the ferenc makes sense possibly and to himself indeed he does for a misshapen fool but hes been here longer than i have perhaps this isnt the sudden burgeoning of previously unsuspected intelligence in the great freak but simply the fact that hes had longer to feel shaitans influence at work to feel his ancient eyes on him staring through the pink orbits of his myriad albino minions now the ferenc echoed arkis well what now shaithis dyou have a plan a plan oh yes a plan to discover more about this shaitan to seek him out and learn why he allowed me to clothe myself in his albinos for their warmth but mainly to know what it is this weird affinity which draws me to a creature ive never known except in muttered myths and legends and out loud a plan aye he answered and thinking with his usual almost casual clarity he created a plan out of thin air entirely on the spur of the moment one which would he hoped suit his vampire companions and one which especially suited himself first we cut a good weight of meat out of this flyer he said as much as we can carry comfortably and then on our way to the central cone you can show me some more of the frozen lords so far ive seen only the one kehrl lugoz who was banished here along with shaitan at the dawn of wamphyri tyranny upon which due to its insufficiency i may not base a firm opinion then in the inner icecastles you may also care to show me these shattered keeps wherefrom the bodies of certain lords have been stolen these several things for a start then and ill think of others as we go along arkis seemed uncertain eh whats this for a plan we take meat with us and visit a handful of shrivelled prehistoric icedoomed lords also the sacked empty tombs of other ancients whose fate we can only guess at on our way to the central cone aye said shaithis and then said the ferenc perhaps to destroy him who dwells within shaithis answered and gain his secrets his beasts and possessions and who can say possibly even discover some means of egress from these hideously boring and barren icelands the ferenc nodded his grotesque head this all sounds good to me very well then lets be at it he commenced to cut strips of frozen flesh from the curve of the flyers rib cage cramming his pockets with them however grudgingly arkis followed suit meat is meat i know he grumbled but the frozen flesh of flyers huh the blood was the life and shaithis snapped his fingers and said ah yes i knew there was something else now tell me diredeath what of your twin thralls the brothers largazi did they follow you here out of the west from the fumarole coast the bubbling geysers and lakes of sulphur did they survive or perhaps they perished en route perished aye the other nodded agreeably and smiled a fond knowing smile his boars tusks glinting dully but not en route perished when they got here and when i found them exhausted and shivering in the hollow core of the westernmost icecastle ah how they begged my forgiveness then and do you know i forgave them indeed i did goram i cried belart my faithful thralls my trusted lieutenants returned at last to the bosom of your mentor oh how they hugged me and i in my turn fell upon their necks and tore them open shaithis sighed perhaps a little glumly you fuelled yourself on both of them at once with never a thought for tomorrow arkis shrugged and finished stuffing his pockets with meat i had been cold and hungry for more than two auroral periods he said and the blood of the largazis was hot and strong perhaps i should have exercised a little restraint kept one of them in reserve and then again perhaps not for it was about then that fess and volse arrived so at least i spared myself the frustration of having one of my thralls stolen away from me as for their corpses i stored them in the heart of a glacier alas they went the same way as my warrior something sneaked them away while i was out exploring shaithis allowed his narroweyed glance to fall upon the ferenc who at once shook his head not me he denied the unspoken charge neither me nor volse we knew nothing of arkiss glaciated thralls if we had well perhaps the story would have been different he clambered out from the lee of the ravaged flyer and stood gigantically in starlight and aurora sheen well and are we all set shaithis and arkis joined him all three they turned their faces in the direction of the central cone directly between the monstrous trio and the exvolcano an icecastle had taken how many centuries to crystallize about its core of volcanic rocksplash it would make as good a starting place as any shaithis taking in the bleak scene and after glancing a moment into the scarlet eyes of each of his companions finally agreed all set so lets go and see what the rest of these aeonfrozen exiles look like shall we and united for the moment united at least the vampires set out to cross the snowfields and scintillant icejumbles and the weird terraces and shimmering battlements of their target icecastle loomed larger as gradually they narrowed the distance between and forming a frowning centrepiece to the glittering concentrically circling aeries every now and then the duller darker shape of the extinct volcano would appear to puff a little smoke into the radiant everchanging sky or perhaps this was just an illusion well possibly but shaithis thought not soon shaithis discovered that one icecastle was much the same as the next this one for example might well be the stark shivery tinkling cold stack of kehrl lugoz might be except of course it was not the undead kehrl who waited out the ages in the densely protective sheath of the core but some other lord also and whoever he had been in life his waiting had long since come to an end and he was now entirely dead an icemummy frozen starved desiccated to a condition way beyond life the olden vampire was one with all past things leaving only his shell to represent him as part of the present shaithis looked at him through the wavering impurity of the ice and wondered who hed been whoever it was probably as well that he was dead his thoughts if there had been any might have told arkis and the ferenc secrets shaithis would prefer them not to know like why he lay there on his carved icepedestal propped upon a skeletal elbow one clawlike hand held up before him as if to ward off some dreadful evil and his colourless eyes from which time had bleached all of the scarlet but none of the nameless horror aye even this member of the olden wamphyri horrified by something or someone who had stood here where shaithis stood even now what do you make of this the sudden echoing rumble of the ferencs voice caused shaithis to start he looked where the giant pointed a taloned hand at a hitherto unnoticed circular bore hole in the ice seven or eight inches in diameter the almost invisible bore seemed to point like an arrow at the preserved wamphyri relic upon his carved couch a hole shaithis frowned aye the ferenc nodded like that of some gross worm in the earth but an iceworm he kneeled and stuck his hand and arm into the hole which extended almost to the depth of his shoulder and withdrawing his arm and sighting along the channel he added directed straight at his heart too more such holes over here arkis called from a little way around the curve of the core and it seems to me theyve been drilled see the heaped chips where theyve spilled out upon the floor and shaithis thought such small privations as my dullard friends have known have made them observant he followed the cores curve to arkis and examined the new holes rather the newly discovered holes for in fact they could have been made a hundred two hundred years ago and sighting along them just as the ferenc had sighted shaithis too noted that these perfectly circular runs seemed aimed at the main mass of the iceshrouded mummys body he thought to himself runs aye and narrowed his eyes a little as he examined that concept more closely for upon a time shaithis had visited the settlements of itinerant szgany metalworkers east of the great mountain range which split starside from sunside these were the tinkers who designed and constructed the fearsome wamphyri wargauntlets shaithis had seen the way the colourful travellers poured liquid metal down clay pipes or along earthen sluices into moulds so that there was that about these bore holes which reminded him of running liquids except all of these incomplete runs climbed gentle inclines towards the dead lord which seemed to indicate that they had not been designed to carry anything to him something away from him then shaithis shivered he was beginning to find his investigations and more especially his conclusions damnable indeed there was something about this entire setup which even shaithiss vampire heart found ominous oppressive doomfraught and finally fess ferenc voiced his thoughts for him me and the whelky volse we saw cores where the ice wasnt so thick in them the bore holes had penetrated right to the centre and all that was left in there were small bundles of rags skin and bones what shaithis frowned at him fess nodded as if the onetime inhabitants or slumberers in these frozen stacks had been sucked entire down the bores all except their more solid bits it had been shaithiss thought exactly but how he whispered how if they were frozen i mean how does one draw an entire frozensolid body down a hole which cant even accommodate that bodys head i dont know the ferenc shook his own misshapen head but still i reckon thats what this old lad was afraid of whats more i reckon he died from the fear of it later a mile closer to the central cone they entered one of the inner icecastles this is one ive not visited before said the ferenc but as close as it is to the old volcano id guess its a safe bet what well find oh shaithis looked at him nothing the ferenc nodded knowingly just shattered ice about a gob of black lava and the empty hole from which some ancient lords been stolen away and he was right when they finally found the high lava throne it was empty and its icesheath shattered into a pile of fused frosted shards a few fragments of rag there were but so ancient and stiff that they crumbled at a touch and that was all shaithis kneeled at the base of the shattered sheath and examined its broken surface and found what he was looking for the fluted rims of a good many bore holes patterned like a scalloped fan all joining where they converged on the empty niche at the black core and he looked at fess and arkis and nodded grimly the author of this dreadful thing could have sucked out the unknown lord like the yoke of an egg but that wasnt necessary for the sheath was only two and a half feet thick so he drilled his holes all the way round until the ice was loosened then wrenched it away in blocks and shards and so finally came upon his petrified prey and fess said did i hear you right did you say this dreadful thing shaithis looked at him also at arkis im wamphyri he growled low in his throat you know me well theres nothing soft about me i take pride in my great strength in my rages and furies my lusts and appetites but if this is the work of a man even one of my own kind still i say it is dreadful its terror lies in the secrecy the stealth the gloating leering malignancy of the slayer ah yes im wamphyri and if i should be trapped in these icelands then doubtless i too would develop various lifesupport systems including a fortress sophisticated defences and a source or sources of food and i too would be as secretive and sinister as needs be but dont you see someone here has already done it in these icelands we are come into the territory of one who victimizes and terrorizes the very wamphyri themselves that is the dreadful thing i mentioned why the very atmosphere of this place seethes with its evil and something else it seems to me that it is evil for evils sake after that shaithis could have bitten off his forked tongue too late for he fancied hed already said or hinted far too much but such was the crushing weight of this place upon his vampire senses such was its psychic jangle upon his nerveendings he felt the others would have to be totally insensitive not to have felt it for themselves arkiss mouth had fallen open a little while shaithis was speaking now he closed it and grunted huh you were always the clever one with the speeches shaithis but indeed i too have felt the threatening doomful aura of this place i felt it when i discovered those several bloodied scales and various small parts of my warriors armoured carapace in the high cave also when the bloodless but wellfleshed and hung with good meat largazis were stolen from the glacier pantry where id lodged them and often ive thought who is it watches over me so closely and knows my every move is he in my very mind or do the icecastles themselves have eyes and ears it was the ferencs turn to speak ill not deny it i too have felt the mystery of this place but i think its a ghost a relic a revenant out of time an echo of something which was but is no more look around and ask yourselves is anything weve seen of recent origin the answer is no whatever deeds were done here were done a long longtime ago arkis snorted again and my warrior and the largazi twins fess shrugged and answered stolen by some thieving icebeast perhaps a cousin of the pallid caverndwelling swordsnout shaithis had shaken off his momentary fit of depression had dispersed the strange and ominous mood which had descended upon him tangible as a bank of fog the ferencs answer suited him well enough he did not agree with it not entirely but it suited him to let the others think so except so if theres no sly intelligence involved he said or no longer involved as the case may be then what sense is there in moving against the volcano again fess shrugged best to be sure eh he said and if there was some sly intelligence at work here albeit a long time ago perhaps his works will still be available to us deep down in the heart of the volcano one things sure well never know unless we go see for ourselves now arkis leperson was eager but shaithis cautioned i vote we sleep on it i for one have tramped enough for the moment thank you and would prefer to tackle the cone fresh from my rest and with a hearty breakfast inside me anyway i note that the auroral display is rising to a new peak of activity thats a good sign let the burning sky light the way for us im with you shaithis the ferenc rumbled but where to bed down why not right here shaithis answered within shouting distance but each of us secure in his own niche arkis nodded that suits me they separated and climbed to precarious but private iceledges and niches where no one could come upon them unheard or unobserved and each in his own place settled down to sleep shaithis thought to call to himself a warm living blanket of albinos then thought better of it if the bats came fess and arkis would probably find it a suspicious circumstance why should shaithis have power over the bats when they had none why indeed it was a question he couldnt answer not yet anyway he curled himself inside his cloak of black bat fur and munched on flyer flesh it was scarcely satisfying but it was filling and with one eye open and set to scan the icecavern from fess to arkis and back again shaithis thought ah but time for the good stuff later the good stuff aye fess and arkis themselves who for certain would be thinking exactly the same thing about him and settling down he began to breathe more deeply and his scarlet eye scanned the cavern and slowly the dreams started to come blood relations shaithis of the wamphyri dreamed a splendid fantasy as is often the way of it with dreams it was comprised of a great many scenes and themes with little or no explanation except perhaps as echoes of his waking ambitions the fantasy had been developing itself for some time in the darker caverns of shaithiss subconscious mind before suddenly firming into an ordered sequence of scenarios which were these it was shaithiss reception his triumph his moment of glory the lady karen kneeled naked between his spread thighs teased his great gonads caressed and even nibbled but very carefully upon the purple bulbous tip of his hugely swollen phallus and now and then paused to gentle that pulsing rod between her perfect breasts sumptuously cushioned shaithis reclined upon dramal doombodys raised bonethrone in karens aerie the last of all the great stacks of the wamphyri finally his by right of conquest and looked upon all of those persons creatures and possessions who were likewise his to use abuse or destroy as when and how he willed it above and beyond the aeries kilometrehigh buttresses battlements and balconies of fossilized bone stone membrane and cartilage new stars thronged to join those already dusting the darkening sky the sun issued its last coruscating fan of golden radiation where it sank down behind sunside and for breathless moments the barrier mountains were thrown into massive jagged silhouette while the glaring yellow spikes of their peaks turned purple and finally grey then the rapidly elongating shadow of the mountains flowed like monstrous stains across starsides boulder plains to blot them into darkness and at last it was that sundown which shaithis had so long awaited the hour of his greatest triumph and of his revenge as at a signal his lieutenants threw back the heavy tapestries from the windows and cut free karens sigils so that they went warping and spiralling out and down into the darkness and they shook out the longer tapering pennants bearing shaithiss new blazon a wamphyri gauntlet clenched and raised threateningly above the glaring sphere which was starsides portal to the helllands to wave in the thinly gusting currents of air over the aeries higher parapets and so i willed it he growled and so it has come to pass and he glared all about defying all and sundry to deny him his sovereignty if they dared and yet in his heart shaithis knew that the victory wasnt his alone not in its entirety he knew he couldnt claim that he was its sole engineer or that he alone had whelmed the strange forces and alien magic of the dweller no for hed required a deal of help with that shaithis couldnt remember exactly how the fight had been won but he did know that hed had a powerful ally who was here with him even now since he seemed to be the only one in any way aware of that other however and since he alone of all men was fit to command fit to proclaim himself warlord of the new wamphyri what difference did it make a wraith may not usurp a man he narrowed his eyes and glanced to the right and back a little but not so obviously that anyone would notice and peered a moment at the dark hooded thing in its black cloak where it stood close by watching all that transpired it was a black evil thing and entirely unknown and invisible to all save shaithis yet this was the creature which had made starsides conquest possible shaithis felt nothing whatsoever of gratitude but merely scowled for out of nowhere it had come to him that his secret faceless ally his invisible familiar was the true master here and he himself a mere figurehead which irritated him and turned his victory sour for he was wamphyri and territorial and there simply wasnt space in this or any other world for two warlords galvanized by some weird frustration suddenly shaithis started to his feet his prostrate thralls and their kneeling overseer lieutenants rose with him though all of them masters and minions alike shrank back from the severity of his gaze and four small warriors in dully glinting armour hissed their alarm at such a flurry of movement but nevertheless held to their positions in the far corners of the great hall at shaithiss feet the lady karen shrank back from her master her scarlet gaze seemed partly adoring aye she was treacherous as ever but mainly fearful he kicked her sprawling out of his way and strode alone to the higharched windows out there the dizzy aerial levels were now alive with entire colonies of smokyfurred desmodus bats like clouds of excited darting midges alongside shaithiss gigantic skyscouring warriors also rank upon rank of mantashaped flyers in ornate decorative trappings with lieutenants and highranking thrall riders seated proud in saddles tooled with shaithiss gauntlet sigil it was an airborne display of his power in the wake of his greatest victory shaithis stood there a moment arms akimbo and head held high and watched the flypast like a general inspecting his troops then he turned his hooded crimson eyes westward to light upon the dwellers garden or rather the high saddle in the grey hills where once a garden had blossomed ah but that was yesterday and now flames leaped there and black smoke boiled skyward and the underbellies of clouds where they scudded across the peaks were ruddy from the inferno blazing below them shaithis had vowed it and willed it into being and now it was real the garden was burning and its defenders were dead no not all of them not yet and bring them to me the dreaming vampire commanded of no one in particular i would deal with them now a halfdozen lieutenants hastened to obey and in a little while a pair of prisoners were led into shaithiss presence massive he dwarfed them of course he did for he was a lord of the wamphyri he hosted a vampire in his body and brain while his captives were merely human or were they for even now there was that defiant something in their bearing which in itself might almost be wamphyri then shaithis saw their eyes and knew the astonishing truth ah and how was this for revenge for there is nothing so delightful to a vampire than to torment torture and tap the life fluids of another or others of his own kind and dweller shaithis said his voice so softly threatening it was almost a whisper dweller come take off your golden mask for i know you now even as i should have known you right from the start ah but your magic had me fooled just as it fooled us all magic hah no such thing but the true art of the great vampire for who else but a master of every wamphyri talent aye and then some would dare to wage a oneman war against all the great lords that were and who else but the most crafty ah crafty vampire might ever have won such a war the dweller made no answer but simply stood there in his loosely flowing robes and golden mask behind which his red eyes burned and shaithis believing he saw terror in those halfhidden eyes smiled a grim smile oh yes for whether or not there was terror there now he knew that there would be soon enough as for the other prisoner shaithis would never forget this one for not only was he a helllander but also the dwellers father who had stood side by side with his son in the devastating battle at the garden when the wamphyri had been swatted out of starsides skies and crushed like so many gnats what was more when the fighting was over and all the great aeries of the wamphyri had been levelled all bar the bitch karens shaithis had seen this one with that selfsame lady in these very chambers karens private chambers as they had been at that time so that shaithis had wondered are they lovers well perhaps they had been and perhaps not it could be that theyd simply been allies against shaithis and his army of wamphyri lords and as a reward for her part in his defeat her aerie had been spared but only to become shaithiss in the fullness of time as everything else had become shaithiss he supposed that one way or the other it made little difference except that for some illdefined reason he really would like to know whether or not this helllander had known karen and been in her well that was a question he could resolve easily enough she sprawled beside the bonethrone where he had left her and now he called out karen come to me she made to stand up but he added quickly no crawl luscious body oiled and gleaming in the light of flaring flambeaux with only her golden bangles and rings to cover a figure which her vampire had made irresistible she obeyed her great bush of pubic hair was a glistening copper tangle the stains of her aureoles and spiked nipples were dark as bruises against the pale loll of her pendulous breasts even proceeding in the undignified animal fashion which shaithis demanded still her lithe loveliness could not be disguised when she was close to him then shaithis reached down quickly and bunched the mass of her red hair in his hand jerking back her head and yanking her to her feet she made no sound no protest but the dweller leaned forward a little a strange attitude or posture like a dog balanced on its hind legs and shaithis thought he heard a low growl rumbling behind the mask had he aroused the dwellers passions and if so what about those of his helllander father now still holding karen upright so that she stood upon her crimsonnailed toes shaithis deliberately looked away from the dweller and into the strange sad eyes of his punylooking father he cocked his great head on one side enquiringly and so youre the helllander who caused me so much trouble in the garden eh well little man it strikes me that you and your son were lucky that time and that if youre the best they have going for them beyond the sphere gate then its high time the wamphyri went through into the helllands and showed them what we can do except i have to admit theres something i cant quite fathom i mean a creature like you small soft puny with the pulpy parts of a virgin boy and youd have me believe youve been into this he knotted karens hair that much tighter in his great fist lifting her higher until she was obliged to dance on the very tips of her toes what and lived to brag about it shaithiss derisory laughter grated like a hot iron in ashes the helllander stiffened and his scarlet eyes widened a very little his mouth twitched in one corner his pale flesh turned paler yet but he found strength to suppress the cold fury which shaithiss scorn had momentarily induced in him and finally in a small quiet voice he answered you must believe what you will i neither confirm nor deny anything such negativity shaithis took it as a sign of the helllanders impotence for if he and karen had been lovers then doubtless hed delight in boasting how she was his castoff which was the way of it with the wamphyri in payment for which insolence shaithis would have him gutted with middling sharp instruments and before his living eyes feed his smoking entrails to a warrior but however impotent he might or might not be still the vampire lords question went unanswered very well shaithis shrugged then i shall assume she means nothing to you if i thought she did i would cut away your eyelids so that you couldnt close them and hang you in silver chains from the walls of my bedchamber where youd have no choice but to observe each smallest intricacy and nuance of our lovemaking before she died from it at which moment even as he said this thing dont the warning echoed like a gong struck in shaithiss mind and he knew its source at once glaring across the hall at the dark hooded thing he saw that where before the interior of its hood had been black and impervious as granite now the sulphur orbits and scarlet pinpricks of eyes were visible unblinking burning their message into his mind dont drive them too far i hold them enthralled their powers suppressed but goading them is like thrusting sharp staves under a warriors scales it makes them unstable galvanizes them weakens my hold upon them and shaithis sent back but theyre whelmed conquered whipped like dogs which no one knows better than you for you hold their minds like grapes in your hands to peel or crush as you will but as well as this i have warriors here and my many lieutenants and thralls aye and all of my creatures without thronging on the night wind now tell me pray what have i to fear only your greed my son and your pride the other answered but did you say your warriors lieutenants and thralls yours and not ours have i no part in your triumph then there were two of us shaithis remember and yet now you talk of t when you can only mean we a slip of the tongue obviously ah but then the tongues of all the wamphyri are forked are they not in answer to which shaithis hissed what do you want of me only that you are not prideful the dark hooded thing told him for i too was prideful in my time only to discover that it goes before a fall it was all too much tell a vampire not to be prideful restrict the towering enhanced emotions of a being such as shaithis but he was wamphyri and to the dark hooded thing i vowed karens death in a certain fashion at my hands in my bed my triumph will not be complete until it has come to pass or as nearly as possible also the dweller and his father have been my mortal enemies whom i intend to destroy then destroy them said the other his eyes blazing up huge as if gorged on fire kill them now but dont torture them for it could be that if they are driven to it yes i think that even they do not know their own strength their own powers shaithis was astonished their strength but cant you see that they are weaklings their powers plainly they are powerless aye and i shall prove it he released karens hair and she collapsed at his feet and in his dreams shaithis again turned to his captives who throughout his conversation with the dark hooded thing had stood as in a frozen tableau held fast by vampire thralls there was a time he told the pair then when the bitch karen betrayed her rightful master which is to say myself and all of the wamphyri at a stroke betrayed us what her treachery almost destroyed us there and then i vowed that when times and fortunes had changed i would slip a siphon into her living heart and drain her blood sip by sip also i vowed that while i emptied her of her juices i would fill her with my flesh a double ecstasy for a most undeserving lady so i vowed it so let it be and to his lieutenant go bring me my couch of black silken sheets and the sharp slender golden straw which you shall find upon my pillow shaithiss couch was carried in by six powerful thralls a fawning lieutenant proffered a small silken cushion bearing a slim wand of gold tubing whose funnel mouthpiece reflected the flaring torchlight shaithis took the golden straw threw off his robe and beckoned karen to the couch but as he moved to join her there again there came that rumbling growl from deep in the dwellers throat and again shaithis sensed this oddlypostured being leaning towards him like some nameless threat the vampire lord paused a moment cocked his head in mocking silent inquiry and smiled an utterly inhuman smile before seating himself upon the couch beside the apparently enthralled karen she lay there in a sort of vacant paralysis with her scarlet eyes fixed upon him but her breathing was shallow palpitating and gleaming beads of perspiration were starting from her brow in morbid anticipation catching up her left breast shaithis lifted it and examined the pale rib cage beneath then slipped the sharp tip of his golden straw between two of her ribs and eased it towards the pounding centre of her body as a bubble of her darkred blood formed around the siphon at the point of entry so shaithiss vampire lust brought him to massive erection he released his partially inserted siphon and gripped the inside of karens right thigh with a huge hand squeezing the flesh there as an indication that she should open herself to him which was when he felt her first tentative rejection of his will and the resistance of others bolstering her resolve and sensed the suddenly converging foci of forces previously unsuspected the dark hooded thing sensed them too crying out in shaithiss mind i warned you but too late for the vampire lords dream fantasy had now turned to sheerest nightmare for the third time shaithis heard the dwellers now unmistakably animal growl and shot him a wideeyed glance in time to see him wrench himself free from the pinioning grip of his guards then reach up and tear his own golden mask from his face except whatever shaithis had expected it was not there beneath that mask and as for the face which was there that resembled nothing even remotely human no for bristling and flateared it was the face or visage of a great grey wolf but its bloodgorged eyes were still those of the wamphyri its wrinkled quivering muzzle frothed and dripped saliva teeth like the blades of small scythes gleamed where the wet writhing muzzle revealed them in the next moment the snarling beast was this really the dweller had turned and snapped at an astonished former guard and even while shaithis gaped the things jaw closed like a steel trap on the lieutenants arm and sheared it below the elbow from then on all was madness as the huge upright creature more nearly completed its metamorphosis into a greyfurred lupine form so its voluminous robes shredded like so much rotten cloth to reveal its sheer size it was a wolf yes but as large as a big man shaithiss thralls having already witnessed the monsters speed and savage efficiency quickly backed off hastening their retreat the great wolf fell to all fours and launched itself at another lieutenant crunching effortlessly upon his head and through all of this the vampire lord on his couch grew only too well aware that fortunes tide had turned and that other inexplicable reversals were even now in motion nevertheless he determined that some of his dreamfantasy at least should be made to work for him and crushing karen in the circle of one great arm he gripped the golden straw where it was poised to pierce her heart and prepared to thrust it home he gripped it and at once snatched back his trembling hand for a second metamorphosis was even now taking place in karen which was no less rapid and awesome than that of the dweller into a wolf moreover it was loathsome as if shaithiss siphon had poisoned her and brought on some incredibly swift ageing process or corruptive catabolism karens flesh was collapsing before the vampire lords eyes her arms became yellowveined sticks from which her bangles clattered loosely to the floor her scarlet eyes turned a sick sunken yellow under matted eyelashes her skin was suddenly corrugated as the skin of dried fruit what he croaked as her ravaged lips drew back in a travesty of a smile and showed him her leprous forked tongue shrivelled gums and loose decaying teeth what it wasnt a question proper but she answered it anyway and her voice was a morbid cackle as she reached for shaithiss shrinking parts and said my lord im ready for you galvanized into frenzied activity shaithis slapped the flat of his hand to the siphons mouthpiece and drove it home into her body and a gurgling stream of stinking pus at once jetted out to splash against and adhere to his shuddering flesh with an inarticulate cry he staggered to his feet pointed at the dissolving liquefying thing on the couch and commanded destroy it remove it now the refuse pit but no one seemed to be listening shaithiss lieutenants and other thralls were in turmoil the dwellers wolf facet was ravaging among them like a fox among chickens and as for the dwellers helllander father the vampire lord could scarcely believe his own eyes the pair of hulking wamphyri aspirants who had dragged this small unassuming human being in here were now slumped smouldering shreds of blasted flesh puddling the flagged floor with their ichor and the magician oh yes for this surely was magic who had cindered them was at the window gazing out on starsides night skies and ruinscarred plain with devastating eyes for where and whenever his gaze alighted and lingered it brought fresh ruins and all across the sky in the deepening gloom of sundown shaithiss new wamphyri hordes were exploding into fiery tatters and raining their debris down among the shattered stacks of their olden forebears raging his frustration shaithis discovered himself robed again with his gauntlet at his hip knowing what must be done that he alone had the measure of the dweller and his father he fitted his deadly weapon to his hand and in the tradition of the olden wamphyri rushed at them to cut them down and why not for they were only flesh and blood after all just as the great white bears of the icelands had been flesh and blood and as the vampire lord knew only too well all flesh is weak even wamphyri flesh in the right circumstances in shaithiss mind the dark hooded thing heard his chaotic bloody thoughts and said fool but shaithis wasnt listening he came upon the helllander first and swung his gauntlet which froze in midair as if time itself had stopped but then shaithis saw that time had simply stretched itself and that his monstrous gauntlet crept across the intervening distance in a maddening slowmotion the dwellers father saw it coming and his strange sad eyes turned but oh so very slowly to burn upon shaithiss face and the scarlet eyes of his son the great changeling wolf were likewise upon shaithis from where that slavering creature floated on the air caught at the high point of its spring in the manner of the wamphyri the pair spoke to shaithis in his raging blooddrenched mind and not only them but the dark hooded thing too all saying the same thing you have destroyed us all your ambition your passion your pride die shaithis replied as his gauntlet collided little by little with the helllanders head and slowly shattered its bright core aye bright bright and blinding and deadly as the furnace sun itself for there was no blood no bone no grey and pulpy brain in the magicians head at all nothing but golden fire like the seething seering nuclear fire of the sun indeed it was the sun endlessly expanding out of the small destruction of the helllander to encompass and destroy everything shaithis started awake felt the ice against his flesh and thought for a moment that it was searing golden fire he cried out and a thousand fragile icicles shattered and came tinkling down from the icecastles fantastic ceiling in the next split second the vampire lord saw where he was and remembered what he was doing here and as his nightmare receded and reality closed on him so his breathing and the pounding of his heart gradually slowed thenhe scanned across the frozen expanse of the icecastle and found the dark forms of fess ferenc and arkis leperson in their niches and saw that the former had likewise come awake and now the ferencs gaze met his across the glittering icesheathed vault dreaming shaithis that one called out to him his words chasing themselves to and fro in the bitter echoing air of the place an omen perhaps you cried out and it seemed to me you were afraid shaithis wondered if the dream had been selfcontained like his inwarddirected thoughts or if fess had been listening in on it he hated the idea that anyone should spy on him especially in his subconscious where the seeds of all of his ambitions indeed his intentions were stored in darkness awaiting their germination an omen he eventually answered but quietly hiding what confusion lingered still no i think not nothing portended fess a pleasurable dream thats all of womanflesh and sweet traveller blood of the lady karen rotting on my couch and the entire wamphyri race wiped out in the sunburst of an alien mind huh the other grunted i dreamed only of ice i dreamed i was frozen in an icetomb and that some unknown thing was melting its way in to me then its as well my cry of sweet pleasure woke you up said shaithis aye but too early the ferenc grumbled arkis sleeps on in this hes the wise one lets drift a further hour or two before were up and about shaithis agreed and grateful that the giant had not read him he settled down again and closed an eye and again shaithis dreamed except that this time even more certainly than the last he knew it was much more than any common dream the setting was a meeting between himself and the being known as shaitan the fallen whom he recognized at once as that selfsame dark hooded thing who had been his sinister frowning familiar perhaps even his alterego in his nightmare of frustrated revenge he was aware of the thing as a shadow among lesser shadows in a cavern of black rock unsuspected except for the red glow of its eyes where they floated in luminous yellow orbits what he shaithis was doing in such a place he could not say except that he felt hed been called here yes that was it he was not here entirely of his own free will but mainly because this enigmatic being had called him here and as if to confirm that thought shaithis my son said the dark hooded thing whose true voice was deeper darker and probably more deceiving than any shaithis ever heard before and so at last youve answered me difficult to reach you my son through that clever deflective screen of yours else i had known you and called you here long before now shaithiss wamphyri eyes and awareness were accustomed now to the gloom of the place indeed he saw and sensed as well as ever which is to say very well indeed as a cat at night or desmodus on the wing the darkness made no difference in fact and with regard to his whereabouts it merely served to confirm his first instinctive guess that he was in some natural chamber deep in the belly of the slumbering volcano which would appear to make shaitan the lord of these subterranean regions in such close proximity the other read his thoughts as if theyd been spoken words and answered but of course just as i have been since oh a long long time shaithis peered intently at the crimsoneyed shadow which was shaitan it was strange but for all his vampireenhanced awareness he saw only an outline of the others form no fault of his his senses were not impaired shaitan must be shielding his physical self in a manner like to shaithis guarding his thoughts but shaitan the fallen could it really be was it really possible for any creature to live so long he made up his mind that indeed it must be for here he stood in the presence of just such a one and this isnt just a dream said shaithis then with a shake of his head i can feel your presence and know you are real that same shaitan of whom kehrl lugoz was and is so mortally afraid that ancient being out of the first annals of wamphyri legend you were banished here in prehistory and you live here still all true the other answered and darkness stirred where he stood as if he had offered a casual shrug i am that same shaitan the socalled unborn who was and is your immemorial ancestor ah said shaithis as truth finally dawned we are of one blood indeed and obviously so you stand out from the others like a meteor speeding through the stirless stars much as i stood out in that distant time when i fell to earth and our ambitions are the same aye and our intelligence i am your origin shaithis and your future and you are mine our futures are bound up together inextricably outside of these icelands you mean in more civilized places in starside and in worlds beyond starside what shaithis was taken aback for there was something here which smacked of that earlier dream worlds beyond starside you mean the helllands for a start and you know of such places upon a time i was the inhabitant of just such a place but that was before i fell or was thrown to earth and you remember it i remember nothing of it the dark hooded thing growled moving marginally closer and there was that about its motion as if its very flux had intelligence a sentient viscosity which caused shaithis to take a pace to the rear my memory all memory was robbed from me when i was cast out no memory of what you did who and how you were again the thing moved closer and once more shaithis backed away but not too far for fear he should back right out of his own dream only my name and that i was vain and proud and beautiful said shaitan conjuring more echoes of that former dream but it was a long time ago my son and given time all things change i too have changed changed shaithis tried hard to understand youre no longer vain no longer proud but even the least of the wamphyri know such vices and enjoy them they always will shaitan slowly shook his hooded head which shaithis knew from the movement of his crimson eyes in their yellow orbits the only parts of the creature which were visible through the warp of his inky impenetrable mental shield no longer beautiful he said but its the same for all of us shaithis answered we know we are not beautiful and accept it and anyway what has beauty to do with power why there are those of us who even foster our ugliness as a measure of our might inadvertently he thought of volse pinescu shaitan picked the picture clean out of his mind aye that one was ugly but he himself willed it i did not and physically and mentally hideous as the wamphyri are still by comparison they are beautiful and for the third time he came closer shaithis stood his ground but groped for his gauntlet it was a dream true but hed not yet relinquished all control do you wish me harm he said on the contrary the other answered for weve a long way to go together but this art i practise is wearying it were better if you knew me as i am then show me yourself i was preparing to shaitan answered indeed i was preparing you enough said shaithis i am prepared so be it said his ancestor and relaxed his hypnotic will what shaithis saw then shocked him awake a second time as if the sleeping volcano itself had erupted under his feet he started up gasping in his iceniche wideeyed and astonished by the castles luminous light after the dreamdarkness of the cones core with a chill in his black heart spawned more far more of what the dark hooded thing had shown him than of any mundane or merely physical condition and because the dream had been more than a dream in fact a visitation it didnt fade back into some subconscious limbo of obscurity but remained sharp etched in the eye of his mind as clear as the sigils on an aeries fluttering banners and pennants shaithis himself a monster in every respect was not a creature to shock easily where the wamphyri were concerned fear or horror were more or less defunct concepts eradicated and replaced by rage adrenalin was rarely released into a vampires system to encourage or enable flight but usually to trigger his animal passions so that he would stand and fight viciously brutally an awareness of their superiority had been bred into starsides vampires through all the long centuries of their sovereignty when it was indisputable that of all their worlds creatures they were far and away the dominant species much as common man was dominant in his world but the fact remained that shaithis had once been a common man a traveller vampirized when shaidar shaigispawn renamed him made him his chief lieutenant or son and gave him his egg and as such hed learned what fear was all about even now after half a millennium he still remembered if only when he slept for however monstrous a man may become the things that frightened him as a youth will continue to do so in his dreams what had frightened shaithis the most in those early days of his abduction from sunside in that time now five hundred years in the past before the lord shaidar coughed his scarlet egg into his throat and changed him for ever had been the many and monstrous anomalies of shaidars lofty aerie the cartilage creatures and gasbeasts the entirely unthinkable siphoneers the vast vats in the lower levels of the stack where trogs and travellers alike became flyers or warriors or yet weirder facets of shaidars hybrid experimentation for the vampire lord had delighted in showing to shaithis at that time a young as yet innocent traveller his most nightmarish creations and in torturing his mind with the halfthreat that one day he too might be a diamondheaded flyer armourscaled warrior or flaccid pulpy siphoneer morbid distortions and abnormalities such as these then had been the harbingers of shaithiss worst nightmares during those early days of wamphyri apprenticeship but in time as he himself ascended to the aeries throneroom such fears had receded been suppressed had succumbed to the vampire in him which bade him become a maker of monsters in his own right an art in which finally hed excelled and his flyers had been the most weirdly graceful his warriors ferocious beyond any previous ferocity and his other creations and experiments varied so that it was only in dreams out of his youth that he remembered and took fright at such things except that even in the most vivid and aweinspiring of these nothing that memory had conjured had been half as monstrous as that which the dark hooded thing had shown him ugly shaitan had called himself but there is ugly and there is ugly and as for hybridism shaithis pictured again the thing which had stood there when his ancestor relaxed his hypnotic shield to let himself be seen as he really was an abomination which not even the most perverse or insane wamphyri mind might envisage made all the worse through its reality it had been what a mansized slug or leech corrugated glistening black and mottled greygreen but rearing upright like a man a vampire yes such as might develop from an egg inside a man or woman but grown huge beyond all reasonable measures so that shaithis had wondered but if this grew inside a man then what became of its host then as the grotesque but mainly vague picture of the thing made vague by virtue of its obscenity scarred itself into his mind so hed become aware of something of its finer detail which in the next moment had sufficed to shock him awake the thing no he must not think of it as a thing alone but also as shaitan his ancestor had rubbery limbs some of which ended in suckered tentacles others however did not but were equipped with vestigial human and other animal parts mummied hands and withered rudimentary feet and even a gleaming bone claw and it was these parts and also shaitans flat composite face on its spadeshaped cobra head which repulsed shaithis the most and brought about the resurgence of his longforgotten phobia for he knew that the hybridism he saw here was not that of some wamphyri lords experimental vats but of nature or rather of the vampires unnatural tenacity its determination to cling to life in circumstances however desperate through travails and triumphs down all the nameless ages aye for the lord shaitan had grown simply too ancient for the accommodation of mortal human flesh and his original body had wasted away to be replaced almost in its entirety by the metamorphic organism which was his vampire which was indeed now him ugly the result was hideous especially so to shaithis in his dream for there it had been the embodiment of every nightmare of his apprenticeship as to how he knew the fate which had befallen shaitan in his icebound isolation his evolution no devolution from manvampire or wamphyri to pure vampire that had been written in the vast intelligence hatred and sheer evil of the leechthings scarlet eyes unblinking under their cobras hood not the unbridled mindless hatred so often seen in the seething eyes of a warrior or the vacant lidless stare of a hugely nodding flyer and certainly not the watery vapid gaze of a siphoneer but such evil intelligence that shaithis had known this thing was no morbid experiment but a true mutation he had known too with reinforced certainty that indeed this was shaitan the unborn called the fallen for of all wamphyri legends there was one of universal prevalence that to the innermost core of his being shaitan had been evil above all other men and creatures dark liaison shaithiss mental guard was down his mind accessible as he emerged more fully from sleep and there was someone there a dark presence to take advantage of his confusion it was shaitan of course even at a distance his gurgling venomous voice was unmistakable evil do you say i was evil no i was wronged wronged by the wamphyri my own kind for i was stronger than them and they feared me and you son of my sons do you also fear me see how you start awake from me as if i were some doom come down upon you rather than your salvation shaithis went to close his mind and hesitated his hideous ancestor was the master of the dead volcano wasnt he what harm could he do from there this could well be the perfect opportunity to learn more about him without alerting the others to his presence shaitan picked all these thoughts out of shaithiss mind and chuckled monstrously aye he gurgled for it would never do to let them in on our secret not until its too late or at least too late for them shaithis lay back narrowed his eyes and scanned across the glittering expanse of the icecastles hollow heart to focus upon the huddled shapes of fess ferenc and arkis leperson where they slept on he reached out with his wamphyri awareness to touch upon the flimsy mental barriers theyd erected about their sleeping minds satisfying himself that they were in fact asleep and finally he answered that dark intelligence which had proclaimed itself his ancestor i think i prefer you this way shaitan out in the open as it were and not cloaked in dreams but it was clever of you to break in on me like that my socalled peers among the wamphyri were never up to it they were not of your blood shaitan at once answered or should we say they were not of mine our minds mesh like those of twin brothers shaithis its a sign that youre a true son of my sons so that we are as one we were meant to be as one and triumph over all adversity and then go on to victories unimaginable aye shaithis nodded wonderingly in this and in other worlds as you have stated i think it would be interesting to know more about that indeed it would interest me greatly to retake starside from the alien enemies who dwell there now and to avenge myself upon them now tell me your thoughts for youve hinted weve a way to go together have you planned our first steps along that way and how do i know can trust you anyway your legends are infamous even among the wamphyri who themselves are not much known for straight dealing again shaitans loathsome chuckle my son youll trust me because you have to because without me youre stuck here and i shall trust you for the same reason but if a token of my good will is required have you not already seen enough of it who was it sent his small albino bats to you to keep your sore bones warm while you slept and who was it disposed of one of your enemies whose intentions were dire against you to say the least an enemy shaithis raised a mental eyebrow and who might that have been what the other seemed taken aback but you know well enow i speak of the abominable whelky one who disguised himself with pustules and was companion to the ferenc why time and again he urged that grotesque giant to seek you out and murder you shaithis nodded that would be volses way sure enough i was never a favourite of his nor he of mine the monstrous clown if his wens had been wits hed outshone the lot of us so it was your beast that killed him eh of course of course shaitans mental voice sank deeper and darker yet and do you think i could not kill you too ah i could my son i could but will not his tone was light again in a moment no for i sense that well do well together and since in various ways ive already shown my good will the next stage is up to you stage shaithis frowned what stage is that of the plan shaitan explained or would you have me do it all and likewise claim all the credit explain but theres nothing to explain just go along with it in accordance with your own plan exactly as planned and that will suffice in short bring them to me my son so that i may deal with them in my way fess and the lepers son and will you kill them and then me too perhaps maybe id do better to stay joined with them against you better the devil you know they say and after long moments devil thats a word i dont much care for said shaitan i dont know why but i dont like it be advised not to call me that again not even obliquely shaithis shrugged as you will and before he could say or ask any more they are waking up shaitan hissed the squat one and the giant both best if i leave now and not compromise you only bring them to me shaithis a great deal depends upon it and as suddenly as that shaithiss mind was free of outside interference but only just in time shaithis the ferencs rumble echoed in the cold air i sense that youre awake hah its a bad conscience makes a man restless as you youll have to mend your ways and he laughed uproariously the icecastle shuddered and sent down a cascade of variously sized icicles which in turn brought arkis more fully awake scratching himself the lepers son sat up whats all the noise he demanded time we were up shaithis called across to him no more delays we make our breakfast poor fare that it is and then were on our way what or whoever the volcano houses hes our meat today and all his goods in the bargain big talk shaithis the other answered but weve to get past the pale caverndwelling bloodbeast first three of us this time said shaithis and forewarned is forearmed anyway fess knows the beasts lair well give it a wide berth and seek some other way in the ferenc chewed on cold meat and made his way down to the floor of the hall i for one am ready for it he said a man cant live for ever not even a lord of the wamphyri not that weve seen anyway and im damned if ill die of boredom or locked in the ice terrified that something will find me there and dig me out oh shaithis kept his thoughts guarded not live for ever well perhaps not but close enough if shaitan is anything to go by and wouldnt that in itself be sufficient reason to team up with the ancient to discover the secrets of his longevity it surely would as for arkis and the ferenc shaithis knew that sooner or later hed be obliged to have it out with them anyway so why delay matters and even better if shaitan desired to have a hand in it with these thoughts and others like them in his mind but always guarded especially thoughts such as these shaithis joined the others where they prepared to leave the icecastle and a short time later the three set out upon their long slow climb up the frozen rise to where the central cone jutted some fifteen hundred feet higher still like a black crouching giant the tower of volcanic rock waited for them sombre under its canopy of cold stars and writhing auroral fire shaitans miniature albino bats accompanied them almost invisible against the snowand iceglare forming an endless entourage whose members came and went reporting all back to their immemorial master in this way he was kept informed of the progress of the three and was pleased to note that they followed a most admirable route one which would lead them directly into one of his many mantraps an ambush aye except that this time there would be no killing no for there were other better things to do with men such as fess ferenc and arkis leperson than kill them what good strong wamphyri flesh such as theirs and they had their vampires in them didnt they just as volse pinescu had once had his in him ah but that had been a treat volse had been monstrous on the outside right enough with all of his pimples polyps and other excrescences but just half an inch under his whelky skin there had been a mass of fatty tissues and good strong longpig meat hanging on a frame of bones like any other man except because he was wamphyri there was a lot more to him than there was to other men for deep inside him there was also his vampire so that after shaitans ingurgitor had drained him of his blood and dragged the shattered shell of him before its master what sheer delight to tear open volses pallid body and seek out his leech the living vampire whose squirming had so cleverly avoided the ingurgitors siphonlike probe but which could not avoid shaitan and finally to behead the thing and gorge on its nectar fluids having first scooped up its skittering egg and stored it in a jar of volses brains mushed to a paste as a tidbit for later ah yes for to the wamphyri such is the essence of a gourmet feast even then shaitan had not been quite finished with his victim for extracts of volses flesh which was infected with vampire metamorphism and so not entirely dead even now would be useful to him in his experimentation the creation of hybrid creatures such as the ingurgitor and other useful constructs to which end the flayed drained gutted decapitated but none the less living remains of volse had been stored with shaitans other materials for use later aye even as the giant ferencs and the squat arkis lepersons remains would be stored if all went according to plan but as for shaithis well there are plans and there are plans shaithis was of the blood of shaitans blood and of all the wamphyri who had been he was also beautiful not by human standards no but certainly by shaitans beautiful strong vibrant with life ah but then the blood is the life and when shaitan dwelled on matters such as these then he no less than his wily descendant kept his thoughts well hidden meanwhile his small albinos continued to apprise him of the trios progress in a little while he saw that theyd strayed from the path somewhat so that he must needs redirect them but in order to do that he must first contact shaithis who at that very moment toiled halfway up the fused volcanic slag cliffs toward the western face of the cone the other two were within hailing distance but their minds were concentrated on the task in hand shaitan aimed a narrow powerful beam of thoughts directly into shaithiss mind with which he was now a little better acquainted son of my sons he said you go somewhat astray your route requires some small adjustment shaithis was momentarily startled but quickly controlled the agitated flutter of his thoughts not before fess ferenc had sensed something however what fess called out across the precipitous naked rock face did something alarm you just then shaithis my foot slipped on a patch of ice shaithis lied its a long way down if i had fallen i was gearing myself for metamorphosis the ferenc nodded across the gulf aye we grow weak upon a time id revel in forming an airshape and flying from these heights now it would deplete me considerably we must watch how we go now shaithis could answer his ancestors inquiry but he must do so carefully with all of his effort concentrated on keeping his telepathic sendings private to this end he made himself secure on a small ledge before answering shaitan you almost gave me away then now tell me how do we stray from the path and how may i correct it also youd better tell me what to expect ive no desire to end up pierced to the heart and drained off like volse pinescu fool the other at once hissed i thought we had had that out if i wanted you dead you would be dead i could send a creature even now to buffet you all three from the face of the cliff perhaps youd fly and perhaps not whichever youd be depleted and my creatures would find you and finish it but i need you shaithis we need each other and so you live as for the others i do not wish to damage them i want them whole cant you see what a fine pair of warriors arkis and the ferenc would make shaitans words were so ominous he could only be speaking truth he would not dare boast of such superiority unless he could deliver it was in effect an ultimatum even a threat make up your mind join me now or suffer the consequences in answer to which very well said shaithis we work together tell me what to do without pause shaitan explained the lepers son climbs too far towards the east diagonally away from you in his way lies an old unguarded lavarun which leads directly to my rooms at volcanos core if arkis were to discover the mouth of this cave he could jeopardize my position certainly my plans would require rapid and radical alteration an unguarded entrance careless of you my resources are not unlimited no more talk you must draw the others especially arkis back towards you very well said shaithis and to the others out loud arkis fess were too far apart and i sense a problem to the east arkis at once secured himself in a lavaniche and peered out and about a problem he blustered and close by you say huh i sense nothing but his voice was full of nervous tension and his thoughts went this way and that the ferenc closer to shaithis by some fifty feet began to edge towards him something has bothered me all along he said ive had my suspicions anyway and youre right shaithis spread out like this were too easy to pick off but i see and feel nothing arkis again protested like a man whistling in the dark with a shrug in his voice shaithis called out to him are you saying that your wamphyri awareness is stronger than both of ours combined then by all means lets test it out do as you will be the master of your own destiny at least you were warned that was enough arkis started climbing more to the left bringing himself back into line on a course converging with the others and not a moment too soon for shaithis from his own position had finally spotted the dark shadow of a cave to arkiss right and a little above him by now the lepers son would certainly have come across it in shaithiss mind the dark thoughts of his ancestor came a little easier good the problem was not insurmountable but the easy way is usually the best what now shaithis inquired of him above you is a wide ledge formed of an earlier cone shaitan answered when you strike it move to the left that is westward soon you will come across another lavarun ignore it and carry on the next entrance will seem like a mere crack occasioned as the rock cooled but this is your route into the volcano except you should take up a position to the rear of the others do i make myself plain shaithis shivered perhaps a little from the numbing cold which was beginning to bite even into his wamphyri bones but mainly at what was implied for thoughts like speech often lend themselves to diverse interpretation and certainly hed detected the ominous tone of the others slyly insinuating mental voice yes and hed known that the depth of shaitans thoughts did not bear plumbing it was strange to be wamphyri and yet feel something of awe at the implied evil in anothers scheming shaitan he eventually cautiously answered im putting my trust in you it seems my future is now in your hands and mine in yours said the other now continue to guard your thoughts and concentrate on your climbing and he was gone again shaithis suddenly found himself wondering at the wisdom of this dark liaison indeed there seemed little of wisdom in it it was mainly a matter of instinct and of course necessity but any advantage was shaitans this was his territory and he knew it well and he was not without resources shaithis could only hope that the ancients plans for the ferenc and arkis leperson did not extend to him also but he sensed that they did not not for now anyway his wamphyri instinct again which had seldom let him down but theres always a first time and a last he avoided morbid conjecture and looked for brighter omens of course there was always his dream that first dream of the lady karens aerie where he had been returned to power after some fabulous conquest of starside and the destruction of the dwellers garden he had the feeling that as dreams go there had been an element of foretokening to it except there was an old wamphyri maxim that men should never read the future too closely for to do so is to tempt destiny and anyway the dream had ended in disaster and ruin but at least it had hinted that there was in fact a future to look forward to how much of a one was anyones guess a ledge fess ferenc grunted dragging himself up ahead of shaithis as shaithiss face appeared level with the rim the giant reached down a huge taloned hand shaithis looked at it for several long moments then took it and the ferenc hauled him easily up on to the level surface last time you had the chance you threw me down shaithis reminded him last time you were reaching for your gauntlet the giant replied then arkis came up and joined them you and your premonitions he grumbled i still say i sensed nothing harmful also i believe i was almost into some sort of cave it might well have been a tunnel but shaithis said oh an empty cave dyou think or did it perhaps contain one of fesss swordsnouts wouldnt i have sensed it arkis frowned fess ferenc scowled volse didnt he said nor did i until it was too late and turning to shaithis what now shaithis narrowed his scarlet eyes and made a small show of sniffing the air with his flattened convoluted snout the area to the right still feels dangerous to me he said so i vote we follow this rim to the left a while out of the suspect region well see where it leads at least it will give us a breather from all this climbing the ferenc nodded his grotesque head suits me but how weve come down in the world eh as they set off along the ledge arkis said come down how so the ferenc shrugged just look at us three lords or exlords of the wamphyri stripped of most of our powers going like frightened children in a huddled group to explore strange new regions and afraid of what might jump out on us afraid arkis puffed himself up speak for yourself the ferenc sighed and said simply but i saw the thing that lanced the great boil remember at that moment it grew darker and the three paused to glance speculatively apprehensively at each other a thin cloud layer had drifted in to cover the higher reaches of the cone the first small flakes of snow began to drift down and coat the ledge arkis looked at the sky all about one cloud he voiced his thoughts out loud which just happened to form here a vampire mist dyou think obviously said the ferenc whoever dwells here hes sensed us coming and seeks to make it harder for us he makes his lair more obscure and the way to it more difficult which means were on the right track shaithis added he set off again along the ledge and behind him the others almost automatically followed on huh arkis grunted well at least your premonitions were good perhaps too good it seems to me this one has the edge on us he sees and knows all while we remain in the dark as it were he swatted at a small white bat which flitted too close and the ferencs eyes went wide as he gave a small start and burst out his albinos his bats we should have known thats how he tracks our course the midges pursue us like fleas after a wolf cub shaithis nodded sagely i had suspected as much theyre his minions no less than desmodus and his small black cousins were ours back on starside they scan our whereabouts and circumstances reporting all back to whoever arkis gaped and grasped his arm drawing him to a halt you suspected these things and said nothing a suspicion is only a suspicion until its an established fact shaithis answered angrily shrugging away the others restraining hand and anyway it makes a very important point and gives us an insight into his circumstances eh insight circumstances what are you on about what point does it make why that the cones master fears us bats to report our movements a snowfall to hinder us a swordsnouted creature guarding his hive as the soldier bees of sunside guard their honey oh yes he fears us which in turn means that hes vulnerable and to himself good reckoning perhaps he really is but still ill take my chances with him at least we have this much in common our intelligence and at once gurgling in shaithiss mind and our blood my son dont forget our blood again at once the ferenc snapped what his huge head swung round in shaithiss direction and his eyes glared under gathered black brows what was that did you say or think something just then shaithis shaithis hid his momentary panic behind bland innocence eh he raised an eyebrow say something think something whats on your mind fess and as the ferenc and arkis scanned nervously all about he sent a tripleshielded thought twice youve almost given me away shaitan do you think this is a game if theres so much as a hint of what im up to im a goner the ferenc scowled on my mind no nothing on my mind except to get finished with this thats all he straightened from his halfcrouch so what say you do we go on or do we call it a day is he vulnerable this master of the volcano or are we even more so its a nervy business this climbing in the snow not knowing whats waiting for us shaitan came whispering into shaithiss mind get on with it bring them in bring them to me do it quickly for hes no fool this giant hes sensitive and weve both underestimated him youll need to watch him and carefully ive noticed said shaithis to the others almost conversationally how the small albinos come and go from the west so i say we stick to the ledge and see where it goes no the ferenc growled somethings wrong im sure of it shaithis looked at him then at arkis do you wish to go down again have we wasted all our time and effort has a cloaking vampire mist entirely unnerved you but our enemy wouldnt have issued it unless we had unnerved him arkis said im with the ferenc shaithis shrugged then i go on alone eh the ferenc stared hard at him then be sure you go to your death how so is this the place where volse was taken no that was on the other side but then ill take my chances arkis said alone shaithis shrugged which is worse to die now or later better to do it here i think locked in combat than locked in the ice with something drilling its way to my heart and then suddenly as if hed run out of patience he hissed at both of them there are three of us remember three great hah wamphyri lords against what an unknown being who quite obviously fears us almost as much as we as you fear him and he turned away from them shaithis the ferenc called after him in a tone halfangry halfadmiring enough shaithis snapped over his shoulder ive done with you if i win through all is mine and if i lose well at least ill die as ive lived wamphyri he continued along the ledge and without looking back sensed the eyes of the two following him then were with you came the ferencs final decision but still shaithis stared straight ahead and at last he heard arkiss voice too calling out shaithis wait for us he did no such thing but hurried on that much faster so that now they must scramble to catch up and with the pair hot on his heels so he came upon the mouth of the first cave even as shaitan had forewarned here because it would be expected of him shaithis paused breathing heavily the others saw the dark cavern entrance into which he concentrated his gaze a way in dyou think said arkis but none too eagerly shaithis stared harder yet into the caves gloomy interior then made a show of carefully backing away from it obviously so he said perhaps too obviously and to the ferenc what say you fess for its amply apparent that the cold of these climes has focused your awareness to a fault is this a safe way to go or not myself i think not it seems to me that far back in the cavern something stirs i sense a thing of great bulk but limited intelligence yet stealthy too which was of course the ferencs own description of a swordsnout and as shaithis had hoped might be the case it put a picture of just such a creature into the giants mind fess thrust forward his great head into the cave glared into its depths and wrinkled his snoutlike nose and aye he growled in a little while i sense it too and indeed this could well be a way in for the cones master has guarded it with a bloodbeast shaithis nodded or maybe with the bloodbeast eh said arkis perhaps he has only the one creature said shaithis for if there were a pair then fess here might well have been taken at the same time as volse but what does that matter now fess shrugged even on its own this thing is a monster are you suggesting we might go against it madness one of us would surely die possibly two even all of us or at least end up sorely wounded before this thing succumbed i saw it strike three times in as many seconds unerringly and ram volse through and through like a fish on a travellers spear why he didnt even know what hit him but shaithis shook his head no im not proposing to take it on quite the opposite what im saying is this if theres only one such beast and its here then we go in by some other route what arkis scowled and they come thick and fast these entrances and exits do they shaithis shrugged so it would seem the tunnel where volse was taken the cave you thought you saw back there on the lavacliff this dark entrance here before us now listen the master of the cone sent a mist to confuse us didnt he but not to keep us from this cave not if this is where hes stationed his swordsnout so perhaps theres another entrance close by he gave a sharp nod i say we continue to follow the ledge a little way at least then even if it comes to nothing at least well have explored this part of the face to the full fair enough said the ferenc no argument here as long as youre not asking me to go in there arkis growled then lets get on we waste time with all this talk and conjecture he started off in the lead and the ferenc followed on and now shaithis brought up the rear overhead the small cloud had snowed itself out the aurora writhed and the stars gave the icy curve of the worlds horizon a blue sheen shaithis sensed the vampire awareness of his two companions focused ahead leaving him free to converse with shaitan and there he sent a tightguarded thought and how does this formation suit you also what was the idea of the small snow storm i thought you were eager for them yet there you go trying to frighten them off the answer came back at once first your formation suits both of us very well second the snow served to confuse and distract them especially the giant now listen and ill describe your route from this point forward very soon now youll come to a place where the rock is riven into deep crevices one such crack has been filled in with lava which forms a floor follow this and it will lead you direct to my abode at the hollow core as for your companions alas their time runs very short indeed they havent enough of it to find their way here not on their feet anyway there was nothing of humour in shaitans mental voice only an icy resolve shaithis made no further comment and anyway arkis heading the column had come to a halt fess joined him then shaithis before them the surface of the ledge and the nearvertical face of the cliff were split with deep fissures a full pace in width arkis looked at the others what now we go on said shaithis perhaps his reply had been too ready or he had sounded too sure of himself for the ferenc looked at him for long moments and at last the giant said but the way looks like a jumble of broken rock any cave we find will surely have collapsed in upon itself we wont know that until we look shaithis answered its just that i feel were very close now the ferenc narrowed his eyes it appears im not the only one whose awareness has been focused to a fault but very well we press on arkis lead the way the lepers son muttering darkly to himself stepped out across the first crack teetered a little on the far side and found his balance and so they all proceeded then after negotiating a halfdozen more crevasses ho arkis called back but this next crack has a floor formed of a frozen river of rock an ancient lavarun said fess joining him shaithis came last and looked at the cliff riven where in olden times the flow had forced an exit lava from the secret heart of the volcano he said so perhaps weve found our way in after all the ferenc stepped under the cliffs overhang into the shadow of the cleft let me scan it arkis went after him with shaithis bringing up the rear and they all three sniffed the air probing the way ahead with keen vampire senses until at last arkis ventured i sense nothing likewise said shaithis relieved that the smalltalented diredeath had discovered no threat where in fact he found the place menacing and uninviting in the extreme the ferenc however seemed of a similar mind to shaithis except he was perfectly and honestly willing to voice it i dont like it he gave his opinion for it smells too much like the cave where volse got his youve let volses death prey on your mind shaithis told him and anyway and as has been said before forewarned is forearmed also there are three of us this time arkis and i we have our mighty gauntlets and you have your even mightier talons and in any case were already decided that the bloodbeast was hidden in that first cave myself he paused to sniff the caves air again i think it likely that the cones master has worked some beguilement here he has gloomed on this place and left the smell of death here but a smell is only a smell and i smell success im for going in he looked from fess to arkis arkis shrugged if this socalled cones master has comforts in there then im with you shaithis ive had it to the tusks with hardship i could use some rich red blood in my belly and a woman in my bed dyou suppose its a harem he guards so jealously shaithiss turn to shrug ive never been a one for the histories he said but ive heard it said that some of the banished lords took their concubines with them we cant say what well find until we find it comforts aye said the ferenc licking his lips i could use some of those myself very well we go on shaithis put on a scowl and said and hows this for a turn of events are you suddenly our leader it seems you like having the last word fess ferenc arkis you lead the way and very well we go on bah was fesss retort if no one ever made a decision then wed be here for ever here let me lead the way which was exactly what shaithis had wanted the darkness of the interior was like daylight to the vampire lords indeed it was preferable to the auroral light and the blue sheen cast by the stars the ferenc strode where the way was obvious and unobstructed inched along where it was made obscure by jumbles or where the uneven ceiling came down low or where blisters of lava had burst to form jaggedrimmed circular cusps of rock like small craters in the almost corrugated texture of the floor and where other natural fissures or blowholes radiated from the main run he steadfastly followed the ancient lava flow arkis stayed a pace or so to the ferencs rear followed immediately by shaithis as they progressed so the oppressive sensation of ominous expectancy or foreboding lifted a little which to diredeath and the ferenc at least lent credence to shaithiss theory that the volcanos dweller had deliberately set a fearful aura over the mouth of the run to dissuade any wouldbe explorers shaithis stayed very much on the alert kept his thoughts fully guarded would have liked to contact shaitan but dared not not with fess and arkis probing in all directions with their minds their wamphyri awareness sharp for the smallest hint of mental activity and always they moved deeper into the heart of the rock eventually the ferenc called a halt whispering we must be halfway in at least time to take stock of what arkis grunted his blunt query sounded like an avalanche echoing out and back in slowly decreasing waves of sound dolt fess whispered again when he could be heard what use to have the senses of bats to be able to smell out the way ahead like wolves and keep our minds tuned for the thoughts of others when at every opportunity all you can do is make great noise would you alert our enemy to our presence abashed arkis kept his answer low hell if hes at home surely by now he knows were coming perhaps shaithis intervened but in any case lets keep it quiet taking stock yes said the ferenc going first all this way has taken the edge of my awareness arkis you can spell me no problem the other took the lead glad for the chance to make amends but after moving on only a dozen or so paces now hold arkis said somethings weird they had all felt it at the same time a sensory void a region vacant of all vibrancies whether for good or evil a place stagnant as some stirless sunless subterranean lake and they likewise knew what that meant that the place had been made sterile for even darkness and cold stone have a feel to them someone wanted them to believe that there was nothing absolutely nothing here because there was something here shaithiss flesh tingled and he knew the others must be feeling the same sensation arkis in the lead stood rooted to the spot gurgling inarticulately but it was much too late for gurgling anything shaithis felt the heavy mental curtain deliberately ripped open felt fear and horror springing into being behind it and rushing to burst through its tattered drapes then saw the blur of leprous grey which was to be the end of arkis leperson called diredeath and indeed his death was dire where the thing came from would be hard to say a niche in the wall of the place a sidetunnel a hiding place in the lee of some bulge of lava but it came at great speed and with fell intent and it was exactly as the ferenc had described it patched white and grey mottled like veined marble it seemed to uncoil or erupt into being as if some massive boulder halfburied in the floor had come to life and reshaped itself its legs were a blur claws scrabbling as it reared before arkis its fishlike head bore a bone lance tapered to a sharp point and equipped with thorns or hooks all along its length its eyes were like saucers fixing its victim with their emotionless glare arkiss gauntlet was on his hand ready but as he raised his arm the thing struck at him in a move too fast to follow its lance gashed his short squat neck as it sawed past and its needletoothed jaws closed on his gauntlet arm the arm was severed swallowed at a gulp in drawing back the thing sawed at arkiss neck again and sliced into his whistling airpipe in the next moment its lance was rammed forward a second time directly into him piercing his squat body to the heart he jerked and throbbed where he was held upright on the bone blade and his tusks chomped on thin air turning red as he coughed up a spray of blood fess whirled away from the scene shaithis thought to run and his eyes were huge and scarlet but a lot more than simple fear lit them there was fury too the giant grabbed shaithis with one taloned hand and drew back the other like a bunch of blackgleaming scythes treacherous bastard he snarled your fathers egg was rotten and the pus is still in you what shaithis forced the metamorphic flesh of his hand to expand within his gauntlet are you mad in trusting you i must be the ferenc readied himself to thrust at shaithis to punch in through his ribs with his taloned hand grasp his living heart and wrench it out but something stopped him something he had seen behind shaithis shaitan was the colour and texture of black lava only his movement against the rocksplash wall had given him away and only then because he wanted to be seen fess saw him and his jaw fell open he took a great gulp of air and forgot to strike at shaithis who rewarded him by crashing his clenched gauntlet into the side of his head then shaithiss immemorial ancestor brushed him aside out of the ferencs suddenly loose grasp and wrapped the stunned giant in a nest of lashing tentacles with his arm locked to his sides fess was helpless but in any case shaitan allowed no time for any sort of recovery with a sound like tearing leather his elastic mouth flowed over and closed upon the ferencs entire face and head shaithis stumbling blindly away struck stony debris and tripped and suddenly nerveless even shaithis nerveless he crashed down on to the lava floor to one side shaitans nightmarish ingurgitor hissed and bubbled as it drained off the last of arkiss fluids and to the other fess ferencs invincible body pulsed and vibrated in the primal vampires coils where shaitan crushed and devoured his head and shaithis thought if theres a hell then i stand at its gate shaitans eyes glowed red out of the darkness which was his crushing grinding metamorphic head and his reply in shaithiss staggered mind was this aye a hell of sorts where we are the lords for it is our hell son of my sons which one day well take with us to starside and then to all the worlds beyond part three the hunters and the hunted harry keogh necroscope and wouldbe avenger had thought at first that it would not be especially difficult to track down his quarry a young driver working for frigis express who also happened to be a necromancer sex monster and the insane serial killer of to date six young women but hed soon discovered that it wouldnt be nearly as simple as hed thought frigis had a dozen branches up and down the country with a like number of warehouses and freezer depots and over two hundred trucks of which fifty per cent were on the roads at any given hour of the day or night the firm must therefore employ quite a few drivers who would fit the vague description in harrys possession vague yes for he suspected that the bloated lusting creature hed been shown was more a figure of terrified imagination than of the real man also it seemed likely that frigis would use casual labour and it could be that harrys man was one of these but somewhere there should be a list of regular employees at least harry hoped to find that list and also that the john or johnny he was looking for would be on it on the third wednesday in may at in the morning he paid a visit to frigiss main office in london to have a look at the companys books he went there via the möbius continuum making several stops at wellknown exit points before finally emerging in a shop doorway in oxford street at that hour the normally polluted air was almost wholly free of traffic fumes and even bracing and the nightlighting loaned the street a certain alien luminosity large lethargically flapping pages from a discarded dismembered newspaper fluttered like strange slow birds on buffets of blustery air along the gutters the offices harry was looking for were directly opposite no lights showed within the building he hoped thered be no night watchman to complicate matters and there wasnt entering the building by the möbius route harry let his burgeoning vampire instincts guide him to the correct floor and then to the records office locked doors were no trouble at all to the necroscope who used numbers to conjure doors of his own out of the thin air but twice purely out of habit he went to switch on lights before realizing that he no longer had need of them and once he came face to face with a fulllength mirror which both shocked and fascinated him with its picture of a gauntfaced man with luminous redtinged eyes he had known of course that the change was taking place in him but only then realized how quickly it was happening it filled him with mixed emotions and alien longings it was the night and the mystery and the going in strange places as if in search of prey well and so he was except there is prey and there is prey the records office was dirty and untidy and smelled of strong coffee and stale cigarette smoke it had an antiquated system of filing cabinets all open for harrys inspection he quickly turned up a list of branch and depot managers but no information on rankandfile employees there was however a list of addresses and telephone numbers of all frigis expresss subsidiary offices which harry pocketed that should save him a little time at least but that was all there was which was hardly satisfactory disgruntled harry pondered over his next move presumably to start at the top of the list of branches and work down it but then out of nowhere he found himself wondering if maybe trevor jordan was up and about he could use a cup of coffee a little companionship and friendly conversation someone to be with briefly anyway if only to work the weirdness out of his system it was unlikely jordan would be awake but just on the off chance harry reached out with his telepathic mind and searched for him and immediately found him harry jordans unmistakable voice sounded in harrys mind as clearly as if hed whispered the words in his ear is that you harry found telepathy similar to and yet quite different from deadspeak he had used something like it before a sort of reverse deadspeak he supposed but that had been quite a few years ago in his incorporeal days and also very different telepathy was therefore new to him even so still it struck him as being more natural well and he supposed it was more natural for after all almost anything in the world would be but telepathy it was something like a telephone conversation even down to the hiss and crackle of psychic static whereas deadspeak was the wind whistling eerily down a bleak desert canyon under a full floating moon in short it was the difference between talking mindtomind with living people and conversing metaphysically with dead ones and yet jordan had seemed wary unsure of harrys identity and even unwilling to reveal his own just why that should be the necroscope couldnt guess he frowned and asked who else would it be trevor and hearing his voice jordan knew him at once but his mindsigh of relief warned harry that something was very wrong likewise what he said next harry you know my old place in barnet thats where i am but i cant say for how long id like to get out of here i dont want to explain right now it mightnt even be safe to but do you think you could get round here i mean like now whats the trouble harry was switched on now alert to danger and he could still sense jordans uncertainty harry i dont know i came down to london to see if i could maybe find something out for you but ive been blocked all along the line almost from the start i came here to watch them ebranch but hell i didnt think thered be anyone watching me right now right now yes im on my way said harry air made a small implosion into the empty space where he stepped through a möbius door its draught causing papers to rustle in a filing cabinet hed left standing open but before the papers had stopped rustling harry had tracked down jordans thoughts to barnet he emerged silently into the resurrected telepaths front room whose firstfloor bay windows overlooked a cobbled culdesac the end wall of a park and the dark gently mobile silhouette of trees beyond the room was in darkness and jordan was at the window looking out through a crack in the curtains on a street shining dull yellow in electric lamplight harry reached out to a wall switch and put on the light and jordan hissed fell into a crouch and whirled to face him there was a gun in his hand its ok the necroscope told him its just me jordan drew a deep breath and almost fell into a chair he waved his hand to indicate harry should also sit down its just the way you come and go he said you invited me harry reminded him jordan nodded here i am a bag of nerves looking out into the street and then the light going on like that harry said it wasnt deliberate or rather it was if i had spoken youd have turned and seen me im not sure which would have shocked you more the light going on suddenly or seeing my eyes in the dark your eyes harry grimaced nodding theyre red as hell trevor and theres nothing to stop it now whats in me is a strong one but you still have a little time harry shrugged i dont know how long long enough to do one last thing i hope and then ill be on my way he finally sat down now would you like to put your gun away and tell me whats on your mind jordan looked at the gun in his hand as if hed forgotten it was there he gave a snort and replaced it in its shoulder holster nervous as a cat he explained or rather as a mouse watched by a cat are you watched harry didnt know where to aim his thoughts to check searching for jordan had been different for hed known what he was looking for likewise paxton but looking for someone he wasnt used to some unknown someone was a trick hed yet to master are you sure jordan got up and put out the light went to the curtains again ive never been so sure he or they are out there right now not too far away scanning me or if not scanning obscuring theyre blocking me i cant read past them i keep thinking it can only be ebranch but how the hell would they know i was back alive i mean he looked back from the curtains saw harrys alien face and said i i see what you mean harry a tall dark silhouette whose eyes made his face a mask from hell nodded but there were other things to worry about than the glare of his bloodhued eyes what does it feel like to have someone watching you blocking your mind being watched is how it felt with paxton blocking is mental interference a screen of static but i wasnt even sure paxton was there until you told me he was just an itch and as for mental interference ok the other matched harrys shrug ill give you an example try aiming your thoughts right at me harry did it and met a buzzing wall of interference if he hadnt known it was jordan then he wouldnt have known what it was jordan said find something like that and you know someones scrambling you deliberately i know because ive had practice when the russian espers used to cover the chateau bronnitsy it was like this all the time we used to try and break through and they were always trying to get through to us he looked at harry again penetratingly incidentally you do it all the time harry except when youre wanting to read someone or wanting someone to read you but with you its different something thats permanent and getting stronger all the time it isnt static but something else and it comes natural to you so natural you didnt even know about it did you or maybe natural is the wrong word for it what you have is well in ebranch we used to call it mindsmog the necroscope nodded i wondered about that its a dead giveaway by now darcys espers must know what i am or if not he should fire the lot of them so it looks like the talent wellesley gave me is going to be redundant or maybe not and after a moments thought no definitely not wellesleys thing is a total blanket it doesnt just make my mind unreadable but blanks it out entirely the vampire thing is just mindsmog like you said but it makes me wonder how come paxton didnt discover what was happening to me earlier how was he able to get to me at all it was only just starting then jordan answered your vampire thing wasnt fully developed it still isnt but sufficiently so that it stopped me ive tried to reach you half a dozen times this last couple of days but was only able to make it when you wanted to contact me oh and something else you mentioned darcy clarke right well suddenly he paused and held up a cautioning hand wait and in another moment did you feel that harry shook his head a probe said jordan someone trying to get in to me the moment i relax theyre there harry stepped toward jordan and the large curved windows but held himself back a little in the shadows you said it was on your mind to get out of here what did you mean only that i dont know whats on their minds the other told him i mean i know it can only be ebranch out there but i dont know what theyre up to or what theyre planning do they know its me that seems unlikely what that im back from the dead but on the other hand and from their point of view who else can i be if im a telepath using trevor jordans flat and this watch theyre keeping on me it reminds me of that time we were covering yulian bodescu i mean who the hell do they think i am harry very slowly harry nodded t begin to understand he said and he gripped jordans elbow and youre right its exactly like that time they were covering yulian bodescu which means that its not so much a case of who they think you are but what they think you are jordan gasped you mean they think im its possible youre back from the dead arent you but i have no mindsmog neither did i until recently again jordans gasp theyre waiting to see how things develop before they move in which would explain just about everything certainly it would explain why im shitscared of them im picking up something of their suspicions their intentions im sensing the hunters hot on my track harry they think they suspect that im a vampire the necroscope tried to calm him down but youre not and its easy to prove that youre not also darcy clarkes in charge of ebranch and what were you going to tell me about darcy anyway jordan came away from the window another look at harrys face convinced him the light would be better on he tripped the switch on the wall then sat down heavily darcys at home he said and very unhappy about something he was the one i was supposed to be watching remember because hes the boss and would know which ways things are jumping but now he seems to have been taken off the job and while he isnt a telepath himself still somebody is throwing up a pretty good shield around him making it hard to get anything that felt ominous harry said maybe we should go and see him maybe we should confront him ask him straight out whats going on im pretty sure i know already that the branch is just waiting for me to put a foot wrong but if we hear it from darcy then well know it for sure jordan shrugged at least it would get me out of here i feel that if i dont get out then ill go nuts god i dont like being watched and not know what theyre thinking ok said harry and afterwards will you come back here or what the thing is i could use some help on this serial killer thing and we can use my place in bonnyrig as a base for the time being anyway that way well be able to spell each other watching out for the watchers and when this task ive set myself is done then before i leave i mean before i really leave everything well find a way to square it with ebranch and put your own record straight that all sounds good to me jordan breathed a sigh of relief just say the word harry and im your man the other nodded the word is we go and see darcy hes single isnt he like most of you espers i know he used to live in hoddesdon is he still there and will he be on his own or is there a woman darcy isnt likely to buckle under a shock or two im sure but i dont want to go scaring any women jordan shook his head no woman that i know of darcys been married to the job too long but hes not in hoddesdon any more he got himself a house in crouch end just a mile or two away a nice place with a garden in haslemere road only been there a couple of weeks he moved in right after the greek job again harrys nod i dont know the area but you can show it to me is there anything you want to take with you my suitcase is already packed then we can go right now at in the morning if you say so i dont have a car though so we either walk it or ill need to call a but jordan knew his mistake at once as soon as he saw harrys strange wan smile a taxis not necessary the necroscope told him i have my own transport darcy clarke was still up pacing the floor as hed paced it all night it wasnt his talent that was bothering him he himself wasnt in any danger he was just worried about the branch and the job he suspected was being planned right now at this very moment about that and about harry keogh but in fact the two were one and the same thing the groundfloor lights of clarkes house were bright behind a facade of shrubs and trees as harry guided jordan out through a möbius exit and back into the real world you can open your eyes now he told the telepath as jordan staggered under the briefly suspended now renewed pull of gravity it was like the feeling in the pit of your stomach when an elevator descends to the level you want and jerks to a halt there except this elevator had no walls floor or ceiling and you fell in every direction at once which was why harry had asked jordan to close his eyes a moment my god jordan whispered swaying a little as he looked all around at the night street harry thought god the möbius continuum well and you could be right august ferdinand thinks so anyway he steadied the telepath and said i know its a weird sensation isnt it jordan looked at harry and felt himself in awe of him he talked about the immundane the utterly unbelievable as if it were merely odd but finally jordan gathered his senses to say nice shot harry thats darcys place right there they let themselves in through the garden gate and walked up a path between the shrubs the glowing white globe of a lamp drew a cloud of moths where it hung like a small moon over the front door harry directed jordan to stand to one side put on his dark glasses and pushed the doorbell in a little while footsteps sounded from within the door was equipped with a peephole lens clarke used it and saw harry standing on his doorstep staring right at him his talent made no objection as he opened the door which told him a lot harry he said come in come in darcy harry said taking hold of his arm listen take it easy but theres someone with me someone with darcy started to say as jordan stepped into view he saw him and said trevor then he started violently and took a pace to the rear harry following him in said its ok its ok trevor clarke breathed his eyes bulging in his suddenly pale face trevor jordan oh my god oh sweet jesus harry wished people wouldnt keep using these names of power so casually but on this occasion he understood and made nothing of it trevor jordan pushed past harry and took clarkes other arm clarke at once strained back and away from both of them but again it was a normal reaction nothing to do with his talent jordan said darcy it really is me and im ok ok clarkes mouth open and closed and the word came out like a croak he tried again really you yes i can see that but i know youre dead i was with you in that rhodes hospital remember when you put a bullet in your brain harry said can we go inside sit down talk talk clarke looked at him at both of them as if they were mad or as if he was but then he nodded sure why not and then i might wake up in the living room clarke pointed to chairs poured drinks like a robot actually apologized for the untidiness and said he wasnt quite settled in yet and then he very carefully sat down and tossed back his large whisky in one and at once sprang to his feet again and said so for fucks sake talk convince me that i havent cracked harry calmed him down and very quickly explained everything or almost everything but without going into the fine details and when he was through so weve come to see you to find out whats going on what it is that you and ebranch are up to actually im pretty sure i already know so im counting on you to keep them off my back until i get done with what im pledged to do finally clarke closed his mouth and turned to stare hard at jordan jordan yes looking exactly as clarke had always known him but still he took the others hand and squeezed it and stared even harder just to be one hundred per cent sure but in the end there was no way round it this could only be trevor jordan the telepath suffered clarkes astonished scrutiny and made no complaint as this old friend of so many years standing checked him out checked every wellremembered line of his face and form jordans face was fresh oval and open and with his fair thinning hair falling forward over grey eyes it would normally look boyish except that now it was lined with worry and not a little astonishment of his own his feelings were reflected in the line of his mouth naturally crooked it would tighten and straighten out if something was wrong which was how it looked now straight and tight well and clarke could well understand that and clarke thought good old easygoing trevor transparent as a window readable as an open book such has always been your guise anyway as if youd like people to be able to read you as easily as you read them like you were trying to compensate for your metaphysical talent or even apologize for it trevor jordan sensitive but always determined i never met the man who didnt like you and if there was such a one why youd simply avoid him and if you really are you youll know exactly what im thinking jordan grinned and said you missed out the handsome rangylimbed athletic bit but whats this about boyish are you calling me a big kid darcy clarke sat back in his chair and touched his feverish brow with a trembling hand he didnt know which one of them to look at harry keogh or trevor jordan finally he said what can i say except welcome back trevor after more drinks it was darcys turn he told them what he knew which wasnt much and finished up so paxton must have reported how i sent you the files on those girls harry which was sufficient to get me suspended as for them coming after you you know how the branch works almost as well as i do of course theyll be coming after you sooner or later trevor said and me no darcy told him because tomorrow first thing ill go into town and put them in the picture i could phone the minister responsible right now but at this hour he wouldnt thank me for that so ill go in and speak to everyone who is anyone in ebranch and make sure they fully understand whats going on it might do the trick and get them off harrys back for a while i hope it gets them off my back said the necroscope unemotionally i really do and he took off his darklensed glasses and asked darcy to dim the lights when ebranchs suspended boss saw harrys face in the darkened room he quietly said harry i hope so too for their sake every last one of them harry supposed that darcy was genuine supposed he was one of only a very few men in the entire world whom he could trust but the necroscopes vampire weirdness was strong in him now and looking at darcy clarke he saw a man who was halffriend and halfenemy harry couldnt read the future not with any certainty and in any case he knew that prognostication was a dangerous game fraught with paradoxes but he could make a damn good guess at what was coming if he had to stay here in this world longer than hed planned if this task hed set himself took longer than just a few more days then it could well be that darcy would be obliged to join the other team darcy was an expert and as harrys metamorphosis progressed the branch would need all the expert help it could get eventually one way or another even darcy would turn against him hed have no choice sooner or later the plague carrier would have to be destroyed it was as simple as that darcy harry said as he turned the lights up again if we ever did come up against one another why youd be just about the only one who could stop me for which reason im half afraid of you you know im a telepath now well i am and i wonder would it bother you if i took a closer look into your mind darcys talent sensed no danger of course not for harry intended him no harm what he did intend was to take out a sort of insurance policy one which could be cancelled later when the danger was past no harm at all to darcy clarke the man only to his talent itself for that was what the necroscope feared to come up against clarke knowing he couldnt win that the deflectors guardian angel would protect him but with his talent taken away from him clarke would be impotent at least for what remained of harrys term here afterwards he would give it back to him look into my mind darcy repeated him with your permission harry nodded but it has to be of your own free will darcy read nothing into the necroscopes words but cant you read my mind just like trevor here this is different said harry for this you need to invite me in as if your mind was a door which you were opening for me anything you say darcy shrugged and his eyes met the others and locked on them and in another moment harry was into his mind the mechanism harry sought wasnt difficult to find and he saw at once that it was a freak a mutation it was clarkes unique talent which all of his life had protected him from external dangers but was impotent to save itself from the internal danger which was harry keogh and even if it could save itself it did nothing because harry meant no harm there was no trigger harry could jam so he simply wrapped the entire mechanism in a fragment of wellesleys blanket the job took as long as it takes to tell and then he was out again and he was satisfied that clarkes guardian angel had been gagged for the time being at least is that it darcy frowned are you satisfied ill do you no harm absolutely harry said to himself while outwardly he merely nodded because if you try youll have no protection which means ill at least be able to protect myself and then he heard another voice in his head jordans saying which means hes no longer protected from anything wont you at least tell him what youve done no harry answered you know darcy hed become paranoid about his safety in a moment that was always his paradox that despite this weird talent of his still he looked after himself like he was accidentprone or something i hope hell be all right thats all said the other well darcy prompted harry im satisfied you wont go against me the necroscope told him and now we have to be on our way jordan said it strikes me as likely that the branch will know weve been here if you want to stay on their good side darcy you might like to call the duty officer and confirm it let them see that youre not in collusion with us and at the same time you might use your good offices to clear me darcy pulled a wry face actually my offices arent looking any too hot right now he said but certainly ill give it a try he looked at harry so where are you two off to now or shouldnt i ask you shouldnt ask harry answered but ill tell you anyway were tracking your serial killer i sort of got hooked up on it thats the job i want finished before i move on darcy nodded that way youll leave a clean sheet behind you harry which is the way it should be youll always be the right sort of legend famous instead of infamous harry said nothing fame even infamy didnt concern him all that mattered was his obsession what was more he knew why it had become an obsession he was being chased off his territory forced to vacate his very own world which he had fought for not physically driven out not yet anyway but soon and the vampire especially one of the wamphyri is tenacious and territorial frustrated almost beyond endurance harry was fighting back but if he must take it out on someone then at least let that someone be a fiend in his own right namely the serial killer the necromancer the torturer of penny and those other poor innocents even pamela trotter innocent yes compared to him anyway it was time harry and trevor jordan were on their way they said the usual farewells very simply and harry told jordan to close his eyes again darcy clarke watched them go and when they were no longer there held out his trembling hand into the space where theyd passed through a möbius door into nothing and that was all he found there nothing finding johnny in edinburgh it would soon be dawn but harry keogh knew that things all sorts of things were rapidly coming to a head and he wasnt nearly ready to ease off now now that hed started this job his one thought was to get it finished in darkness or if needs be in light earlysummer sunlight would be a problem from now on in but it was more an inconvenience than a threat proper the sun wouldnt kill him not yet anyway but taken in large doses it would sicken and weaken him his glasses helped keep its glare out of his eyes his floppy hat protected his head and face but was a dead giveaway he must keep his hands in his pockets for long periods which gave him the slovenly look of a delinquent youth or a labour politician but was absolutely necessary only the british weather almost invariably mean was on his side trevor jordan on the other hand suffered no such restrictions and could come and go as he pleased and with harrys help go as far as he pleased and instantly in the necroscopes bonnyrig house they drank coffee harry would prefer good red wine but needed a resupply and split the list of frigis express depots down the middle they would work through them alphabetically until they found what they were looking for jordan would take the day shift with harry supplying the transport harry would do nights with jordan for lookout the telepath had asked what was the big deal with this job and harry had showed him a series of vivid mindpictures taken from penny sanderson and pamela trotter and now jordan was as eager as he was there was a monster loose in the world and he had to die therell be night watchmen on these places im sure jordan said studying his half of the list but at this hour of the morning theyll be kipping off asleep in some secret corner we could do a few depots right now before the drivers or packers or whatever get in the bloke were after is a driver harry said he uses the ml and possibly the al or a maybe we should start with depots close to those major routes jordan had been glancing through the files on the murdered girls pennys report seemed to interest him greatly ignoring what the necroscope had just said he asked harry did you know pennys body was found in the gardens under the castles walls harry frowned yes is that significant it could be the other answered there are quite a few small specialized units housed in the castle for all we know our man from frigis delivered meat to the various messes and cookhouses that night and when the coast was clear he bundled penny over the wall harry nodded ill check out the exact spot where she was found i remember looking over the wall there are places where it rears over grassy ledges and steep banks where the drop is only a few feet and if she fell or was tossed her body might slip and slither a bit without breaking anything or suffering any real damage because apart from the damage and suffering he had caused her she wasnt in bad shape his gaunt face had turned angry as he remembered penny as she had been the first time he saw her shaking his head to dismiss the memory he growled anyway ill look at it if it seems at all likely or even possible well it could be youve narrowed down the field a little thanks trevor and then ruefully as you can see id never have made the grade as a detective or even a common or garden policeman listen jordan told him you drop me off in edinburgh right now and let me follow it up lets face it youve been seen up in the castle people may remember you but they dont know me ill take this file with me i still have an old ebranch identity card i picked up fromthe flat its as good as a policemans uniform for getting me into places to gather information then while i concentrate on this end of the job you can get on with checking out the list of depots harry saw the sense of it all right he said and well meet back here tonight meanwhile we can easily contact each other if anything breaks but you have to understand that the sun hampers me it might stop me getting through to you or you to me on the other hand if the day is dull everything will be ok the only thing is he paused uncertainly yes jordan waited youll be on your own the necroscope continued if the branch decides to move on me theyll be picking my friends up too but picking them up jordan repeated him not picking them off and anyway darcy said hed take care of that harry nodded but he cant take care of the fact that im a vampire and you know the branch wont be taking any chances trevor in fact id lay you odds that my warrant has already been issued and that right now theyre busy closing off any boltholes for now theyll probably lay off this place because its mine and i know it better than they do but sooner or later even this house of mine wont be safe hell it would be the perfect place to settle with me out of the way alone and lonely morbids not the way to go harry the other told him lets for now just try to find this johnny right plenty of time then to sort the rest of it and the necroscope knew he was right all except the plenty of time part the following morning the minister responsible called darcy clarke in to ebranch hq when clarke walked into what had once been his office the minister was seated at his old desk and geoffrey paxton was standing in one corner of the room arms folded across his chest and with his back to the reinforced glass windows clarke could do without paxton picking at his mind but he was no longer in a position to complain about it after apparently casual nods of greeting or acknowledgement the minister remarked how ragged clarke looked to which he replied i was up late in fact id just managed to snatch an hour or two when your office called to arrange this meeting well that was good for i was coming in anyway you see last night i had a couple of visitors except im afraid youre not much likely to believe me when i tell you who one of them was paxton spoke up at once we know who they were clarke he said sourly harry keogh and trevor jordan vampires clarke had been ready for that he sighed and turned to the minister do we have to have this meathead in on this i mean if he must forever be wriggling about like a fucking great maggot in peoples heads cant it be from a distance say right outside the door here unruffled the minister stared right back at him are you saying that paxton is wrong clarke clarke sighed again i saw harry and trevor last night yes hes right that far so youre saying that harry keogh and jordan arent vampires the ministers voice was very quiet clarke looked at him looked away chewed his bottom lip and the minister prompted him they are vampires clarke faced him again and said jordan isnt but keogh is clarke snapped but you were already pretty sure of that right all thanks to he glanced fire at paxton to this slimy shit yes harrys been contaminated he picked up this bloody thing protecting us every single one of us doing a job out in the greek islands which i had asked him to help us with so that in my book at least hes not about to turn killer now what more can i tell you we think quite a lot paxton answered but softly now his pasty face reddening from the sting of clarkes insult clarke looked at him looked at the minister and felt no rapport he wasnt getting through to them at all why dont you let me tell it my way he pleaded and why dont you try listening to me who knows you may even learn something but paxton said yes and we might get thrown right off the track too clarke glared at him looked at the minister across his desk and said look your pet parrot here isnt making much sense shit i dont understand a word do you know what hes raving about the minister came to a decision gave an abrupt nod and said clarke im going to give it to you straight ebranch was monitoring your place last night yours and jordans both you see we knew even before you did that jordan was back from the dead which is to say undead what a man dead and gone yet up and about among the living undead thats how we see it the only way we can see it and not only jordan but one of those murdered girls too vampires for theres nothing else they can be clarke cut in desperately but if youll only listen to me but the minister wasnt listening we know what time keogh got to jordans flat the time they left it together and where they went and the fact that however much we dont know and even if you hadnt admitted as much still wed be absolutely sure that harry keogh is a vampire how can we be so sure because he carries all the stigmata you could say he even smells of vampire which is to say he covers himself in mindsmog do you follow me so far of course i do clarke answered feeling his desperation increasing by leaps and bounds knowing that the minister was building a case but what sort of case against whom he had to take one last stab at getting through to him but cant you see that even in this youre wrong with all due respect you dont know anything about vampires youve had no experience of them youre not even talented you only know what youve read or heard from others and hearsay cant make up for experience see this mindsmog youre talking about is something harry cant control he doesnt cover himself with it it just is its a result of what he is like a dog has a tail harry has mindsmog it isnt deliberate in fact if he could get rid of it he would for its a dead giveaway the minister looked questioningly at paxton who nodded however grudgingly or perhaps it wasnt so much a grudging nod as a grim one a nod of affirmation and even as his apprehension went up another notch so clarke said so you see how easy it is to make mistakes unblinking unwavering the minister said all vampires have this mindsmog right clarke did blink however as his nerves started to jump there was nothing to fear here for his talent would warn him of it but still his nerves were jumping as far as we know yes he answered all of them that weve dealt with anyway when a telepath tries to scan a vampire he gets mindsmog darcy clarke the ministers face was white now it must have taken a lot of nerve to come here either that or youre a madman or you really dont know whats happened to you happened to me clarke could feel the tension building and didnt know what it was about what the hell are you talking you have mindsmog paxton spat the words out clarkes jaw dropped what i have the minister raised his voice you out there miss cleary and ben you can come in now the door opened and millicent cleary stepped inside with ben trask right behind her the girl looked at clarke and her voice was breathless as she said its true sir you you have it she had always called clarke sir he looked at her backed away a step and shook his head but ben trask said darcy shes telling the truth even paxton is telling the truth clarke took two hesitant steps towards him and trask narrowed his eyes backed off and held up his arms to ward him off clarke saw the look in his old friends eyes and couldnt believe it ben its me he said i mean with your talent you have to know that im telling the truth too darcy trask answered still backing away youve been got at its the only answer got at without your knowing it you believe youre telling the truth and on your own that would be enough to throw me but its two to one darcy and you have been pretty close to harry keogh clarke spun on his heel looked at the faces surrounding him the minister white as chalk behind his desk paxton grimfaced his right hand nervously playing with the lapel of his jacket trask whose talent had never once let him down until now and millicent cleary still respectful for all that shed just accused him of being a monster crazy every damned one of you clarke shakily husked he thrust his left hand into his pocket brought out his branch id and tossed it on to the desk thats it im through with all of this finished with the branch for good im walking he reached with his right hand inside his jacket and dragged his issue mm pistol into view and paxton yelled freeze and aimed the gun which he had produced a moment earlier astonished clarke turned towards him turned his empty gun towards him too and paxton squeezed off two shots simultaneous with the deafening reports millicent cleary and ben trask yelled no too late for clarke had been hurled halfway across the room by the first bullet then swatted from his feet and tossed against the wall by the second his gun went flying as he crumpled to his knees against the bloodied wall and his hand crept tremblingly to an area over his heart there were two holes in his jacket both turning red and dripping through his twitching fingers shit he whispered and what he fell forward on to his face rolled over on to his side and trask and the cleary girl went to their knees beside him the minister was on his feet aghast holding on to the edge of the desk to keep from falling and paxton had come forward his gun still at the ready face pale as a sheet of paper with holes punched out for eyes and mouth he had a gun he gasped the words out he was going to use his gun the minister said i i thought he was trying to hand it in thats what it looked like to me ben trask cradled clarkes head moaning jesus darcy jesus the girl had unbuttoned clarkes jacket torn open his crimson shirt but the blood had almost stopped pumping clarke looked down disbelievingly at his chest and the red life leaking out of him not not possible he said and the fact was that yesterday it wouldnt have been darcy darcy trask said again not possible clarke murmured for the last time before his eyes filmed over and his head lolled into trasks lap and as yet no one had even called for a doctor or an ambulance for long seconds the tableau held until paxton broke the silence with get away from him are you crazy get away from him trask and the girl looked at him his blood paxton told them you have his blood all over you hell contaminate you trask stood up and the horror slowly cleared from his eyes the horror of what had happened anyway but his horror of paxton was something else darcy will contaminate he started to repeat paxton and took a long loping pace towards him his blood will contaminate us what the hells wrong with you paxton backed off darcy was right trask snarled about you he pointed at the minister responsible and you and he took another pace after paxton back off paxton warned him waving his gun trask caught his wrist and twisted it and his strength was furious the gun went clattering to the floor he never spoke a truer word trask said holding paxton at arms length like a piece of stinking rotten meat you dont know anything about vampires except what youve read or been told you have no experience of them if you did youd know that bullets dont stop them not for long anyway but poor darcy there if you have any talent at all youll know that hes stone dead and you killed him i i paxton struggled but he couldnt free himself from trasks grip contaminate trask grated through clenched teeth he drew paxton close and rubbed clarkes blood into his hair his eyes and nostrils you piece of shit what could contaminate you he drew back a ham of a hand and bunched it into a fist and trask the minister snapped ben let paxton go let it be whats done is done an accident maybe a mistake possibly but its done and its only one of several things were not going to like doing trasks fist hung in midair shaking with its need to crash into paxtons face but as the ministers words sank in so he tossed the telepath away from him and lurchingly almost drunkenly he went back to clarkes crumpled lifeless body the minister said to paxton get a doctor and an ambulance then he saw the look on paxtons face the telepath had recovered both his wits and his nerve he was cleaning his face with a large pocket handkerchief and shaking his head his look said think what youre saying what youre doing and out loud he said we dont need a doctor or an ambulance just an incinerator clarkes for burning by us right now right or wrong we cant take any chances with him hes for the fire just as soon as possible and me im for bathing trask cleary i know how you must feel but if i were you no you dont know how we feel ben trask looked up at him all emotion gone now from his face anyway paxton continued id bathe if i were you and right now the minister indicated the door go on then he told paxton go and arrange disposal do it now and take a shower too if you feel its necessary then report back to me and after the telepath had left the room past the gaping espers where they crowded the corridor ben said the minister the killing has started right or wrong like paxton said its started and we both know it has to go on so from now on i want you in charge of this thing i want you to run the entire show until its sorted out one way or the other trask stood up leaned against the wall looked at the minister and thought one way or the other no it can only be one way for the other is unthinkable well someone has to do it and im as experienced as any of them more than most and at least if im running it ill know that that idiot paxton wont be doing any more damage in the old days it would have been darcy ken layard trevor jordan and a handful of others and harry of course but this time theyd be hunting harry himself and that was different and despite what clarke had said it looked as if theyd be hunting jordan too and the girl penny sanderson jesus according to the file she was just a kid but an undead kid all right said the minister and trask sighed and answered with an almost imperceptible nod yes it was all right and paxton could well have been right too if there had been something anything at all wrong with darcy trask looked at the girl her bloodied hands and blouse shower he said simply and make a good job of it then when he and the minister were alone he said when darcys been burned we have to scatter the ashes scatter them far and wide he gave a small shudder for the fact is harry keogh does things with ashes and i really dont think i ever want to see darcy again not on his feet anyway am harry keogh had just finished examining the personnel files at frigis expresss darlington depot when three things happened simultaneously one the depot clerk whom harry had lured from his tiny box of an office with a bogus telephone call returned unexpectedly two harry felt a pang almost a pain of a sort hed never experienced before within his chest as if someone had doused his heart with ice water and three the fading echo of an unrecognized cry bounced off his mind to ricochet into an unreachable metaphysical limbo of its own and it seemed to the necroscope that whatever its source it was intended specifically for him as if his name had been called from the gulf between life and death deadspeak but this had been different telepathy well maybe or a cross between the two that seemed more likely and harry remembered how his mother had described the feelings in her incorporeal heart when a pup called paddy had been killed by a car on a bonnyrig road so had someone died but who and why had he cried out to harry who the fuck are you demanded the burly shortsleeved redheaded clerk as he herded harry into the shadows of a dusty corner where the metal filing cabinet met the wall he gaped at the former contents of the cabinet now spilling across the floor harry barely glanced at the mans suspicious mottled face and said shh shh the other repeated him disbelievingly youll get shh breaking in here now whats the score harry was trying desperately to hang on to the diminishing ethereal echo of a cry for help was that what it had been look he told the very untypical clerk be quiet a minute will you he tried to push by him why you blotches of angry red appeared on the mans jowly cheeks a conman and thief right i recognize your voice it was you on the phone right well you picked the wrong man this time thief he grabbed harry by the lapels and looked as if he was going to butt him in the face the necroscope continued to concentrate on the cry and at the same time reached out and caught his assailant by the throat with one huge hand he held him at bay choking and with the other he reached up and took off his dark spectacles the clerk saw his eyes and choked all the more and commenced windmilling his arms as harry shoved him effortlessly backwards driving him across the floor finally the clerks legs hit the edge of his desk and he sat down in a plastic paper tray shattering it with his fat backside still harry held him and still he listened for a repeat performance of the cry but it was gone now probably disappeared for ever harry felt anger expanding inside him felt frustrated cheated and his hand on the clerks windpipe was like iron his nails bit into the mans flesh as if it were putty and harry knew that if he wanted to he could crush his adams apple and tear his throat out all in one whats more the thing inside was urging him to do it do it but he didnt instead he swept the clerk from the desk top and set him crashing down among the debris of his shattering chair and a wooden wastepaper basket mmy ggod the clerk coughed and spat and massaged his throat and crawled dazedly into a corner where he turned and looked back fearfully at the spot where the bloodeyed fanged furious stranger had been standing but of course the necroscope was no longer there no one was there and again the clerk gurgled my god my ggood ggod working from his list alphabetically harry had already investigated three frigis depots and installations the vehicle depot at alnwick the slaughterhouse and meat dressing station in bishop auckland and lastly the freezer complex in darlington so far he had copied the addresses of four possibles all of them johns or johnnies and all drivers for the firm now however with the morning only halfway through the weird mindcry out of nowhere had disturbed him damaged his resolve and destroyed his concentration to such an extent that he took the möbius route home to bonnyrig and from there contacted trevor jordan at the castle on the mount in edinburgh harry jordan came back at once his telepathic voice full of his relief that the necroscope was in touch again i tried to reach you but your mindsmog was too dense and getting thicker all the time can you come and get me i think i may have a lead harry nodded just as if he was speaking to someone directly in front of him and not ten miles away and said do you know the lairds larder its a coffee shop up there just off the royal mile ask anyone and theyll direct you ill be there in five minutes but trevor tell me has anything peculiar happened have you felt anything strange do i need to be well more than usually careful how i move watchers you mean the branch a mental shake of the others head not that ive detected maybe a tentative touch now and then but nothing you could nail down nothing concentrated anyway if they have people up here then theyre too good for me and im pretty damn good no static paxton maybe i dont feel any static distantly maybe but nothing local as for paxton im sure id be able to pick him up twenty miles away and you just an experience harry answered in darlington darlington the necroscope could almost see the others eyebrows going up now theres a coincidence and did you find any johnnies in darlington harry was intrigued two he replied and one of them a reallife johnny thats how he spells his name anyway johnny courtney the other is called john found and now he pictured jordans grim nod as the telepath said yes and dragosani was a foundling too wasnt he harry said is that supposed to mean something he knew it was better believe it jordan confirmed see you outside the lairds larder harry told him five minutes he waited out the five minutes in a fever of anticipation then made it six to be sure jordan had got there and finally möbiustripped to the steep cobbled road just off the royal mile he emerged from the continuum on a crowded bustling pavement where tourists and locals alike were clustered like bees in a hive jostling and filled with purpose as they went about their various businesses no one noticed that harry was suddenly there people loomed everywhere from every direction sidestepping each other the necroscope was just another face in the crowd jordan was in the doorway of the lairds larder he spotted harry grabbed his elbow and guided him off the street into the shade harry was glad of that for the sun was out and it had grown to be more than a mere irrritation he now actively hated it buy three sandwiches he told the telepath steak for me and rare as theyve got it whatever you like for yourself and anything with plenty of bread around it for the third ok mystified jordan nodded and went to the busy counter he ordered was served and came back to harry where he waited harry took his arm said close your eyes and ushered him through a möbius door to anyone watching it would look as if they just stepped out of the coffee shop into the street except they didnt arrive in the street instead a moment later they emerged two miles away by the lake on the crest of the vast volcanic outcrop called arthurs seat there was an empty bench where they sat down and ate a while in silence and harry tore up the third sandwich into small pieces which he fed to the ducks and a lone swan that came paddling to the feast and eventually the necroscope said tell me about it but jordan answered you first whats all this about an experience in darlington you sounded like something had worried you harry something other than finding a couple of suspect johnnies that is i mean tracking this maniac down is important no one would deny that but theres such a thing as personal safety too so youd better tell me are there going to be problems oh yes harry answered and soon something inside tells me that not even darcy clarke can do anything about that but thats not what this was about and as best he could he explained what he had felt and told jordan how his mother had reacted to the death of a small dog you think someone died this morning any idea who harry shook his head someone cried out to me thats all i think so anyway and your deadspeak cant you make inquiries harry gave a wry snort the great majority dont want to know me he answered not now not any longer i cant say i blame them he shrugged then brightened a little on the other hand if someone did die and still wants to contact me then pretty soon hell be able to do just that oh through deadspeak harry explained except hell have to contact me in person for i wouldnt know where to start looking and it will have to be by night during the daylight hours the sun interferes too much if not for this hat of mine id be in trouble even with the hat i feel tired sick unable to think straight there were a few clouds earlier but theyre clearing and the brighter it gets the duller i get he stood up and threw the last handful of crumbs on to the surface of the lake between the crags lets get out of here i could use some shade they took the möbius route to the gloomy old house on the outskirts of bonnyrig then telepathically probed the countryside all around nothing jordan declared and harry agreed and finally all right the necroscope threw off his hat and sprawled gratefully in an easy chair now its your turn just what did you discover up there at the castle i can tell that somethings excited you youre right jordan grinned it was my chance to pay you back harry for what youve done for me for my life my resurrection my god im alive and i know how wonderful it is so i wanted things to work out you could say i almost willed it to happen and it did you think youve found our man or monster harry leaned forward eagerly in his chair im pretty sure i have the telepath answered yes im pretty damn sure johnny found i showed my ebranch id at the guardroom jordan commenced his story and told them i was investigating the death of the girl who was found under the walls i said wed had our wires crossed the first time because she wasnt who wed thought she was which was why we were looking into it again from square one the squaddies on duty had read all about it in the newspapers and anyway i wasnt the first investigator theyd seen not even the first today they told me that in fact there were already two plainclothes men in the castle down in the sergeants mess that piece of information stopped me dead for a second or two while i considered it but then i thought what the hell for after all i was ebranch wasnt i well i had been until very recently anyway i never had any problem dealing with the law in fact the police had always shown me and ebranch in general a lot of respect and vice versa so i asked directions to the warrant officers and sergeants mess and made my way there edinburgh castle is a massive place the greater part of which is never even glimpsed by the tourists and general public your average tourist knows that the castle esplanade is where they hold the edinburgh tattoo with room to build a stadium of eight thousand seats royal boxes and all and a hardstanding that takes the militarys massed bands motorcycle and other vehicular displays shows from all around the world you name it but the vast stone complex beyond mons meg the one oclock gun and ye olde tea shoppe or whatever it is theyve named that cafe in the crag remains a mystery to most people and where the way is roped off thats where the real castle begins but youve been there harry and know what its like a maze of alleys and gantlets and courtyards a fantastic place and one thats easy to lose your way in eventually i found the sergeants mess and the two jock plainclothes officers who were talking to a sergeant cook and his civilian assistants and jotting down a few notes i showed my id and asked if i could sit in on their questioning and they didnt bat an eyelid between them they knew how the branch in the shape of darcy clarke and yourself harry had been helping out with the job anyway id arrived right on cue because they were asking about the night of the murder especially about the deliveries of refrigerated meat which had been made to the cookhouse that night apparently forensic had alerted them to beast blood on pennys clothes do you see well you can imagine how it felt harry to be right there when the cook sergeant got out his register of deliveries to check details of the beast carcases that had come in yes from frigis express naturally i said nothing just kept my ears wide open and my mouth tight shut and took in as much as i could get which was quite a bit because this overweight redfaced hotandbothered sergeants mess cook was efficient to a fault he not only kept a record of dates and times of all deliveries of foodstuffs and copies of his own countersigned receipts which bore the signatures of his suppliers but he even had the registration numbers of delivery vehicles too and naturally i made a mental note of the number of the truck which had made the deliveries that night this is how the delivery system works during the day the esplanade gets crowded and anyway edinburghs streets are no place for big articulated trucks during daylight hours so frigis express delivers at night of course big vehicles cant make it under the arch of the guardroom and up the narrow gantlet so they park down on the esplanade and the cookhouse sends down a driver in a military landrover to collect the carcasses the frigis driver passes the meat straight out from the back of his truck into the back of the landrover which then conveys it up to the main cookhouse and the frigis driver goes up as a passenger in the landrover to get his docket signed and sometimes hell have a beer with the cook sergeant in his little office before walking back down to his truck on the dark esplanade by night of course the esplanade is empty and he has plenty of room to turn the big vehicle round and get out of there so the plainclothes officers wanted to know if this had been the routine on the night of the murder and it had in fact the cook sergeant knew this delivery man quite well he worked for frigis out of darlington yes darlington harry and made deliveries to the castle every three or four weeks and when the sergeant was around theyd usually have a pint together in his office as for his name well his signature was a scrawl quite unreadable possibly even disguised all except for the f which started his surname but the fat sergeant was willing to swear that he referred to himself as thats right johnny well that was about it when the officers were satisfied with what theyd got i came out with them along the way i made mention of how they seemed to be doing ok without ebranch on this one it was pretty obvious they werent exactly sure what the branch is all about hell who is except branch members but that they guessed we were some sort of higher echelon intelligence organization which fools about however successfully with psychic stuff tablerapping and divining and such and i suppose in a way they were right at that then we spent a little time looking over the wall in various places and down on the gardens towards princes street and sure enough there are places you could dump a body without breaking its bones the jocks seemed especially interested in looking down on one spot and i guessed thats where penny had been found a peep inside their minds told me i was right finally as i parted company with them on the esplanade i said well be in touch and if this johnny bloke doesnt work out the way you but one of them broke in on me oh were pretty sure hes the one and we can wait a few days longer actually wed like to catch this bastard in the act of picking up some girl before we move on him hes been doing these jobs of his thick and fast so we think hell maybe try it on again the next time out another day or two at most and youd better believe well be right behind him then he shrugged and let it go at that so i told them good luck and that was it i felt great great to be alive and even better that id made a dent in the case and so had a beer on the royal mile following which i just waited around for you to contact me end of story the necroscope seemed a little disappointed you didnt get a general description of this man or discover when hes driving for frigis again these things werent in their thoughts jordan answered shaking his head and anyway if id had to concentrate on scanning their minds i might have slipped up done something stupid given myself away remember you and i are both telepaths when we read each other and it comes over strong and true thats because were doing it deliberately but reading the mind of an ordinary person is different theyre cluttered things minds and rarely concentrate on anything for more than a moment or two harry nodded i didnt mean to put you down what youve done is wonderful its worked out perfectly so far but now i want to find out something about this mans background like why hes the way he is such knowledge might be of use thats all if not to me to ebranch after ive gone also im curious about his name you said something about dragosani also being a foundling well maybe theres more to that than you thought or intended so i have one or two things to learn about this johnny found and of course i want to get to him before the police hed be charged with murder i know but what hes done and would still do is worth a lot more than that he came on very cruel and thats how he should go out the necroscopes voice as he finished speaking was a deep growl sinking deeper all the time jordan was happy to keep out of his mind but he couldnt help thinking to himself mr johnny found who or whatever or why ever you are i wouldnt be in your shoes for all the gold in fort knox ben trask had called his briefing for pm and all available ebranch operatives were present the minister responsible was there too accompanied by geoffrey paxton whom trask really hadnt expected to see but he made no fuss about it it had dawned on him that the job was too important to let personalities interfere it just struck him as incongruous that while a lowlife specimen such as paxton was safe and legitimate the good stuff such as harry keogh had crashed foul of fate and was about to become a victim of his own methods sure for it had been harry who showed the branch how to do this sort of thing how to set it up what weapons to use the stake the sword the fire and how to strike in order to kill vampires when everyone was present trask wasted no time but got right down to it by now all of you know what harry keogh has become he began which is to say hes the most dangerous creature who ever lived partly because he carries this plague of vampirism which could consume all of us and for which theres no cure well there have been others before harry and they all succumbed usually to the necroscope himself and thats the rest of what makes him so dangerous he knows all about it about us about just about everything now dont get me wrong he isnt a superman and never has been but he is the next best thing which was great when he was on our side but isnt quite so hot right now oh yes and unlike the other vampires the branch has dealt with harry will know were after him he let that sink in then continued some other things that make him dangerous hes become a telepath so from now on all you thoughtthieves keep a close watch on your minds if not harry will be in there and if he knows what were doing as were doing it then he wont be waiting around for it to happen right hes a teleport too and uses something called the möbius continuum to come and go as he pleases he can be literally anywhere he wants to be instantaneously think about that last but not least that we know of anyway harry is now a necromancer no less than dragosani was no more than dragosani was because dragosani only examined his victims harry on the other hand can bring them back from the dead even from their ashes as vampires we think and as such obviously theyd be working for him so what im saying is that everything hes previously achieved has now been totally reversed he is our target harry and anyone who works with him a lot of you will be wondering about darcy clarke so let me put you in the picture darcy died by accident trask at once held up a restraining hand because hed seen faces beginning to tighten and mouths opening questioningly it was an accident of sorts he repeated and in its way understandable if not entirely acceptable now ive had to do a lot of soulsearching myself in order to come to terms with this and so i can readily understand your confusion but darcy had been changed he must have been else we couldnt have killed him thats right i said we the branch if hed lived he would have been our weakest link and sooner or later wed be obliged to deal with him anyway but he isnt alive and cant be brought back or interfered with not where he is now for weve had him cremated already yes and even now his ashes are being scattered if he was one of harrys people which it has to be said seems likely then he isnt any more ok ive said it was an accident but the real accident or more properly the tragedy was that darcy clarke and harry keogh were friends and that theyd had a lot of contact with one another its as simple as that harrys own accident happened to him out in the greek islands or more likely in romania just a few weeks ago since when its taken him over completely and conceivably unknown to darcy and just conceivably unknown or unrealized even by the necroscope himself the thing disease contagion whatever and however you think of it somehow passed between them thats the way we see it anyway but the fact is that darcy had a very bad case of mindsmog and hed lost his guardian angel the talent which had kept him secure through everything the branch has thrown at him all these years as for darcy working with him or for harry well we knew that hed been passing information even before we knew for sure that hed been changed just when these changes occurred isnt easy to tell they might have been in the wind for some time but they came to light just last night for that was when harry visited darcy at home he didnt stay long but after he left then darcy had mindsmog so thats what i meant when i said darcy had been changed when he died he just wasnt darcy clarke any more not the one we all knew and now he isnt anyone but more importantly he isnt and can never be a threat to the branch or to the world harry keogh very definitely is however and so are the people we believe hes already contaminated there are at least two of these a young girl called penny sanderson and the telepath we knew as trevor jordan again he held up his hand yes i know trevor was my friend too and hell he was also dead but he isnt any more harry keogh has resurrected both of these people from their ashes which in itself must surely confirm what theyve become undead so where does all of this leave us plainly it leaves us with a fight on our hands and one which will take all the skills and efforts of every last one of us because if we dont win this one then there wont be a last one of us now heres how we go about it as of tonight the sanderson girl goes under covert surveillance were going to leave that to special branch no espers to be involved at this stage why because harry keogh or jordan would pick up on our people like they were radioactive so its the dear old british bobby who covers for us but without really knowing what its all about just another stakeout as far as theyre concerned which should be safe enough for as far as we know the girls had no contact with jordan or the necroscope since harry well since he did whatever he did to bring her back so we just let the common or garden law keep an eye on her until its time then call them off and finally move in by which time well know how were going to deal with her incidentally if i seem coldblooded about this its because thats how it has to be im the only one whos left of the old crowd which means im the only one who knows what hell is like i saw it during the bodescu case and out in the greek islands anyone who thinks im exaggerating hasnt read the keogh files or darcy clarkes report on the greek thing and if any one of you really hasnt read those items then he bloody well better had and now ok so as of tonight well have the girl covered and shell stay that way until were all set but shes small fry and the big fish the sharks are still cruising theyre the ones we have to worry about but how much do we have to worry about them lets talk about jordan this morning he was at edinburgh in the castle on the mount taking an interest in the serial killer case darcy clarke had asked for the necroscopes help on this one and it looks like harry got hooked on it now he and jordan seem to be working together on it dont ask me why except that penny sanderson was one of the killers victims revenge it could well be for vampires are like that if so then sooner or later harry and co may be having a go at this sex freak as to how we know jordan was in the castle he just casually latched on to a couple of plainclothes men during their investigations up there he was able to do it because he still has his branch id later when one of the investigators mentioned jordan to a superior the fact that ebranch still had a man on this thing his boss got straight on the phone to us saying thanks but no thanks they dont need our help any more they think theyve already got their man well at least we managed to obtain the suspects name and address which might come in very handy apparently hes called john or johnny found and has a flat in darlington so therell be some common or garden law watching mr found too and ill be detailing someone to watch them with a warning to stay well out of the picture for the moment unless or until keogh and jordan decide to move on him what else about jordan well as you know trevor was i mean is a pretty good telepath it could be that thats where harry got his new talent for harrys also a necromancer remember and as such he might be able to accumulate talents as he goes much as dragosani did thats speculation however and still to be proven another thing about jordan is this he was always one hell of a nice bloke oh i know theres no such thing as a nice vampire you dont have to tell me that but what im saying is i dont think evil will come naturally to him it will probably be a gradual process i hope so anyway because of course his vampirism will quickly enhance his already powerful telepathy following which well put it this way there wont be any sneaking up on him all right im almost through youll all be detailed to your new tasks within the hour as soon as i can get them worked out anything else youre busy with drop it until youre told otherwise so to sum up on how were going to work this thing we know that harry keoghs favourite haunt the place he rightly considers his territory because its been his home for most of his life is an old house near bonnyrig not far out of edinburgh we think he must be working out of there with jordan assisting him in whatever hes doing probably tracking down johnny found or if theyve already located him gearing themselves up to bring him to some kind of justice so as well as watching the sanderson girl and mr found were also obviously going to keep a covert eye on harrys old house but and i cant stress this too strongly a very surreptitious eye right if we can get the girl harry and jordan all at the same time especially if we can get them on their own as individuals thats when well move on them which might possibly be precipitated if or when harry and jordan decide to take out found ideally well wait until we can move on all three of them simultaneously that way they dont get any warning what we mustnt do is try to pick them off one by one which would be to alert the others are we straight on that lastly or rather before we go on to examine the tools of our trade i have something to tell you that i know wont go down at all well namely that the minister here has confided in soviet ebranch on this thing trask stared into the small sea of astonished faces but no one spoke the point is he went on that even if we find a way to trap the necroscope which wont be easy still hell have a bolthole into a place he could conceivably come back from bringing godonlyknows what back with him yes im talking about the gate at the perchorsk projekt under the urals weve kept tabs on that nightmare ever since we found out about it and we know that the russians are managing to contain it while they decide on a more satisfactory solution if we make life intolerable hopefully impossible for harry here he might just try heading for starside so thats why weve confided in the russians because we darent let him go back there fine if he wanted to stay there but monstrous if he ever decided to bring anything back here with him what makes us think he might hide out in another world a notebook we found an hour ago at clarkes flat thats what darcy had been jotting down a few thoughts but that must have been before harry got to him it may even be why he got to him the notes are only a mess of scribble but they make it plain that darcy thought harry would skip to starside well now the soviets know about harry as much as we could tell them anyway and theyll be looking out for him so it looks like the perchorsk gate is closed to him ok so now lets consider our equipment and how to use it then well get round to breaking you all down into balanced teams and doing a preliminary itemization of your tasks trask removed a blanket from various pieces of equipment laid out on a stout folding table its important you learn how to use this stuff he said the machetes speak for themselves but be careful with them theyre razorsharp as for this i suppose you all recognize a crossbow when you see one this third item however might not be quite so familiar its a lightweight flamethrower a new model so i think maybe well take a look at that first this is the fuel tank which sits on your back like so and so it went on the briefing lasted another hour right after sunset harry made his way to darlington via the möbius continuum he left trevor jordan sleeping not surprisingly exhausted his return from beyond was still like the very strangest dream to him from which he still feared he might suddenly awaken in a secret room under the eaves of the house on the river from the attic room there was a way into the deserted crumbling old place next door so that if anything should happen jordan might use this route to effect something of an escape but both espers had checked out the psychic atmosphere of the locality and there didnt seem to be anything happening and in any case jordan had been busy rationalizing his fears in that respect and really couldnt see ebranch doing a yulian bodescu on him and in any event he was satisfied that they wouldnt do anything rash johnny pounds address in darlington was the groundfloor flat in an old fourstoreyed victorian terrace house on the outer edge of the town centre the old red bricks had turned black from being too close to the mainline railway the windows were bleary three steps led up from a path in the tiny overgrown front garden to a communal porch and behind the fagade of that porch behind the flyspecked dingy windows there in those very rooms that was where found lived in the twilight harrys skin tingled at the thought and he felt his eager vampire senses intensifying as he walked the street first one way then the other past this gloomy streetcorner residence of a twentiethcentury necromancer the murderer of sweet young penny sanderson simple confrontation would be the easy way of course but that wasnt part of the necroscopes plan no for then the result could only be precipitate the accused would either come quietly in the parlance of the law or he would react violently and harry would kill him which would be far too easy pounds way on the other hand his modus operandi was cruel creeping designed to terrify even before the terrible act the monstrous crime itself was committed and harry was concerned that in his case the punishment should fit the crime except there should be something of a trial too but trial as in ordeal not as in examination as a precursor to judgement for if johnny found was in fact the man then the sentence had already been passed the working day was over traffic was thinning in the darkening streets people wended their ways home and some of them entered the house of the necromancer a middleaged woman with a bulging plastic carrierbag letting herself in fumblingly through the front door a young woman with straggly hair and a whining child pulling on her arm calling out after the woman with the bag to wait for her and hold the door an older man in coveralls weary and slumpshouldered carrying a leather bag of tools a light came on in a garret room under steeply sloping eaves another winked into being on the second floor and one on the third harry looked away for a moment up and down the street then looked back in time to see a fourth much dimmer light come on in an angled corner window in the groundfloor flat but he hadnt seen found go in the house stood on a corner there must be a sidedoor harry waited for the traffic to clear then crossed to the other side of the road and turned the corner and there it was a recessed doorway at the side johnny pounds private access to his lair and johnny himself was in there harry crossed the cobbled street away from the house and merged with the shadows of the building on the far side he turned and leaned back a little against the wall and looked at the light where it shone out on this side too from a tiny window in pounds groundfloor flat and he wondered what his quarry was doing in there what he was thinking until it dawned on him that he didnt have to just wonder for trevor jordan had given him the power to find out for himself he let his vampireenhanced telepathy flow outwards on the night air out and away into the dark and across the road and through the old brickwork into the smokegrimed stagnant house of evil but the probe was aimless unpractised and lacking authority spreading out like ripples on a dark pond in all directions until suddenly the necroscope found more than hed bargained for his telepathy touched upon a mind no two minds and he knew at once that neither one of them belonged to johnny found they werent in the house for one thing and for another they were already intent upon him upon harry keogh harry drew breath in a sharp hiss of apprehension fought hard against the urge to crouch down which would only serve to illustrate his awareness and looked this way and that along the dark alley ebranch no for there was no strength there no talent no metaphysical power so who and what were they and where along the alley a cigarette glowed in the dark as someone took a drag someone keeping to the shadows no less than the necroscope himself and across the main road under a lamppost there stood a figure in a dark lightweight overcoat with his hands stuffed forlornly in his pockets turning first this way and then that for all the world like a man stood up who still hopes that his date will show a decoy to distract attention from the one in the shadows and both of them wondering about harry so that he picked up their thoughts in snatches right out of their unsuspecting minds the one under the lamppost pounds home but whos this bugger up and down the street prowling like a cat the one we were told to watch out for said if he showed up we shouldnt touch him but feather in the old cap promotion to inspector and the one in the shadows who was now stepping out of the shadows and heading harrys way dangerous they said well let him try it on if im obliged to protect myself blow his fucking head off and harry could actually feel the mans hand tightening nervously about the rubber grips on the butt of a pistol in his pocket as the one with the gun came almost jauntily on so the other straightened up and took his hands out of his pockets then headed across the road towards harry and quite casually patiently but with their hearts pounding in their chests and their eyes sharp as daggers so they converged on him harry glared at them and was surprised to hear himself snarl a river of fire raced in his veins setting light to something inside which blazed up and sang to him of slaughter and spurting crimson blood of life and of death wamphyri but the human side said no these are not your enemies upon a time before you were a law unto yourself they might even have been your friends why hurt them when you can evade them so easily because it isnt my nature to flee but stand and fight fight not much of a fight theyre like children oh well at least one of these children has a gun the man crossing the road waited for a stream of cars to go by in the nearside lane he was ten to fifteen paces away no more the other one was maybe twenty paces away but both of them were definitely homing in on harry his vampire knew the danger no less than he did and worked to protect him the necroscope sweated a strange cold sweat and breathed a weird mist which clung to him like an everthickening cloak and as the two policemen came on so harrys mist spilled out of the shadows where he waited and poured itself into view like the exhalations of a basement boiler room their guns are useless now they cant see me in this but i can see smell sense even reach out and touch them if i wish it reach out and snuff them damn you harry cursed himselfor the thing inside him out loud damn you you slimy black bastard thing yeah well never mind all that pal one of the policemen answered him crouching down and aiming his gun twohanded into the fog weve been damned and cursed before right so just come on out of there ok i mean all of that steam has to be bad for you do you want to ruin your lungs or do you want me to do it for you eh now i said come on out of there there was no answer only a sudden swirling as the fog seemed to fold inwards upon itself as if someone had shaken a blanket or slammed a door right in its heart and in a few seconds more the mist thinned out fell to earth turned to a film of liquid which made the cobbles damp and shiny and the wall was high black and blank with no alley and no basement boiler room and there was no one there at all back in bonnyrig trevor jordan was awake some immediately forgotten night terror had drenched him in his own sweat and snatched him panting out of his bed in the attic room now he prowled the rooms and corridors of the old house where it stood by the river putting on all the lights his every nerve jumping as he looked out from curtained windows into the night just what his apprehensions were he couldnt say but he felt something looming hovering waiting some terrible thing for the moment conserving its energy but full of monstrous intent was it harry jordan wondered the thing that harry was far too rapidly becoming possibly could it be concern over harrys fate if when ebranch finally moved on him well yes that too or was he worried about his own fate if he was still with the necroscope at that time was this how yulian bodescu had felt at harkley house in devon that evening when the branch had closed in on him to destroy him something like this jordan was sure it was time for jordan to leave harry and he knew it to leave him for good and merge back into the mundane world of ordinary men oh the telepath knew he could never more be truly mundane for he had seen the other side and returned from it but he could try he could work at it work into it gradually forget that he had been god he couldnt bear the thought of the word even now that he had not been alive and eventually become just another man again albeit one with a talent and when harry was well out of it and fled into that other world which jordan could scarcely imagine then he might even return to the branch if they would take him back but of course they would want to be sure about him first they would want to check that he was who and what he was supposed to be but the trouble was and jordan knew now that this must be the source of his nightmare that he couldnt be sure he would be the same person for if harrys awful metamorphosis continued to accelerate harry jordan sucked air gaspingly as telepathic awareness of the necroscope suddenly flooded his being the sensation was like being doused with icewater causing his whole body to shudder violently harry out there somewhere across the river harry listening to jordan to his thoughts but how long had he been there only a minute or two in fact and he had not been eavesdropping on jordan but telepathically checking the vicinity of the house he had detected something of jordans fears however which did precious little to calm the beast which raged within him denied expression when hed fled from the two policemen watching johnny pounds flat the reason harry chose to emerge from the möbius continuum into the bushes on the far side of the river and not directly into the house was simple when hed read the minds of those plainclothes policemen in darlington hed plainly seen that they were expecting him indeed someone had told the man with the gun that harry might be dangerous obviously ebranch must have alerted them to the possibility of him showing up so whatever darcy clarke had told the branch about him it hadnt cut any ice they werent having any and if they were looking out for him in darlington plainly it wouldnt take long before they were doing it here too hed scared off paxton for the moment anyway but paxton was only one of them and untypical of the species so from now on he would have to check locations very carefully before venturing into what were previously safe places it all went to reinforce the necroscopes feeling of claustrophobia a doomladen sensation of space möbius space included narrowing down for him to say nothing of time and now to discover that trevor jordan was also afraid of him of what harry might do to him it was too much the dead even möbius himself had turned against him his mother had become worn out and left him there was no one in the world neither alive nor dead who had anything good to say on his behalf and this was the world and the race which he had fought so long and so hard for not even his own race not any longer harry stepped through a möbius door into a dark corridor of the house across the river and silently commenced to climb the stairs to his own bedroom suddenly he was tired his cares seemed too great sleep would be curative and to hell with everything let the future care for itself but jordans voice stopped him when he was only halfway up the first flight harry the telepath looked up at him from the foot of the stairs trevor jordan who could read the necroscopes mind as easily as harry read his i shouldnt have been thinking those things harry nodded and i shouldnt have overheard you anyway dont worry about it you did your bit for me and did it well and im grateful and it wont be so bad being alone for ive been alone before so if you want to go then go go now for lets face it im losing more and more control to this thing and leaving now might be the safest thing to do jordan shook his head not while the whole worlds against you harry i wont leave you yet harry shrugged and turned away and continued to climb the stairs as you wish but dont leave it too long dreams the night was still young when harry laid his head on the pillow but the moon was up and the stars were bright and it was his time his senses were no longer strong in daylight but in the dark of the night they were sensitive as never before even those which governed or were governed by his subconscious mind and his dreams were stronger too he dreamed first about möbius and sensed that it was more than an ordinary dream the longdead mathematician came and sat on his bed and while his face and form were indistinct his deadspeak voice was as sharp and nononsense as ever the last time we can talk harry in this world anyway are you sure you want to the necroscope answered it seems i cant help giving people a bad time lately the vague weightless figure of möbius nodded yes but we both know thats not you thats why ive chosen to come to you now while your dreams are still your own are they i think so certainly you sound more like the harry i used to know harry relaxed a little sighed and sank down in his bed so what is it you want to talk about the other places harry the other worlds my coneshaped parallel dimensions the necroscope gave a wry apologetic shrug they were mainly bluff i argued for arguments sake we were practising my vampire and i thats as it may be möbius answered but bluff or none you were right anyway your intuition harry the only thing your vision didnt take into account was how how more rightly who said möbius how who are we talking about god again the big bang said möbius the primal light back at the dawn of space and time all of this couldnt have come out of nothing harry and yet weve already decided that before the beginning there was nothing which was foolish of us because we both know that you dont need flesh to have mind god harry nodded the ultimate incorporeal being he made it all right but to what end möbiuss turn to shrug to find out what would happen maybe you mean he didnt already know whats that for omniscience unfair said möbius no one can know before the fact and its dangerous to try but hes known everything since tell me about the other places said harry fascinated despite himself the world of starside and sunside is one möbius told him but it was a failure there were unforeseen paradoxes and things went disastrously wrong starside the vampire swamps and the wamphyri themselves they were cause and effect both but thats for the future and for the past to tell it now might be to change it which would be presumptuous space and time are relative harry argued havent i always said so and in their own way theyre fixed you cant damage them by talking about them möbius chuckled however sadly clever harry ill grant you that but you cant work your vampire wiles on me my boy and anyway starside isnt the place im talking about well im listening the necroscope answered just a little disgruntled once when we talked möbius reminded him you mentioned the balance of the multiverse with black and white holes shifting matter around between all the different layers of existence and delaying or even reversing entropy like the weights governing the swing of an old clocks pendulum but thats only one sort of balance the physical sort then theres the metaphysical the mystical the spiritual god again the balance between good and evil which all had origin in the same source your argument august ferdinand remember there was nothing before the beginning right were not in dispute möbius shook his head on the contrary were in complete agreement harry was astonished god had a dark side oh yes which he cast out the mathematicians words and their delivery had riveted harry and i can do the same is that what youre saying im saying that the other places are like levels some of which are higher and some lower and what we do here determines the next step we go up or down heaven or hell möbius shrugged again if it helps you to think of it like that you mean that when i move on i can leave my dark side maybe even my vampire behind me while theres a difference yes a difference while we may still distinguish between you you mean if i dont succumb i have to go now said möbius but i have to know more harry was desperate i was allowed to come back möbius said simply but i am not allowed to stay my new place is higher harry i really cant afford to lose it wait harry tried to stir himself sit up and take hold of möbiuss wrist but he couldnt move and anyway it would be like trying to grasp smoke and like a set of his own esoteric formulae the great man mutated into nothingness and was gone if anything möbiuss visit had wearied harry even more than before he drifted deeper into sleep but his vampireinfluenced mind was full of a certain name which tormented him and wouldnt let him be and the name was johnny found harry was a telepath he had a quest a task which he must finish and he had a vampire in him when he had gone to face faéthor ferenczys bloodson janos in the mountains of transylvania the ferenczy had warned him that only one of them would come out of it alive and that the winner would be a creature of incredible power janos had read the future seen the same thing known he couldnt lose except one should never try to understand the future read it if you must but dont try to understand it harry had been the one who came down out of the mountains and though he didnt yet have the measure of his powers especially his most recent acquisition telepathy still they were incredible they had been incredible before but now with the booster which was his vampire dreaming he no longer had control over his talents which were active nevertheless dreams are the clearinghouses of the mind where the balance is kept the cuttingroom where all the junk and trivia of life are discarded and the meaningful set in order that is the function of mens dreams that and wish fulfilment and also for anyone with a conscience the elevation of suppressed guilt which is why men sometimes nightmare harry had his share of guilt and more than sufficient of desires requiring fulfilment and what he himself had failed to put in order during his waking hours his subconscious self and the vampire which was part of it would try to put in order while he slept his enhanced awareness spread outwards from him to form a telepathic probe which in a moment unerringly leaped all the miles to its target in darlington for that target was the sleeping mind of johnny found a mind with a talent as weird as it was warped which harry desired to know about and with the sinister guile of the vampire he need only hint suggest propose strike this chord or maybe that and with any luck at all johnny found would tell him all of it johnny was dreaming too of his childhood this wasnt something he would do voluntarily but a night spectre kept rapping on the door of childhood memories and demanding that he open it childhood memories oh he had them but he wouldnt say they were worth remembering or dreaming about which was why he didnt usually he tossed a little in his bed his subconscious mind moaned and went to take up a hammer to nail shut the door to his past something pushed the hammer aside beyond his reach and johnny could only watch helplessly as the door creaked open inside all the bad things of yesterday were waiting for him the many small crimes he had committed and the range of punishments and penalties hed been made to pay for them but hed been a child then and innocent so they said and would soon grow out of it and only johnny himself had known he wouldnt ever grow out of it and that theyd never be able to find punishments severe enough to fit his crimes theyd tried to convince him that the things he did were bad and had almost succeeded but by then he was old enough to know that they lied to him because they didnt understand and because they didnt understand they would never know how good the things were which he did how good they made him feel yes it had been a lonely place childhood where no one understood him or wanted to know about the things he did because they didnt want even to think of such things let alone know about them lonely yes the place beyond that beckoning door and how much more lonely if he hadnt had the dead things to talk to and to play with and to torment but because hed had that his secret thing his clever way with creatures which were no more being an orphan hadnt been nearly so bad because hed known there were others worse off than him whose plight was far worse and that if it wasnt then johnny could soon make it worse the open door both repelled and attracted him beyond it the mists of memory swirled eddied and hypnotized him until against his will johnny found himself drifting in through the door where all his childhood was waiting for him theyd called him found because he had been in a church and the pews had vibrated with his screams and the rafters had echoed with them that sunday morning when the verger had come to see what all the todo was about he was still bloody from birth the foundling and wrapped in a sunday newspaper and the placenta which had followed him into the world still warm in a plastic bag stuffed under the bench in one of the pews but lusty johnny had screamed to wreck his lungs howled to break the stainedglass windows and bring down the ceiling almost as if hed known he had no right to be in that church perhaps his poor mother had known it too and this had been her attempt at saving him which had failed and not only was johnny lost but so was she in any case hed yelled like that until they took him out of the church to the intensive care unit of a local hospitals maternity ward and only then away from gods house had he fallen silent the ambulance which whirled him to the hospital carried his mother too found seated against a headstone in the churchyard in a pool of her own blood head lolling on her swollen breasts except unlike johnny she didnt survive the journey or perhaps she did for a little while a strange start to a strange life but the strangeness was only just beginning in the intensivecare ward johnny had been washed cared for given a cot and for the moment and indeed for all his life a name someone had scribbled found on the plastic tag which circled his little wrist to distinguish him from all the other babies and found hed stayed but when a nurse had looked in on him to see why hed stopped sobbing and gone quiet so suddenly that had been the weirdest thing of all or perhaps not depending on ones perspective for his young mother hadnt been quite dead after all and perhaps shed heard the babies crying and had known that one of them was hers that must be the answer surely for what other explanation could there be there johnnys unnamed unknown mother had sat beside his empty cot and johnny in her dead arms sucking a dribble of cold milk from a dead cold nipple johnny was at an infant orphanage until he was five then fostered for three more years until the couple who had taken him split up in tragic circumstances after that he went to a junior orphanage in york about his foster parents the prescotts had kept a large house on the very outskirts of darlington where the town met the countryside at the time they adopted johnny in they already had a small daughter of four years but there had been problems and mrs prescott was unable to have more children a pity for the couple had always planned to be the perfect family unit the pair of them plus one boy and one girl johnny would seem to fit the bill nicely and make up the deficiency and yet david prescott had been uneasy about the boy from the very first time he saw him it was nothing solid just something he could never quite put his finger on a feeling but because of it things were just a little less perfect than they should be johnny was given the family name and became a prescott for the time being anyway but right from the start he didnt get along with his sister they couldnt be left alone together for five minutes without fighting and the glances they stabbed at each other were poisonous even for mismatched children alice prescott blamed her small daughter for being spoilt which is to say she blamed herself for spoiling her and her husband blamed johnny for being odd there was just something well odd about the boy well of course there is his wife would round on him johnnys been a waif without home and family except in the shape of the orphanage yes and that wasnt the best sort of place either love suffer the little children they seemed altogether too eager to be rid of him if you ask me precious little of love there and david prescott had wondered with reason maybe but what possible reason johnny isnt even six yet how can anyone turn against a child that small and certainly not an orphanage charged with the care of such unfortunates the prescotts had a corner shop which did very nicely a general store that sold just about everything it was less than a mile from their home on the main road into darlington from the north and served a recently matured estate of some three hundred homes working nine till five four days a week and wednesday and saturday mornings they made a good living out of it with the help of a parttime nanny a young girl who lived locally they were not overstretched david kept pigeons in a loft at the bottom of their large secluded garden alice liked to be out digging planting and growing things when the days work was done they took turns seeing to the kids on those occasions when their nanny took time off so that apart from the friction between johnny and his sister carol the lives of the prescotts could be said to be normal pleasant and fairly average which was how things stood until the summer when johnny turned eight indeed until then their lives might even be described as idyllic but that was when david prescott started having problems with his birds and the family cat a placid neutered torn called moggit who slept with carol and was the apple of her eye went out one morning and never came back in and there were long periods of that hot sultry weather which irritates exacerbates and occasionally causes eruptions and it was the same summer when david built a pool for the kids and roofed it over with polythene on an aluminium frame johnny had thought it would be great fun swimming and fooling around in his own pool but he soon became bored with it carol loved it however which annoyed her adopted brother he didnt care for people enjoying things which he didnt enjoy and in any case he didnt much care for carol at all then one morning three or four days after moggit had gone missing johnny got up early he didnt know it but carol was awake and throwing her clothes on as soon as she heard his door gently opening and closing her brother she always put a heavy sneering accent on the word had been getting up early a lot recently hours before the rest of the household and she wanted to know what he was doing it wasnt especially malicious of her but the fact was she was a little jealous and more than a little curious even if johnny was a pig still shed rather have him playing with her in the pool than off on his own playing his stupid mysterious lonely games as for johnny his time was all his own now and no one to make demands on it school was out for the summer holidays he had things to do he could usually be found beyond the garden wall in the hedgerows where they blended into meadow and farmland that stretched out and away to the north and north west but he would always come when he was wanted a loud call would usually bring him home directly and he was sensible about getting back for mealtimes just what he did out there all the hours of the day was something else if his fosterparents asked him he would say playing and that was all but carol wanted to know what it was he played at it was beyond her that he could find anything more interesting than the pool so she went out after him tiptoeing past her parents room into the early morning light where dawn hadnt long cracked the horizon with its golden smile johnny went down past the pool under its polythene blister to the garden wall he climbed the high wall at a wellknown spot jumped down the last few feet on the other side and he started out along the overgrown hedgerow into the maze of fields shimmering in the morning light and carol right after him half a mile into the fields at a junction of ancient rutted overgrown tracks the jumbles of a ruined farm lay humped and green with flowering brambles and clumps of nettles where sections of broken greylichened wall and the buttressed mass of an old chimney poked up in teetering stacks of stone johnny cut diagonally through a meadow and only his dark head shiny with sweat could be seen above the tall swaying grass from where she balanced precariously on top of a disused stile carol saw where he was heading and resolved to follow him the old ruin was obviously johnnys secret place where he played his secret games but they wouldnt be secret much longer johnny had disappeared somewhere into the tumble of fallen weedgrown walls by the time his sister came panting out of the meadow she paused a while and looked this way and that along the tracks which had once serviced the farm then made to cross them to the ruins and paused again what was that a cry the cry of a cat moggit moggit carols hand flew to her mouth she drew a gasping breath and held it what poor little moggit lost somewhere in the shell of this crumbling old pile maybe that was what had drawn johnny here the sound of moggit jammed in some hole trapped and starving in this tottering ruin carol thought to call out in answer to moggits strange choking cries and maybe bring him a little hope but then she thought no for that would only make him struggle the harder and perhaps get himself in more of a fix maybe he was only crying like that so urgently and piteously because johnny was already trying to rescue him holding her breath carol crossed the hardpacked dusty tracks to what once would have been a wide entrance through high farmyard walls to the cluster of buildings within now the gap was a mass of collapsed stone choked by brambles and bolting ivy with a few hazelnuts and straggly elders crushed under the weight of parasitic green broken bricks and rubble shifted underfoot where a wellmarked trail had been worn through the undergrowth carol supposed by johnny dusty and cobwebbed the trail in through the foliage was almost a tunnel the light was shut out sevenyearold carol felt stifled as she forced her way through but when she might have faltered moggits howls she was sure it must be moggit while at the same time praying it was not drove her on until finally she broke cover into yellow sunlight and blinking the grit out of her eyes saw johnny where he sat in the central clearing and saw the the things he had there but without really seeing them at first because her childs mind couldnt conceive couldnt believe and finally she saw but no no there was no way that this could be moggit what moggit of the snowwhite belly and paws the bushy tail and lone ranger masked face the sleek gleaming black back and neck and ears this tortured dangling thing moggit carol almost fainted she slumped down behind a broken wall and knocked loose a brick and johnny heard the clatter when his head snapped round on his neck to look carols way he didnt see her at first only the ruins in the clearing as hed always known them but carol still saw him his bloated face bulging emotionless eyes and bloody clawlike hands his penknife lying open beside him on the wall where he sat and the sharpened stick with its red point clutched tight in one hand and she still saw moggit too moggit with his hind paws just touching the ground feebly dancing to stay upright and keep his weight off his neck which was encircled by a thin wire noose that hung down from the branch of an elder and one yellow eye hanging out on a thread dribbling wetly and dancing on his wet furry cheek even as moggit danced and his fat white belly thin and crimson now where it had been slit open to let a bulge of shiny black red and yellow entrails dangle and moggit wasnt all there were two of carols fathers favourite pigeons too hanging limp from other branches with their wings twisted all askew and a hedgehog still alive but with a rusty iron spike through its side pinning it to the ground so that it staggered dizzily round and around on its own axis in unending agony snuffling horribly yes and there were other things too but carol didnt want to see any more johnny satisfied that no one was there had returned to his game through eyes that were brimming with tears carol saw him stand up catch a dead pigeon in one hand and thrust his stick right through its claycold body and he worked the stick in its unfeeling flesh almost as if as if it wasnt unfeeling at all as if he really believed that the bedraggled stiff broken thing could feel it and all the while he laughed and talked and muttered to these poor tortured alive or dead or soontobedead creatures caring nothing for their waking or sleeping agonies indeed his sister now understood something of the nature of his game that having harried a living thing to its death johnny couldnt bear that it had escaped him and so continued to torture it in the lightless world beyond and at that she was the first to know the truth about her adopted brother without even knowing she knew it for a child herself she recognized a childs fancy when she saw one knew also that johnny was simply a cruel and hateful boy and that what shed imagined just couldnt be but moggit poor moggit finally it got through to carol that it was indeed her battered halfeviscerated cat which johnny was slowly hanging and she could bear it no longer mogghw she screamed at the top of her voice and johnny i hate you oh how i hate you she stood up stumbled and regained her balance flew at him clutching the jagged half of a brick johnny finally saw her and his redblotched face rapidly turned pale he snatched up his penknife not to use on her but with an entirely different perhaps even worse purpose in mind and went to slice through a length of tough kitestring which held down moggits branch strands parted but the string didnt in a sudden rage johnny jerked the string this way and that and moggit was lifted and whirled like a rag his hoarse cat cries cut off as the wire bit into his rubbedraw throat then johnny gave a gasp of triumph as his knife cut through the string and moggit was jerked aloft choking and spitting for a second or two as the noose tightened to finish the job but johnny was so intent on the murder of the cat that carol was on him blindly whirling her arms she came at him with the sharp nails of one hand and the halfbrick grasped tight in the other he avoided her raking nails but a sharp broken corner of the brick struck him on the forehead and knocked him down in a moment he was sitting up shaking his head looking around for his knife and his eyes blazed as he glared at his sister and threatened first moggit and now you he got unsteadily to his feet his forehead grazed and bleeding then spotted his penknife and pounced on it and in that same moment carol knew she was in deadly danger johnny couldnt let her tell her parents what she had seen what he had done and there was only one way he could be sure to stop her with a backward glance that took in the whole scene one last time poor moggit hanged and bobbing with the motion of the elder branch the hedgehog finally exhausted gasping its life out where it lay and the dead mutilated birds strung up in a row she turned away and fled for home and bursting through the tunnel of undergrowth out of the ruins she knew that johnny was right behind her and he would have been except he knew that if she got home first she would bring someone to see and he mustnt let anyone see quickly he cut down moggit and the birds and yanked the hedgehogs stake from the ground panting from the furious pace of his exertions and from his fury in general he tossed the lot into a deep stagnant well which hed discovered on the site whose battened cover had long since rotted away in one corner he hated to see his dead and dying things go down into the dark like that making splashes in the deep black unseen water below wasted all of them and so much life still left in them it was all carols fault yes and thered be a lot more to blame her for if she got home first he set out after her following her wailing and the wild zigzag trail she left through the long grass a halfmile across rough open countryside is a long way when youre a heartbroken child with your eyes full of tears carols heart hammered in her breast and her breath was ragged and panting but to drive her on there was always that picture burning on her minds eye of moggit dangling and jerking in the wire noose with his guts hanging out like a small bag of crushed fruits when her mother made jam in the kitchen and to drive her even faster was johnnys voice crying after her caaarol carol wait for me she did no such thing the garden wall was just ahead at the end of the hedgerow behind her panting and yet growling too like some savage dog johnny was catching up his groping hand missed her ankle by inches as she halfclimbed halffell over the wall but on the garden side she just lay there too terrified tearful too exhausted to go on and johnny jumping down after her his eyes mad and glaring small fists tightening and slackening where he held them to his sides she looked toward the house but it was hidden behind fruit trees and the misted dome of the pool would her parents be up yet she didnt even have the wind for yelling johnny snarled as he bunched her hair in a strong fist and commenced dragging her towards the pool swimming he said the word bursting from his lips like a bubble of slime youre going swimming carol youre going to like it i know and so am i especially afterwards for the last week or so david prescott had also taken to getting up early alice didnt complain or ask why because he was always so quiet and considerate and invariably brought her a cup of coffee it must be the summer the light mornings the old early bird syndrome but in fact it was the mail out this way the mail deliveries were always early the very crack of dawn and david was expecting a letter from the orphanage not that it would contain anything of any significance he was sure it wouldnt but still hed like to get to it before alice if she saw it first well shed only say he was paranoid about johnny and certainly it would look as though he was else why would he write to the orphanage about him the thing was david was desperate that things should work out all right he really did want to love the poor kid but at the same time hed always been more receptive of mood than alice more aware of the aura of people especially kids and he knew that johnnys aura just wasnt right if it was something out of his past but what past he was just a child something the orphanage would know about then david believed that he and his wife should be told for he suspected alice was right to complain about the attitude of the orphanage they had seemed too eager to wash their hands of johnny or rather to place him in the care of a normal loving family where he can grow into a healthy person healthy in mind as well as in body thats what the orphanage director had said the day they went to pick up their new son and the words had always stuck in davids memory healthy in mind as well as in body something wrong with johnnys mind something a little sick or a lot sick for that was the nature of the aura which david sometimes felt washing out from the boy a sick one and clammy as an old man on his deathbed johnny felt sick as death but not his death and this morning sure enough the letter was there david tore it open and read it and for a little while the words made no sense budgerigars in the kids rooms and johnny stealing killing and collecting them a collection of dead things mice beetles the budgies even a kitten a dead kitten under his bed crawling with maggots and johnny twisting its legs until they came off in his hands that was how the orphanage people had found out about it when the other kids came screaming but a kitten moggit screaming and david could hear the horrified screams of those kids from here except it wasnt those kids but one of his own no his own carol from the bottom of the garden what and alices sleepy mumbling voice from upstairs calling down wheres the coffee the kids are up early and another scream from the garden cut off gurglingly at its zenith david had ever been the one to leap to conclusions often incorrectly he did so now and this time was right down the garden path with his dressinggown flapping yelling for carol hoarsely like crazy but no answer and a small blurred figure inside the polythene dome kneeling at the side of the pool david burst in it was johnny kneeling there he looked as if he were trying to drag carol out of the water and she was floating there facedown arms limply outstretched crucified on the blue gently lapping water johnny had been playing in the fields hed heard carols screams and seen a man dirty bearded dressed in rags climbing the wall out of the garden the man ran away across the fields and johnny went to see what hed been doing carol was in the pool and hed tried to drag her out he told the story to david to alice the police anyone who wanted to hear it and most of them believed him even david halfbelieved him though he didnt want him near any more and alice probably believed him though that would be hard to say for she wasnt much good for anything from that time forward the police found a camp site in the ruins of the old farm and brought up a lot of rubbish from the well someone person or persons must have been living rough there stealing from gardens and properties davids pigeons in order to eat it could be gypsies the hedgehog or maybe a tramp hard to say chances were theyd get him or them eventually but they never did get anyone and johnny went back to the orphanage harry slept on and for a little while longer experienced johnny pounds dreams of course he saw pounds past only from the necromancers own point of view which if anything was worse than the whole picture and more than sufficient to guarantee he had the right man but eventually pounds excesses became too much his dreaming memories of his own evil deeds a lurid litany to his inhumanity by which time harrys hatred of him had grown into a rage johnny found had lived all his young life a monster and murderer and so far had got away with it but until recently his stepsister carol had remained his single human victim between times hed made do and played his unthinkable games with creatures dead of causes other than murder but as men and monsters alike mature so their tastes also mature and johnny was no exception except what grotesque form does maturity take in something rotten from the start once for entirely unthinkable reasons which even harry keogh couldnt bear to contemplate found had taken a job in a morgue only to be fired when his boss became suspicious it was his dream about another job hed had however this time in a slaughterhouse which did the trick and like the last straw broke the necroscopes back that was when harry had drawn back his shuddering telepathic probe pulled out of johnnys mind and let the man get on with his nightmaring except of course in pounds case the nightmares could barely match up to the reality and fancies and then the necroscope had dreamed of darcy clarke which was also a form of nightmare for in it darcy was dead and his voice came to harry as deadspeak even so it didnt come clearly but was distorted drifting a thousand echoes coming together from all directions and combining to form a strange outofsync sighing i couldnt believe you would have done that to me harry said darcy when hed established his identity i mean i knew the moment they killed me when i saw that they actually could kill me despite my guardian angel that you were responsible it could only have been something you did inside my head when you were in there you killed off the thing that watched out for me and so left me vulnerable but i still cant believe you would and i still dont know why i thought i knew you but i didnt know you a damn this is just a dream harry answered him then this is my conscience while i still have one giving me trouble because i protected myself at someone elses expense this is a nightmare darcy and youre not really dead its just me blaming myself that i had to interfere inside your head as for why i did it to be sure that if you came up against me before i was out of here then that you would be vulnerable because of all the talents in ebranch yours is the one that scares me most it gives you the edge makes you invincible i could try to stop you again and again and fail but you would only have to pull the trigger once and id be a goner and it wouldnt be new to you you could do itfor youve done it before darcys deadspeak presence was gathering itself now coming together as an act of sheer will so that his fragmented voice lost its echoing sigh and took on authority as he said its no dream harry im dead as can be and even though ive come to you while youre asleep still you should be able to see that but if you doubt me why not ask your thousands of friends the great majority the teeming dead will tell you i dont lie im one of them now a copout harry answered smiling and shaking his head i cant ask the dead anything because they dont want to know me any more hey im a vampire remember im not one of you living guys and im not one of those dead ones im somewhere in the middle darcy undead wamphyri harry said darcy bitterly theres no need for all this subterfuge you dont have to try out your wamphyri wordgames on me im admitting it you won i dont know why you wished me dead but anyway you got your wish i am dead i really am harry tossed and turned in his bed and began to sweat sometimes like any other man his dreams were just so much junk or again they might be erotic or esoteric fancies and fantasies or they could be well just dreams but at other times they were a lot more than that and this was beginning to feel like one of those times ok he finally said still unconvinced and wanting desperately to stay that way so youre dead so who killed you and why the branch darcy answered with a typical deadspeak shrug who else whatever you did to my mind the mere fact that youd been in there gave me mindsmog you interfered inside my head cancelled something took something away from me and in its place i got your taint no im not saying you vampirized me just that you spoiled me they could smell you on me in the heart of my being and they darent take any chances with me which was surely the way you planned it harry thought about it a moment then said darcy if you really are dead if this isnt just my conscience acting up because youre right and i did interfere with your mind which i know was wrong then ill be able to find you when im awake i mean well be able to talk to each other again through deadspeak right he sensed the others nod ill be waiting for you harry except it isnt easy im still learning how to get it all together eh will you explain they burned me and scattered my ashes darcy told him im sure i dont have to tell you why but it means i have no focal point i dont belong in any special place im blowing on the winds drifting on the tides flushed away down the citys sewers and suddenly the necroscope suspected it was true and he began to toss and churn in his bed that much more violently it seemed that darcy picked up his torment for when he spoke again his words were less harsh even conciliatory if i wrong you with accusations harry its only because youve wronged me this has to be a nightmare harry gasped darcy it has to be i didnt mean to harm you of all the men ive known you are the one i couldnt harm not under any circumstances not because of your talent but because because youre you and so you see this has to be a bloody awful nightmare and now darcy knew that indeed harry was just as innocent as ever and that if anyone anything were to blame then it was the creature inside him which was rapidly becoming one with him he would have comforted him then if there was a way but he felt himself drifting again coming apart and he knew he didnt have the strength or the knowhow to keep it together he was only recently dead after all ill be around when youre awake harry try contacting me then it will be easier if you come looking for me and with that harry was alone again for a while at least gratefully he relaxed and sank down deep in his bed and even deeper into sleep as is the way of dreams he quickly forgot the last one and prepared to move on to the next which was when the necroscope dreamed of someone else except that this time he knew for sure it was more than just a dream and that his visitor was or had been more than merely human for his parasite responded to this visitor this other vampire in typical wamphyri fashion prompting harry to inquire who are you that you dare come creeping into my sleeping thoughts answer quickly there are doors in my mind which would swallow you whole ahhh came back the answer at once so its true you won your fight with janos but you also lost im so sorry harry so sorry and now harry knew him ken layard he said we took your head and burned your body in the mountains over halmagiu and you went willingly to your death layard answered with a deadspeak nod death was nothing compared to the prospect of being undead in thrall to janos ferenczy he would have put me down into ashes too but only to have me at his beck and call and bring me up again whenever he had need of my talent anyway and as you said i went willingly for i knew it would be harder for me if i tried it the other way and bodrogk and his thracians were quick about it i didnt feel a thing harrys deadspeak thoughts turned sour but you owe me one right the worst one you can give me because whichever way you look at it i was the one who tracked you down and now theyre about to track me down and so youve come to gloat layard was taken aback how wrong can you be harry he said listen i know youve been getting a hard time from the teeming dead but you still have a few friends left you came in friendship i came to say thanks for trevor jordan harry shook his head i dont follow you to thank you for what you did for him and to offer my help if theres anything i can do for you the necroscope began to make sense of it trevor was your friend and colleague right you and he were one of the best teams one of the best partnerships ebranch ever had the best said layard so when i died it was only natural id want to keep tabs on him see how he made out what i did best in life came even easier in death and in life id been one hell of a locator which was pretty fortunate for me else id have had a really dreary time of it what me a vampire the dead didnt want to know me harry so locating people youd known in life occupied a little of your time eh a little of it all of it i mean once you get over your fear of death of being dead it can pretty soon get boring so i traced trevor and discovered that he was dead too and i would have spoken to him except the great majority did a job on me and blocked me out there are some fine talents among the dead harry and not a lot they cant do if theyve a mind so theyd throw up a lot of deadspeak flak every time i tried to talk to anyone anyone that is except me exactly theyll do their damnedest to mess us around but they dont mess with us we want to talk to each other thats fine just as long as were not trying to pervert one of them i see harry said so the only way you could get to speak to trevor was through me thats right except youre too late and your deadspeak wont work anyway because trevor is alive again which means you still cant communicate direct but must use me as a gobetween complicated but in a nutshell correct well you picked the wrong time harry was halfapologetic try me when im awake ill do that but in the meantime maybe i can do you a favour too oh harry layard said i was one of the good guys a long time before i copped it and even at the end i was still pretty much my own man i was a creature of janoss making in thrall to him yes but given even the smallest chance id have taken him out if that were at all possible it wasnt possible not for me anyway and so i died but youll never know how glad i am that he got his too so as you said i owe you one not one of the worst but a good one like the talent of locating how would you like to be a locator harry it would come in handy certainly the necroscope answered i already have deadspeak telepathy one or two other things being able to find someone or thing in a hurry would be a big bonus thats what i thought so maybe we can trade you get my talent and i get to talk to you now and then plus a reintroduction to trevor jordan i mean you act as our gobetween trevor would like that im sure what will it entail harry became cautious well layard offered a deadspeak shrug im already in your mind in contact anyway so i suppose youll just have to open up and let me look deeper inside i mean i know my own trick the mechanism which makes me a locator and if i can find a similar thing in you and activate it something like that and you want me to open up to you of my own free will right layard chuckled albeit drily youve played this game before harry harry nodded yes i have occasionally with disastrous consequences layard was serious at once harry theres none of that shit in me i was still myself when i went out i dont have anything up my sleeve the necroscope considered it but what did he have to lose very well he finally said except ive already warned you that my minds a weird place dont try to mess with me ken you dont have much i know but i swear if you fool around in there i wont leave you with anything hey you dont have to convince me ok harry said and after a moment one last thing you said you came to thank me for what i did for jordan i take it you mean his resurrection so how did you know id brought him back layard shrugged just because the great majority dont speak to me doesnt me i cant eavesdrop now and then also the dead dont move around too much you know but trevor does so i knew that what id heard was true you have a heap of rare talents there harry a pity you didnt get darcys too before they got him that focused the necroscopes attention to a pinpoint he fastened on it in a moment darcys dead i thought that was just a nightmare i hoped it was anyway which means i have to hope this is too you have my sympathy harry layard told him but its all real no one brings me any good news any more lost for words harry shook his head then deliberately returned to the former subject all right ken my minds all yours the locator went in and was out again almost as quickly and youre right and thats a strange place harry he said its as if it was radioactive in there hot and cold at the same time but i found what i wanted or rather i didnt find it you dont have the equipment theres nothing there for me to switch on harry shrugged you tried anyway but you do have david chungs kind of mind chung the sympathetic locator thats right so i tripped that switch instead now all you need is something belonging to the one you need to locate you focus on it and bingo except being what you are everything you are youll probably be better at it than chung is harry nodded said well i suppose its my turn to owe you again thanks ken oh ill be back later to collect layard told him i mean trevor was like my kid brother you know and now ill go and let you get some sleeping done youre tired harry in mind and body both as layard backed off and faded into nothing the necroscopes mind cleared itself for whatever else whoever else was waiting and she didnt take long in coming he dreamed of penny but was she a dream or just a fancy even dreaming he wondered about it was she an adjustment of psyche part of the pigeonholing of mundane occurrences into all the subconscious slots between forget it through trivial to highly important or just a remnant left over from a moment or two of waking lust hed known of course that the dead girl had a crush on him it had been obvious even from their first meeting for after all how many men get to see their ladies naked on a first date in harrys day damn few maybe this was simply the extrapolation of something his subconscious mind had been working on and should have been titled how things might have been if harry keogh could spare the time and if he wasnt a bloody vampire whichever it was a soothing and blessed relief to his tormented mind after the nightmare of association with johnny found the delirium of darcy clarkes accusations and the revelations of ken layard and it brought physical relief too as he answered pennys caresses and loved her with his body as any ordinary man loves a girl the initiative however was all hers had to be else his exhaustion must drag him down even deeper into dreamless sleep and harry wondered about that too how come she knew how to do it all for after all he knew she was an innocent his little innocent whose death he would soon avenge isnt bringing me back enough she whispered guiding his rubbery fingers to her stiffening nipples do you have to go after him too you know harry ive been doing a lot of thinking since all of this happened and i mean ive got so much to be glad for i was dead and now im alive it would be sort of ungrateful of me to want revenge too oh i wanted it at first i know but now im not so sure but id settle for you certainly he lay back and listened to her and felt her small gentle fingers tight on his flesh where it throbbed but lazily as yet like a motor waiting for the throttle and in the darkness she sat up beside him crouched over him and patted him with her hands so that he swayed from side to side jerking and snatching at the darkness are the sexual arts instinctive in some people harry couldnt remember who had shown him or had he just known maybe he would remember when he woke up but for the moment he didnt want to wake up here now asleep he was just a man no more the necroscope no more the vampire just a man being loved and making love and waiting for the sweet sucking thing which was the heart of pennys womanhood to descend on to his silently singing flesh and hoping against hope that the dream wouldnt fade or change its course and that he would get to come the last time hed made love had been just weeks ago but already it felt like forever he felt full to bursting maybe it was just being with this girl penny just being human which from now on he could never be again and the poignancy of that was so great that when at last gasping she actually slid her sweet young body down onto him he came almost at once like an urgent youth stroking his first loves breasts and feeling him shuddering within her the hot spurt of his juices she clenched him that much tighter until the jerking of his flesh had spent him to the last drop following which the gradual resurgence of his need was slow but sure and her guidance unwavering until he was in her again this time they lay on their sides and while his left hand stroked squeezed and compressed the pillow of her right buttock so the tight tube of her vagina sucked on him for the milk of love and life and harry thought if this were real i wouldnt dare for fear of making her pregnant with my damned milk of life or in my case my tainted wamphyri sperm and deep inside his vampire laughed at him milk of life frothing spume of lust more like for as everyone knows only the blood is the true life harry she clawed at his shoulders rubbed his chest furiously with her flattened generous breasts and harry she panted again im coming coming coming it brought him to climax too the thought of her orgasm and the feel of its wet wrenching tremors but more than that it brought him to his senses suddenly he was awake wide awake in their sweat and their fluids and the pungent smell of their love which wasnt fading back into the depths of his subconscious mind which wasnt the ephemeral stuff of dreams which was in fact totally terribly real because penny was there in his bed with him harry gasped and opened his eyes and shot bolt upright in the tumbled bed its all right its ok penny said grasping his wrists in the moment before she saw his eyes then oh she said as her hand flew to her mouth harrys mind whirled what the hell was happening here how had penny got into the house where was jordan oh he finally repeated her bloody oh penny you dont realize what youve done he tossed back the covers and pulled on his clothes naked she came after him drew him to a standstill and reached tremblingly to touch his redly illumined face in the darkness of the room when i was dead she said in a whisper they tried to tell me you were a monster i wouldnt listen to them because i didnt want to talk to dead people but i remember they said there was life and death and a place between the two people have existence in the first two places but not in the third which is reserved for for vampires harry cut in harshly yes and for their victims people they turn into vampires and for foolish girls who through their thoughtless actions change themselves into vampires she shook her head but you didnt take my blood harry you didnt even make me bleed she was defiant im almost nineteen and anyway i wasnt a virgin i i knew a man for a whole year once knew a man he snorted youre a child and youre out of touch she hit back its plenty of girls british girls get married at sixteen and seventeen these days yes and plenty more prefer not to get married but simply live with their lovers im no child are you saying my body felt like a childs yes he snapped then gritted his teeth folded her in his arms and groaned no you felt you feel like a woman but still a foolish one penny you dont understand i didnt need to make you bleed you see theres something of me in you now its not much but it doesnt need to be for even a little is enough to change you then let it as long as im with you she clutched him to her you brought me back harry gave me my life for what its worth i owe it to you all of it and i want you to have it youve run away from home he put her away from him to arms length ive left home she sighed nineteeneightynine remember he wanted to hit her and couldnt he thought dear god shes in thrall to me and then thought but she was even before this except wed call it a crush please dont let anything of me of that be in her his head cleared sleep and all that had accompanied it receded the implications came home to him fully what time is it he glanced at his watch only pm how did you find me more importantly how did you get in she sensed his urgency and reacted to it whats wrong harry and now her eyes were frightened as he put on the lights and his face took on a more normal aspect she said when i was here before i saw the address on some of your mail i remembered it remembered everything about you in fact you havent been out of my mind for a minute and i knew i would have to come to you no matter what and trevor jordan let you in without waking me harry hurled open his bedroom door trevor he shouted will you come the hell up here there was no answer just penny shaking her head harry looked at her longlegged yellowhaired blueeyed his gaze took in her firm breasts thighs and backside all of her beautiful young body and the uneven slant of her mouth which was quite unintentioned but still made her look sexy and somehow provocative when hed first seen her like this naked there had been ugly black holes in her flesh but now she was whole again whole but probably unholy better get dressed he said and jordan gone she said slipping easily into her clothes i told him i had to be with you but not how i intended to be with you he made me promise to look after you and told me to tell you goodbye thats all no he also said i shouldnt stay when he couldnt convince me then he left he said youd understand oh and i remember he said he hoped that er ebranch that they would understand too for his sake ebranch harry echoed her and then remembering his dream darcy who she was dressed she stared at him go downstairs he said make some coffee for yourself theres red wine in the fridge for me pour me a glass harry i do it now she went and when he was alone harry sent out his deadspeak thoughts to search for darcy clarke and prayed he wouldnt find him but found him anyway found him blowing on the wind drifting with the tides flushed away like so much flotsam or maybe jetsam jetsam yes materials hurled from the deck of a ship in peril sacrificed for the greater good the necroscope sat on the edge of his bed and shed several hot slow tears it was his humanity amplified by the overpowering emotions of the wamphyri even if he were only human he would have cried except then his tears wouldnt burn like the overflow of the volcano rumbling within darcy he said who was it lt was you harry darcys deadspeak was faint as the wind over the sea heard in the whorl of a small shell god i know harry felt stabbed to the heart but who was it physically who took your life and how did you die not the old way the stake the sword the fire no just a bullet well two bullets the fire wasnt until later and your executioner why so you can go after him no no harry for after all he was only doing his job and he obviously suspected that i was a deadly threat also well its a fact my own actions could have been more prudent so maybe it was as much my fault as it was yours but on the other hand maybe if id known i was no longer protected then i would have been more careful you wont tell me who killed you i have told you you did then ill have to find out some other time from someone else why dont you just steal it out of my deadspeak mind i dont just take not from my friends if you wont tell me of your own free will then ill just have to find out some other way but you did take and not just information and it most certainly was not of my own free will so that now im a dead friend just one of the great majority a third party asked find out what some other way and harry gave a small start but it was only penny standing in the doorway with a glass of red wine in her hand shed heard the necroscope apparently talking to himself harrys concentration slipped darcy clarkes deadspeak disintegrated contact was lost but harry wasnt angry not with penny if he and darcy had continued then they probably would have parted on even worse terms lets go downstairs he said out into the garden its a warm night are the stars out id like to look at the stars and think he would like to look at his stars yes the familiar constellations for who could say maybe it would be his last opportunity and the stars over starside were very different and he would like to think about what penny had said for one thing did he really need to even the score with johnny found and why the hell should he want to know who had killed darcy clarke darcy wasnt himself vengeful was he and then there was ken layard and his gift harry was now a locator well and he always had been to an extent telepathically he could readily seek and discover others of his acquaintance such as zek föener and trevor jordan and given an introduction to a dead person from then on hed always been able to find his way to that persons graveside and no matter the distance hed rarely had difficulty conversing with such dead friends but now the teeming dead didnt much want to speak to him any more some do said another voice in his metaphysical mind one which laved him like a shower on a sweltering hot day it was pamela trotter and she was a breath of fresh air penny had come into the garden with the necroscope but of course she hadnt heard pamelas deadspeak harry sent her indoors if not she would only talk to him question and distract him but turning away towards the house she looked as if she might cry and so he said im not putting you away from me but i need to be alone for a couple of minutes after that well have lots of time for being together because ill have to watch you until im sure youre just you or if it comes to the worst until im sure that youre something else his thoughts were deadspeak or good as and pamela picked them up as penny went back indoors so the exwhore said a vampire lover harry im jealous well you shouldnt be he shook his head and explained what had happened the trouble penny had probably landed herself in hey i could use that sort of trouble pamela retorted i mean i really wouldnt mind being undead with someone like you but too late for that im not much up to fun and games any more maybe just one last time eh for the right man you know she went quiet and waited for his answer a long pregnant pause which defied him to cry off now not that he intended to eventually he said you think we should go ahead with it she sighed well no question which one of you is in charge right now oh you have the upper hand harry the human you for if your vampire was ascendant youd have no such doubts you would know what was right harry gave a snort my vampire would know what to do for the best the best for my vampire maybe so whats your problem she was becoming impatient with him youre one and the same or will be my problem is simple the necroscope answered if the dark side of me gets its way the human side loses perhaps permanently so maybe i should just let the police have johnny found i know that left to their own devices theyll get him soon enough anyway because theyre right on his tail even now but but we had a deal she cut in i cant believe youd want to cry off i mean you were so hot for this did i let you into my mind to read what you read there for nothing and the other girls are they dead for nothing with no chance to square it you were the only chance we ever had harry and now you say let the police have him i mean fuck the police why they wouldnt even know what to do with him what lock him up in a lunatic asylum for a couple of years then turn him loose to do it again no you were right the first time around he has to pay now the full price he held up his hands pamela wait wait nothing you chickenshit vampire have me and the others been digging our way out all this time for nothing that took harry by surprise others ive made a few friends and they want to help so he shrugged let them help and after long wondering moments then you havent changed your mind he shook his head not for a minute i was just thinking my way round it thats all youre the one whos coming on all excited and changeable she was silent for a count of three then said i think that just now just a minute ago you deliberately let me run on or offat the mouth its possible he admitted nodding we chickenshit vampires are like that argumentative just for the sake of it im sorry harry she felt an utter fool but its just that were all set now and when i homed in on you it seemed to me you might be reconsidering things no he said again just thinking things through or maybe arguing with myself for the sake of it what did you want anyway he could almost hear her sigh of relief i was hoping youd have some idea when we can expect soon he cut her off it has to be very soon now and to himself because if im going to get johnny found it has to be before ebranch gets after me if theyre not already after me in fact he strongly suspected that they were no he knew that they must be and the night would yet prove him right harry finished his drink and went back inside penny was waiting for him pale and lovely and the look on her face begged the question whats going to become of us the necroscope wasnt sure yet so gave her a kiss instead which was when she asked him how it had happened to him that was something hed asked himself time and again until he now believed he had the answer wasting few words he quickly told her about old faéthor ferenczys place in ploiesti romania the onceruins where an ancient father of vampires had lain where surely by now the bulldozers had levelled everything and a concrete mausoleum was mushrooming to the grey skies except the vast hive would not be intended as a memorial to the evil of faéthor for he had been secretive to the end so that no one living today remembered him but to that of the madman ceausescus agroindustrial obsession anyway there was nothing of faéthor left there now or if anything only a memory and even then not in the people only in the earth which the great vampire had poisoned id lost my talents harry explained i had no deadspeak and was locked out of the möbius continuum but faéthor told me he could fix all that if i would only go to see him i was over a barrel and had to do it but in fact he did give me back my deadspeak and he assisted in my rediscovery of the möbius continuum but all of that was incidental to his plan which was to come back to return as a power and a plague into the world of men as to how he would do it i still dont know if it was an act of evil will or the automatic action of alien nature i dont know whether faéthor caused it to come about or if he knew it would happen of its own accord i cant be sure it wasnt something he himself set in motion with malice aforethought or simply the last gasp of his own vampires incredible urge for survival all i know for sure is that theres nothing more tenacious than a vampire the mechanics of the thing were simple faéthor had died when his home was bombed during the war staked through by a fallen ceiling beam and decapitated out of mercy by a man who happened upon the scene his body had been burned nothing of him escaped the fire or did it what of his fats vampire fats rendered down from his flesh dripping into cracks in the floorboards seeping into the earth while the rest of the house and faéthors flesh went up in flames the greek christian priests of old had known how to deal with vampires how every piece of the vrykoulakas must be burned because each smallest part has the power of regeneration anyway thats how i see it faéthors spirit and not only that but something of the monsters physical essence too had remained there in the atmosphere of the place and in the earth waiting but waiting for what to be triggered by what by faéthor when he found himself a suitable vessel or vehicle into the future i believe so and also that i was to have been that vehicle something of him call it his essential fluids if you like had gone down into the earth under his ruins to escape the furnace heat and when i went to see him and laid myself down to sleep upon that selfsame spot god i did i really did then that something surfaced to enter into me but what was it i had seen nothing there but a few bats flitting on the night air which came nowhere near me no i had seen something at this point the necroscope directed pennys fascinated gaze to a shelf of books on the wall by the fireplace there were a dozen of them all with the same subject fungi she stared hard at the books then at harry mushrooms he shrugged mushrooms toadstools fungi as you can see ive made something of a study of them in fact theyve occupied quite a bit of my time in the last few weeks he got her one of the books titled the handbook guide to mushrooms and other fungi and turned to a wellthumbed page near the back thats not the one he tapped a fingernail on the illustrated page but its the closest ive found my fungus was more nearly black and rightly so she looked at the page the common earthball harry gave a grunt not so common he answered not the variety i saw anyway they werent there when i settled down to sleep but they were there when i woke up a ring of morbid fruiting bodies small black mushrooms or puffballs already rotting and bursting open at the slightest movement releasing their scarlet spores i remember i sneezed when their dust got up my nose later when theyd rotted right down their stench was well it was like death no it was death i remember how the sun seemed to steam them away shortly after that faéthor wished me well which should have been a warning in itself and advised me not to waste any time but complete the task id set myself with despatch i thought it a queer thing to say that the way hed said it had been queer but he didnt elaborate she shook her head you breathed the spores of a toadstool and became a vampire yes harry finished it for her but they werent the spores of just any toadstool these things were spawned of faéthors slime of his rottenness they were his deadspawn but well that wasnt all there was to it for id had a lot of truck with vampires too over the years and id learned their ways perhaps learned too much maybe thats also part of it im not sure but at least you can see now why you shouldnt have gone to bed with me a few spores was enough for me so what about you but as long as im with youshe began penny he cut in im not staying here im not even staying in this world she flew into his arms i dont care which world take me wherever you go whenever you go and ill always be there to care for you well he thought and i will need someone and you are a lovely creature and out loud but i cant go anywhere until found is finished its not just for you but all the others he murdered too and one in particular i made her a promise found johnny found thats his name and i have to get after him he has to die because hes hes like me and all the others ive had to deal with not meant to be not in any clean world i mean found hurts the very dead isnt dying enough without him too and what if he ever fathers children what will they be eh and will their mother leave them on a doorstep like johnny was left no he has to be stopped here now just thinking about the necromancer had worked harry into a fury or if not harry his vampire certainly he wondered what found was doing right now this very moment he more than wondered he had to know harry freed himself from pennys arms put out the light stood dark in the darkened room and reached out with his metaphysical mind he knew pounds address knew the way there he sent a probe there to darlington the street the house into the groundfloor flat and found it empty this was his chance to take something belonging to the necromancer would there be watchers in the street probably but with any luck he wouldnt be there long enough that theyd see him penny i have to go somewhere now he said but ill be right back a few minutes at most youre to lock the doors and stay right here in the house his red eyes glowed this is my place only let them dare to to and let who dare she whispered ebranch let them dare to what harry a few minutes he growled ill be back before you know it countdown to hell there were watchers harry chose to exit from the möbius continuum at the same point as the last time hed been there in the shadow of the wall across the alley from pounds place and one of the watchers was right there even in the moment he stepped from the continuum into the real physical world harry heard the plainclothes mans gasp and knew someone was there in the shadows with him knew too that even now this unknown someone would be reaching for his gun one big difference between them was that harry could see perfectly well in the dark another was that his adversary was only a man reacting in a lightningfast movement harry reached out to slap the mans weapon out of his hand and saw what kind of a gun it was which the other had produced from under his coat a crossbow he knocked it away anyway sent it clattering on the cobbles and held the esper by his throat against the wall the man was terrified a prognosticator a reader of future times he had known that harry would come here that had been as far as he could see but hed also known that his own lifethread went on beyond this point which had seemed to mean that if there was trouble harry would be on the receiving end the necroscope read these things right out of the espers gibbering mind and his voice was a clotted gurgle as he told him reading the futures a dangerous game so youre going to live are you well maybe but what as a man or a vampire he tilted his head a little on one side and smiled at the other through eyes burning like coals under a bellows blast and in the next moment stopped smiling and showed him his teeth the esper saw the gape the impossible gape of harrys jaws and gagged as the vampires steel fingers tightened on his windpipe in his mind he was screaming oh jesus im dead dead you could be harry told him you could oh so easily be it rather depends on how well we get on now tell me who killed darcy clarke the man short and sturdy balding and narroweyed used both hands to try to loosen harrys grip on his throat it was useless turning purple still he managed to shake his head refusing to answer the necroscopes question with anything but a gurgle but harry read it in his mind anyway paxton that vicious slimy at that harrys fury filled him to bursting it would be so easy to just tighten his grip until this staggering shits adams apple turned to mush in his hand but that would be to punish him for what someone else had done also it would be to pander to the monster raging inside him instead he tossed the man away from him took a deep breath and breathed a vampire mist by the time the esper was able to prop himself on one elbow against the wall choking and massaging his throat the mist lay over the alley like a shroud and harry had disappeared into it or rather through it and through the möbius continuum into johnny pounds flat he knew he didnt have a lot of time it depended how many men the branch had up here they could be coming through the main door of the building right now and theyd be equipped with all the right gear too a crossbow is a hellishly ugly weapon but a flamethrower is far worse pounds flat was grimy as a pigsty and smelled just as bad harry moved through it without touching thinking even my shoes will feel unclean first he checked the door it was sturdy as hell made of heavy oldfashioned oak hung on massive hinges fitted with three locks and on the inside two large bolts obviously johnny hadnt intended that anyone should break in which sufficed to make harry feel a little safer too he quickly moved on in the front room before a small grimy window overlooking the now quiet road he paused beside a cheap writing desk one drawer was halfopen harry glimpsed a metallic sheen from inside but was distracted by the items on top of the desk a creased stained hugebreasted samantha fox calendar with todays date ringed in biro alongside some scribbled marginalia and a handscrawled message on a sheet of a bearing the frigis express logo the calendar didnt seem especially important at least not until harry had read the message on the a johnny tonight a london run your lucky charm truck which ill have loaded for you pick her up at the depot its for parkinsons in slough theyll be dressing it for heathrow suppliers starting first thing in the morning so we cant be late with this sorry for late notice if you cant make it let me know soonest the note was signed in some indecipherable scrawl but harry didnt need to know who had signed it the date at the top was todays johnny had a london run tonight leaving the darlington depot at now harry looked at the calendar again in the margin opposite the ringed date found had scribbled london run good cos i feel lucky and this could be my night and i need to fuck inside a tit glancing at his watch harry saw that it was johnny was at the depot right now the necroscope came to a decision there and then his mad quarry used a frigis express truck his lucky charm truck as a prop in his crazed games of sex murder and necromancy and so the truck should likewise feature in his punishment very well tonight would be johnnys last run and now all harry needed was an item from the lunatics personal belongings he yanked the desk drawer open the rest of the way and a halfdozen heavy metal tubes jumped in their velvetlined compartments harry looked at them and thought what the but as he carefully lifted one of the tubes out of the drawer he knew well enough what the the thing was a weapon which found himself must have made or had manufactured for use on his victims or for use on one of them anyway a name had been painted with a small brush in black enamel on the shining metal penny and harry thought this was what went into penny before found went into her the weapon fitted pamela trotters description perfectly a section of steel tubing about an inch and a half internal diameter one end was cut square and had a rubber sheath or handgrip and the other end was cut diagonally to a point that was the cutting edge of the tool and its rim had been filed from the inside out to a razors sharpness the necroscope already knew how and why such a hideous knife would be used the very thought of it was sickening as a kid harry had played in the deep snows of englands northeast coast when he was quite small hed love just to sit there in the piled snow with an old tin can driving the open end plop into the cold soft white bank when you pulled the can out again it would be full of snow short fat cylinders of snow from which you could build castles like on the beach except unlike sandcastles which melted away when the tide came in these castles would last for days until the weather warmed up but it wasnt the castles he pictured now but the perfectly circular holes which the can had used to leave in the snow in his minds eye he could see those holes even now and they were crimson and they werent cut in snow harry looked at the other steeltubing knives there were five more of them four were called after girls whose names he knew from the police files but didnt know personally and the fifth carried the name pamela this bastard kept them like mementoes like photographs of old flames harry could imagine him masturbating over them six weapons in all yes but there were seven velvetlined trays in the drawer found must have the seventh tube with him except it wouldnt have a name yet suddenly harrys vampire awareness warned him of someone in fact more than one entering the main door of the house to creep in the communal corridor outside pounds door ebranch the police both he sent out his thoughts to touch upon their minds another mind stared back at him for a moment then withdrew in shock and horror it had been a middling telepath ebranch again but the others out there were police armed of course heavily the necroscope snarled a silent snarl and felt his face twisting out of its familiar contours for a mad moment he considered standing and fighting why he could even win but then he remembered his purpose in coming here the job still to be finished and conjured a möbius door he went to the frigis express depot emerging from the möbius continuum on to the grass verge where the frigis works exit turned on to an al south access road he was in time to feel the blast of a big articulated truck as it sped by the man at the wheel was just a shadow behind the glassy night sheen of his windscreen but despite the fact that the legend on the side of the truck said only frigis express still it spoke volumes for one leg of the x was missing where the paint had peeled away making it look like eypress johnny pounds lucky charm truck harry came forward to the edge of the road was trapped for a moment in sweeping headlight beams where a large powerful car followed not too far behind the truck intense faces merely glanced at him as the car swept by but there was something about those faces harry reached out and touched their minds police they were after found they still wanted to catch him redhanded or if not that at least on the point of picking up some poor unsuspecting girl fools there was evidence enough in his flat to put him away for not for long enough pamela was right hed probably go into a madhouse and be out again in short order that other party back at johnnys flat in darlington maybe they had broken in by now maybe they knew so if harry wanted the necromancer for himself he was going to have to work fast but then he remembered penny alone in the house in bonnyrig he didnt know how long this was going to take he could simply kill found out of hand of course or cause him to be killed in any number of ways except hed made a deal with pamela trotter and he still wouldnt cheat on the dead also pounds punishment should fit the crime but penny shouldnt be left on her own not for too long theyd killed darcy clarke hadnt they why the fuck was everything so complicated harry felt the tension building felt it swelling until the pressure inside was enormous then gulpingly filled his lungs with the cool night air and took a firm deliberate grip on himself penny had put him first he must put her first he took the möbius route to edinburgh she wasnt in the house harry couldnt believe it hed told her to stay here to wait for him so where had she gone he reached out with his telepathic mind but which direction at this hour of the night where could she have gone why for what reason or had she simply taken trevor jordans advice and walked out on him he let his vampire awareness guide him sent probes into the night spreading outwards like ripples on the surface of a sentient mindpool seeking for penny and found others espers again he snarled at them in their minds and felt the shutters slam into place as they clamped down tight as limpets to rocks when the tide goes out theyd been close but not too close probably in bonnyrig some house theyd made their hq harry passed them by attempted to search further afield came up against mental static that sizzled like bacon frying in his mind it was ebranch scrambling his sendings damn all you mindspies he cursed i should get out and let you all find your own paths to hell but i should leave something behind me to make sure you get there something to give you nightmares for ever he could do it too if he so desired for he had the plague in him this could be his legacy to a world and race which had forsaken him a plague of vampires physically his own vampire was undeveloped immature as yet but its blood was his blood and his bite must surely be virulent and at his command the infinite vastness of the metaphysical möbius continuum why he could plant vampires in every continent in the world right now tonight if he wished it and maybe then they would wish theyd left him the fuck alone he rushed out into his garden under the stars and the risen moon it was night his time ahhh his time but maybe in more ways than one they were here for a reason these espers they could be coming for him right now invisible under their shield of static come then come he taunted them and only see whats waiting for you at the bottom of the garden someone pushed the gate creakingly open harry penny stepped into view and started up the path towards him penny the necroscope reached out to her with his arms and with his mind but her mind was a blur or rather a mist in which her psyche hid without even knowing it mindsmog harry felt devastated but he must hide it now she was a vampire or would be and now she was his thrall it wasnt a crush any longer and he wondered if it ever had been after all he had brought her back from the dead what were you doing out in the night i told you to wait but the night was so beautiful and just like you i needed to think she let him fold her in his arms what did you think about the night lured you you felt the first fires racing in your veins and tomorrow the sun will hurt your eyes irritate your skin i thought maybe you didnt want to take me with you maybe you wouldnt you thought wrong i will i have to for to leave you in this world would be to sign your death warrant but you dont love me oh but i do he lied but it wont matter one way or the other for you wont love me either still well have our lust harry im frightened too late too late i dont want to leave you here now he told her youd better come with me but where he took her into the house ran through the rooms turning on all the lights quickly returned to her and he showed her johnnys knife with her name on it she gasped and drew back from him can you imagine him he asked her his voice dark as a winter night can you picture him looking at this and remembering your pain and his pleasure she shuddered i i thought id forgotten ive tried to forget you will forget he nodded and so will i when its over but i cant leave you here and i have to finish it with him will i see him she turned pale at the thought harry nodded yes his scarlet eyes lit in a strange smile yes and he will see you but you wont let him hurt me i promise then im ready one hour earlier on waverley station in edinburgh trevor jordan had boarded the overnight sleeper for london hed made no plans as such tomorrow morning early he would probably give ebranch a ring and see if he could sniff out which way the wind was blowing and if it felt right hed offer them his services again theyd check him out in the circumstances it was only to be expected and of course theyd want to know all about his experiences with harry keogh but hed make sure that all of that took time and by then harry wouldnt be here any more in the event he was still here jordan would cry off any work that went against him not out of fear but respect and out of gratitude yes and if he was truthful out of fear too harry was harry and a vampire in that respect anyone who didnt feel at least some trace of fear had to be an idiot the telepath had paid for a bed but couldnt sleep there was just too much on his mind he was a man back from the dead and he couldnt get used to it probably never would not even a man who makes a full recovery from a desperate illness could feel like jordan felt for he had gone beyond illness beyond life itselfand returned and it was all down to harry unknown to jordan unknown even to harry himself was the fact that there was a lot more than that down to him for the one thing jordan hadnt taken into account was that harry had been in his mind the necroscope had touched upon his mind fingered it however briefly but enough that hed left his prints there and no way to erase them to ebranch certainly to the two espers who had followed jordan on to the train one a spotter and the other a telepath those prints took the form of a reeking mental mist called mindsmog of course they couldnt probe too deeply because jordan was himself a quality telepath and hed know it indeed gareth scanlon one of the two men who shadowed him had once been jordans pupil brought on by him until his own talent had matured and taken shape jordan would know his mind not to mention his face his voice immediately which was why the two kept well away from him boarded a carriage far down the train on the other side of the buffet car and sat for the first part of their journey with their hats on hiding behind newspapers which theyd already read four or five times but jordan never once headed in their direction or sent a single thought their way he was satisfied just to sit in his sleeper compartment listen to the clatter of the wheels on the tracks and watch the night world roll by beyond his window and be glad he was once more a part of that world without once pausing to wonder for how long as the train slowed down a little for a viaduct crossing between alnwick and morpeth scanlon sat up straighter in his seat and closed his eyes in sudden halffearful concentration someone was trying to get through to him but the thoughts were sharp clean and entirely human with nothing of vampire mindsmog about them it was millicent cleary at the hq in london from where she the minister responsible and the ebranch duty officer were coordinating and running the show she kept it short gareth do you have a sitrep scanlon relaxed his screen of static and gave a brief situation report finishing hes in a sleeper coming all the way into london maybe not she came back it depends how things are going but the minister says we might pull the plug on all three of them very soon now what scanlons concern was obvious also his horror that at any moment he and his colleague might be called upon to kill a man indeed to kill a former friend clearly picked that up a former friend yes but now a vampire and a moment later the minister wants to know is there a problem there wasnt except i mean we are on a train remember we cant very well burn him on the bloody train the train will be stopping in darlington and we already have agents there so be ready for the word you may have to get off the train there and take trevor er jordan with you thats it for now well get back to you scanlon passed the message on to his companion the spotter alan kellway who was one of the branchs more recent recruits i didnt know jordan all that well kellway answered and so have no problem that way all i know is he was dead and now is alive life of a sort and that it isnt natural so well only be restoring the natural order of things but i did know him scanlon shrank down in his seat he was my friend it will be like murder a pyrrhic killing yes kellway put it his way but is it really you have to remember harry keogh jordan and their kind they could murder our entire world yes scanlon nodded thats what i keep telling myself thats what i have to keep telling myself in the möbius continuum johnny pounds unthinkable knife was like a lodestone it pointed in pounds direction rather harrys locator talent pointed the knife and he simply followed where it led penny clung to him with her eyes closed she had looked once but that had been enough the darkness of the möbius continuum seemed solid that was because of the absence of everything material the absence even of time where there is nothing however even thoughts have weight its a kind of magic she whispered as much to herself as to anyone no the necroscope answered but you can be forgiven for thinking it after all pythagoras thought it too at which point expert in the ways of the möbius continuum that he was harry sensed a cessation of motion and knew hed found found forming a möbius door and looking through he saw a hedgerow paralleling a ribbon road that stretched into the distance straight as a ruler vehicles thundered by on the metalled surface their lights strobing the bushes of the hedgerow into a flickering kaleidoscope of yellow green and black and even as harry watched so the frigis express truck whoofed by a short möbius jump took them a mile farther down the road where they exited inside a catwalk spanning the als multiple lane system and a minute later harry said here he comes they gazed down through the walkways windows watched the frigis express truck thunder by beneath them to rumble on down the road as its lights diminished and merged with those of the rest of the night traffic penny asked what now harry shrugged and checked their location boroughbridge is a mile or two further south he said johnny might stop there or might not in any case i dont intend to monitor his progress mile by mile but i do know that somewhere along the line hell call a halt probably at an allnight diner thats his modus operandi right its his venue the hunting ground where he finds his victims women on their own in the dead of night except i dont have to tell you that do i penny shuddered no you dont have to tell me that they looked around on one side of the road was a petrol station on the other a diner harry said im happy now that i can find johnny any time i want him so lets take a break for a coffee ok and i can maybe explain something of how i want to play it she nodded and even managed a shaky smile ok they headed along the walkway towards steps leading down to the cafeteria people were coming up the steps heading down to the petrol station and its car park before they could climb up to the walkways level penny grabbed harrys arm your eyes she hissed harry put on his dark glasses then took her hand lead me he said you know like i was a blind man it wasnt a bad idea from then on in the cafeteria where a handful of travellers were eating people only looked at them once and quickly looked away its a funny thing harry thought but people dont much look at someone with an affliction or if they do they look sideways hah theyd jump sideways if they knew the nature of my affliction but they didnt not all of them anyway on the bank of the river some little way from bonnyrig ben trask and geoffrey paxton stood in the dark of the night under the moon and stars and listened to the gurgle of blackly swirling waters they listened for other things too but heard nothing and they watched they watched the old house across the water the house of the necroscope with all its lights ablaze watched it for movement behind the open groundfloor patio doors for shadows falling on the fabric of the curtains in the upper windows for any sign of life or absence of life undeath and watching it they fingered their weapons trask his submachinegun with a magazine of thirty mm rounds seated firmly in its bluedsteel housing and paxton his metal crossbow loaded with a hardwood bolt under pressure sufficient to hammer through a man like a nail into softwood a mile away on the road into bonnyrig two more ebranch operatives sat in their car waiting they had small talents of their own but werent telepaths neither one of them had ben trasks experience or paxtons zeal but if it became necessary certainly they would be able to do whatever must be done their car was equipped with a radio tuned in on london hq at the moment their job was simply to relay messages and act as backup for the men up front if trask or paxton called them they could pick them up in little more than a minute which at least gave the men on the river bank a feeling of security paxton a little less than trask for he had been here before well trask whispered now taking the telepaths elbow is he in there or isnt he standing close to the very spot where harry keogh had tossed him into the river paxton was nervous the necroscope had warned him that next time that there had better not be a next time and now that time was here and trasks hand still gripped paxtons arm just above the elbow i dont know the telepath shook his head but the house is tainted for sure cant you feel it oh yes trask nodded in the dark just looking at it i can see its not right what about the girl an hour ago she was here definitely the other answered her thoughts were clouded mindsmog yes but readable to a degree shes in thrall to him no doubt about it i thought keogh was here too in fact i was sure he was briefly but now he shrugged telepathy with vampires is a very tricky business to see without being seen and to hear without being heard before trask could answer him or make further comment a tiny red light began to flash on his pocket walkietalkie he extended the aerial and depressed the incomingcall button there sounded the customary wash of background static and then the quiet faintly tinny voice of guy teale saying car here how do you read me ok trask answered him soft and low whats up weve had a call from hq teale came back were to move to final strike locations now situate ourselves from there on in maintain radio and esp silence and wait for the word trask frowned and said we can ready ourselves sure but how will we be able to strike if our target isnt here ask hq that will you without pause teale came back hq says that in the event theres no one in the house when they give the word we remain in situ stay alert and wait to see what happens trasks frown deepened ask them to repeat that will you with some of the blanks filled in i already did teales sigh was clearly audible before i even called you as far as hq knows keogh has the sanderson girl with him and he and she are on to the serial killer likewise we have people on keogh and found within limits that is and also people on trevor jordan on a night train bound for london so well let keogh andor the police settle with found then move on the necroscope the girl and jordan simultaneously wherever they are at that time trask nodded so if our people dont get harry at their end and if he escapes back here well be waiting for him right thats how i see it teale answered trask nodded ok secure the car and come on in on foot meet us at the old bridge ready to cross in ten minutes time then well reorganize split into two pairs and choose vantage points at the front and rear of the house thats all for now be seeing you he pressed the off button paxton nervously scanning all about in the darkness under the trees said do you think teale and robinson will be ok working together i mean im sure well be fine together but they dont strike me as having a hell of a lot of candlepower between them youre probably right trask stared hard at him in the dark of the night disliking everything that he saw and felt especially the fact that every now and then hed feel paxtons talent tugging on the covers of his mind and trying to turn them back so ill team up with teale and you can take robinson paxton turned more fully towards him and his eyes were slightly feral in fleeting moonlight you dont want us to work together paxton let me put you right trask told him the only reason i wanted to work with you up here in the first place was to keep an eye on you see i think youre full of it and its leaking on your attitude so youre right i dont want us to work together in fact id rather work with raw shit paxton scowled and started to turn away make tracks back up to the road but trask caught him by the arm and turned him around oh and theres one other thing mr hugely talented telepath ive about ninety per cent had it with you trying to read my mind when im a hundred per cent pissed youll be the first to know it because after that harry keogh wont be the only one who ever tossed you in a river right paxton was wise enough to say nothing they returned to the road in silence made their way to the old stone bridge over the river and waited for teale and robinson to join them there harry and penny had finished their first coffees half an hour ago now they had seconds which were going cold in their cups penny had tried a cream cake too from which shed taken just one bite she wasnt sure if it was the cake or her mood but since nothing tasted right it was probably her mood every so often the necroscope would reach into his inside pocket and take johnnys hideous steeltube weapon into the palm of his hand penny was aware each time he did it aware that he was touching the instrument of her oncedeath and she shuddered every time finally as harry reached into his pocket yet again she burst out what if he doesnt stop what if he drives clear down to london harry shrugged if it looks like he will then ill let him get as far as he came to a jerky halt as his fingers touched the awful knife and briefly closed his eyes behind their dark lenses when he opened them again his voice had turned cold and taken on a cutting edge but it wont come to that he has stopped now do you know where she clutched his hand he shook his head no the only way to find out is to go there and see oh my god she whispered im going to see the man who murdered me more importantly harry told her hes going to see you and hes going to wonder about you if he reads the newspapers hell know that penny one of the girls he killed had a lookalike called by some peculiar coincidence penny but hell have a hard time believing hes actually happened across her i mean there are coincidences and coincidences if he has any brain at all hell find it a damned suspicious thing it will worry him thats what i want to do worry him i think johnny deserves something of a harrowing time before we evenup the score more permanently we she repeated him it it feels like youre using me harry i suppose i am he answered her allowing her to lead him out of the cafeteria into the night though not as hard as he did he quickly went on and dont tell me thats not fair fair is like beauty it lies in the eyes of the beholder also im not asking you to do much just to be there theres someone else with a much larger part to play maybe youre right she said as he folded her in his arms conjured a door and carried her over the threshold into the möbius continuum about whats fair and whats beautiful i mean and its a fact i dont think there was anything of beauty in johnny no harry answered grimly and nothing fair about him either but me im fair i only take an eye for an eye nightmare junction johnny had stopped at an allservices motorway wateringhole north of newark hed chosen the at rather than the larger ml because its service stations usually had richer pickings not only longdistance truckers and motorists used its facilities but locals too it was johnnys experience that when the town and village dance halls slowed down around midnight the young ones headed this way for a cheap motorway meal after a hard nights drinking dancing and whatever hed stopped here before but no luck as yet maybe tonight on clutch and airbrakes hed snorted and whoofed the big articulated truck around the tarmac until hed found a place to park it where its nose sniffed the exit route it was as well to be able to drive out of such places with as little trouble as possible the place was on a major junction the car park was busy and the lorry park halfempty people came and went in small parties to and from the brightlylit diner johnnys would be just one more face over a plate of chicken and chips and a pint of alcoholfree inside thered been nothing much of a queue at the selfservice bar in a little while johnny had settled at a table in a corner booth where hed toyed with his food and casually looked the place over for a likely female face there were several but they didnt fit his bill too old too drab slackfaced sharpeyed accompanied or stonecold sober a few brighteyed young things yes but all hanging on to flash boyfriends well thats how it went but there were plenty more places just like this between here and london and you never could tell when your luck was going to change he remembered a time when on a lonely stretch of road this bird had roared by in a little red sports job hed bombed after her and forced her off the road into a ditch then told her he was sorry and it was an accident but he would be glad to give her a lift to the nearest i garage oh hed given her a lift all right but not to a garage and then it had been her turn to give him a lift a really good one a real high johnny had been in a weird mood that night after killing her hed chopped a channel up under her jaw and fucked her in the throat shed felt it of course and how the dead bitch had yelped oh shed had cock in her throat before but not coming from that direction thinking about it had got him worked up he must have one tonight but not from this place maybe he should move on and that was when he saw he saw what the shit it wasnt possible but he had to fight with his eyes to keep them from looking in her direction again she was just over there shed just slid her backside on to a seat in a booth close by there was a blind guy there too or a guy in dark glasses anyway but he didnt seem to be with her she had a coffee just a coffee and she was the same as last time she was exactly the same and for a moment johnnys mind whirled for he could swear hed had this one before how can that be he asked himself how can it be and the answer was simple it couldnt be unless this girl was the others twin sister or her double and then he remembered reading something about that in the papers how they thought the one hed had in edinburgh penny that was her name was someone else but then shed turned up alive the spitting image of the one hed screwed murdered and screwed again stranger still the one whod turned up had also been called penny coincidence jesus coincidence but the biggest coincidence of them all here she was right now right here that is unless hed started seeing fucking things slowly johnny looked up from his food through the acidetched fernpatterned glass dividers which loaned the booths a little privacy until her face was directly in his line of vision maybe for a moment he caught her eye but just for a moment and then she looked away the halfblind guy the guy with the eye problem anyway who shared her booth had his back to johnny but he didnt look much anyway slumped over his mug of coffee like that her father maybe no her lover harry keogh answered but silently speaking only to himself her vampire lover you scumbag he had been into pounds mind from the moment he and penny had entered the place and the mental cesspool in there was as rank as anything hed ever come up against together with the necromancers recognition of penny as a former victim or that victims double it strengthened harrys resolve confirmed his commitment but as yet pounds recognition of her hadnt produced the reaction harry had expected curiosity yes but not fear in a way perhaps that was understandable for after all found knew that the other penny was dead he knew that this couldnt be the girl he had violated still his shock had been shortlived and harry was disappointed also he knew now that he was dealing with a very cool customer whether found would be able to stay cool when confronted with what was on the cards for him that was something else entirely leaving johnnys mind the necroscope leaned across the table a little toward penny and quietly said i can see how badly shaken you are i can feel it too im sorry penny but just try to stay calm it wont be long now when found leaves ill go after him youll stay here and wait for me ok she nodded and said you seem very well cold about all of this harry he shook his head just determined but you see found is cold which might give him an advantage if i allowed myself to get too heated as he spoke harry saw two men enter the diner from the car park they seemed ordinary enough but there was something about them as they moved along the selfservice bar collecting cold drinks their eyes scanned the room found the necroscope and penny in their booth moved on harry went on to probe their minds and his telepathic probe at once came up against a wall of mental static he withdrew immediately at least one of these men was an esper which meant ebranch was closing in on both johnny found and harry keogh they probably wouldnt try anything in here maybe not even in the darkness of the car park but in any case harry didnt want them on his trail and theyd obviously figured out that if they followed found theyd find the necroscope too now of all times he really couldnt afford this sort of complication now too he remembered the car hed seen tailing pounds truck out of darlington an unmarked police car with how many men aboard two or three hed thought they were all policemen but now knew better suddenly coming from nowhere he felt a growl rising in his throat his wamphyri side was reacting to the threat aware of pennys gaze he stifled the growl at once harry her voice was concerned youre very pale fury my love theres something i must do he told her it will mean leaving you here but only for a minute youll be ok in here alone with him her eyes were huge and round there are fifty people in here he answered and two of them at least are pretty sharp characters i promise ill be right back she touched his hand and nodded then ill be ok but she avoided looking pounds way harry stood up smiled a robots smile at her and went out into the night at first to anyone watching it would appear that hed been heading for the gents toilets but as he passed close to the swinging glass doors of the exit he turned sharply and pushed through them and as soon as he was outside crouched down breathed a mist and moved wraithlike between the cars ranked like soldiers on the hardstanding his wamphyri senses guiding him he went straight to the unmarked police car and approached it from the rear there was a driver a plainclothes policeman with one elbow on the sill and a cigarette dangling from his lips where he sat silhouetted in a steel frame looking out of his wounddown window into the darkness and breathing the mild night air exuding fog the necroscope moved like a lowslung spider performed a weirdly loping limbo to draw silently alongside the car and then he stood up the policemans jaw fell open in a gasp of astonishment as a shadow coming from nowhere blocked out the stars and flowed over him his cigarette flew as the necroscope hit him once hard enough to send him sprawling across the front passenger seat he was out like a light or like his cigarette which harry ground under his heel then he reached inside the car and snapped the key in half in the ignition so much for that they wouldnt be following johnny or harry anywhere in this car but to be doubly sure he took out pounds steeltube knife and drove it into the wall of a tyre until it hissed air and sagged down on to its rim but as he began to straighten up he glanced into the back of the car and froze the necroscopes eyes were attuned to the night which was his element he could see into the back of the car just as clearly as in broad daylight and there on the back seat a bulky ugly darksnouted shape which harry knew at once a flamethrower and on the floor back there the bluedsteel glitter of a pair of loaded crossbows loaded crossbows harry hissed and crouched down into himself they were ready for him all of them it must be coming soon perhaps sooner than hed anticipated bastards and he was the one whod showed them how he attacked a second tyre and grunted his satisfaction as it collapsed into extinction then moved round the car and did a third following which he paused and drew a ragged breath and forced himself to be calm calm he was trembling but only trembling no more hissing snarling mere moments of violence but they had acted as a safety valve on harrys awful pressure as his mist began to thin he sighed his relief stood more humanly erect put away the knife and headed back towards the diner mere moments less than two three minutes at most but more than sufficient time that the menace of johnny found had got to penny cancelling her former resolve to be ok for she had known from the moment harry left the glass doors swinging behind him and disappeared into the night that she would not be ok not in the same enclosed space as this monster not with fifty or five hundred people around her mere moments yes but enough time for johnny to make up his mind that penny would be the one obviously the guy with the dark glasses hadnt been with her after all and now she was on her own what was more she was aware that johnny was interested he could feel her avoiding his eyes even avoiding his thoughts his existence and suddenly he wondered does she know me but how could she possibly know him what the fuck was going on here anyway he put aside his plate and placed his hands on the table palms down as if to push himself to his feet and all the while he stared at penny willing her to look his way she was looking his way however obliquely and saw him slowly rising all the colour fled from her face as she too rose slid out of her booth backed away from him she collided with a fat man with a tray and sent milk hot food bread rolls flying johnny paced after her smiling a deliberately feigned surprised smile it was as if he were saying whats wrong did i startle you anyone watching would think what on earth is wrong with that girl is she drunk on drugs so pale and that nice young man looking so surprised so astonished and that was the whole thing of it johnny found did look like a nice young man when harry keogh had seen him hed been surprised that he didnt more nearly fit the bill medium height and blocky build blond shoulderlength hair good square teeth in a full mouth with a droopy almost innocent smile only his slightly sallow complexion marred the boynextdoor image that and his eyes which were dark and deepsunken and the fact that he lived in a pigsty and that he was a coldblooded ravager of both living and dead flesh penny blurted an apology to the gaping spluttering fat man where he fingered his milksoaked jacket looked up and saw johnny closing with her turned and fled for the swing doors johnny glanced around at the dozen or so nearby patrons in their booths shrugged and pulled a wry face as if to say a weirdo nothing to do with me folks and calmly walked after her but he was so intent on his act and on following the girl into the night that as he caught the still swinging door on the inswing and passed out through it he didnt see the two sharpeyed men starting to their feet and coming after him outside penny turned frantically this way and that a thin mist lay on the tarmac of the sprawling treebordered car park the headlights of vehicles on the nearby trunk road blinded her where they went scything by she couldnt see harry anywhere but johnny found could see penny and he was right behind her she heard the crunch of gravel on the path leading back to the diners door but didnt dare turn round of course it could be anyone but it could also be him she felt rooted to the spot all of her senses straining to identify what if anything was going on behind her but utterly incapable of turning round and using the most obvious sense of all and god she prayed please let it not be him but it was penny he said sly and yet somehow wonderingly now she turned but with a sort of slowmotion jerkiness like a puppet controlled by a spastic puppeteer and there he was bearing down on her wearing a paintedon smile under eyes that were jetblack and flinthard her heart very nearly stopped she wanted to cry out but could only choke she almost fainted into his arms he caught her up looked quickly all around and saw no one and mine he gurgled glaring into her halfglazed sidewayssliding eyes behind their fluttering lids all johnnys now penny he wanted to ask her questions right now right here but knew she wouldnt hear them she was sliding away from him away from the horror of him into another world escaping into unconsciousness that was a laugh why no way she could escape from johnny not even into death here in front of the diner was the car park behind it was the lorry park and dividing the two a belt of trees with paths between johnny picked penny up hurried with her into the cover of the trees carried her through them light as a child behind him the ebranch spotter and a special branch detective inspector erupted from the diner glanced this way and that saw him hurrying into darkness they came running after him and the necroscope came loping after them harry had heard her cry out not aloud for shed been too terrified to make any sound whatsoever hed heard her in his mind she was his thrall and shed called to him the call had come just as he was leaving the disabled police car and at first he hadnt known what it was but the vampire in him had known he had seen found carrying penny into the screening trees towards the lorry park and hed seen the two men from the diner running after him all of them were moving quickly but not as quick as harry his lope was more wolf more alien than human and he covered ground like the shadow of a fastfleeting cloud under the moon but as he entered the trees on a diagonal course calculated to intercept johnny found and his captive he knew hed made a mistake the trees and the shrubs beneath them were an ornamental screen designed to separate the two car parks and as such they were protected by high wiremesh fences precious seconds were lost as harry came up against a fence cursed and conjured a möbius door in another moment he cleared the belt of trees and emerged on the perimeter of the hardstanding where a reeling gagging figure collided with him and brought him to a halt it was the esper he knew harry at once sensed the awesome power of his metaphysical mind that and the vampire in him and threw up a hand to ward him off the hand was bloody as the gaping wound in his cheek where johnny found had torn a third of his face away harry held him upright snarled at him then thrust him toward one of the paths through the trees go and get help quickly before you bleed to death and as the esper choked out something inarticulate and staggered away the necroscope reached out with his vampire awareness to cover the entire park he found three people at once penny unconscious johnny found furious and bloody and the policeman dead where pounds weapon had crashed through his ear to gouge into his brain harry pinpointed their location conjured a door and ran through it and out again at the rear of the frigis express truck where even now johnny was slamming home the bolt on the roller door at his feet the policeman lay crumpled in a pool of his own blood the left side of his face a raw red pulp the necromancer had taken the policemans gun he sensed harrys presence whirled aimed and fired harry was coming headon he felt a colossal blow as the bullet smashed into his collarbone on the right side spun him round and hurled him down on the tarmac then startled by the explosion and the flash johnny was fumbling the gun and dropping it stumbling across harry he kicked at him where he lay curled up in his pain and running past the trailer toward his trucks cab the madman raved cursed and laughed all in one the pain in harrys shoulder was a living thing that took hold of his flesh with whitehot pincers and twisted it causing him to moan his agony and he thought bastard thing in my blood my mind your fault you berserk headlong idiot very well youve caused me to be hurt now heal me found was in his cab starting up and revving the engine airbrakes hissed and the reversing lights blazed crimson to match harrys eyes or the jelly coagulating on the side of the dead policemans head racked by pain the necroscope saw the huge bulk of the truck jerk shudder and start backing up in another moment a pair of its twinned wheels skidded viciously then gripped and dragged the policemans body under blood and guts gushed as the wheels lifted up barely an inch and the weight of the truck squeezed the corpses innards like toothpaste from a tube hes lucky hes dead harry dazedly unthinkingly thought its something he wouldnt want to happen while he was still alive they were instinctive thoughts shocked out of him by the squelching eruption of brains and shit and flailing guts but they were also deadspeak and the policeman heard him exhaust gases belched in harrys face where he rolled desperately from the path of the reversing truck the scarletdripping wheels missed him by inches but through all the roar and the stink and the mess on the tarmac he heard and was riveted by the policemans answer but i did feel it and god it was like dying twice and harrys blood even his blood froze as he remembered who was driving the truck johnny found necromancer whose actions his victims could feel even as the teeming dead had once felt dragosanis then the airbrakes hissed again and the truck jerked to a halt shuddered started forward turned and rumbled away towards the exit johnny found was making his escape with penny aboard but no you fucking dont harry fixed the trucks location in his mind got to his knees toppled through a möbius door and out again into the refrigerated trailer it was dark in there but that was nothing to the necroscope he saw penny crawled to her put his left hand under her head and drew it into his lap she opened her eyes and looked into his where they blazed harry i i didnt stay in the diner she whispered i know he growled did he hurt you no she shook her head but weakly i i think i just fainted harry had no time to waste not now for his blood was up literally cling to me he said she did as she was told and harry let the möbius equations roll across the computer screen of his mind one moment later and penny felt the awesome immensity of the möbius continuum and in the next gravity returned where they fell prone on to harrys bed in the house outside bonnyrig this time stay here he told her and before she could even sit up he was gone again in the operations room at ebranch hq millicent cleary and the minister responsible sat with david chung who was also the duty officer at one end of a large desk the desk was equipped with a radio receiver a radio telephone standard telephones blownup ordnance survey maps of england under illuminated plastic and a tray containing various small items of property belonging to branch agents in the field spotlights in the ceiling were concentrated on the desk turning it and its immediate surroundings into an island of light in the large rooms comparative darkness millicent cleary had just a moment ago received a brief telepathic message from paxton at the house near bonnyrig stating that the assault team was in position keogh and the girl had been back briefly but paxton was sure that the necroscope was no longer in the house similarly frank robinson the spotter who was paxtons partner on the job believed one of the two was still there since there was no noticeable disturbance of the psychic ether he would guess it was the girl keogh must have used the möbius continuum to drop her off at the house before moving on if thered been any indication that the necroscope himself was still in there then the team would have maintained esp silence but since he wasnt paxton was eager to learn what was happening cleary passed the mindmessage on and the minister responsible gave a snort ive come to the conclusion that youre right about paxton he said all of you i get the feeling he wont be satisfied until hes running the world cleary frowned and nodded ruining it you mean she said sourly then quickly added er sir but we are right and you dont have to be psychic to know it hes a menace were lucky ben trask is up there keeping an eye on him do you want me to tell him anything the minister looked at her also at chung where he busied himself touching and concentrating on his many contact sigils in their tray fathoming the whereabouts mood and feelings of the agents in the field and mentally reviewed the situation the telepath trevor jordan who by all rights and natural laws should be a small heap of ashes in a vase was on a night train heading for london via darlington two ebranch agents were on the same train and didnt anticipate too much trouble even though it was a pretty safe bet that jordan was a vampire they were equipped with powerful automatic weapons and one of them had a small but deadly crossbow another man was on his way to the mainline station in darlington to give them a hand he had a car and in its boot a flamethrower penny sanderson also a resurrected vampire was probably in keoghs house outside bonnyrig the agents up there were again probably as strong a team of espers as ebranch could throw together which they would need to be if or when keogh rejoined the party for the odds were that sooner or later hed go back there for the girl as for the necroscope himself he could be quite literally anywhere but he was probably tracking johnny found his reasons for doing so were all his own but the sanderson girl had been one of pounds victims vengeance why not it seemed the wamphyri had always been big on revenge so if ebranch moved now two of the three targets were good as dead the minister recoiled for a moment shocked by the necessarily cold efficiency of his own thoughts but keogh would still remain the big question mark the pivot on which everything else turned and it would be to everyones advantage literally everyones everywhere if the necroscope could be taken out at the same time as the others sir the girl was still waiting for an answer the minister opened his mouth to speak but at that moment david chung held up a hand and said hold it cleary and the minister looked at the locator his other hand was resting on a zippo cigarette lighter the longtime property of paul garvey a telepath working with the police out of darlington that hand was steady the tips of chungs long fingers motionless where they touched the cold metal but the hand he held up was trembling violently suddenly he snatched back his hand from the tray stepped back a little from the desk in another moment hed recovered himself came forward again and said garvey has been hurt i dont know how but its serious he closed his eyes and his hand hovered a moment over the maps beneath their clear plastic laminate as the small chinamans hand came down to cover a section of the al north of newark the minister turned to cleary can you get hold of garvey ive worked with him lots she was breathless let me try she closed her eyes and concentrated on mental pictures of her fellow esper and got him at once garvey was in fact sending at that very moment but his signal and message were weak garbled distorted by his pain which cleary immediately became heir to she gasped and staggered and for a second lost him then she picked him up again but barely in time before he blacked out and his telepathic thoughts flew into shards in her mind the rush of psychic sendings had not been without images however which shed received even as he was going under she turned to the minister and her features were drawn bloodless pauls face she said its ruined his cheek is hanging in tatters but theres a doctor with him theyre in some sort of motorway cafe i think he was attacked by johnny found but the necroscope was also there and a policeman is dead the minister grabbed her wrist steadied her a policeman dead and keogh was there youre sure she nodded gulped it was in pauls mind a picture of a a bloody hole in a policemans head and another of harry with eyes like red lamps burning in his face chung said garveys somewhere here and he pointed at the map on the al the minister took a deep breath nodded and said this is it its all coming to a head right now keogh might have guessed it all along but by now he must know were after him definitely so while all three of these these creatures are in different locations from which two of them at least cant escape now has to be the best time to move on them he turned to the girl miss cleary er millicent is paxton still waiting get back on to him and tell him to move in now at once then speak to scanlon and tell him the same thing he turned to chung and david but the locator was already busy on the radio speaking to people in darlington meanwhile by the time johnny pounds thundering frigis express truck took the curves on the roundabout at the junction of the al and a outside newark he was much calmer and showing a lot of skill and driving discipline had there been a police patrol car stationed at the roundabout its officers probably wouldnt look twice at him there was no patrol car however just harry keogh using pounds knife the necroscope had followed the trucks progress in a series of short möbius jumps waiting for his quarry to slow down a little before attempting what would have to be an extremely accurate jump on to a moving object directly into pounds cab also it must be accomplished as smoothly as possible so as not to jar harrys badly shattered collarbone the pain of that alone would have left any other man writhing on his back or entirely unconscious but harry wasnt any other man indeed with every passing moment he was a little less a man and more a monster albeit one with a human soul and so as the necromancer straightened up his truck off the roundabout and back on to the al harry emerged from the eternal darkness of the möbius continuum into the empty seat on his left at first found didnt see him or if he did he considered him a shadow in the corner of his eye and harry sat still and quiet in the very corner of the cab pressed against the door with his face and upper body turned towards the driver he kept his eyes threequarters shuttered studying johnnys face which had seemed previously scarcely to match up with any of the descriptions given him by the girls but which he now saw to be very terrible indeed as for johnny himself he knew that it was all over too many people had seen him tonight in the diner the car park with or close to the girl indeed it seemed to him that hed been set up they had traced him then trapped him with a girl who was the image of one of his victims and he had fallen for it well two of the bastards at least had paid for it and the girl would pay too when he climbed into the trailer with her chopped a passage through the orbit of her left eye and fucked her brain these were his thoughts which harry looking directly at him read as clearly as more clearly than the pages of a book and if before there had been any doubt at all in the necroscopes mind that his intended course of action was the right one these were also the thoughts which dispelled it now as johnny dwelled more intimately on the pleasures he intended taking with or from the girl harry very quietly spoke up and said none of those things will happen for the girl isnt in the trailer i freed her as i intend freeing all of the dead from their terror johnny from your tyranny pounds jaw had fallen open at the first word there was a trickle of saliva slime froth in the lefthand corner of his mouth which now ran down under his lip and into the dimple of his chin he said who and his coalblack eyes slowly slid to the left in their deep sockets then stood out like inkblots on the gaunt parchment which until a moment ago had been the flushed bloated flesh of his face youre a goner johnny harry told him and opened his furnace eyes to reflect ruddily on the others paralysed astonished features but pounds paralysis was shortlived and the rest of it his almost immediate response was all instinct so that not even the necroscope could have seen it coming what he gurgled taking his left hand from the wheel and reaching up behind his head for a meathook where it hung from the cabs frame a goner well one of us is thats for sure harrys plan had been simple as found attacked him hed conjure a möbius door and wrestle him through it but it was difficult enough just to take hold of a man in the cab of a truck let alone when he was wielding a meathook johnny had seen the huge bloodstain on harrys jacket and recognized him as the one hed shot back in the diners vehicle park how he came to be in the cab was something else but he surely wouldnt be much good for anything with a gaping hole in his shoulder and even less good when johnny was finished with him whoever you are he grunted swinging the hook youre dead fucking meat the blow was awkward and lefthanded but still harry couldnt avoid it he ducked down a little and the question mark of shining metal passed over his right shoulder swooped down on him and caught in the hole which the bullet had torn out of his back he gasped his renewed agony as found yanked him towards him and glared into his face then using harry as a counterweight the necromancer lifted his left leg reached it across harrys knees and kicked open the cab door and as the truck careened down the twin lanes he kicked again this time at harry himself and simultaneously released his hold on the meathook sliding free of his seat into the rush of night air the necroscope made a desperate grab for the wildly swinging door luckily the window was down as he looped his arms through the frame so his feet slammed down on to the running board johnny could no longer reach him without letting go of the wheel but he could at least try to shake him loose heedless of other vehicles the maniac threw his huge truck this way and that across the lanes and harry hung on like grim death until the thought suddenly occurred why not a big door why not the biggest bloody door you could ever imagine on his left and almost directly under his skidding skittering feet a car was sideswiped and sent spinning crashing through the roadside barrier in a shriek of ruptured metal it smashed into the embankment nose first and exploded like a bomb but the big truck rushed on and left people frying and dying in its wake and in the cab johnny fuelled himself with their pain and knew that even dead they would hear his crazy laughter enough harry thought and conjured his giant door on the road directly in front of the truck the rumble and thunder and rocking violence of the vehicle died away in a moment as it plunged through the möbius door into darkness absolute likewise the mad laughter of johnny found shut off as he delivered a single gonging thought into the aweseome möbius continuum what what indeed the beam of his headlights went on for ever cutting a tunnel through infinity but apart from the headlight beams and the truck where its mass surrounded him there was nothing whatsoever no road no sound no sensation of motion nothing whaaaat johnny screamed again deafeningly in both his and the necroscopes mind but no good shouting now johnny harry told him hanging on the door and guiding the truck aiming it like a missile to its final destination like i said youre a goner and were very nearly there welcome to hell johnny let go of the wheel and sprawled across the wide seat reaching for the necroscope where he clung to the door of the cab but too late they were there harry conjured another door in front of the truck and pushed himself free slowing his motion to an abrupt halt and the truck went rushing on out of the möbius continuum to emerge inches over the surface of a narrow road it crashed down bounced rocked and roared and as its freespinning tyres found purchase on the tarmac so it rocketed forward johnny screamed as he saw the sharp bend coming up where the road skirted a long high wall of ivyclad stone he made a desperate grab for the steering wheel but the truck had already mounted the kerb it shot across a narrow strip of grass tore through a mass of nightblack shrubbery slammed into the wall and stopped stopped dead but not johnny as the truck and its trailer concertinaed as the wall cracked and sent stone debris flying as massive petrol tanks shattered and showered fuel on to hot tortured metal turning the truck into a blazing inferno so johnny was ripped out of his drivers seat and hurled through the windscreen bones in his left arm and shoulder broke where pinwheeling he hit the top of the wall before crushing down on to something hard far on the other side there was pain more pain than hed ever known and then apart from flickering firelight from beyond the wall and a booming whooshing explosion as the emergency tank blew there was a deafening silence the silence of mental concentration of knowing even through waves of agony that someone several pitiless someones were watching him he cranked his neck up an inch from where sharp gravel chips stuck to the tattered mess of his face and saw harry keogh standing there looking down on him and behind the redeyed necroscope there were other people things anyway which johnny knew should never be they came crawled staggered crumbled forward and one of them was or had once been a girl johnny backed off pushing with his raw hands sliding on his belly and his knees skidding in the bloodied gravel until he collided with something hard which brought him up short he somehow turned his head and looked back and saw what had stopped him a headstone a a fucking graveyard he gasped and harry keogh said end of the road johnny pamela trotter said you kept your promise harry and he nodded and johnny found necromancer knew what had passed between them no he gasped then screamed noooooooo he would get to his feet even broken shattered cut to ribbons he would flee from the hell of it but pamelas dead friends fell or flopped on him and bore him down and a hand that shed rotting flesh and maggots stoppered his mouth then she came to him and searched among his rags until she found his new knife and close up like that badly gone into corruption though she was even with the flesh beginning to slough from her face still he knew her you remember that good time we had she said you didnt even say thanks johnny and you didnt leave me anything to remember you by well now i think its time i had me a small memento or even a big one eh something i can take back down into the earth with me right she showed him his own knife and smiled at him and her teeth were long where the blackened gums had shrivelled back from them harry turned away and shut out the sight shut out pounds silent frenzied shrieking too from his mind but to pamela he said make sure you kill him except too late she was weeping her frustration or rather too soon damn the bastard harry but hes already died on me harry sighed his relief and thought just as well she heard him and a moment later agreed yes i suppose it is shit i didnt want to dirty my hands on this filth anyway and now pounds deadspeak reached out to both of them to harry and to pamela what is this where am i who is it out there neither one of them answered him but the sheer weight of harrys presence impressed itself on pounds mind like a light shining in through the stretched membrane of shuttered eyelids he knew that harry was there and that he was special its you right he said the guy with the dark glasses with some kind of magic you brought me here with your magic right harry knew that pamela would probably never speak to johnny found neither pamela nor any other of the outraged great majority instead of taunting the necromancer theyd merely shun him lock him up or out like a leper so maybe harry shouldnt speak to him either but simply go away and perhaps that would be the most merciful thing to do except harry had a less than merciful thing inside him which now caused him to speak up you had the same magic johnny he said or you could have had you could speak to the dead could have trained yourself as i did to converse with them and befriend them but no you chose to torture them instead found was quick to catch on so now im one of them right im dead and you did it to me but just answer me this why harry could have explained that hed needed to focus his wamphyri passions on something to have something to let them loose on rather than people who were previously his friends which was to say ebranch and the world in general he could have explained but didnt for his vampire wouldnt let him found had been the cold cruel uncaring one in life death should be a cold cruel place too and just as uncaring an eye for an eye why did i kill you harry shrugged began to turn away hey fuckface found shouted after him defiant furious even in death that doesnt cut it you had your reasons sure enough because of the dead shit who gives a fuck for the dead so come on tell me why and so coldly cruelly and uncaringly harry told him youre right he said no one gives a fuck for the dead and you johnny youre dead you want to know why and again he shrugged well why the fuck not the vampire killers even though the great majority no longer trusted him harry had always respected them he thanked pamela and those of her friends who had assisted in bringing johnny found to justice and as they commenced their arduous return to what would now be their final resting places so the necroscope employed his metaphysical minds fantastic equations and materialized a möbius door but in the moment before he stepped through it an agonized voice not deadspeak but telepathy which even as he received it changed to deadspeak reached out to him from a deserted stockyard not far from the mainline station in darlington it was trevor jordan alive at first then dead turning to fused flesh bubbling blood and charred blackened bone as a squad of former ebranch colleagues torched him to sticky steaming cinders trevor harry gasped his own agony almost as great as the telepaths as he received the full searing impact of his final seconds trevor im coming right now just keep talking and ill find no jordan cut him off as all the pain of a life at its termination faded away and deaths cool darkness crashed over him laving him like an ocean wave no harry dont dont come here theyre expecting you and believe me they have the right gear and anyway you have no time the girl harry the girl the necroscope understood of course penny the branch had been closing in on him they had closed in on jordan they would close in on penny and theyd be doing it even now trevor harry was torn felt himself riven two ways a secondary agony of frustration and indecision but jordan was right no one should be put to such an agonizing death and certainly not an innocent jordan had been just such a one and so was she no matter what name anyone gave her now or what she would be tomorrow tonight she was an innocent you cant help me harry jordan told him trying to make it easier for him not this time you can only jeopardize your own safety and pennys but its ok its ok i lived twice which was enough and dying twice was that was too much i dont need any more in the möbius continuum harry still felt himself dragged apart pulled two ways he moaned his horror and his anger as he deliberately shut jordans deadspeak thoughts out of his mind later maybe later hed have time to thank him for the warning but as for now bonnyrig he emerged along the river bank well away from the house emerged to a darkness shot with the crimson of his fury wamphyri fury the thing within held sway its awareness washed out from the necroscope like human like inhuman radar scanning the house standing in darkness except when harry left here the lights were ablaze harrys telepathy was carried on his vampire probe in the house five people five warm beings full of blood five clever thinking creatures and four of them possessed of wild weird talents but nothing so weird as harrys his metaphysical mind touched upon their minds but guardedly so that they wouldnt suspect penny first terrified for her life but as yet unharmed then guy teale an as yet undeveloped seer given on occasion to glimpsing the future which harry well knew was an unwieldy unforgiving talent at best and frank robinson a spotter with the ability to recognize another esper on sight or even in close proximity his mind flinched a little when harry touched it but not enough that the necroscopes presence was revealed robinsons talent too was as yet embryonic but then ah then there was ben trask a sad thing harry had hoped thered be no old friends here but here was ben and finally paxton paxton the mindflea the previously unreachable itch a vampire no less than harry himself who scorned the blood of others for the secret juices of their minds their very thoughts and indeed paxton was something else keen beyond the call of duty zealous to a fault vicious as the crossbow he even now held on penny sanderson in the necroscopes bedroom so that quick as harry was to withdraw his probe still he wasnt quick enough and paxton knew he was there the telepath at once narrowed his eyes and quietly with a shiver in his voice called downstairs hes close hes coming in the spacious front room of the house which had served mainly as harrys study whose french windows looked out over a garden descending in shallow terraces to a high wall and the river bank beyond ben trask and guy teale received paxtons hushed warning and acknowledged it with tightlipped glances and cramped edgy movements moon and starlight were their only sources of illumination which in itself was a mistake on their part their eyes had needed to adjust to the darkness and even now worked inefficiently in the rooms gloom but the necroscopes every sense was already adjusted the night was his element it was the same for those upstairs as for trask and teale their only light was that of the moon creeping into harrys bedroom through a window with the curtains thrown back but downstairs teale felt harrys presence touched ben trasks elbow and husked paxtons right hes close and my god i suddenly realize what were doing here ben what if he comes here right to this room you do nothing trask answered gruffly you hold that crossbow on him and do nothing you give me a chance to talk to him is all but if i dont get that chance or if you yourself are threatened then you shoot and you shoot for real the heart is that understood it was now be quiet watch and listen outside in the garden mist crawled through the gate in the wall where it hung on rusted hinges milky tendrils covered the lower terraces and lapped along the paths and trask knew well enough what that meant harry made a möbius jump from the river bank beyond the gate and emerged with his back to the wall of the house just to one side of the open french windows he listened and could hear the breathing of the two men in the room could feel their very heartbeats one of them was ben trask but penny wasnt with them she was upstairs and so was paxton jesus teale panted the short hairs rising at the back of his neck hes here i know he is and ive just seen a lot of trouble a whole load of pain for one of us trask cocked his smg he took two paces out through the french windows and stood ankledeep in mist looking this way and that about the night garden but he failed to look up he backed into the room and said trouble pain for me you who for for fucks sake paxton teale hissed for paxton trask turned horrified eyes to the ceiling paxton robinson and the girl were upstairs harry owed paxton one maybe several and that vicious little bastard was holding his woman up there trask had worked out with entirely human logic that like any ordinary adversary the necroscope would enter the downstairs rooms first which was the main reason hed sent paxton upstairs to keep harry safe for a little while anyway long enough that trask could maybe talk to him and make sure he got whatever breaks were due him but harry wasnt any ordinary adversary and trask might have guessed he wouldnt work that way hed work his way which was unique but paxton was in charge up there and robinson had a bloody flamethrower upstairs trask gasped lets go now harry too had decided that it was time upside down above the high window of his bedroom he used the great webbed sucker discs of his hands to cling to the pitted wall of the house and lowered his head to look in a cloud scudding over the moon obscured the small shadow which his head cast he glanced inside for a moment only then withdrew but adding together what he saw and the thoughts of those inside he now had a complete picture and before anyone or thing could move or do anything to change that picture he acted he relaxed his hold on the wall conjured a door and fell through it into the bedroom robinson knew it at once hes here the spotter yelped spinning on his heel jumping and gyrating trying to aim the hot nozzle of his flamethrower in every direction at the same time but seeing and aiming at nothing paxton knew it was true he could actually feel the necroscopes mind touching his own like an oozing slug as close as that but inside the room nothing seemed to have changed and from downstairs the voices of trask and teale were hoarse where the two came running thundering through the house and up the stairs shouting their warnings where paxtons voice was a screech of terror where is the bastard he and robinson faced each other paxton looked down the glowing muzzle of robinsons flamethrower into the flicker of its pilot light and robinson stared at the business end of paxtons crossbow they both reached for the light switch penny was in the bed naked a sheet pulled up under her chin around her neck and harry was under the sheet with her where hed materialized not knowing what was happening she felt his arms go around her felt his huge webbed discs restructuring themselves into hands once more and screamed paxton read her mind robinson finally pinpointed harrys vast esp talent as the room came alive with electric light both men turned towards the bed and triggered their weapons but harry had already conjured a door directly under himself and the girl so that they tumbled through it and apparently through the bed itself as they went he dragged the bedsheet after them in the möbius continuum penny opened her eyes then gasped and screwed them shut again but now that she knew who had her it was ok harry took her to a safe place wrapped the sheet around her grated stay here be quiet wait and as she sat down with a breathless bump in the shade of a windcarved tree on a deserted midday australian beach so he returned to the house he had to go back for hed been challenged paxton had challenged him ignored his warnings and challenged him and harrys vampire was furious in an upstairs room in the house outside bonnyrig the necroscopes bed roared up in fire and smoke with paxton and robinson dancing like maniacs around it trying to damp down the flames but already they knew that harry and the girl had escaped trask and teale came crashing through the door and the latter took one look turned white and backed right out of the room again trask went after him and grasped his arm what did you see teales mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water he hes coming back again he finally gasped and hes mad as hell trask stuck his head back inside the smokefilled bedroom paxton robinson out of there now but the house is burning robinson yelled thats right trask shouted back and all the way to the ground well torch it downstairs heavily every room raze the place its one refuge he wont be able to use again and to himself sorry harry but thats the way of it except it wasnt entirely to himself for the necroscope was listening too listening with his mind and watching with his scarlet eyes from across the river where a minute later he heard the gouting roar of the flamethrower and saw the fire spreading through all the downstairs rooms and my place harry thought and there it goes in flames this is the end of it theres nothing to keep me here now in harrys downstairs study paxton turned on trask and his face was livid just what is it youre trying to do he demanded you know he wont come into a burning house teale says keogh wants me and robinson reckons hes close but you youre holding him off he has to come to us before we can kill the bastard or maybe thats it maybe you dont want him killed right trask grabbed him by the front of his jacket and almost lifted him off his feet you shithead he dragged him into the garden out of the blazing room you scumbag no i dont want harry killed for he was my friend still id do it if i had to but thats ok for in fact i dont think we can kill him not you and me or an army like us you ask why im warning him off for you paxton for you for me the other struggled free loaded his crossbow damned right trask snarled for while you cant kill harry keogh youd better fucking believe he can kill you the downstairs rooms of harrys house were a red and yellow inferno now and smoke had started to pour from the upper windows and ancient gables in the garden as the glass in the french windows surrendered to the heat and began to shatter the four ebranch agents backed away paxton suddenly anxious stared this way and that in the glare and flicker of firelight and held his crossbow close to his chest the high garden walls seemed to frown on him and he stumbled as his shuffling feet missed a step to send him reeling down a path into the kneedeep mist of the lower terraces that eerily sentient mist out of which harry keogh rose up like a ghost from its tomb with his hellish orbs more than reflecting the destruction of his house nuhuhurgh paxtons eyes stood out in the parchment of his face as the necroscope towered over him and his inarticulate gurgle of a cry caused the other agents to turn from watching the burning house towards him in his extremity of terror what they saw was this paxton in the grip of something which was only half or less than halfhuman they saw paxton but only as a detail of the main scene whose utter horror seemed to sear itself on to their retinas and in the minds of the three one thought was universally uppermost that they were here as volunteers come to kill this an act which must surely qualify them as the bravest or most lunatic heroes of all time the lower half of harrys figure was mistshrouded visible only as a vague outline in the opaque milky swirl but the rest of him was all too visible he was wearing an entirely ordinary suit of dark illfitting clothes which seemed two sizes too small for him so that his upper torso sprouted from the trousers to form a blunt wedge framed by his jacket which was held together at the front barely by one straining button the wedgeshaped bulk of harrys rib cage was massively muscular his white opennecked shirt had burst open down the front revealing the ripple of his musclesheathed ribs and the deep powerful throb of his chest the shirts collar stuck up now from harrys jacket like a crumpled frill made insubstantial by the corded bulk of his leaden neck his flesh was a sullen grey dappled lurid orange and sick yellow by leaping fire and gleaming moonlight but there was scarlet there too leaking from the hole in his jacket and splashed diagonally across his straining shirt he towered all of fifteen inches taller than paxton whose cringing form he quite literally dwarfed and his face that was the absolute embodiment of a waking nightmare ben trask gawped at him in utter disbelief and thought oh my good god and i thought i could maybe talk to that oh but you can still talk to me ben the necroscope told him trasks first personal experience in the use of telepathy made possible through the sheer power of harrys probe its just that where paxtons concerned i may not be willing to listen thats all teale was gibbering trying desperately to find strength to lift and aim his crossbow and failing his talent a generally untrustworthy ability to read something of the future was conjuring all sorts of monstrous events in his minds eye piling them up so thick and fast that he was utterly unnerved it was his proximity to harry of course robinson was similarly stricken this close to a true metaphysical power his own small talent was reacting like an iron filing whirled in a strong magnetic field but in any case he couldnt use his terrible weapon not without burning paxton too trask was on his own the only capable one among them and now he raised and aimed his smg at harry where he held paxton up before him like a rag doll paxton dangling there in midair staring gapejawed and bulgeeyed into the necroscopes unbelievable face knowing he was only inches from the gates of hell that close yes for he was the mindflea he was the unbearable unscratchable itch or he had been until now harry looked at him through halogen halloween eyes which seemed to drip sulphur looked at him and grinned a grin was that what it was in an alien vampire world called starside on the other side of the möbius continuum there at least it might be called a grin but here it was the rabid slavering grimace of a great wolf here it was teeth visibly elongating curving up and out of gleaming gristle jawridges to shear through gums which spurted splashes of hot ruby blood here it was the gradual inclination of a monstrous head through several degrees to an almost curiously inquiring angle the way you might look at a mischievous pet and having looked it was a writhing of scarlet lips a flattening of convoluted snout the beginning of a slow yawning of mantrap jaws to tuttut and even chastise that disobedient lap dog and perhaps to punish it that face that mouth that crimson cavern of stalactite stalagmite teeth jagged as shards of white broken glass what the gates of hell all of that and worse when harry had grabbed paxton and lifted him off his feet hed knocked the telepaths crossbow from his grasp and thrown it down unarmed paxton was a piece of candy a sweetmeat a coconut flake he was something to munch on why harry could bite his face off if he wished it and suddenly trask thought maybe he does maybe he will harry trask shouted dont the necroscope slowly closed his jaws looked up he glared at trask across the misted garden in the ruddy illumination of the burning house at ben trask once a friend with whom hed stood side by side against against just such a creature as he had now become and trask wheyfaced staring back thinking for fucks sake dont harry would you shoot me ben you know i would i wouldnt want to even now but id have to its you or the world dont you see i dont want to see my world die screaming then laugh and crawl right back out of its grave but if you let him go paxton i mean if you let him live then id be ready to believe youd let us all live your world is safe ben im not staying here starside harrys mental shrug theres nowhere else trask looked down the sights of his smg he could shoot at harrys mistwreathed legs and maybe chop him down or he could aim at the necroscopes head and upper body and try not to hit paxton into the bargain but he was a good shot and unlikely to miss his target or he could simply take harrys word for it that he was going away from here and the world had nothing to fear from him except looking at him now who could believe that harry read these things in trasks mind and tried to make it easier for him he put paxton down which was anything but easy for the necroscope he had to fight the thing inside him and fight hard but he did it and speaking out loud or rather grunting in the deep bass monotone of the wamphyri he asked hows this ben trask gasped his relief its good harry its good but even answering he was aware out of the corner of his eye of teale and robinson unfreezing and lining up their weapons hold it you two he shouted harry shot a bloodtinged glance at teale which sufficed to send him staggering back and tuned into robinsons mind to advise him better listen to trask son try to fry me on earth and ill fry you in hell trask put his smg on safe and tossed it aside the wars over harry he said but paxton lying in the mist where harry had dropped him squeezed the trigger of his regained crossbow and cried oh no it fucking isnt moments earlier the necroscope had picked up the message from paxtons mind that a deadly hardwood bolt was about to come winging his way almost instinctively he had conjured a möbius door and now with the deceptively sinuous grace of the wamphyri he stepped or flowed backwards into it to the four espers it seemed that he had simply ceased to be paxtons bolt shot forward into the misty swirl of harrys vacuum and was eaten up by it leaving the telepath panting i got him i im sure i got the bastard i couldnt miss laughing however shakily he got to his feet and the mist where it had closed on the necroscope opened up again and his clotted gurgling disembodied voice came out of it saying how sorry i am to have to disappoint you shit trask thought snatching a breath of hot smoky air as a huge grey hand with nails like rustscabbed fish hooks reached out of empty space closed over paxtons head and dragged him shrieking out of the garden and right out of this universe and harry keoghs monstrous voice left hanging on the air saying ben im afraid i just have to do this in the möbius continuum harry hurled paxton away from him and heard his scream dwindling into conjectural distances he should leave him there let him spin on his own axis flailing across parallel infinities for ever shrieking and sobbing and if his heart should burst finally dying a raving madman but that would be to pollute this mystical place there had to be a better way a more reasonable punishment than that he sped after him caught and steadied him and drew him close and there in the möbius continuum whose nature even harry was only just beginning to suspect or understand where even the smallest thought has weight he said to him paxton youre a miserable creature get away from me get the fffuck away from me tsk tsk harry sucked his teeth which as his blood began to cool were halfway to normal again and you a telepath you dont need to shout in the möbius continuum mindflea just thinking it is enough and in that selfsame moment harry knew what he must do of course paxton the mindflea the mental vampire who lived on the thoughts of others rather than their blood the thoughtthief the unscratchable itch how many victims had felt his bite ebranch was full of them and how many more didnt even know werent equipped to know that hed ever been into their minds in the first place or maybe not a flea maybe a mosquito but in any case a harmful parasite with a painful irritating sting it was high time someone drew that sting and the necroscope knew just exactly how to do it he entered paxtons dazed terrified mind to search for and discover the telepathic mechanism which was the source of the mans talent it was something paxton had been born with and there was no switching it off but it could be shielded buried in psychic lead like a rogue reactor until it melted down or burned itself out trying to break free which was precisely what the necroscope did he wrapped paxtons talent in essence of wamphyri mindsmog smothered it in a blanket of espopaqueness mothballed it in ephemeral and yet almost unbreakable threads of what ordinary people term the privacy of their own minds except that in paxtons case the privacy would be his prison and when harry was done with him then he delivered paxton back to the garden of the burning house where the men from ebranch had moved down to the river wall away from the heat of the conflagration against a backdrop of roaring gouting gold and crimson fire harry emerged from the möbius continuum and tossed a snivelling paxton into ben trasks arms the telepath at once collapsed in tears sank raggedly to his knees and hugged trasks legs looking down at him trask was aghast what have you done to him neutered him said harry what harry shook his head not his balls his telepathy mental emasculation hes raped his last mind and where the branch is concerned ive done you my last favour harry look after yourself ben harry wait but the necroscope was no longer there he stood off for long moments along the river and watched the old house burn what was it faéthor ferenczy had called his castle in the khorvaty when finally that morbid pile had been reduced to rubble his last vestige on earth well and this obsolete old house had been harrys last vestige in this world anyway on a beach of gleaming white sand on the other side of the world penny had fashioned a bikini for herself from strips of harrys bedsheet now walking at the rim of the ocean she picked up and examined exotic shells where they littered the tides reach strangely because she usually tanned without difficulty and also because her as yet innocent mind hadnt recognized the significance of it she found the sun spiteful her exposed skin was already blotched and rapidly turning red to cool herself she kneeled in the shallows of a tidal pool and let the sea lave her which was when harry returned and called out to her from the shade of the windblasted tree she looked up and saw him and felt the power of his magnetism stronger than ever before it was love and it was much more than love he need only command it and there was nothing she wouldnt do for him she was entirely enthralled taking a magnificent conch with her she ran to him and saw how different he looked different and yet the same before returning to her the necroscope had stopped off somewhere to pick up a widebrimmed black hat and a long black overcoat weird gear penny thought for a beach in the heat of the midday sun now he reminded her of the grimfaced bounty hunter or undertaker in how many of those old spaghetti westerns except they hadnt worn darktinted glasses where the tree gave its maximum shade harry eased off his coat and displayed evidence of his wounds great mats of blood congealed into rusty scabs which crusted his tatters and glued them to him feeling his hurt indeed feeling more of it than he felt penny unwrapped the strip of soaked cotton sheet from her breasts and dampened the necroscopes bloodied areas with brine and then she was able to peel the soiled rags from his now entirely human body his humanlooking body anyway from the front the bullet hole in harrys right shoulder didnt look too bad but from the back it was awful a chunk of flesh the size of a childs clenched fist had been blown right out of him and its rim at the top had been ripped by johnny pounds hook but amazingly to penny if not to the necroscope himself the wound was already healing new skin was forming around the crater where flesh and bone had been blasted away and while the pulp within gleamed red as meat on a butchers block still it had almost stopped bleeding its healing now harry grunted if you just sat there and watched it youd see it closing up another day two at most and therell be only a scar another week and even the restructured bone will have stopped aching fascinated drawn to him irresistibly she clutched his shoulders and turned her lithe lovely body this way and that brushing her breasts against the gaping hole in his back done on impulse her eroticism caused the necroscope a little pain and gave him a lot of pleasure looking over his shoulder he saw the brown of her nipples stained red by blood fresh from his body but in the next moment astonished by the strength of her own sensuality penny said ii dont quite know why i did that i do he growled taking her there on the sand and in turn being taken again and again through the long hot afternoon it was love and lust and what lovers have done since the beginning of time but it was other than that more than that it was an initiation of sorts for harry as much as for penny and it proved beyond a doubt how utterly inexhaustible are the wamphyri and their thralls later she woke up feeling chilly saw harry sitting there with her shell in his lap his face was gaunt almost pained the sun setting over the rolling ocean highlighted the rims of hollows in his face like shallow craters in a moonscape squinting her eyes until he was little more than a dark silhouette penny tried to make this newly perceived harry less stark the toodistinct lines melted a little and softened his face but the pain was still there then when he felt her eyes on him the mood was broken and when she sat up shivering he draped her with his coat picking the shell up she said its beautiful isnt it he gave her a strange look its a dead thing penny is that all you see death no he shook his head i feel it too im the necroscope you feel that the shell is dead he nodded and how the creature it housed died well not feel it exactly i experience it no not that either he shrugged and sighed i just know she looked at the conch again and the sun struck motherofpearl from its iridescent rim it isnt pretty he shook his head its ugly do you see that tiny hole toward the pointed end she nodded thats what killed it another snail smaller but deadly deadly to it bored into it and sucked out its life a vampire yes there are millions of us and she saw him give a shudder she put the shell aside thats a horrid story harry its also a true one how can you know that his voice was harsher now because im the necroscope because dead things talk to me all dead things and if they havent the mind for it then they convey to me and your pretty bloody shell it conveys the slow grind of its killer eating into its whorl the penetration of its probe and the dully burning seep of its fluids being drained off pretty its a corpse penny a cadaver he stood up and scuffed listlessly at the sand and she said has it always been like that for you i mean no he shook his head but it is now my vampire is growing as he grows sharper so he hones my talents there was a time when i could only talk to dead people or rather to creatures i could understand dogs go on after death just like we do did you know that but now again his shrug if they were alive once but now are dead i can feel them and i feel more and more of them all the time he kicked at the sand again you see this beach the very sand sighs and whispers and moans a million billion corpses broken up by time and the tides all of that life wasted and none of it ready or willing to lie quiet and still and every dead thing wanting to know why did i die why did i die but it has to be that way she gasped frightened by his tone it always has been without death what would be the point of life if we had forever we wouldnt strive to do anything because everything would be possible in this world he took her shoulders theres life and theres death but i know another world where theres a state between the two and as it grew dark he told her all about starside when he was done she shivered to the inevitability of it and asked when shall we go there soon he told her we cant stay here i know that place is bound to frighten me do my eyes frighten you they were like small lamps in his face she smiled no because i know theyre your eyes but they frighten others because they dont know you on starside ill build an aerie harry told her where your eyes will be as red as mine will they she seemed almost eager oh yes harry told her and to himself you may be sure of it you poor darling child for even here and now as early and unanticipated as this he could detect the faintest scarlet flush in them while she slept in his arms harry sat and made plans they werent much just something to do they kept him from thinking too deeply about his and pennys imminent departure its possible perils about its inevitability for it was inevitable as was the drone of the helicopter whose searchlights came sweeping along the beach from the east harry had thought theyd be safe here for oh a long time but as he reached out and touched the minds of the people in the droning dragonfly airplane he saw that hed been wrong they were espers the branch he said perhaps bitterly waking penny up and forming möbius equations in his mind what even here she mumbled as he shifted her across the continent to a clothing store in sydney even here there yes he said indeed anywhere their locators will find me no matter where i go theyll alert their contacts worldwide espers and bounty hunters will track and trap and eventually burn us we cant fight a whole world and even if i could i dont want to because to fight is to surrender to the thing inside me and id prefer to be just me for as long as possible anyway but tonight well lead them all a dance right for tomorrow we die die well be dead to this world anyway he said they chose expensive clothes willynilly and an expensive leather suitcase in which to pack them then as the stores alarms began to clamour they moved on it had been pm local time when they left the beach it was in the store they robbed moving east they got dressed on another beach long beach at am in the first light of dawn and started a champagne breakfast in new york a little after am and all in the space of thirty or so minutes penny ate her steak barbecued medium rare harrys was so rare it dripped blood just the way hed ordered it they drank three bottles of champagne when presented with the bill the necroscope laughed snatched penny into his lap tilted his chair over backwards and the pair of them out of this world into the möbius continuum minutes later at pm local time and some three and a half thousand miles north of where theyd started out they robbed the innermost security vaults of the bank of hong kong and by midnight theyd lost a million hong kong dollars on the gaming tables in macau a few minutes later at in the evening local still ordering and drinking champagne harry bundled an entirely tipsy penny into a hotel bed in nicosia and left her there to sleep it off she dripped pearls and diamonds and her skin smelled of a fine haze of alcohol most women were they truthful would give an entire world for the things she had seen and done and experienced in the last halfday of her life on earth so had penny given a world thats why harry had arranged and executed it their binge had taken a little over three hours the locators at ebranch hq in london and others in moscow were quite dizzy but the necroscope knew that penny was as yet too weak a source for them to track as a single entity on her own they probably wouldnt be able to find her even if they could he doubted if theyd have a man in cyprus shed be safe there for a little while anyway and now it was time he made their starside reservations part four faéthor zek perchorsk in the möbius continuum harry opened a futuretime door and went looking for faéthor ferenczy faéthor was long dead and gone and had been incorporeal which is to say bodiless for a very long time so long that by now he was probably mindless too but there were things of great importance which the necroscope wanted to ask him about harrys disease and how hed come by it maybe even about how he could cure it though that possibility seemed almost as remote as faéthor himself möbius time was awesome as ever before launching himself down the everexpanding timestream harry paused framed in the doorway and looked out on humanity as few fleshandblood men had ever seen it and then only on his authority he saw it as blue light the nearneon blue of all human life rushing out and away with an interminable sigh an orchestrated angelic ahhhhhhhhh into forever and ever but the sigh was all in his mind indeed he knew that it was his mind sighing for time is quite silent which was just as well for if all the sound in all the years of all the life he witnessed had been present then it would have been an utterly unbearable cacophony he stood or floated in the metaphysical doorway and gazed on all those lines of blue light streaming out and away the myriad lifelines of the human race and thought its like a blue star gone nova and these are its atoms fleeing for their lives and he knew that indeed every dazzling line was a life which he could trace from birth to death across the tractless heavens of möbius time for even now his own lifeline unwound out of him like a thread unwinding from a bobbin to cross the threshold and shoot away into the future but where the rest were pure blue his own thread carried a strong crimson taint as for faéthors line if it existed at all it would be pure impure scarlet but it didnt for faéthors life was over no life now for that ancient onceundead thing but true death where he sped on and on beyond the bounds of being all thanks or whatever to harry keogh bodiless yes the old vampire but still the necroscope knew how to track him for in the möbius continuum thoughts have weight and like time itself go on for ever faéthor harry called out sending a probe lancing ahead as he launched himself down the timestream id like to pay you a visit if youre in the mood for it oh the answer came back at once and then astonishingly a chuckle one of faéthors most dark most devious chuckles a meeting of two old friends eh and is it visiting day well and why not but truth to tell ive been expecting you you have harry caught up with faéthors spirit with the memory the mind which was all that remained of him oh yes for who else would know the answer if not me eh the answer but harry knew well enough what he meant the answer the solution to his problem assuming such a solution existed come come faéthor tuttutted am i naive call me what you will harry but never that and now he gave a deadspeak nod and looked the necroscope over well well but you know you never fail to amaze me i mean so many talents and now this fasterthanlife travel why lookyouve even outstripped yourself even as faéthor spoke harrys lifeline gave a wriggle a shudder and split down the middle half of the line bent back a little on itself and shot off at rightangles to the necroscopes line of travel shortly to disappear in a brilliant burst of red and blue fire but the other half like a comet with harry himself for its nucleus sped on as before and kept pace with faéthor harry had been expecting some such the phenomenon hed just witnessed which in fact had been his departure point for starside was in the probable future but this was möbius time which is to say speculative time and nothing was for certain it was the reason why reading the future was so very hit and miss for if in the real world anything contrary should happen to him between now and then his departure simply wouldnt happen or possibly not in other words and despite the fact that hed seen it it was only something which might happen but probably said faéthor and again he chuckled so theyre driving you out eh no harry shrugged im going of my own free will because if you stay theyll hunt you down and destroy you because i will it harry repeated you brought yourself into prominence said faéthor and they looked at you closely now they know you for what you are all of these years youve been their hero and now youre their worst nightmare come true and so its back to starside well good luck to you but mind you look out for that son of yours why the last time you were there he crippled you before continuing their conversation harry very carefully shielded his mind only show faéthor the tiniest crack in the door and hed be in not only to spy on the necroscopes most secret thoughts but to lodge himself in his mind as a permanent tenant it was the ancient vampires one chance his very last chance for any sort of continuity other than this empty endless speeding into the future and so when harry was satisfied that hed made himself impregnable yes my son crippled me he agreed robbed me of my deadspeak denied me access to the möbius continuum it was easy for him then because i was only a man but now as you see im wamphyri you go back to do battle with him faéthor hissed your own son if thats the only way harry shrugged again mainly to disguise his lie but it doesnt have to be a fight starside is a big place even bigger now that the wamphyri are dead or fled hmmm faéthor mused so youll return to starside build yourself an aerie there and if necessary do battle with your son for a piece of his territory is that it possibly so why have you come to see me what have i to do with it if this is your plan then go to it for long moments harry was silent finally he answered but it was my thought that you might like to come with me faéthors gasp and the ensuing silence was of stunned disbelief until eventually that i might like to come with me harry said it again but no said faéthor in a while and harry sensed the unbodied shake of his head i cant credit this it is can only be a trick you who once fought so long and hard to keep me out now invite me in to be one with you in your new wamphyri mind body and dont say soul said harry also you have it wrong eh faéthor was at once on his guard but how can i have it wrong to go with you from this this hellish noplace into starside is out of the question unless it is as part of you here i am nothing but if of your own free will youre now inviting my mind into yours initially yes said harry but this time you must agree to move out when i desire it and without a struggle without that i must use trickery as last time faéthor was flabbergasted move out to where into the mind and body of some lesser man some traveller king or such in starside and finally faéthor understood or thought he did and his deadspeak thoughts turned sour as vinegar and so you are unworthy after all he said then and have been from the start i used to lie in the earth in my place in ploiesti and think the necroscope can have it all everything the world thibor was a ruffian unworthy but not so harry janos was the scummy froth of my loins beside which harry has the consistency the purity or if not that then at least the homogeneity of cream i shall make harry my third and last son yes these were my thoughts of which you were unworthy how come said harry i mean why do you insult me what astonishment disbelief surely you mean why do i sorrow but you could have been could still be the most powerful creature of all time the master vampire the great plague bearer because i faéthor ferenczy willed it you are wamphyri you have admitted as much yourself and yet now you would throw it all away does it mean nothing to you to be wamphyri what of the passion the power the glory what of me harry answered the real me before my adulteration the new you is greater i dont resent the greatness harry shook his head only that it was not on my terms but now im offering you terms and no more time to waste can you help me or cant you cards on the table then said faéthor you will take me into your mind transfer or transport me to starside which after all is or should have been my natural place and there pass me on to some other to guide him as i would have guided you in return for which you desire to know if theres a way you may rid yourself of the thing growing within you now do i have it right and if there is a way harry qualified the deal youll describe it in detail a fools guide so that i may be my own man again following which youll return to your own world leaving me embodied once more in starside thats the plan and if there is no way to free you harry shrugged a deal is a deal youll be a power on starside anyway as stated eventually to become your rival and your sons rival yet again the necroscopes shrug like i said with the old wamphyri dead or fled starside is a big place faéthor was cautious it seems to me that whichever way it goes still i get the best of this bargain now why should you be so good to me maybe its like you said harry told him a meeting of two old friends fiends faéthor corrected him as you will except im an unwilling fiend and despite the fact that youre the engineer of my current fix still i cant forget that in the past youve put yourself out to do me one or two favours even though all of them a little sourly as ive since come to realize were to your ultimate benefit still it seems ive grown accustomed to you i understand you now you played the game according to your own rules thats all wamphyri rules also im full of human compassion i cant help it and i have to admit my conscience has been bothering me about you stuck here in möbius time about my leaving you here and finally well you said it yourself if there is a cure for my complaint whod know it better than you which is the number one reason im here and doesnt leave me with much choice he was very convincing very well said faéthor as harry had supposed he would you have a deal now take me into your mind when you have told me what i want to know whether or not you may rid yourself of your vampire a little more than that oh where it came from how it got into me in the first place you havent thought it out for yourself it was the toadstools right faéthors deadspeak nod yes and the toadstools were you yes they were spawned of my fats festering in the earth where id burned and melted down an ichor an essence simmering there waiting then when the brew was ripe i willed the fungi up into the light but not until i knew youd be there to receive them and you were in them as you well know for through them i came to you but you cast me out and these fungi are they a natural part of the wamphyri chain part of the overall life cycle i dont know faéthor seemed at a genuine loss there was no one to instruct me in such mysteries old belos pheropzis might have known might even have passed such knowledge down to my father but if so then waldemar ferrenzig never told me i only knew that the spores were in me in the fats of my body and that i could will them into growth but dont ask me how i knew how does a dog know how to bark and the spores were your very last vestiges yes could it be that such toadstools grow in the vampire swamps on starside it seems logical to me since those swamps are the source of wamphyri infestation faéthor sighed his impatience but ive never even seen the vampire swamps on starside though i hope to and soon now then let me into your mind can i be rid of my vampire do we still have a deal however i may answer so long as you answer true no you are stuck with your vampire for ever harry wasnt hard hit he had supposed it would be so even concerning the very question or idea or thought of curing himself his will was already weakening probably had been for some time for he was learning what it was to be wamphyri and if his right hand didnt like it then his left hand did the dark side of men has always been their stronger side and what of women the lady karens cure had been her destruction in his mind like an echo the necroscope heard once more faéthors answer you are stuck with your vampire for ever and he thought so be it and to faéthor he said then farewell he began to decelerate leaving the astonished vampire to speed on ahead as before as the gap rapidly widened faéthor despairingly called back what but you said i lied harry cut him off what you a liar faéthor couldnt accept it but but thats not like you at all no harry answered grimly but it is like the thing inside me it is like my vampire for its part of you faéthor its part of you wait faéthor cried out in his extremity you can be rid of it its true you really can and that is the part said harry transferring out of time and back into the möbius continuum the lying part and in möbius time faéthor was left to shriek and gibber but faintly now and fading like the slithering whispers of winters crumbling leaves whirled for ever on the winds of eternity harry went to see jazz and zek simmons on the island of zakynthos in the ionian they had a villa in the trees overlooking the sea and hidden well away from the holidaymakers in porto zoro on the northeast coast it was eight in the evening when he materialized close to the house he put out a probe and saw that zek was on her own but guessed that jazz wouldnt mind his wife speaking for both of them first he reached out to her telepathically and the way she answered him unafraid it was as if shed expected him for a day or two she said after inviting him in when hed explained what he was doing but of course shell be ok here the poor girl not so poor he was prompted to answer almost defensively because she doesnt really understand it she wont fight it as hard as i have and before she knows it shell be wamphyri but starside how will you live there i mean do you intend intend to zek gave up she was after all talking to a vampire she knew that behind those dark lenses his eyes were fire knew too how easily she could be burned by them but if she feared him it didnt show and harry liked her for that he always had liked her well do what we have to do he answered my son found ways to survive the way i see it she said with an almost unnoticeable shudder blood is a powerful addiction the most powerful he told her its why we have to go zek didnt want to push it but felt she must her female curiosity because you love your fellow man and cant trust yourself he shrugged and offered her a wry smile because ebranch cant trust me but his halfsmile swiftly faded who knows maybe theyre right not to and after long moments of silence he asked what about jazz she looked at him and lifted an eyebrow as if to say do you really need to ask jazz doesnt forget his friends harry but for you we were long since dead on starside and in this world but for you the ferenczys son janos would still be alive and festering anyway jazz is in athens seeking dual nationality when can i bring penny here thats up to you now if you wish harry gathered penny up from her bed in the nicosia hotel without even waking her and moments later zek saw how gently he laid her between cool sheets in the guest bedroom of this her new temporary refuge and she nodded to herself certain now that if anyone was able to look after this girl on starside or anywhere else then it would be the necroscope and what now harry she queried serving coffee sweetened with metaxa brandy on her balcony where it jutted over the cliffs and the moonlit sea now perchorsk he answered simply but halfway down his cup he fell asleep in his chair it was a measure of his trust that he felt he could rest here and it was a measure of zek föeners that she didnt go and fetch her speargun and silver harpoon and try to kill him there and then and penny after him she didnt but even zek couldnt feel that safe before retiring she called for wolf a real wolf born on starside and when he came from the dark scented cover of the mediterranean pines stationed him at her door and wake me if they should move she told him at midnight harry woke up and went to perchorsk in the ussrs uralskiy khrebet zek watched him go and wished him luck in the urals it was in the morning and in the depths of the perchorsk projekt viktor luchov was asleep and nightmaring he always would nightmare as long as they kept him here but now since british ebranchs warning the nightmares were that much worse what exactly did that warning consist of a vague shadowy harry keogh inquired of him in his dream no dont tell me let me take a shot at it have a go at guessing it it had to do with me right luchov the projekt direktor didnt know where harry had come from but suddenly he was there pacing the discs bolted metal plates with him in the glare of the sphere gate arm in arm like old friends in the harrowing heart of perchorsk in the very roots of the mountains and finally he answered whats that you ask did it have to do with you but you sell yourself short harry why you were all of it they told you about me your ebranch yes i mean not me specifically they didnt tell me but they did warn the new man in charge of our own espionage group who of course passed it on to me except im not sure i should be repeating it to you not even in a dream dream luchov shuddered his subconscious mind briefly however unwillingly returning to the horror of what had gone before he considered that for a moment and in the next recoiled from it as if scalded my god but the whole monstrous business was a nightmare in fact and for all that you scared me witless you were one of the few human things about it human yes said harry nodding but that was then and this is now luchov disengaged his arm and moved a little apart then turned and looked at the necroscope stared hard curiously even fearfully at him as if to bring him into definition but harrys outline was fuzzy he wouldnt come into focus against the glare of the gate where its dome came up through the disc he was a silhouette whose rim was punctuated and perforated with brilliant lances of white light they say that you that youre that im a vampire are you luchov lay still a minute in his bed and stopped breathing waiting for the others answer are you asking do i kill men for their blood has my bite turned men into monsters have i myself been turned into a monster by a vampires bite then i can only tell you no his answer wasnt entirely a lie not yet luchov breathed again began tossing in his bed as before and he and harry continued their tour of inspection around the rim of the glaring sphere gate as they went so the necroscope used a basic form of espionage telepathy to study the projekts secret core its awesome nucleus where it was mirrored in the russian scientists subconscious mind he saw it that great spherical cavity carved in the mountains solid rock eaten out by unimaginable forces and in luchovs mind the enigmatic gate was the gravitydefying maggot at its centre coiled into a perfect ball of matterless white light motionless still glutted on energy absorbed in the first moments of its creation the gate floating there like an alien chrysalis with everything it contained waiting to break loose to break out but harry also saw that certain things had changed some things anyway the last time he was here or rather there physically there at the core it had been like this a spidery web of scaffolding had been built halfway up the curving wall at its perimeter supporting a platform of timber flooring which surrounded the glaring gate or portal floating on thin air at the caverns centre the effect had been to make the sphere look like the planet saturn with a ringsystem composed of the encircling timber floor the cavern was a little more than forty metres in diameter and the central sphere a little less than quarter of that there had been a gap of a few inches between the innermost timbers and the event horizon which was the spheres skin backed up against the black wormholeriddled wall at the perimeter of the cavern where the supporting scaffolding and stanchions were most firmly seated three evenlyspaced twinmounted katushev cannons had pointed their ugly muzzles almost pointblank at the blinding centre ready at a moments notice to discharge hot sleeting steel at anything which might emerge from the glare closer to the centre an electrified fence with a gate had been an additional precaution but precautions against what the answer to that was simple against what appeared to be the denizens of hell as to what the perchorsk projekt had been originally and how it mutated into what it was now when the usa started work on its sdi programme the ussr thought to answer with perchorsk if americas aim was to knock out ninety per cent of incoming russian missiles then the reds must discover a way to terminate or otherwise render ineffective one hundred per cent of missiles originating in the usa the answer was to have been a screen of energy several in fact which would enclose the soviet heartland or large vital parts of it under an impenetrable umbrella a team of toprank scientists was quickly assembled and in the depths of the perchorsk ravine an amazing subterranean complex was blasted and hewn out of the mountain itself a dam was constructed in the ravine its turbines would supply sufficient hydroelectric power to drive the complex and supplement the energy of its atomic pile working furiously the soviet taskforce completed the perchorsk projekt in short order and with nothing to spare in what had been a very tight schedule except that perhaps the schedule had been just a little too tight and then the device had been tested it was tested just once and went disastrously wrong mechanical failure energies which should have fanned out and been dispersed across a great arc of sky were turned back in their tracks deflected downwards into the core of the projekt into the pile and the perchorsk projekt ate its own heart it ate flesh and blood and bone plastic and rock and steel nuclear fuel and the atomic pile itself for a second maybe two seconds three it was ultimately voracious so much so that finally it ate itself and when it was over the shining sphere gate hung in thin air where the pile had been and the laboratories and levels all around had been reduced to so much magmass that was what direktor luchov had termed those monstrous regions in the vicinity of the central cavity and gate the magmass levels made monstrous by what had occurred in them at the time of the blowback when flesh and rock and whatever else had been gathered together and fused or moulded into this or that incredible unthinkable shape like so much plasticine men reversed so that their innards hung outwards had become one with the rock walls and closer to the centre where they had been incinerated by the heat of the blowback there theyd left their twisted alien impressions scorched into the blackened rock pompeii in a fashion is similar to look upon but there in the ashes and the lava at least the figures are still recognizably human after that it had soon become apparent just what the sphere was the fact that the failed experiment had blown a hole through the wall of this universe into another which lay parallel and the sphere was the doorway the portal the gate but it was a weird kind of gate anything going through it couldnt come back likewise for anything that came through from the other side from the parallel world of sunside and starside and the trouble with starside of course was that it was the source of vampirism the home of the wamphyri things had come through from the other side which by the grace of god or by chance good fortune had been destroyed before they could carry their lethal taint the plague of vampirism into the outside world but such had been their horror that men just couldnt face up to them hence the katushevs hence the flamethrowers everywhere evident where in other secret establishments one might expect to find fire extinguishers hence the fear which had lived and breathed and occasionally held its breath in perchorsk the fear which lived here even now even now yes it was different harry observed but not that different for one thing the wooden floorboards of the saturns rings platform had been replaced by these steel plates radiating outwards from the sphere like giant fish scales the katushevs had gone too leaving the gate surrounded at its own height by a system of ominouslooking sprinklers and higher up the curving wall of the cavern on platforms of their own were the great glass carboys which contained the liquid agent for this sprinkler system many gallons of highly corrosive acid the steel plates of the rings sloped slightly downwards towards the centre so that any spilled acid would run that way below the sphere gate central on the magmass floor a huge glass tank served as a catchment area for the acid when its work was done its work of course would be to blind incapacitate and rapidly reduce to fumes anything that should come through from the other side for after the last grotesque emergence of a wamphyri warrior creature viktor luchov had known that exploding steel or a team of men with conventional flamethrowers just wouldnt be enough not for that sort of thing what had been enough was the failsafe system which was in use at that time which poured thousands of gallons of explosive fuel into the core and then ignited it except it had also reduced the complex to a shell since when why didnt you get out then harry inquired when hed seen everything he needed to see why didnt you just quit the place close it up oh we did briefly luchov answered blinking rapidly where he peered at his dream visitor in the glare of the gate we got out sealed off the tunnels filled all the horizontal ventilation and service shafts into the ravine with concrete built a gigantic steel door onto the old entrance like a door on a bank vault why we did as good a job on the perchorsk projekt as theyd later do on the reactor at chernobyl and then we had people sitting out there in the ravine with their sensors listening to it until we realized that we just couldnt stand the silence harry knew what he meant the horror at chernobyl couldnt reactivate itself it wasnt likely to become sentient but if sentient minds could plug the holes at perchorsk others however alien might always unplug them we had to know to be able to see for ourselves that all was well down here luchov continued at least until we could deal with it on a more permanent basis oh harry was keenly interested deal with it permanently will you explain and luchov might have done just that except harry had allowed himself to become just a fraction too intense too real and suddenly the projekt direktor had known that this was more than any ordinary dream starting awake in his austere celllike room the russian jerked upright in his bed and saw harry sitting there staring at him with eyes like clots of fluorescent blood in the rooms darkness then remembering his dream and panting his shock where he pressed himself to the bare steel wall luchov gasped harry keogh it is you you you liar again harry knew what he meant but he shook his head i told you no lie viktor i havent killed men for their blood ive created no vampires and i wasnt myself infected that way thats as may be the other gasped but you are a vampire harry smiled however terribly look at me he said his voice very soft almost warm even reasonable i mean i can hardly deny it can i and he leaned himself a little closer to luchov the russian was as harry remembered him his skin might be a shade more sallow his eyes more feverish but basically he was the same man small and thin he was badly scarred and the hair was absent from the left half of his face and yellowveined skull but however vulnerable luchov might seem harry knew that in fact he was a survivor he had survived the awful accident which created the gate survived all of the things which subsequently came through it even survived the final holocaust yes survived everything so far anyway luchov blanched under the necroscopes scrutiny and panted that much faster he prayed that the steel wall would absorb him safely within itself maybe to expel him in the cell next door away from this man for luchov had faced a vampire before and even the thought of it was terrifying finally he forced out words why are you here harrys gaze was unwavering he watched the yellow veins pulsing rapidly under the scartissue skin of luchovs seared skull and answered oh you know why well enough viktor im here because of what ebranch told you or caused you to be told that im obliged to abandon this world and in order to do so must use the perchorsk gate but no big deal why i should have thought youd all be glad to see the last of me oh we would we would luchov eagerly agreed nodding until droplets of sweat flew its just that that harry inclined his head a little on one side and smiled his awful smile again go on but luchov had already said too much if what you say is true he babbled trying to change the subject that as yet youve harmed no one i mean are you asking me not to harm you harry deliberately yawned politely hiding the indelicate gape behind his hand but not before hed let the russian glimpse the length and serrated edges of his teeth and not without displaying the hands talons what for the sake of my reputation every esper in europe and possibly even further afield baying for my blood but i have to be a good boy fairs fair viktor now why dont you just tell me what ebranch told your lot and what theyve asked you to do oh yes and what measure what permanent solution there could possibly be to this frankenstein monster youve created here at perchorsk but i cant darent tell you any of those things luchov whined cringing against the steel wall so despite all youve been through youre still a true brainwashed son of mother russia eh harry grimaced and gave a mocking snort no luchov shook his head just a man a member of the human race but one who believes everything people tell him right what my eyes tell me certainly the necroscopes patience was at an end he leaned closer still grabbed luchovs wrist in a steel claw and hissed you argue well viktor perhaps you really should have been one of the wamphyri and at last the projekt direktor could see his worst nightmare taking shape before his eyes the metamorphosis of a man into a potential plague and knew that he might all too easily become the next carrier but he still had a card left to play you you defy every scientific principle he babbled you come and go in that weird way of yours but did you think i had forgotten did you think i wouldnt remember and take precautions better go now harry before they burst in through that door there and burn you to a crisp what harry let go of him jerked himself back away from him luchov snatched back the covers of his bed and showed the necroscope the button attached to the steel frame the button which he had pressed how long ago and whose tiny red light was flashing even now and harry knew that however unwittingly still hed been betrayed by his own vampire for this was a failure of his dark side the thing within him had wanted to be seen to take ascendancy to do this thing its own way and frighten the answers out of luchov yes and then possibly to kill him if harry had fought it down then he might simply have plucked the answers right out of the scientists mind but too late for that now not too late to fight back however and drive the hidden thing to ground beat it back into subservience he did so and luchov saw that he was just a man again sobbing the russian said i thought i thought that you would kill me not me harry answered as running footsteps sounded from outside not me it and yes it just might have killed you but damn you you trusted me once viktor and did i let you down all right so the fleshandblood me has changed but the real me im still the same but its different now harry luchov answered suddenly aware that hed averted whatever surely you can see that im not doing anything for myself any more not even for mother russia its for the human race for all of us they were banging on the door now voices shouting listen harrys face was as earnest and as human as the russian had ever seen it or it would be but for those hellish eyes by now ebranch and your russian organization too if theyre worth their salt must know i only want out so why cant they just let me go shots sounded from the corridor ten or more in rapid succession hammer blows of hot lead that slammed into the lock on the steelpanelled door and shattered its works to scrap metal but are you telling me you dont know luchov saw only harry now only the man are you saying you dont understand maybe i do harry answered im not sure but right now youre the only one who can confirm it and so luchov confirmed it but theyre not worried about you going harry he said as the door was slammed back on its hinges and light flooded in theyre only worried that one day you might come back and about what you might try to bring with you scared men crowded the doorway one cradled a flamethrower its flickering muzzle pointing directly at luchov dont the direktor screamed ramming himself into the corner and covering his face with frail fluttering hands for christs sake dont hes gone hes gone they stood there in the doorway smokily silhouetted in cordite stench looking round the stark cubicle and finally one of them asked who has gone direktor and another said has the direktor been dreaming luchov collapsed on his bed sobbing oh how he wished hed only been dreaming but no he hadnt not all of it anyway for he could still feel the pressure on his wrist where the necroscope had gripped him and he could still feel those terrible eyes burning on his face and in his mind oh yes harry keogh had been here and pretty soon hed be back but the direktor also knew that unless he was hugely mistaken harry had learned only part of what he came to learn the next time he came the rest of it would be waiting for him but the next time could be any time as of right now switch it on he gasped eh a scientist pushed hastily unceremoniously by the rest and squeezed himself into the gap beside luchovs bed the disc did you say were to switch it on yes luchov grasped his arm and do it now dmitri do it right now then luchov lay back gasping and clutched at his throat i cant breathe i cant breathe out dmitri kolchov ordered at once with a wave of his arm out all of you lets have some air in here but as the men filed out wait luchov held out a clawlike hand after them you with the flamethrower wait right outside and you with the shotgun is it loaded silver shot of course direktor the man looked puzzled what use to have it if it wasnt loaded and is there a grenadier with you with grenades luchov was quieter now steadier yes direktor came the answer from outside luchov nodded and his adams apple wobbled a little as he gulped down air then you three all of you wait for me outside and from now on dont let me out of your sight he swung his legs wearily to the floor then noticed dmitri kolchov standing there staring at him direktor i kolchov started to speak now luchov screamed at him man are you fucking deaf didnt you hear me i said switch on the disc right now then report to the duty room and get me moscow on the hotline moscow pallid now and shrinking a little kolchov backed out of the small room gorbachev luchov rasped gorbachev and none other for theres no one else who can order what comes next a thing alone starside the dweller the necroscope knew that there was very little time left and certainly none to waste the soviets had worked out some final solution to the perchorsk problem which meant that he had to be through the gate before they could put it into effect he went to detroit and just after pm found a bike garage and showroom on the point of closing the last tired employee was locking up the nexttolast a black forecourt attendant had just this minute put away his broom washed his hands and was sauntering away from the garage down the evening street marvellous chromeplated machines stood in a glittering chorus line behind the semireflective plate glass the necroscope right said a deadspeak voice in harrys mind after hed used a möbius door to get into the showroom it surprised him for the dead werent much for talking to him these days i mean youd have to be the boogyman whoever it was continued cos i kin hear you thinkin you have me at a disadvantage harry answered polite as ever at the same time examining the chain which passed through the spoked front wheels of the parade of gleaming motorcycles securing them i have your what oh yeah you dont know me right well i was an angel deadspeak occasionally conveys more than is said with regard to angels harry would no longer be surprised to learn that there really were such creatures and especially in the möbius continuum but on this occasion he saw that the angel in question wore no such halo a hells angel harry stood on the chain and hauled with both arms exerting furious wamphyri strength until a link came apart with a sound like a pistol shot but didnt you have a name hey whoooah man and the angel whistled appreciatively like i bet you leap tall buildings too right is it a bird is it a plane shit no its the everlovin chainbreakin deadwakin necroscope he grew quieter my name it was pete pretty shitty handle right here petey petey petey sounds like a fuckin budgie so i used my chapter name the vampire er but i see you have your own problems harry took a harleydavidson off its stand and backed it out of the line of bikes towards the rear of the showroom but the last employee had heard the gunshot of the snapped chain and was working his way back through a series of locked doors pete seems a good enough name to me said harry so what are you doing here its where i hung out the angel told him i never could afford one of these really big babies but id come down and look em over all the time this place was a shrine a church and these harleys were its highpowered priests how did you die harry turned the key in the ignition and the big bike thundered into life each pulse of each fat piston almost individually audible one night me and my pillion pussy had a fight the angel answered randy mandy split so later me and the machine we were both full of high octane the booze caught up with us about the same time as we clocked the big one zero zero ran out of road on a bend piled into a filling station crunched a pump we burned me and the bike both in a whitehot geyser what was left of my body blew away on the wind but me i gravitated here pete said harry i always wanted to ride one of these things but never seemed to find the time you dont know how in one harry nodded i mean i can learn the hard way or take a little expert advice right so fancy a ride me who else hooohaaa and harry could almost feel him right there in the saddle where it asshooked at the back indeed their minds were one as harry revved her up and up and up then let her rip in smoking tyres and shrieking gears straight at the wall of glass meanwhile the duty lockup a clerk had reopened the last door and entered the showroom and was now backed up against the giant display windows right in harrys way spreadeagled the man mouthed a silent gaping scream as the big bike snaked towards him he knew hed be cut to ribbons him and this maniac rider both and didnt know which way to jump closing his eyes and saying his prayers he slid down the glass even as the bellowing monster bore down on him and passed through him and was gone as the noise subsided he opened his eyes first a crack then all the way the harleydavidson and rider were no longer there there were skidmarks blue exhaust smoke even the roar of the engine slowly echoing into silence but no bike and no rider and the plate glass was still in one piece haunted the man thought before he passed out christ ive always known it this place is haunted to hell he was right and he was wrong the place had been haunted but no longer for pete the vampire biker was now with harry keogh and like harry he wouldnt be back harry coasted through the möbius continuum to zakinthos conjured a door and blazed out through it at forty onto the uneven surface of a starlit greek island road an inexperienced rider he might have come to grief right there and then but pete the biker was in his mind and his hands and the huge machine stayed upright and steady on the potholed tarmac zek met the necroscope on the white steps which wound to her door but she had spoken to him moments earlier pennys awake shes been drinking coffee a lot my fault harry had answered we did a little celebrating a movingoutparty and he thought of his place near bonnyrig edinburgh housewarming with a difference yes wow said the vampire seeing zek mirrored in harrys mind is this your pillion pussy but of course his exclamation and question were deadspeak and zek couldnt hear them or even know he was here at all no it isnt harry spoke only to pete shes just a good friend anyway mind your business and your mouth penny joined zek and harry even as they touched hands she came ghosting to the door and smiled however tiredly however eerily when she saw the necroscope had returned and there in the greek night zek saw the cores of pennys eyes glowing red as a moths where they reflected the light of the lamp over the door as for harrys eyes zek avoided looking at them in any case there was no need and no need to say anything out loud not when their minds were touching zek he said i owe you we all owe you she answered every one of us not any more youve squared it for the rest goodbye harry she leaned forward and kissed his lips just a mans lips for the moment but cold he led penny through the trees to the big bike and mounting up looked back zek stood in lamplight and starlight and waved the harleydavidsons lights cut a swath under the trees picking out the track back to the road zek heard the roar of the engine pick up to a howl saw the headlights cutting the night held her breath then the engine noise was only a receding echo doing a drum roll along the hills and the headlight beam was gone as if it had never existed are your eyes closed harry asked over his shoulder yes her answering thought was a whisper then keep them that way tightclosed until i tell you to open them hurling the big bike through the möbius continuum with penny and pete the vampire riding pillion harry headed for the perchorsk gate he knew exactly indeed precisely where the gate was möbius equations flickered across the screens of his metaphysical mind opening and closing an endless curve of doors as he went but when the doors began to warp and waver he knew he was almost there it was an effect of the gate to bend the möbius continuum as a black hole bends light a moment later harry guided the bike through the last fluxing disintegrating door and hurtled out of the möbius continuum on to the perimeter of the steel disc surrounding the gate and viktor luchov saw it all even as it happened at the very rim where the plates of the disc were covered in rubber three inches thick the projekt direktor was conversing with a group of scientists the perimeter had been made safe roped off with nonconductive plasticcoated nylon the disc not only carried a lethal voltage but was now linked to the sprinkler system fat white and blue sparks danced as harrys huge powerful machine came roaring off the möbius strip to erupt into this spacetime the screaming eagles dunlops were wide heavy and of the very best rubber but the sudden shock of the bikes five hundred and seventyplus pounds jarred fishscale plates together in a crackle and hum of electrical discharge blue energies skittered across the disc like snakes of lightning adding to the throaty chaos of snarling pistons in the cathedral acoustics of the spherical cavern and overhead the acid floodgates were opened the necroscopes intuitive möbius maths was on top form he had calculated well and after all what could possibly go wrong in something slightly less than the space of a single second walking round that central cavern with luchov in the direktors mind hed seen no guns there the acid sprinkler outlets had been maybe twenty feet above the disc theyd take a little time to activate and fill before they could commence spraying he should be into the sphere gate and gone before the first droplets smoked murderously down onto the steel plates and yet even as hed emerged into the glare of the cavern and his tyres had shrieked on the plates where they tried to find purchase even then hed known that something was wrong not with his figures but with the plan itself with what he already knew of that plan with what hed already seen of it in action for he had seen something of it yes when hed visited faéthor in future time his scarlettinged neon line of life turning aside from its futureward thrust shooting off at rightangles and disappearing in a brilliant burst of red and blue fire as it left this dimension of space and time and raced for starside but only as it that solitary lifeline one lifeline departed harry himself harry alone without penny slowing from forty to thirty miles per hour while the bike yawed and his tyres found purchase harry remembered a vastly important rule never try to read the future for that can be a devious thing but he had taken even this temporary deceleration into account and even so the timing was still only a second one tick of a clock so what was wrong the answer was simple penny was wrong had she once obeyed him had she once obeyed his instructions to the letter no never she might be in thrall to him in love with him fascinated by him but she didnt go in fear of him he was her lover not her master and in her innocence penny had been inquisitive and vulnerable dont open your eyes hed said but being penny she had opened them as they shot through the möbius door into perchorsk opened them in time to see the glaring cyclopseye gate looming where the bike skidded fishtailed and rocketed towards it and seeing knowing they were going to crash shed reacted of course they were going to crash crash right through which was the whole plan and shouldnt be her concern if time wasnt of the essence he might have explained all of that to her all of which flashed across the necroscopes mind in the split second that penny screamed and let go of his waist to cover her eyes and his rear suspension bucking like a bronco to absorb the shuddering of the steel plates and just exactly like a bronco asshooking the gasping girl into an aerial somersault in the next split second he ruptured the gates skin and shot through but on his own a thing alone or at best with only pete the vampire biker hanging on behind shit petes deadspeak howled in harrys mind necroscope youve lost your pillion pussy harry saw it in his mirrors looked out through the gates skin and watched penny come down in dreadful slowmotion on to the plates of the disc he saw the languid flash of lightning that stiffened her limbs to a crucifix laced her hair and clothes with webs of blue fire and spun her body like a giant coruscating catherinewheel he saw the acid rain come down and the curtain of hissing vapour which at once went up saw penny turn wet and black and red skittering like a flounder on her back where her skin peeled open or was eaten away saw her rhumba rollerskated this way and that across the steel plates on vibrating molecules of her own boiling blood like droplets of water flicked into a greasy smokinghot pan shed been dead of course from the first flash of blue fire and so felt nothing of it but harry did he felt the absolute horror of it and he sucked in his breath as at last the current glued her to the steel fish scales where acid and fire both worked on her turning her to ashes tar smoke and stink and there was nothing he could do not even harry keogh for he was through the gate and no way back but there are certain mercies her single silent telepathic shriek had failed to reach him for hed already been over the threshold and into another world likewise her deadspeak if she was using it now it was shut out by the gate the necroscope wanted to die right here right now he could happily unhappily die but that wasnt the way of the thing inside him and pete the angel wasnt about to let it happen either between them they closed harry down turned him to ice froze him out lolling there emotionless mindless vacant in the saddle of the screaming eagle he wasnt riding the bike any more but they were and they rode it all the way to starside when harry recovered he was a full mile out on the boulder plain seated on a rock beside the now silent harleydavidson the big machine stood there silvered by full moon and ghostly starlight it had seemed awesome enough in a showroom on earth but here on starside it was utterly and literally alien the bike was alien but harry wasnt wamphyri he belonged here a picture of penny surfaced out of memorys scarlet swirl he remembered drew breath to howl and choked on it then clenched his fists and closed his red eyes for long moments until hed driven her out of his mind for ever the effort left him limp as a wet rag but it had to be done everything penny had been everything anyone had been was a dimension away and entirely irretrievable there was no going back and no bringing her back bad vibes man said pete the biker but quietly what now harry we done riding harry stood up straightened up and looked around it was sundown and in the south there was no gold on the jagged peaks of the mountains east lay the low tumbled tumuli of shattered aeries the fallen stacks of the wamphyri only one remained intact an ugly column of dark stone and grey bone more than a kilometre high it was or had been the lady karens but that was a long time ago and karen was dead now south west up in the mountains that was where the dweller had his garden the dweller yes harry jr with his travellers and trogs all secure in the haven hed built for them except the dweller was a vampire and the battle with the wamphyri lay four long years in starsides past so that harry wondered is my son still ascendant or has the vampire in him finally taken control his thoughts were deadspeak of course and pete the angel answered them whynt we just go and see man the last time i was here harry told him we argued my son and i and he gave me a hard time but and he shrugged i suppose he has to know sooner or later that im back if he doesnt know it already so lets go pete was eager to ride just climb aboard the old screamin eagle and start er up man but the necroscope shook his head i dont need the bike pete not any more the exangel was cast down hey thats right you got your own form of transport but what about me harry thought about it a while then gave a wan smile and it was a measure of his strength that he still had it in him to smile pete the biker read his deadspeak thoughts of course and whooped wildly necroscope do you mean it he was breathless with excitement sure said harry why not and they got aboard the big bike they turned her around found a good straight stretch of hardpacked boulderfree earth and took her up to a ton and it was as if a primal beast bellowed in the starlit silence of starside then still howling a hundred and waving a tail of dust half a mile long harry conjured a möbius door and they shot through followed by a futuretime door which they likewise crashed and now they rode into the future with a great many blue and green and harry noted even a few red lifelines the blues were travellers the greens would be trogs and the reds vampires pete picked the thought out of his mind looks like it said harry sighing but pete only laughed like a crazy man my kind of people he yelled and on they rode for a little while until harry said pete heres where i get off you mean shes all mine for ever and ever and you neednt ever stop pete didnt know how to thank him so didnt try harry opened a pasttime door then paused a while before crossing the threshold and watched the big harley rocketing away from him into the future eventually he heard the angels whooping cry come echoing back heeehaaaaaaaaaa well at least pete was happy now and then harry went back to starside and the garden the necroscope stood at the forward edge of the garden his hands resting on the low stone wall there and looked down on starside somewhere between here and the old territories of the wamphyri where the broken remains of their aeries now lay in shattered disarray the sphere gate this end of the spacetime handle the dimensional warp whose alternate extension lay in perchorsk would be lighting up the stony plain in its painful white glare harry fancied he could see something of its light even from here a ghostly shimmer way down there in the far grey foothills he and the incorporeal pete had come out of the starside gate on the big bike come through the aching dazzle of the grey hole from perchorsk and out of it on to the boulder plain but harry remembered very little of that he did remember the last time he was here however which strangely felt more real to him than all that had gone between probably because he now desired to forget all that had gone between he turned his head more directly northwards and gazed out across all the leagues of starsides vast unknown to the curve of the horizon lying darkblue and emeraldgreen under fleeting moon glittering stars and the writhing allure of aurora borealis that way lay the icelands where the sun never shone and into which the doomed forsaken and forgotten of the wamphyri had been banished since time immemorial shaithis too after the defeat of the wamphyri and the destruction of their aeries in the battle for the dwellers garden and he remembered how shaithis had sped north aboard a huge manta flyer in the peace and the silence of the aftermath harry and the lady karen had spoken to shaithis before he exiled himself unrepentant even then the vampire lord had openly lusted after karens body and even more so after the dwellers and his fathers hearts but hed lusted in vain at that time anyway as for the necroscope hed had his own use for the lady karen for just like his son she had a vampire in her if he could exorcize karens nightmare creature perhaps he could also cure the dweller he starved karen in her aerie used the blood of a piglet to lure her vampire out of her then burned the thing before it could escape back into her body but after that things had not gone according to plan and the rest of it was still seared on the screen of his memory she came to him in a dream stood over him in her most revealing white gown and turned his triumph to ashes cant you see what youve done to me she said i who was wamphyri am now a shell for when one has known the power the freedom the magnified emotions of the vampire what is there after that i pity you for i know why you did what youve done and also that youve failed and then she was gone he woke up and searched for her in all the rooms on all the many levels of the aerie and could not find her eventually he went out on to a high bone balcony and looked down and saw karens white dress lying crumpled on the scree more than a kilometre below no longer entirely white but red too and karen had been inside it harry shook himself came out of his reverie deliberately turned his back on starside and the scars it had given him and looked at the garden which now he saw was not entirely as he remembered it a garden well yes but not the welltended garden he had known and the greenhouses the hillside dwelling places of the travellers the hot springs and speckled trout pools there was green algae on the pools the transparent panels in many of the greenhouses were torn and flapping in cold air eddies out of starside the dwelling houses especially harry jrs showed signs of disrepair where tiles were missing from the roofs windows were broken and centralheating pipes from the thermal pools had cracked spilling their contents out upon the open ground so that the radiators went without not the same harry helllander is it said a deep sad growling voice from close at hand if not in those words exactly but the necroscopes telepathy had filled in the bits which his ears had failed to recognize its easy to be a linguist when youre also a telepath harry turned to face the man approaching him jinglingly along the lee of the wall as he did so the other noted his gaunt grey flesh and crimson eyes and paused hello there lardis the necroscope nodded his own voice as deep and deeper than the others i hope that shotguns not for me he wasnt joking if anything he might have been threatening for the dwellers father lardis looked at the weapon in his hands as if seeing it for the first time in something of surprise he shuffled a little awkwardly like a boy caught in contemplation of some small crime and said hardly that but and again the traveller chief looked at harrys eyes and this time narrowed his own wherever youve been and whatever youve done since last you were here harry helllander i see youve known hard times finally he averted his gaze glancing here and there all about the garden then down onto starside aye and hard times here too and more still to come i fear harry studied the man and asked hard times wont you explain lardis lidesci was romany in this world on earth anywhere there would be no mistaking the gypsy in him he was maybe fiveeight tall built like a crag and looked of one age with the necroscope in fact he was a lot younger but starside and the wamphyri had taken their toll in contrast to his squat build he was very agile and not in body alone his intelligence was patent in every brown wrinkle of his expressive face open and frank lardiss round face was framed in dark flowing hair in which streaks of grey were now plainly visible he had slanted bushy eyebrows a flattened nose and a wide mouth full of strong if uneven teeth his brown eyes held nothing of malice but were careful thoughtful penetrating explain said lardis coming no closer but isnt all of this explanation enough he opened his arms expansively as if to enclose the entire garden ive been away four years lardis harry reminded him but not in exactly those words he made automatic conversions time on sunside and starside was not measured in years but in those periods between sunup when the barrier peaks turned gold and sundown when auroras danced in the northern skies when i left this place and returned to the helllands he did not say after my son had crippled and banished me for hed read in lardiss mind that he knew nothing of that wed just won a resounding victory over the wamphyri the sun had burned the dweller very badly but he was well on the road to a complete recovery the futures of you and your traveller tribe and the dwellers trogs too seemed secure so what happened where is everyone and wheres the dweller in good time lardis nodded slowly all in good time and in a little while frowning when i saw you come here he seemed to have changed the subject when you appeared here in that way of yours as once the dweller was wont to appear past tense harry contrived to hide a small start well i knew it was you obviously i remembered how you looked you zek jazz as if all of that were yesterday yes and i remembered the good times in the days immediately after the battle here in the garden then approaching you i saw your eyes and knew you were a victim no less than the dweller in that earlier time and because you are harry wolfsons father his natural father and i suppose also because i carry this shotgun loaded with silver from your sons armoury i wasnt afraid of you for after all i am lardis lidesci whom even the wamphyri respected in some small part in some large part harry nodded at once dont sell yourself short so what are you trying to say lardis i am wondering the other began to answer paused and sighed the dweller when lucid has mentioned when lucid now what the hell was this harry would look inside lardiss head but something warned him not to take on too much yes he prompted is it possible lardis jerked the shotgun shut across his arm thus loading it its twin barrels pointing straight at harrys heart that you are their advance guard the necroscope conjured a möbius door directly under his own feet and fell through it and in the next moment rose up out of another door behind the traveller chief the echoes of the double blast were still bouncing between the higher crags a whiff of blackpowder stench drifted on the air lardis was cursing very vividly and swinging the double barrels of his weapon left and right through a degree arc harry touched him on the shoulder and as lardis crouched down and spun on his heels took the gun from him he propped the weapon against the wall narrowed his eyes and tilted his head on one side a little perhaps warningly and growled lets walk and talk lardis but this time lets try to be a little more forthcoming the gypsy was build like a bull for a moment he remained in his halfcrouch eyes slitted arms reaching but finally he changed his mind harry was wamphyri go up against him one might as well hurl oneself from a high place which would be a much quicker far less painful death but this time no longer distracted by the gun harry read his thoughts no need to die lardis he said as softly as possible and no need to kill im no ones vanguard now will you tell me what has happened what is happening here and take the shortest route about it many things have happened lardis grunted catching his breath and many more will happen that is if the dwellers premonitions his dreams of doom should come to pass where is the dweller now harry demanded he glanced sharply at lardis wolfson did you call him and wheres his mother his mother lardis raised his slanted eyebrows quickly lowered them again ah his mother your wife the most gentle lady brenda she was my wife once harry nodded come this way said lardis he led the necroscope across the garden and harry saw for himself how great were the changes for it was plain now that the place had been left untended the pools were stagnating the greenhouses were empty and cold a bitter wind blew bouncing wiry balls of tumbleweed across the flat once fertile saddle and to one side where the level ground began to climb again like foothills to the higher peaks there lay brendas simple cairn harry felt the poignancy of the moment and reached out with his deadspeak it was instinct like the beat of his heart like breathing but in another moment remembering how shed been he withdrew she wouldnt know him and even if she did remember it would only disturb her to lardis he said she died peacefully aye the gypsy answered sunup and gentle rains and all the flowers in bloom a good time to go she wasnt ill lardis shook his head merely frail it was her time harry turned away but alone here she wasnt alone lardis protested the trogs loved her my travellers too and her son he stayed with her to the end it helped keep his own trouble at bay his trouble harry repeated him you mean when hes not himself not lucid and youve called him harry wolfson i ask you one more time where is the dweller lardis lidesci the gypsy stared at him a moment then glanced at the full moon riding the peaks and shivered up there he said where else wild as his brothers aye and like a king among them where they lope in the trees along the ridges or snug in a cave with his bitch on sunside when the sun is up or hunting foxes in the far west men see him from time to time with the pack they know him from the hands he wears where the rest have paws and from his crimson eyes of course harry need ask no more for now he knew it was something hed wondered about often enough almost to himself softly he said with the dweller changed and the wamphyri defeated no longer a threat there was nothing to keep his people here nothing to hold them together perhaps you even feared him and so you travellers have drifted back to sunside the trogs have returned to their caves and the garden will soon come to an end unless i put it to rights again you why not i fought for it upon a time lardiss voice was sour gruff now and will you also hunt on sunside hunt men women and children when the nights are dark does my son hunt the travelling folk did he ever lardis turned abruptly away i have to go at the back of the saddle theres a track a cleft a pass my route back through the mountains to sunside harry followed close behind do you go alone why did you come here anyway to remember what was upon a time and to see what has become just this one last time and now that the wamphyri are no more how goes it on sunside have you settled or do you journey as before lardis looked back and gave a snort what the wamphyri no more well perhaps for now but the swamps boil with their spawn all is as it was in the long ago and what has been will be again vampires today wamphyri tomorrow harry came to a halt let the other stride away into a rising mist lardis he called after him remember this dont bother me and i wont bother you and yours thats a promise and if youre in need seek me out except seek carefully hah the gypsys reply rang from the mist but youre wamphyri now harry helllander what and do you make promises and should i believe them well and perhaps i would have believed them upon a time but believe the thing inside you no way never oh youll come ahunting soon enough for a woman to warm your bed or a sweet traveller child when youve wearied of the flesh of rabbits lardis wait harry growled after him there are things i need to know which you can tell me of course he could always stop him instantly and do what he would with him but he wouldnt for the old times and also because he the necroscope was still ascendant still in command of himself the moon raced full and low in the sky it silvered the peaks turned the shadows of the crags black made the mist luminous where it crept and harry saw that the mist wasnt rising but falling down from the shadowed places to fill the saddles and false plateaus and tumble over the crags like glowing slowmotion waterfalls the howl of a wolf reverberated echoing from one peak to the next it was joined by another and another no natural mist this and these unseen creatures they were strange and mournful finally lardiss voice came back hoarse and panting do you hear that harry helllander the grey brotherhood aye and their king with them come to sit by his mother and talk with her a while as is his wont ask him these things you would know and maybe hell talk to his father too but as for me farewell there came a distant crunching of pebbles the sound of scree dislodged and sliding and lardis was off and running on his way to sunside and the howling ceased harry waited finally they came out of the mist longeared greyfurred tongues lolling with eyes like molten gold a pack of wolves but they were only wolves harry looked at them and they looked back he was unafraid and they were cautious they lined up on both sides of him and left a gauntlet for him to run except he wouldnt run but walk it back to the dwellers house and as he went the mist and the grey brotherhood closed in behind him inside the house all was darkness which mattered not at all to the necroscope mist swirled ankledeep like something sleeping whose dreams harry disturbed by passing through the dweller sat upright at a table in what was once the living room where moonbeams came slanting through an open window he wore a hooded robe with his eyes burning like triangular coals within the cowl only his hands long and slender were otherwise visible harry sat down opposite and i had thought you might come back one day said the dweller his voice a snarl a cough a croak and i knew it was you from the moment you came howling out of the sphere gate someone who comes into a place like that brash and full of fire he is either fearless or very afraid or he doesnt much care one way or the other i didnt much care said harry not then lets not waste words said the dweller once i had all the power but i also had a vampire in me and thought you would try to exorcize and kill it and so kill me being afraid of what you might do i put a thought into your head and used it like a knife to cut out all of your secret talents like me you could come and go at will i immobilized you like me you listened to the dead and talked to them i made you deaf and dumb and when all was done then i returned you back to your own place and stranded you there not so terrible at least you were in your own world among your own kind then for a while there was peace in this world and to a lesser extent there was also peace in me but i had used the power of the sun itself to destroy the wamphyri you and i together we had burned them with bright sunfire and toppled their aeries down on to the plain all very wonderful but in so doing in playing with the sun like that i too had been burned well and i would soon recover from it so it seemed i did not recover what started as a healing process soon stopped indeed reversed itself my metamorphic vampire flesh could not replenish itself and the flesh of my human body and the vampire must come first that which was human in me gradually sloughed away eaten out as by leprosy or some monstrous cancer even my mind was erased and in large part replaced and what was instinct in my vampire gradually became instinct inherent in me for the vampire must have a host active and strong to house its egg until it could be passed on and it remembered the shape and nature of its first host as you know father my other father the source of my egg was a wolf i knew that my body was going my mind too and saw that i was reverting but still there was someone who knew my story all of it from the day i was conceived and to whom i could talk in my hour of need my mother of course and in practising my deadspeak so i kept at least that one last talent alive but as for the rest they are gone forgotten ironic i destroyed your talents and lost my own and now when i forget things i talk to the gentle one under the stones who reminds me of what has been who even reminded me of you when i might so easily have forgotten harrys emotions the gigantic emotions of the wamphyri had filled him to overflowing he couldnt find words to speak could scarcely think in a few short hours a small fraction of his life his entire life had been changed for ever but that meant nothing his pain was nothing for others had really suffered and were suffering even now and he could trace all of it back to himself son ill come here no more the dweller said now that ive seen you and now that youve forgiven me i can forget what i was and be what i am which is something you might try for yourself father he reached out a hand to touch harrys trembling hand and his forearm was greyfurred where it slid from the sleeve of his robe harry turned his face away tears are unseemly in scarlet wamphyri eyes but a moment later when he looked again the dwellers robe was still fluttering to the floor while a shape greyblurred launched itself from the window harry leaped to see there in the vampire mist his son sprang away then paused turned and looked back he blinked triangular eyes lifted his muzzle sniffed at the cold air his ears were pointed alert he tilted his head this way and that he was listening but to what someone comes he barked warningly and before the necroscope could question his meaning ah yes that one forgotten until now like so many other things ive forgotten it seems im not the only one who marked your return father no for she too knows youre back she the necroscope repeated his werewolf son as that one turned and loped for the higher peaks and all the grey brotherhood with him vanishing into the mist then a shadow fell on the dwellers house and harry turned his startled eyes skyward where even now a weird diamond shape fell towards the garden and she he said again his query a whisper he means me helllander her telepathic voice hardly severe nevertheless exploding in harrys mind like a bomb reached down to him telepathy yes and not deadspeak but how could this be it whirled him like a top you he finally answered in her own medium as her flyer swooped to earth the long dead the no longer dead the undead lady karen harry and karen the threat of the icelands karen glided her flyer to earth at the northfacing front of the garden just beyond the low wall there where the ground sloped steeply away towards starside it was a good relaunch site and well known to her for this was where shed blinded the crazed lesk the glut cut out his heart and given his grotesque body to the gardens defenders for burning leaving the dwellers old house and making his way towards her through the dispersing mist the necroscope sent a dazed thought ahead of him is it really you karen or am i seeing and hearing things i mean how can this be real i saw you dead and broken on the scree where youd thrown yourself down from the roof of your aerie hah she answered and without malice but that was when you were seeing things harry keogh she had stepped through a break in the wall and stood poised there waiting for him silhouetted against wall and flyer both the latter a nightmare dragon thing but harmless for all its prehistoric design nodded salivated and blinked huge owlish eyes it swayed its flat spatulate head this way and that its damp gleaming manta wings were of fine flexible alveolate bone thinly sheathed in metamorphic flesh worm legs or thrusters bunched beneath the doughy bulge of its body harry looked at it and wondered why he felt no horror and very little pity for he knew that the thing had been fashioned from the flesh of trogs or travellers perhaps there was no more horror left in him or perhaps there was no more human except drawing closer to karen he knew that some of his emotions at least were still human she was breathtaking in the world beyond the sphere gate the world of men now an entire universe away her like had been quite unknown even her crimson eyes seemed beautiful now harry was awed by her beauty struck by it no less than when hed first seen her that time when she came here to join the gardens defenders in defiance of the wamphyri she had enthralled him then and did so again now he couldnt take his eyes off her he drank her in from the burnished copper of her hair down through every gorgeous curve of her body which whether halfhidden or halfexposed was always given emphasis by her sheath of soft white leather to the pale leather sandals on her feet open at the toes to show her toenails painted gold she was ravishing over her shoulders she wore a cloak of black fur and about her waist a wide black belt whose greymetal buckle was shaped into a snarling wolfs head the sigils significance was lost in the past dramal doombodys ancestors had passed it down to him and he in his turn had passed it to karen and not only his crest but dramal had given karen his egg too riveted for long moments by her weirdness her unearthly beauty and contrasting colours harry had paused now he moved closer face to face karen was even more beautiful more desirable countering his approach shifting her body to mirror his every move she displayed the sinuous motion of a gypsy dancer which he remembered so well but of course for upon a time shed been a traveller why only listen and he might hear the chime and jingle of her movements yes even when there was none to hear he heard these things now and then her telepathic voice chiming in his mind you very nearly killed me once harry and i should warn you my first reason for coming here was to return the favour she brought forward her right hand until now hidden behind her back her battle gauntlet was in position when she flexed her hand a torturers delight of blades hooks and small scythes gleamed silver in the starlight harry conjured a möbius door on his immediate right and fixed it there invisible it was the perfect bolthole if such were needed let karen take a swing at him hed merely feint right and disappear but these were thoughts he must keep to himself while out loud are you saying youre here to kill me to which in a voice that trembled at the very edge of her control she answered in kind and are you saying you dont deserve it still keeping his own mind guarded harry looked into hers and saw the furious passions brewing there saw anger bordering on rage but nothing of hatred also and very importantly he saw the lady karens loneliness they were two of a kind now i didnt understand what it was like to behe began and paused and tried again i mean i thought i was helping you curing you as of some vile disease but i admit it i did it for my son as much as for you for if i could cure you cure she spat the word out why dont you try curing yourself there is no cure necroscope surely you must know that by now he nodded took a chance and inched closer yet and yes i do know he answered but in a way i did cure you you had a vampire in you the sort the wamphyri called a mother if you had spawned so many vampires in the end it must diminish you kill you am i right well never know will we she growled harry stood directly before her less than a pace away well within the arc of her gauntlet so you came to kill me he nodded but surely you can see ive suffered my own change and surely you know in your heart that i was never your enemy karen i was merely innocent in my way she stared hard at him for a moment narrowed her eyes a little then nodded and smiled but it was more a sneer than a smile proper ive found you out she said i sense your door harry you took me there once remember you carried me from the garden to my aerie all in a moment and now theres another door right here beside you would you dare stand so close without it if so then do it show me how innocent you are he shook his head that was then he said as for now whatever i might wish to be i can only be wamphyri precious little of innocence in me now about as much as there is in you yes the thing within advised me to conjure a door for my protection or for its protection but the man which i still am tells me i dont need this safeguard that it makes anything i might say to you the things i want to say to you a mockery and while i live the man in me has the upper hand so be it he threw caution to the wind collapsed the möbius door and opened his mind wide to her in a few moments she read or scanned all that was written there for he kept nothing hidden but in telepathy to read is often to feel and most of all she felt his pain as great and greater than her own and his loss all of his losses whose total was so much more and she saw how lonely and empty he was which brought her own loneliness and emptiness into proper perspective but she was a woman and remembered certain things as his right hand closed in the curve of her waist at first gently then possessively so she bent her elbow at his side until her open gauntlet leaned loosely against his back and upperleft arm and she said do you recall the time i told you how id lusted after you in how many ways i lusted after you like a woman perhaps but certainly like a vampire and do you remember when you trapped me in my room how i tried to lure you i went naked writhing panting thrusting at you and you ignored me it was as if your flesh was iron and your blood ice no he husked in her ear drinking in the natural musk of her body drawing her to him and bending down his head to her my body was flesh and my blood was fire but i had set myself a course and must run it now its run she felt his need swelling to match to intensify her own so much need and was aware of his heartbeat like a hammer against her breast you youre a fool harry keogh she whispered as he crushed her even tighter and every nerve of her body thrilled as wamphyri instinct demanded that she scoop her gauntlet into the flesh and bone of his back and spoon it out then reach inside and slice his heart to a crimsonpumping geyser thrilled yes and thrilled again in astonishment when she relaxed her hand so that the weapon fell from her fluttering fingers fell loose to the ground even as great a fool as i am she moaned then sinking redpainted razorsharp nails through cloth and skin and shivering flesh into his back and neck as he in turn wrenched her sheath dress apart and clutched her bruisingly wherever his hands would reach and bit her face and mouth until the blood flowed which is to say she panted when finally they held each other burning at bay a very great fool indeed they flew to her aerie mounted behind her in the ornate saddle at the base of the flyers neck where its manta wings sprouted harry must cling to karen or risk falling in which case he would conjure a door and fall through it into the möbius continuum but he would not fall while he fondled her straining breasts whose nipples were nuggets under her ruined sheath and he would not fall while his manhood strained in the crevice of her delicious behind surging there as if to lift her out of her seat wait she had told him back there in the garden at the wall where with his newfound wamphyri passions he would have taken her immediately and ploughed her like a field of yielding flesh and wait shed repeated twice during the flight when hed moaned louder than the wind in her ear and bitten the back of her neck and she had felt his metamorphic flesh flowing to enfold her while his hands enlarged and flattened as if to touch all of her at once and yet again wait oh wait she had pleaded with him when the flyer set them down in a launchinglanding bay some levels lower than her topmost apartments and she had almost to flee before his lust across the cartilage causeways and up stairways of fretted bone to her rooms but at last he caught her in her bedroom and knew that the waiting was over for both of them harry had made love so very recently yet now it was all forgotten and perhaps not surprisingly for if space and time are so linked as to be inextricable to any ordinary man just how long ago was it since he had known penny a dimension ago an entire universe and as a universe is huge almost to infinity how then the timegap between universes time is relative as the necroscope knew only too well but in any case that earlier phase now seemed fuzzy as a dream while now was the only reality penny had been a mirage a dreamcreature a waif light as thistledown enthralled and drawn into his dream with him and at last destroyed by it but karen was woman she was substantial compelling consuming a magnet with gravity of her own great as a small planet so that she held him like a moon to light her flesh and lust after it for harry she was the embodiment of all earthly unearthly desire greater than a mere planet she was his own personal black hole which might suck him in in his entirety indeed karen was all of this and more karen was wamphyri upon her bed they twined and tangled panted grunted and groaned and in all truth harry no longer knew what was real and what was fantasy he had not previously explored his metamorphism he didnt know the extent of fleshly flexibility he was innocent in respect of his own passions potential and karen too innocent or very nearly so you have kept yourself to yourself the necroscope gaspingly inquired of his vampire love while extending a hand and its fingers within her to examine and caress all of her innermost organs and places and while she moistened with spittle the shining fist which was his glans and taunted its throbbing with the slither of her forked tongue no she groaned truthfully twice i flew to sunside at sundown to seek me out a lover but how may one seduce a terrified man anyway i brought one back here in a little while he overcame something of his fear and crept into my bed ah i was a yawning chasm an aching gorge into which he dropped a pebble he could not fill me i milked him dry and wanted more but all he had left was blood i knew that i could grind him down turn him to pulp murder him within the heart of my womanhood and devour him into myself as easily as eating him but i took him back to sunside since when ive kept me to myself yes just as men and women are for each other so we wamphyri may only cleave unto wamphyri flesh for theres no pleasure in beasts and when wamphyri blood is up humanity is frail all true gurgled the necroscope feeling her left nipple extend into his throat like a tongue while his scrotum swelled to bursting from the pressure of his juices a woman would die in agony from what i have done to you likewise a man from these caresses of mine she replied shuddering but of pleasure however monstrous and she drew out his great soft spidercrab hand from her body folded his legs at the knees and fed them into herself until finally he was drawn in to his navel and she experienced the geysering of his cold semen laving her palpitating innards and yet the old lords in their time took traveller women for themselves harry panted in his delirium she was full of him now her pale belly round and shining grotesquely bloated where his arms and hands encircled it and her body had so gorged on him that he looked halfborn she coiled herself forward to kiss him and their teeth clashed as the flesh of their faces melted into one face a moment later she extruded him in a huge contraction but just as quickly he entered her again headfirst this time so that she must speak to him telepathically to answer his query those women died screaming she said ive heard it said that following a raid lesk the glut would take ten or more in a night bursting them like bladders with his sex ah that was violation but the socalled lords werent all alike if a girl was beautiful then she might survive brought on by degrees she would be vampirized and as her metamorphosis progressed so her satyr lord would instruct her the lord magula fashioned himself a huge mound of a woman and slept within her when their excesses exhausted him she expanded herself convulsively to let him out then fell on him and grasped at his slick body with exploratory hands of her own the wamphyri equivalent of talking dirty had incensed them what orifices could be entered of each of them were entered their kisses fetched blood their juices drenched the bed and dripped from it on to the floor all around they themselves flopped damply from the bed slipping and sliding in their own liquids harrys system endlessly manufactured semen which was endlessly sucked from him by karens various lips they let their vampires run rampant scythe teeth nibbled but never so deep as the bone and nails like claws of tyrannosaur pulled and gouged but only to bruise never to break they reduced the bedclothes to drenched rags the slate bed itself to rubble the huge room to a shambles their lovemaking lustmaking grew frantic and impossible to follow in its contortions and convolutions their cries became primal as their bodies shared totally they knew sex as no merely human beings had ever known it the necroscopes greatest climax of many was when karen entered him for fifteen hours they spent themselves vented tormented and demented themselves so that in the end they didnt merely sleep but fell unconscious in each others coils when harry came out of it karen was washing him dont he said feebly trying to push her away a waste of time i want you again now while youre still here still here she took his member in her hand to cool its bruises with water and watched it grow there like a club its a dream karen a dream he gasped his hand seeking her softness like everything gone before dreams of a madman i know it now for sure for i saw you lying dead yet here now you live unless is there a necromancer in starside she shook her head drawing back from him a little where his hands began to pull with some insistence at her once more entirely human breasts and it were best if you listened to me harry she said i wasnt dead that time it wasnt me you saw lying there broken in the bony scree not you then who do you remember when you starved me karen stared hard earnestly even accusingly at him do you remember how you lured my vampire out of my body with a trail of pigs blood ah but i was wamphyri and crafty the mother creature inside me was crafty more so than any other she it left an egg in me the tenacity of the vampire harry you you were still wamphyri his mouth had fallen halfopen even after i burned your vampire and its eggs you burned all but one she insisted which remained in me the thing would grow again yes but i knew that if you suspected as much then that youd try again and then that i would die oh and the thought of that terrified me i remember how i slept harry licked dry almost desiccated lips i was even more exhausted than now by what id seen and done yes she nodded you fell asleep in a chair which was when i was saved for while you slept one of mine returned to the aerie one of yours a creature harry frowned but they were all destroyed or sent away sent away yes she answered you had set this one free out of the goodness of your heart sent her away to die her a trog a handmaiden a creature who performed menial tasks within the aerie and in my personal chambers but she had been born here and understood no other existence and eventually she returned to the only home shed ever known i knew it the moment she set foot on the bottom step of the nethermost stairwell she heard my mindcall and came as fast as she could but she was starved from her wandering in the cold wilderness of starside and wearied unto death by her climb through all the aeries levels even unto death aye she died harry felt karens small sadness as at the death of a favourite pet the vampire lady nodded but not before shed removed the silver chains from my door and disposed of the potted kneblasch plants then she collapsed and died and i saw my chance while still you slept i dressed her corpse in my best white dress and bundled it from the ramparts she fluttered down down almost as if she flew but in the end she rushed to the rocks and was broken this was what you saw when you looked down from that high balcony harry but me i was in hiding where i stayed until you were gone from here the necroscope saw it all now i went back to the dwellers garden he said my son knew what id done fearing for his own existence he took my powers from me then transported me back to my own world where for a time i was only a man but i discovered monsters there and they discovered me until as you can see in the end i set myself against one vampire too many karen had settled down between his spread legs despite the seriousness of their discussion of past events harrys shaft pounded there like a second heart where her fingers teased the shining rim of its bell she paused a while to moisten its pulsing tip with her snakes tongue and to trap its swaying trunk between her breasts and how strong you are harry she sighed perhaps wonderingly indeed i do believe youre full again to see your face he answered to smell your body and feel you wet in your core how could i be other than full again he lifted her up to seat her on his rod but instead she slipped from his grasp and stepped down from the bed not here she panted oh there she said there in that secret place of yours the möbius continuum to make love there why not is it a holy place harry didnt answer but it could well be it could well be will you take me there harry and will you take me fuck me there oh yes he answered throatily and ill show you a place you just wont believe where we can fuck for a second or a century as you will she flew into his arms and he rolled her out of the sheets and into the möbius continuum but theres no light she hissed opening her legs wide and guiding him into her i need to see you the way your face quakes when you come the slackening of your mouth as the throbbing subsides and the aching starts you shall have light he grunted nodding and in the next moment felt a deadly fear for that had been close to blasphemy but he had not intended it she would have light yes blue light green and a little red and as she clawed at his buttocks and rode his bucking whipping piston shaft so he foamed within her and carried her moaning through a futuretime door and now she saw the future racing away from her and the scarlet light streaming from her own body with only the faintest trace of blue indeed karens light mingled with harrys twining even as their bodies twined and his was only slightly less red than hers our lifelines he told her we ride them into our future and then quoting faéthor we ride there faster than life we ride each other into the future she answered thrilling to the starburst sensation of it and to the shock of harry bursting inside her and in a little while the blues travellers he told her true human beings then the handful of reds can only be wamphyri survivors in the icelands and the greens must be trogs i i never saw such colours such light even the brightest auroras over the icelands were never as bright as this harry plied her breasts like dough in his hands and came yet again and she felt his seed spraying her inner walls and shuddered to its gush your come is cold as a waterfall no its hot but cool against your insides which are a volcano it only feels that way she moaned for in truth were both cold harry both of us were wamphyri he answered but we arent undead weve never been dead not in the way some vampirized people die and sleep a while before their rebirth from the grave i had expected to be cold certainly expected to feel the lust of the wamphyri their raw roaring appetite for life and for all dark carnal experience but with nothing of enduring emotion but this is much more than that other than that for you perhaps she answered for youre not long a vampire and yet maybe youre right this isnt as i imagined it the old wamphyri were liars as anyone knows could it be that they lied about this too incapable of love they said but were they or merely incapable of owning up to it is it weak to love someone harry and is it strong to be cold and without love he welded himself to her all of his parts melting into hers cold he growled well if were that cold then why is our blood so hot and if were that weak then why do i feel so strong no i think youve got it in one the last and most blatant lie of the wamphyri that they were without love they werent they were merely afraid to admit it and the necroscope knew that at last the truth of the matter was exposed the wamphyri had always been capable of dark passions desires and deeds beyond the human range but now on the same far side of the spectrum he and karen had discovered in themselves genuine equally powerful bonding emotions and letting those emotions rule could only properly be described as an ecstasy however sudden weird and alien their love they were true lovers there was lust in it of course but was there ever a love affair between man and woman without lust as a single fused mass the first halfhuman couple ever to cleave to one another in the fullest sense of the word they sped down the future timestream until out of nowhere suddenly a new light golden fire incredible bursting allconsuming at first harry thought it was some strange and wonderful effect of their sex their love but it was more than that the great throbbing onenote ahhhhhh chorus of the future which was not sound at all as such but the minds reaction to a threedimensional display of everexpanding time changed in the space of a single moment to a fiery hissssss and the necroscope brought their headlong rush to an abrupt tumbling halt partly extricating themselves but still mainly fused they spun on an axis of their own while time rushed on and karen temporarily blind sank needle claws into harrys shoulders to gasp what was that but the necroscope even harry keogh had no answer as his own eyes adjusted to the golden brilliance and his mind to the sear and the sizzle so he glanced back at what had been like looking into the heart of an exploding blue star where chemical imbalances caused red and green imperfections back there all was as before but up ahead in future time harrys and karens threads of life were no longer red but bright gold where they rushed out of their bodies into the future and the future itself was a blaze of gold tinged with the leaping orange flares of fire slowly the brazen yellow glare diminished and faded away smoking into darkness like embers drenched in rain and the lifelines of the two vanished with it beyond this point there was no future for them not on starside but there was a future for some for the dazed blue lifelines raced on likewise the greens though there were fewer of them now but as for the reds nowhere a sign of them and the darkness seemed greater than the light a disaster harry thought and karen heard him but what happened what will happen here baffled he could only shake his head and shrug the greens seem sickly they are dying it was so a good many trog lifelines grew dim flickered low and blinked out even as they watched but the necroscopes heart picked up again as he noted that others seemed to gain strength and brightness to speed on and he breathed a mental sigh of relief as new lines commenced to spark into existence signifying new births and beginnings then he gathered his startled wits conjured a door and drew karen through it into the more nearly normal flux of metaphysical being but what happened she clung to him even tighter i dont know he shook his head and guided her through a final door emerging from the möbius continuum onto the roof of her aerie and facing into a cold wind off starside he added but whatever it was it will happen be sure feeling her shivering where she huddled in his arms and sensing her despair he stared inquiringly into her crimson eyes perhaps i know she told him then for weve sensed their resurgence a while now we he allowed her to lead him below out of the starlight and into the aeries topmost rooms your son and i she nodded while he was still himself and their resurgence them but even asking so harry worked out the answer for himself and now too he understood lardis lidescis anxiety and animosity in the dwellers garden the wamphyri she nodded the old lords condemned to the icelands but not content with the icelands they passed through massive fiercely frescoed halls of fretted bone and carved stone descended cartilage stairs to her chambers where they collapsed into great chairs and in a while tell me all harry grunted it had started on harrys time scale two years earlier which was to say two years after the battle for the dwellers garden whose outcome had been the defeat and rout of the old wamphyri lords sensing a threat from the icelands karen went on i requested an audience with the dweller during which i confided in him the substance of my fears by that time he knew well enow that i had survived your cure but in any case there was a truce between us after all id fought alongside you and your son against the wamphyri he could not doubt but that i was his ally occasionally i would visit him in the mountains and there were times when he even came to see me here we were friends you understand nothing more but they were strange times the change was on him he was losing human flesh and putting on the shape and ways of a wolf still and all and while he retained the mind of a man we became true allies a second time for he too in his way had felt the icelands threat a weird foreboding that waxed and waned with the auroras a doom which crouched there like a beast on the frozen frontier all hunched down into itself and tensed ready to spring i have said he sensed it in his way your son is a wolf now necroscope with a wolfs senses and instincts across all the leagues he could smell them on the winds out of the north see them riding in the auroras hear them whispering and plotting plotting their return and their revenge aye their revenge harry on the dweller and his people on me on any and all who had helped defeat them destroy their aeries and banish them into the great cold which is to say on you too except of course you were not here at that time there was only the dweller and myself and going the way he was it would not be long before i was alone i asked him what must be done we must set guards he told me out there in the cold waste to look north and report back on any curious incursions from the icelands guards you must make them he said are you not wamphyri and dramal doombodys rightful heir didnt he show you how indeed i know how to make creatures i told him then do it he barked make warriors but make them male and female make them so they can make themselves selfreproducing the very idea made me gasp but that is forbidden even the worst of the old wamphyri lords would never have dared would not even consider which is why you must do it he was forceful aye for it will save you time at the vats make them so they can live and breed on the ice and feed themselves on the great fishes which live under the ice but build them with a safety device only three whelps to a pair and all males after that theyll die out soon enough but not until theyve reported whatever it is that threatens and done battle with it when it comes rumbling out of the north karen shrugged your son had great wisdom necroscope he knew good from evil and knew the source of the worst possible evil but his humanity was failing fast he knew that when the time came he would not be able to help me and so he would help me now with good advice i thought it was good anyway and in the icelands harry queried shaithis is it him karen shuddered none other and not alone oh she grasped his arm do you remember that time at the garden the fire and thunder the gas beasts exploding in the sky and raining their guts down on everything the screams of trogs and travellers when wamphyri lords and lieutenants came strutting with their gauntlets dripping red harry nodded i remember all of that also how we seared them with the dwellers lamps blinded their flyers set your warriors against theirs and finally reduced them to vile evaporation with rays from the sun itself but not all of them she said and shaithis was only one of the survivors who else the giant fess ferenc and the hideous volse pinescu also arkis leperson plus several lieutenants and thralls none of these were accounted for in the fighting we must assume they fled north after discovering their aeries shattered and tumbled down to the plain the necroscope breathed a sigh of relief no more than a handful then she shook her head shaithis on his own would be more than a handful harry not then when we had your son and his army to side with but now when we have only survivors and what of all the other lords banished and driven into the icelands throughout wamphyri history what if they have survived too prior to the battle in the garden all such went singly slinking never in a group or they might be allowed to take a woman and the odd thrall with them perhaps shaithis and the others have found them and organized them into a small army but could any army of the wamphyri ever be said to be small it could be worse than that harry gloomed at her if they took women with them if they could live with the unending cold why shouldnt they breed like your warriors lets face it we dont even know what the icelands are like maybe the only thing that kept icelanders from invading all of this time was the fact that the old wamphyri were stronger but now there are no old wamphyri only us the new wamphyri also she reminded him out there at the rim of the cold and sluggish sea a dozen or more warriors watchers guards you followed my sons advice and made yourself some creatures yes but she looked away out of what and why do you avoid my eyes karen snatched her head round to glare her defiance at him i avoid nothing i found my materials in the stumps of the shattered aeries in the workshops of the lords most were ruined crushed or buried forever but some were intact at first i blundered creating flyers which could not fly warriors which would not fight but gradually i perfected my art you have seen and ridden upon my flyer an exceptional beast likewise my warriors i made three pairs which were sound and fearsome and mighty who by now have made six or even nine more except and again she turned her face away harry caught her chin in a hand and turned it back again except for a while now they have not answered my calls i send my thoughts out across starside requesting information but they dont hear me or if they do they fail or refuse to answer harry frowned youve lost control over them she tossed her head it was something the old wamphyri were always afraid of to make creatures with a will of their own which might one day bolt and run wild mercifully i heeded the dwellers warning and they are doomed genetically therell be no females among the offspring harry gave a grunt so you have watchers who dont watch and warriors which wont war what other precautions have you taken against this threat from the icelands now she hissed at him do you snigger at my works necroscope and should i tell you how i had decided to meet the threat when and if it should arise remember before you came i was a woman alone and how do you think shaithis would deal with me with karen great traitor bitch of the wamphyri if he had survived the icelands and would now return here should i surrender myself to his tender mercies hah no not while i could defy him to the last defy him lit up in the blaze of her hair and eyes and in the gleam of her teeth harry was struck anew with the thought shes a volcano inside and out and out loud how defy him again she tossed her head why rather than have shaithis force himself upon me id give myself to a more destructive even more faithless lover for id mount my flyer and head south over the mountains and across sunside even into the brazen face of the sun itself let shaithis chase me there if he would into streaming gases and exploding flesh and nothingness so be it harry drew her into his arms and she came without resistance it wont come to that he husked stroking her hair while her furious tremors subsided not if i have anything to do with it but etched on the mirror of the necroscopes inner mind kept hidden even from karens telepathy was a scene out of future time which try as he might he could not banish a picture of a fiery molten gold future a vision of the end framed in the scarlet allconsuming fires of an ultimate hell again perchorsk the icelands now the hivelike caverns burnedout burrows and haunted magmass levels of the perchorsk projekt had seen a period of intense activity six days had passed since harry keoghs night visit with projekt direktor viktor luchov and his subsequent invasion of the core riding a powerful american motorcycle as a result of which a final terrifying scene had now been set the pieces were all in place for what luchov could only hope would be the permanent closure of the gate down in the core standing on the now deactivated recently cleaned and polished fishscale plates where they encircled the dimensional portal luchovs unblinking gaze fell in silent awe on the wouldbe instruments of that disconnection a pair of topsecret tokarev mk ii shortrange missiles in more common parlance nuclear exorcets mounted atop the compact caterpillartracked carriage of their greymetal launching and guidance module behind the smoked lenses of his plastic eyeshields the projekt direktors eyes were mere slits as if frozen in a wince or grimace for it had been his responsibility passed down from moscow to order the tokarevs armed and programmed he knew only too well what he had here knew that obscene slugs of toxic metal had been loaded into the slender steel bellies of the missiles where now they lay quiescent but ready on the instant to spring shrieking awake all it required was the push of a button a group of military technicians in white smocks were busy in the vicinity of the tokarevs checking and doublechecking electrical hookups semiautomatic and computerized systems radiation levels other instrument readings their senior man directly responsible to the projekt direktor touched luchovs arm and caused him to give a start vainly trying to conceal his nervous reaction the direktor barked yes what is it the man was young no more than twentysix or seven but already a major he wore upon his lapels the crown of his rank inside the stylized atomic nucleus insignia of the special artillery arm sir he formally reported were all ready here from now on or until these weapons are required for use there will always be two of us on duty here armed of course as a safeguard against sabotage we are aware that the projekt has a history of er intruders luchov nodded yes very good but hed scarcely been paying attention turning jerkily away from the tokarevs and pointing towards the glaring sphere of the gate he said and do you know what youre on guard against from that i mean are you sure that if ever its required youll know just exactly when to press the button the other stiffened he knew his duty well enough a pity he now found himself in a position where he must take orders from a damned civilian thats all he was tempted to answer luchov in just such terms and from the heart except it had been made adequately clear to him that the senior scientist was a power in his own right and so ive acquainted myself with the projekts history certainly sir he said coldly also weve watched all of the films but in any case the firing sequence may not be initiated except on your instructions listen luchov turned more fully towards him fixed him with a wideeyed glare and grasped his arm in a trembling claw thats your brief yes but it doesnt say everything indeed it says very little youve seen the films good but you cant smell them can you they cant spring out from the screen and swallow you whole can they nodding wildly and again pointing at the glaring white upper hemisphere of the gate he continued hoarsely in there a curse a plague something to make chernobyl seem of no consequence whatsoever if it they whatever got out into the world thats the end i mean of everything mankind joins the dinosaurs the trilobites the dodos gone so dont get snotty with me when i ask if you know what youre dealing with pale with barely suppressed anger the young officer came to attention and his thin mouth cracked open but luchov wasnt finished with him hadnt yet told him the worst listen he said again one week ago a man or something which was once a man went through that gate into whatever lies beyond when he went the world breathed a sigh of relief since when its been holding its breath we were glad to see the back of him because he was tainted a carrier only now we wonder how long before he finds his way back here and if he does what will he bring with him do you follow me so far something of the colour had returned to the majors face he sensed the importance of what the projekt direktor was saying the enormous stresses playing on his mind i follow you so far he nodded very well said luchov and now something which wasnt in your brief you mentioned our previous problem with intruders quite right we did have this problem we could have it again so now im going to add to your brief and issue a new order he pushed his face closer this one if i should get taken out if anything weird or inexplicable should happen to incapacitate me or even yes exclude me permanently from the scheme of things then youre the next in line consider yourself appointed here and now what the officer looked at luchovs pale shining face his hideously scarred skull and wondered if he was entirely sane you are appointing me projekt direktor indeed i am luchov was vehement as guardian of the earth yes guardian of press it luchov whispered cutting him short if anything should happen to me press the bloody thing dont delay dont waste time phoning gorbachev or those mumbling cretins who so poorly serve him but press the button get it over and done with and send your exorcets on a real mission of exorcism into the world beyond the gate before the devil himself comes spewing out of there right into your face have you got that the major took a pace to the rear his eyes were very wide now very concerned and still luchov held his arm in a steel grasp sir i abruptly luchov released him straightened up a little and stiffened his back and shoulders then glanced away say nothing he gave a curt almost dismissive nod for the moment dont say anything at all but neither must you forget what i said dont you dare forget it thats all how to answer him with a smile which might be misinterpreted with words but luchov had advised him to say nothing and anyway the major had no words perhaps it were better if he simply forgot the whole incident except luchov had warned him about that too and anyway would it be a wise move to forget that this possibly dangerous man was in charge here and in so doing to forget what he was in charge of saving the major from further embarrassment and possibly worse a hatch in the fishscale plates clanged back on its hinges and a maintenance engineer came up from below staggering a little as he stood up in the glare of the gate he wrenched breathing apparatus from his pale damp face and put on plastic goggles then he reached out a groping hand as if seeking support and staggered again luchov recognized him went to him at once with the major following on behind felix szalny the projekt direktor took the mans arm steadied him is it you felix he could be familiar when he thought the situation required it but you look like you saw a ghost the coveralled maintenance man small balding smudged with grime nodded he blinked his eyes rapidly and glanced back towards the open hatch the next best thing anyway direktor he muttered almost to himself wiping cold sweat from his brow with a rag what is it luchov felt the short hairs rising at the back of his neck which they were wont to do all too often in this place something below down there in one of the sealed shafts which was part of the original complex yes szalny answered i was checking a wormhole hotspot curiously the radiation has decreased almost to background its no longer dangerous anyway so i opened up the seal and and entered eventually the wormhole came out into the old abandoned reactor maintenance level in there i found magmass of course ah luchov knew what had happened or thought he did there were bodies bodies yes szalny answered nodding that was part of it at least theyd been roasted inverted transformed some were halfin halfout of the magmass like mummies wrapped in warped rock rubber and plastic and even after all these long years of entombment lord still i fancied i could hear their screams luchov was well able to picture it he had been a scientist here in perchorsk when the hideous accident happened he still bore the scars both upon his seared parchment skull and more permanently in his mind which was why he now shuddered its as well you came up out of there he said later you can take a team down and clean the place out but for now i i tripped over something szalny was still dazed still talking almost to himself because as yet he hadnt told it all something crumbled into dust where i stepped on it so that i stumbled and crashed against a cyst which immediately shattered the young major touched luchovs elbow but this time very carefully did he say something about a cyst the direktor glanced at him oh and are you interested and without waiting for an answer nodding grimly he continued then you must see it for yourself he called over a private soldier and sent him hurrying off on an errand and while they waited can we borrow a couple of these radiation tags from your staff here and then to szalny felix i want you to go and sit in one of those chairs on the perimeter and finally to a second soldier you there go and get this man a mug of hot tea and hurry luchov and the major clipped radiation hazard tags to their clothing the first soldier returned with a pair of gas masks slinging these over their shoulders the pair descended through the steel hatch into the lower half of the chamber down there the gate glared on them from where it hung suspended weightless in the centre of spherical space reaching the bottom of the steel ladder luchov stepped carefully down between the gaping mouths of circular shafts cutting at all angles into the giant stone bowl of the floor these were wormholes energy channels which had been eaten through the solid granite in the first seconds of the perchorsk accident when previously rigid matter had taken on the consistency of dough watch how you go he called up to the young officer and give a wide berth to wormholes with their radiation seals intact theyre still a little hot of course youd know all about that sort of thing wouldnt you he set out to negotiate the perfectly smooth cold stone floor following corrugated rubber steps which had been laid down to provide for a firmer tread and climbing away from the hub they were soon obliged to use iron rungs where these had been grafted into a sloping floor which gradually curved into the vertical which was also when luchov drew level with a threefoot diameter shaft whose leadlined manhole seal had been left standing open hed first spotted the open hatch as he came down the ladder and guessed that this was where szalny had been working for corroboration a pocket torch with the maintenance engineers name scratched into its plastic casing lay where szalny had left it in the wormholes gaping mouth luchov took up the torch and lighting the way ahead he crawled into the hole still interested are you his almost sardonic voice echoed back to the major who followed on hands and knees good but if i were you id put on that gas mask szalny had left a rope attached to the last rung it snaked out of sight into the wormhole which wound first to the left then tilted into a gentle descent for maybe thirty feet before levelling out and finally turned sharply right into darkness into the permanent midnight of a place long abandoned in the old days luchov breathed where he pierced the smoky darkness with a shaft of light and lowered himself carefully to the lumpy uneasyfeeling floor they used to service the pile from down here his voice maskmuffled had become a susurrating echo but of course that was before the pile ate itself the young officer was close behind clambering awkwardly out of the wormhole he stood up and caught hold of luchovs smock to steady himself but luchov was pleased to note that the majors hand shook and his breathing was a little panicked probably from unaccustomed exertion indeed mainly from that until luchov let the beam of the torch creep across the walls the floor the magmass inhabitants of the place then the majors breathing turned to panting and his shaking got a lot worse until after a while he gasped my god luchov stepped carefully fastidiously over anomalous and yet homogeneous debris over debris which had tried to be homogeneous anyway when the accident happened he said matter became very flexible and flowing a melting pot without the heat oh there was some heat a lot in places but that was mainly chemical reaction or nuclear residual it had little to do with the way rock rubber plastic metal flesh and bones melted together into this this was a different sort of heat an alien sort the result of the forging of the gate as you can see things get tangled at the crossroads of universes abruptly his slithering torch beam passed over and immediately returned to something in the wall szalnys cyst a fine eggshell sheath of magmass stone like a mansized blister clinging there but broken open now and dripping black stuff on the nightmarish floor even with their masks filtering out any poisons still they could smell it their movements and luchovs muffled echoing voice had disturbed it as they stared so sticky black bones came lolling out of it after that the major didnt stop moving and mouthing panting and gasping until he was back through the wormhole to the whiteglaring core where finally at the foot of the ladder he paused removed his mask and threw up having followed him luchov stood off at a safe distance and watched and as the young officer finished but continued to kneel there hanging like a limp rag on the lower rungs so the projekt direktor said so now you begin to understand you understand something of the horror this place has seen inherent in its atmosphere indeed in its walls down here sealed in by the magmass and in other places bricked up by men who couldnt bear to contemplate it there is much horror ah but up there he lifted his eyes to the belly of the steel disc with its overlapping plates on the other side of that madly glaring cyclops gate there is so much more an entire world of horror for all we know which is still alive the major wiped his mouth i could see it in your eyes that you thought id cracked luchov told him well of course i have do you really think id be here if i was entirely sane the major coughed into his hand and mumbled my god my god luchov nodded and without malice said nice thought but what has he to do with this place eh he shook his head very little i fear and the longer youre here the more godless it gets to be not even attempting to answer the other continued to cling tightly to the ladders rungs below the caldera of an ancient volcano in a place not unlike subterranean perchorsk and yet an entire universe away a place of wormhole lavaruns and sulphur walls where ages ago superheated gas had expanded to form caverns like bubbles in chocolate and the liquid guts of a planet had first forced and then made permanent a spiderweb network of channels in the permeable rock this was where the monstrous lord shaitan had made his home in a time immemorial and here just four years ago his descendant shaithis of the wamphyri had discovered him alive and plotting still now standing tall but dramatically insignificant against the dark uppermost fangs of the calderas broken walls like a statue there on the old cones lava rim under writhing auroral vaults shot through with the occasional scar of a meteorites suicide and gazing south upon a far faint horizon shaithis selected and highlighted memories of those years of how theyd passed of what hed seen and learned and of what had been planned by his ancestor shaitan and by himself plans which purported to coincide though not necessarily indeed not at all and guarding such thoughts ah but jealously fearfully shaithis remembered his journey here from starside on the rim across surly iceberg oceans and vast wintry wastelands he and the other survivors of the dwellers wrath the giant fess hideous volse squat arkis and various thralls all fled here selfexiled under threat of a vampires death which is far more terrible than that of any mere man and not just from an entirely physical point of view for a man knows he must die but a vampire knows he need not four years ago aye after the whelky volses loathsome demise shaithis in his treachery had directed arkis leperson called diredeath and the acromegalic fess ferenc into the clutches of shaitan the unborn where in the shrieking sulphur shadows of an ancient lavarun that immemorial monster had struck out of his own mindsilence even now remembering how it had been shaithis gave an unaccustomed start the lightningswift shadowsilent attack of the siphonsnout as shaithis thought of such creatures now then arkis speared and held aloft on nimbly skipping tiptoes jerking and throbbing on the hollow bone blade where it pierced him to the heart eyes bulging and cheeks going in and out like a bellows puffing out a fine damp scarlet mist extremely fine that lifemist for shaitans ingurgitor had been loath to lose or spill a drop and fess the giant rounding on shaithis in a fury all intent upon tearing out his heart but shaitan to the rescue flowing out of the darkness like a tide of evil wrapping the berserker in a nest of tentacles while shaithis swung his gauntlet to burst his head in and the one final scene which remained fresh as steaming blood in shaithiss mind to this day the great pulsing mass of the ferenc held fast for long and long in shaitans manyarmed embrace until at last the giants throbbing ceased and elastic cobra jaws released his head leaving it wet and smoking and apparently whole except it was seen how the eyesockets were empty and trickling with similar dribbles escaping from the nostrils and slack yawning mouth and shaithis thinking a thought so cold it burned him still oh yes surely hells gate where ive just witnessed a socalled ancestor of mine emptying the ferencs head like a rat sucking out a stolen egg and indeed you have shaitan had at once gurglingly agreed while his crimson eyes in their yellow orbits glared out from the darkness beneath the black corrugated flesh of his cobras hood my creature siphoned off his blood for safekeeping until later you understand and i sucked out his brain but youll note how we left the best for you eh with which hed made a small effort to propel the corpse in shaithiss direction so that it had appeared to take two stumbling flopping steps towards him before crashing at his feet and of course hed known exactly what the other meant for hiding in the ferencs huge pale dehydrated shell his vampire ah sweetmeat of sweetmeats was still to be discovered and reckoned with and wont you join me shaitan had offered a clotted gurgled invitation before wrenching arkis from the bubbling blade of the ingurgitor and throwing him down to the lava floor there falling or flowing over him as he commenced to search for his frantic cringing parasite to this point events had left shaithis somewhat stunned but not for much longer he was after all wamphyri and all of this had been much as anticipated and of course the blood was the life dining with shaitan may even have sealed something of a bond between them it might have anyway after that there was a lot to remember and events contrived to jumble a good many fractured scenes and conversations overlapped their jagged edges in shaithiss memory as contrary breezes blew up off the cold blue starand auroralit waste bringing nodding snowdevils to swirl around the bases of the glittering plundered icecastle tombs of anciently exiled wamphyri so he attempted to arrange these fragments in chronological order or failing that to separate them at least shaitans cavernous workshop for example located immediately beneath the volcanos hitherto unseen northfacing scarp where soon after shaithiss advent the fallen one had escorted him upon a guided tour apart from the highceilinged stalactiteadorned vastness of the place with its nearopaque windows of ice looking out upon and lending grotesque distortion to the very roof of the world and its deep permafrost pits where shaitan was wont to confine in ice his more volatile less manageable experiments the workshop had seemed much like any other shaithis too was a master of just such creative metamorphism or so he had always considered himself until he saw his ancestors work gazing down on one such piece through ice clear as water he had offered his opinion this alone would suffice to have you denounced and banished afresh or destroyed outright if this were starside and the old wamphyri still held sway why it has reproductive organs which were forbidden a bull aye shaitan had answered with a nod of his cowl alas but procreation the act of copulation its contemplation even the possession of organs of the means drives creatures to rage i made this one a mate female which for thanks he at once tore to pieces but even if shed lived and brought forth what then i cannot see that hed permit offspring to survive but would surely devour them at the first opportunity just look at him and as yet halfgrown but so untrustworthy at last i was obliged to freeze him here the fault was his sex it made him prideful and pride is a curse its the same with men of course and therefore with the wamphyri shaithis had nodded more so shaitan cried for in them all such urges are amplified by ten but they dont tear their odalisks in pieces at least not always more fool them said shaitan for if you can live for ever what sense to breed that of your own flesh which may one day usurp and destroy you and yet you sought out women in which to spend yourself shaithis had been quick to point out else id not be here and at that their eyes had met and locked across shaitans creature frozen in its pit of ice and after a while the fallen one had answered i did its true and perhaps for that very reason it had been their first argument or discussion as such but only one of a great many to come and while it would soon become shaithiss complaint that his ancestor conversed with him in terms more befitting a child generally he accepted that the ancient evil being was trying to instruct him perhaps he considered his great age gave him the right for after all he was shaithiss senior to the extent of seven spans another time shaithis had been shown a developing siphonsnout absorbing liquids where it gradually took on shape and substance in a vat the thing was much similar to the guardian ingurgitors of which the volcanos master had three but the siphon was longer more flexible and bedded at its roots in great walls of flesh so that the creatures tiny greedily glittering eyes were almost entirely hidden in bulging bands of grey gleaming muscle shaithis had known immediately what the thing was enquiring of shaitan but dont you have enough of these it surprises me you trouble yourself to make more by now youve surely had the best of the iceencysted wamphyri those of them who were readily got at anyway so what use to persist shaitan had cocked his cobras head on one side coiled up his arms and inquired and have you fathomed it all my son do you know the precise use to which theyre put these things of mine certainly they are variations on a theme ingurgitors not unlike that or those which stopped volse and arkis but rather more specialized their slender bonetipped cartilage snouts vibrate in ice to shatter it whereby paths are drilled to the suspended exiles in their otherwise impenetrable sheaths once a channel has been cut then the beast drains off its victims liquids through its snout which siphoned fluids are then regurgitated into my reservoirs shaitan perhaps peeved with shaithiss ingenuity had finished it for him yes yes but arent you curious to know how how may the driller siphon off solids eh for of course his victims are mainly frozen whose fluids gurgle like glue ah shaithis had been fascinated i will explain in a moment as to why i bother myself with these old lords when as youve pointed out theyre now so few in number and invariably low in sustenance the answer to that is simple because it pleases me to do so the terror in the minds of those of them who can still think at all is so rare and delicious as to be exquisite if i had not them then whom would i terrify eh could i even exist without my measure of tyranny and terror and shaithis had understood evil feeds on terror without one the other cannot exist they are inseparable as space and time and reading his thoughts shaitan had whisperingly gurglingly chortlingly agreed aye its simple as that i like it and i need the practice so that was why and the how of it was likewise simple the drillers squirted metamorphic acids into their victims whose desiccated tissues then dissolved into liquids which were drawn off before they could resolidify it still doesnt answer my first question shaithis had argued which was why do you trouble to make more of these creatures shaitans shrug of sorts i say again mainly for the practice as has been almost everything ive done these last three thousand years practice yes towards the time when we shall build an army of warriors and with them set out against starside and all the worlds beyond for a moment the scarlet eyes beneath the fallen ones cobras hood had burned more brightly yet like fires stoked from within but then hed nodded gradually returned from the privacy of his darkcloaked thoughts and said ah but now you must tell me since you seem of the opinion that i breed too many just how many of my icedrillers and kindred creatures have you seen shaithis had been taken aback hed imagined a great many such beasts to be sure but what evidence hed seen of them in the looted icecastles had been the slow work of countless centuries in no way the concerted effort of a handful of auroral periods nor even entire cycles of such and while here in the workshops at the roots of the volcano several vats steamed and bubbled where shaitans experiments continued to shape still there were precious few working beasts no flaccid siphoneers here as in starsides aeries for the cones caldera contained a small lake of water nor any great requirement for gasbeasts where several of the volcanos caverns especially shaitans living quarters were warmed by active blowholes so that after giving the question some little thought shaithis had been obliged to answer now that i think of it i cant say ive actually seen any except this one cooking in its vat exactly for there are none not of the visible mobileandeatingtheirheadsoff varieties at any rate i keep only my ingurgitors for the protection they afford me now come and shaitan had taken his descendant down to black lightless nethercaverns where every niche crevice and extinct volcanic vent served as a storage chamber for the iceencased progeny of his experimental vats and there he inquired of him so advise me how would you keep such as these both awake and fullbellied and answered himself out of the question what in these almost barren icelands you wouldnt which is why as their various purposes are served i freeze them into immobility down here and here they stay inert for the moment the raw materiel of tomorrows army and when i require another perhaps different sort of creature why i simply design and construct one the art of metamorphism shaithis but nothing wasted my son never that continuing to gaze down on his ancestors preserved experiments shaithis had nodded i see youve tried a warrior or two he commented fearsome but archaic perhaps i should advise you starsides warriors have come a long way since your day in all truth these things of yours would not last long against certain of my constructs if shaitan was offended it hardly showed then by all means instruct me in these superior metamorphic skills hed answered indeed and in order that you may do so you shall have complete freedom of my workshops materials and vats which had been much to shaithiss liking another time shaithis had asked what of your ingurgitors since plainly they are working beasts and since its your habit to separate them from what they take from their victims how do you sustain them on what do you feed them for as you yourself have pointed out these icelands are very nearly barren shaitan had then shown him his reservoirs of frozen blood and minced metamorphic flesh explaining ive been here a long long time my son and when i first came here ah but i quickly learned what it meant to go hungry since when ive made provision not only for myself but for my creatures both now and in the dawn of our resurgence in blank astonishment shaithis had gazed upon the rims of literally dozens of potholes of black plasma blood so much blood but not from the frozen lords surely there were never sufficient of the wamphyri in all starside to fill these great bowls beast blood shaitan told him whale blood too yes and even a little man blood but you are correct only a very little of the latter the blood of beasts and great fishes is fine for my creatures it will fuel them to war when that time is come following which why therell be food aplenty for all eh but the man blood is mine and yours too now that youre here for our sustenance shaithis had been even more astonished youve bled the great fishes in the cold sea actually while i called them fishes they are mammals shaitan had shrugged in his fashion theyre warmblooded those giants and suckle their young soon after i came here i saw a school at play spouting at the rim of the ocean so that my first ingurgitor was designed with them in mind it was a good design and ive scarcely changed it down the centuries doubtless youve noted the vestigial gills fins and other seeming anomalies in the volcanos guardian creatures likewise in my driller shaithis had noted those things indeed it was his habit to note everything on another occasion fascinated by the sheer age of his selfappointed mentor shaithis had thought to suggest but you have been here upon the earth in starside and in the icelands mainly in these frozen wastes almostsince the beginning even speaking those words he had realized how naive they must sound and how much in awe of the other he must seem which his ancestors dark chuckle had at once confirmed the beginning ah no for i perceive that the world is a million times older than i am or did you mean the beginning of the wamphyri in which case i can but agree for i was the first of all really again shaithis forgot to distance himself from his astonishment it was hard to be inscrutable in the face of revelations such as these of course the legends of starside said that shaitan the fallen had been the first vampire but as any fool is aware legends are like myths mainly untruths or at best exaggerations the first the father of us all the first of the wamphyri aye shaitan had answered at last after a long curious silence but not the father did you say no not the father oh i fathered my share be sure for i was young with a young mans appetites i had been a man entire and fallen to earth here where my vampire came to me came out of out of the swamps he paused leaving his words to taper into a thoughtful silence and after a while out of the vampire swamps shaithis had pressed him there are great swamps to the west of starside and according to legend others to the east i know of them but never saw them are these the swamps of which you speak shaitan was still distanced by strange reverie nevertheless he nodded those are the swamps aye i fell to earth in the west shaithis had heard him use this term about falling to earth before frowning and shaking his head hed said i fail to understand how may a man fall to earth out of the sky do you mean from your mothers womb but werent you also called the unborn where did you fall from and how shaitan had snapped out of it you are a nosy person and your questions are rude still ill answer them as best i may first understand this my memories start at the swamps and even then they are faded and incomplete before the swamps i im not sure but when i came naked to this world i came in great pain and great pride i believe that i was exiled into this place thrown down here even as the wamphyri exiled me at last to these icelands the wamphyri exiled me because i would be the one power well and perhaps i had tried to be a power in that other place too wherefrom i was banished and fell to earth it is a mystery to me but this i do know compared to the other place this world was like a hell someone had sent you here as a punishment to a life of hell or to a world which could become a hell of my making it was a question of will anything could be if i so willed it or allowed it to be i repeat it was because i was wilful and prideful that i was here or at least that is how i seem to remember it you do not actually remember falling then only that you were suddenly there in the vampire swamps close to the swamps yes where my vampire came into me shaithis had been keenly interested in that last in our time he mused weve both had occasion to kill enemies and tear their living vampires out of them to devour fess ferenc and arkis leperson were only the most recent we know what such parasites look like fullformed they are barbed leeches which hide in men to shape their thoughts and urges and in certain hosts over long periods they may grow so fused as to become inseparable as in myself yes shaitan had answered indeed there remains precious little of the original me at all while my vampire is grown to what you see just so said shaithis you or rather your vampire as a result of prolonged metamorphism is now gross but how was it then did it come to you as an egg did the parent creature remain in the swamps or did the parasite come to you full grown take you by surprise and slither into you complete it came to me from the swamp shaitan had repeated that much i know how i do not know the problem had vexed shaithis and his ancestor no less but on that occasion at least theyd been lost for further questions and answers a good many auroral periods later however when shaithis was busy in a corner of the workshop carefully constructing a warrior for his ancestors approval this is how it was said shaitan coming swiftly and in some excitement upon shaithis where he worked and flowing up to him like a midnight shadow in that earliest existence of which i apprised you i served another or others but desired to serve only myself as a reward for my pride which is to say for my wit and great beauty of which i was perhaps too much aware and for my pains i was thrown out and removed from my rightful place in that society i was not destroyed not wasted but used i became to them a tool a seed of evil which they would sow between the spheres do you see i was the folly and the penance i was the darkness which allows for the light in the face of this outburst shaithis had brought his work at the vat to a halt unable to understand the other he could only shake his head and throw up his hands cant you explain yourself more clearly damn you no shaitan had shouted then i dreamed it i know it for the truth but i cannot understand it ive told it to you so that you also may attempt to fathom it and likewise fail to fathom it even as i have failed with which and in a fury he had rushed off and disappeared into the volcanos labyrinth for a long time after that shaithis had not seen the other at all he had merely been aware of his ancestors shadowy presence but a time had come when going again to the vats hed found the ancient gloomily examining his various adaptations where they squirmed and hardened in their liquids and there following customary greetings but in answer to no specific remark or query shaitan had listlessly mumbled i have been banished out of many spheres and thrown down from many worlds aye and others like me throughout all the myriad coneshaped dimensions of light that had been all mad creature shaithis had kept this thought and others he was thinking very much to himself but its as well you rush around crazed while im about my work the last thing i would want is for you to become interested in what im doing now for in fact he was there at that time in order to inject brain matter into his new construct so stimulating and even directing the foetal ganglions growth except these were cells obtained from a rather special source and by means of shaitans iceboring ingurgitor putting all such business aside for the nonce however and pandering to shaitans insanity if that is what it was he had answered in which case when we go against starside with these warriors im fashioning your revenge will be so much sweeter nothing will stand before us and if there are higher worlds to conquer they too shall finally fall even as you fell to earth his words had seemed to suffice to draw the other up from whatever morbid depths claimed him even so far as to correct his temporary imbalance and indeed these appear to be good warriors my son hed at once remarked a rare compliment at once qualified by which they should be for in starside you had a sufficiency of superb clay with which to practise and after that the ancient rambled no more later still the two had constructed a slender streamlined powerful flyer equipped it with a sucking snout and given it the strippedtobasic brain of one of menor maimbites otherwise defunct lieutenants fuelling the beast on quality plasma theyd sent it on a reconnaissance flight to starside after that and over the space of a good many auroral displays theyd waited on its return but in vain eventually when almost all hope had faded then the flyer had returned bringing back with it a scrawny shivering waif of a traveller child a boy of eight or nine years the flyer had snatched him at sundown from a party of travellers where they camped in the hills over sunside it appeared that the travellers no longer went to earth when the sun sank down into night why should they when the wamphyri were no more but the return journey from starside had been long and the child almost dead from exposure shaitan had carried him away to his private chambers for questioning shortly thereafter the ancients mindcall had summoned shaithis from where he worked at the vats come a single word yes but its authors excitement had spoken volumes sundown exorcets the godmind shaithis stood tall and severe in the black gapped caldera wall and looked south towards starside overhead the aurora wove in a sky which was otherwise black but he knew that on starside it would be sunup the mountain peaks would be burning gold and in karens aerie thick curtains and tapestries woven with her sigil would guard the uppermost windows where lances of sunfire might otherwise strike through he looked south narrowing his scarlet eyes to focus upon a far faint line of fire all along the horizon a narrow golden haze which separated the distant curve of the world first from blue then black space where all the stars of night hung glittering and hypnotic seeming to beckon him which was a call he would answer soon indeed he must for when the aurora died to a flicker and the sky in the south darkened to jet then it would be sundown in advance of which shaithis and his devolved depraved ancestor would muster their warriors mount their flyers and launch a small but monstrous army from the volcanos steep lava slopes for them the realization of a dream and for starside the advent of a nightmare was finally in the offing shaitans dream for so many hundreds of years now looming into being brought into sharp relief by a lone flyers recent return out of starside with its burden of a stolen traveller waif shaithis remembered the event in minute detail the way his gloating ancestor had carried off the exhausted halfdead boy into the gloom of his sulphurfloored chambers following which eventually his mental summons come in his minds eye shaithis saw it all again the fallen one jubilant where he paced or flowed to and fro across the black grainy floor of his apartments in his excitement and before shaithis had been able to frame a question this dweller of whom youve spoken shaitan had turned to him this alien youth who used the power of the sun itself to bring down the mighty wamphyri yes what of him what of him shaitan had gurgled darkly delightedly in his fashion devolved thats what even as i myself am devolved but to his far greater cost so he bathed you all in blazing sunlight eh by which reducing wamphyri flesh to steam and stench well and he seared himself too his vampire must have been injured it could not repair itself his metamorphic manflesh sloughed away even as a lepers then his desperate vampire returned him to an earlier form that of its original host and manifestation less bulk in that making the wastage easier to contain dyou see and so your dweller is now a wolf a wolf astonished shaithis had remembered his dream a beast aye going on all fours a grey one the leader of the pack with nothing of powers except those of the wild the travellers hold him in awe whose forepaws are human hands a little of his mind must be human too at least in its memories and of course his vampire has survived in however small part for that was what saved him but the rest is wolf a wolf shaithis had breathed it again well it wasnt the first time hed experienced oneiromantic dreams it was an art of the wamphyri thats all and his father the helllander harry keogh he is back in starside aye back indeed for following the battle at the dwellers garden he returned to his own place something which you could hardly be expected to know for by then you were in exile his own place the helllands helllands helllands they are not helllands how often must i tell you this place is hell with its sulphur stenches vampire swamps and sunblasted furnace lands beyond the mountains ah but harry keoghs world to the likes of us it would be a paradise how can you know that i cant but i can suspect it this harry keogh shaithis had mused he had powers to be sure but he was not wamphyri well now he is shaitan at once contradicted him but as yet untried for who is there to test him in devious argument or in battle whats more the travellers dont much fear him for he will not take the blood of men what according to the boy shaitan had nodded the dwellers father eats only beast flesh compared to your vampire my son it seems his is a puling unsophisticated infant of a thing and the socalled lady karen ah yes shaitan had nodded the lady karen last of starsides wamphyri you have designs on that one dont you i remember you remarked on her treachery and even now her name falls like acid from your forked tongue well karen and harry keogh are together so at least hes that much of a man they share her aerie if shes the beauty you say she is doubtless hes in her to the hilt and beyond even as we speak it was a deliberate jibe and shaithis knew it but still he could not resist rising to the others bait then they should enjoy each other while they can he had answered darkly and finally he had looked around for the traveller child gone shaitan told him manflesh pure and simple ive had my share of metamorphic mush these thousands of years the boy was a tidbit but welcome for all that the entire child in sunside there are entire tribes shaitan had answered his voice a clotted gurgle and beyond that entire worlds with which theyd commenced to ready themselves for their resurgence now shaithis waited on the emergence of his latest warriorcreature and his ancestor shaitan the fallen waited with him when the beasts scales grapples and various fighting appendages had stiffened into chitin hard as iron a matter of hours now finally it would be time to venture forth against starside as for any future battle would it even last long enough to qualify as such shaithis doubted it for he firmly believed that on his own singlehandedly controlling a mere fistful of warriors from the back of a flyer and without his ancestors help still he would have the measure of karen and her lover and whatever allies they might muster and therefore the measure of starside too what a mere female a pack of wolves and a vampire lord who shied from manblood no army that but a rabble let keogh call up the dead if he would fine for scaring trogs and travellers but shaithis had no fear of the crumbling dead and as for that other facet of keoghs magic that clever trick of his of coming and going at will invisibly that wouldnt help him not this time if he went good riddance and if he came let it be to his death but on the other hand shaithis could scarcely deny his own troublesome dreams whose patterns were strange as the auroral energies which even now wove in the sky high overhead perhaps he should examine those dreams yet again as so often before except no time not now for he felt a familiar encroachment and knew that shaitan was near in mind if not in body and what is it he inquired how clever you are the other purred telepathically and oh so sensitive theres no sneaking up on you my son then why do you persist in trying shaithis was cold shaitan ignored his testiness and said you should come now our creatures are mewling in their vats and would be up and about they must be tested we have things to do preparations to make indeed it was true enough and i shall be there immediately shaithis answered commencing the treacherous climb down from the cone yes for his ancestor wasnt alone in his eagerness to be free of this place except theres freedom and theres freedom and the concept is never the same to any two creatures shaitan would merely free himself from the icelands while his descendant he had something else to be free of some little time earlier and several thousands of miles to the south the necroscope had been out to inspect karens advance guard her earlywarning system of specialized warriorcreatures or rogue troops as they seemed to have become where shed stationed them at the rim of the frozen sea against any incursion from the icelands he had gone there via the möbius continuum in a series of hundredmile jumps which had taken him far across consecutive northern horizons into auroralit wastes where the snow lay in great white drifts on the shores of a sullenly heaving icecrusted ocean karens creatures had been there sure enough and harry was soon to discover how well theyd adapted metamorphic a single generation had sufficed to accelerate their evolution theyd grown thick white fur both for protection against the cold and as a natural camouflage when harry had thought to detect some slight movement in a humped snowfall and after hed carefully moved a little closer then hed seen just how effective the latter device was his first real awareness of the beasts had been when three of them reared up and charged him in combination a quarteracre of murder running rampant then removing himself some small distance hed thought id be little more than a minnow to be divided between three great cats theyd get no more than a taste apiece but note their instinctive tendency to secrecy karen had commented from her aerie some two thousand miles south their minds may be feeble but still they were able to hide their thoughts and thus themselves away from you whats more you are wamphyri a lord a master but that didnt stop them either the necroscope had detected a degree of pride in karens thoughts these were her creations and shed made a good job of them alas but then shed allowed them to slip the leash still focusing on him she had detected that thought too the distance was too great shed shrugged i see that now telepathy is a special talent which we share our mainly human minds are large and we focus them well wherefore contact between us is simple but their minds are small and mainly concerned with survival again her shrug quite simply theyve forgotten me time they remembered then harry had answered and as she amplified and reinforced her original orders and instructions so hed relayed them directly and forcefully into the groups dull minds following which and when he went among them a second time theyd behaved with more respect brave of you shed commented however nervously to examine them at such close quarters and perhaps a little foolish too come out of there harry please come home now home did she mean back to the aerie he wondered and was that really his home now perhaps it was in keeping that monstrous menhir rising over starsides boulder plains whose furnishings were fashioned from the hair and fur gristle and bones of oncemen and monsters what better home for a man whose lifelong friend had been the grim reaper himself bitter thoughts but on the other hand it had seemed to harry that karen pleaded with him and that she was concerned for him and any home was better than none anyway his job was finished here now and he was cold but he knew that karen would warm him a universe away in the urals major alexei byzarnov was present in the perchorsk core for the latest computersimulated test firing of the tokarevs his ic captain igor klepko was in charge of the test klepko was short sharpfeatured with the dark eyes and weatherworn complexion of his steppemen ancestors throughout his preparations the officer had kept up a running commentary for the benefit of the halfdozen junior officers in attendance also in attendance and keeping a close eye on the proceedings from where he stood apart on the perimeter walkway under the inwardcurving arch of the granite wall projekt direktor viktor luchov was quietly intense totally absorbed in klepkos instructive monologue as it approached its climax two missiles yes klepko continued a dual system in the field their launching would constitute either a preemptive strike in a hitherto nonnuclear battle zone or retaliation against an enemys use of similar weapons the first tokarev would seek out enemy hq somewhere beyond the forward edge of the battle area and the second would home in on heavy enemy troop concentration in the battle zone tor our purposes however here in perchorsk klepko shrugged while our targets are somewhat more specific they remain paradoxically conjectural we aim to detonate the first missile in a world beyond this er gate with a cursory wave of his hand he indicated the glaring white sphere behind him and the second tokarev while it is still inside the passage between universes the mechanics of the thing are very simple onboard computers are linked by radio as the first tokarev clears the gate into the far world contact will be broken onefifth of a second later both devices will detonate captain klepko sighed and nodded as for the purpose of this system if and when used it will be entirely defensive youve all been shown films of creatures from the other side breaking through into this world im sure i dont have to stress how important it is that in future no further emergence be allowed lastly and before the simulation there remain the questions of command and personal security command these weapons will only be used on the instructions of the projekt direktor as qualified by the officer commanding major byzarnov or in the unlikely event of his absence by me except under circumstances where a chainofcommand situation has been initiated no other person will have that authority personal security from the moment the button is pressed the warheads are armed there will be a delay of five minutes before firing anyone who remains in perchorsk at that time will be alerted by continuous klaxons the klaxons have only one meaning get out exhaust from the tokarevs is toxic as a safety measure against the unlikely failure of the projekts ventilation systems any stragglers will need to employ breathing apparatus until theyve exited the complex it takes about four minutes for a fit man to make it out of here from the core into the ravine these tokarevs are weapons their use will not be experimental but for effect there is no failsafe after firing the system cannot be aborted and we cannot rely on more than sixty seconds before detonation which makes a total of six minutes after initiation the explosion of the device on the far side should have no effect here but the one in the passage may be different it could be that the sheer power of the detonation will drive radioactive gases and debris back through into perchorsk hopefully all such poisons will be contained down here in the vicinity of the core by which time the place will have been vacated and the exits sealed klepko straightened up and put his hands on his hips any questions there were none simulation is computerized he relaxed scratching his nose and offering an apologetic shrug bit of a letdown im afraid if you were expecting a fireworks show instead it will all happen on the small screen there in black and white silent and with subtitles and no special effects his audience laughed mainly klepko held up a warning hand to silence them this is to let you see how short a span six minutes really is and he pressed a red button on a box seated in front of him on top of his lectern major byzarnov had seen the simulation before he wasnt especially interested in that but he was interested in the expression on viktor luchovs face one of rapt fascination byzarnov took two paces backwards onto the perimeter walkway edged up quietly on the gaunt scientist and coughed quietly in the back of his throat luchov turned his head to stare at the major you still think this is some kind of game dont you he accused no byzarnov answered and i never did i note that any order i might give on the use of these weapons is to be qualified by you or your ic do you suspect i might order their use frivolously then not at all the major shook his head only too well aware of several closetyped folded sheets of paper where they bulked out his pocket luchovs current psychological profile as supplied by the projekts psychiatrist and to himself insanely yes but not frivolously luchovs eyes were suddenly vacant i sometimes feel that im being punished he said oh yes for my part in all of this i mean i helped build the original perchorsk in those days franz ayvaz was the direktor but he died in the accident and so paid for his part in it since when the responsibility has been mine a heavy enough load for any man byzarnov nodded moved apart a little and decided to change the subject i saw you come up from below before klepko started on his demonstration you were down in the abandoned magmass levels luchov shuddered and whispered god what a mess things are in down there so many of them were trapped sealed in i opened a cyst the thing inside it was like it was an alien mummy not rotten or liquid this time just a grotesque mass of inverted halffossilized flesh several major organs were visible on the outside along with a good many curious i dont know appendages of rubber plastic stone and and and et cetera byzarnov felt sorry for him luchov had been here too long but not for much longer not if moscow would act quickly on the majors recommendation it is terrible down there viktor he agreed and it might be best if you kept out of it viktor and byzarnovs tone of voice what pity luchov glanced at him glared at him abruptly turned away and over his shoulder stridently so long as i am projekt direktor major ill come and go as i will and then he made away byzarnov approached klepko by now the twin dart shapes moving jerkily across the computer screen had popped into oblivion the simulation was over klepko was finishing off will still be filled with toxic exhaust fumes and could well be highly radioactive but of course we shall all be well out of it the major waited until klepko had given the dismiss then took him to one side and talked to him briefly urgently about luchov the necroscope dreamed he dreamed of a boy called harry keogh who talked to dead people and was their friend their one light in otherwise universal darkness he dreamed of the youths loves and lives the minds hed visited bodies hed inhabited places he had known now in the past and future and in two worlds it was a very weird dream and fantastical more so because it was true and for all that the necroscope dreamed about himself his own life still it was as if he dreamed of another finally he dreamed of his son a wolf except this part was real and not just a memory from another world and his son came to him tongue lolling and said father theyre coming harry came awake on the instant slid from karens bed went swift and sinuous to the window embrasure where he drew aside the drapes he was wary kept himself well to one side was ready to snatch back his hand in a moment if that should be necessary but it wasnt for it was sundown shadows crept on the mountain divide usurping the gold from the peaks stars at first scarcely visible came more glowingly alive moment by moment the darkness was here and more darkness was coming karen cried out in her sleep came awake and jerked bolt upright in the tumbled bed harry her face was ghostly pale a torn sheet with a triangle of holes for eyes and mouth where she gazed all about the room but then she saw the necroscope at the window and the holes of her eyes came burning alive theyre coming their scarlet glances met and joined forming a twoway channel for thoughts which moments ago were sleeping harry saw through karens eyes into her mind but he answered her out loud anyway i know he said she came off the bed naked and flew to him buried herself in his arms but theyre coming she sobbed yes and well fight them he growled his body reacting of its own accord to the feel and smell of her flesh which was soft silky pliable ripe musty and wet where his member grew into her she trapped him there with muscles that held him fast and groaned lets make this the very best one harry because it might be the last just in case she grunted forming barbs within herself to draw him further in after that it was like never before leaving them too exhausted to be afraid later he said what if we lose lose karen stood beside him they leaned together and gazed out through a window in a room facing north towards the icelands as yet there was nothing to be seen and they hadnt expected there would be but they could feel something it radiated from the north like ripples on a lake of pitch slow shuddery and black with its evil harry nodded slowly if we lose they can only kill me he said and he thought of johnny found and the things he had done to his victims terrible things but compared to shaithis and any other survivors of the old wamphyri johnny found had been a child and his imagination sadly lacking karen knew why the necroscope closed his mind to her for her own protection but it was a wasted effort she knew the wamphyri much better than he did nothing harry was capable of imagining could ever plumb the true depths of wamphyri cruelty that was karens opinion which was why she promised him if you die i die oh and theyll let you die will they so easily they cant stop me on this side of the mountains it is sundown but beyond sunside true death waits there for any vampire it burns like molten gold in the sky thats where id flee far across the mountains into the sun let them follow me there if they dared but i wouldnt be afraid i remember when i was a child and the sun felt good on my skin im sure that in the end before i died i could make it feel that way again i would will it to feel good morbid harry stood up straighter gave himself a shake all of this morbid keep it up and were defeated before we even begin there must be at least a chance well win indeed theres more than a chance can they disappear at will as we can like ghosts into the möbius continuum no but but wherever we go she shrugged and however many times we escape well always have to return we cant stay in that place for ever her logic was unassailable before harry could find words to answer perhaps to comfort her or himself she continued and shaithis is a terrible foe how devious she shook her head you could scarcely imagine true a voice came startlingly from nowhere entering the minds of both of them shaithis is devious but his ancestor shaitan the fallen is worse far the dweller karen gasped as she recognized their telepathic visitor and then incredulously but did you say shaitan the fallen one aye the wolfvoice rasped in their minds he lives he comes and he not shaithis is the terror harry and karen reached out with their own telepathy tried to strengthen the mindbridge between themselves and their visitor and for a moment the aerie was filled with flowing mental pictures of mountain slopes where domed boulders projected through sliding scree of a full moon lending the crags a soft yellow mantle of great firs standing tall and in the shadow of the trees silver triangle eyes blinking a good many where the pack rested before the hunt then the pictures faded and were gone and likewise the one who lived with them and moved among them but his warning remained with karen and the necroscope how he could know what he had told them who could say but he was or had been the dweller and that was enough time passed sometimes they talked and at others they simply waited there was nothing else to do this time seated before a fire in the aeries massive great hall they talked shaitan is part of my worlds legends too said harry there they call him satan the devil whose place is in hell in starsides histories your world was hell karen answered and all of its dwellers were devils dramal doombody believed it firmly harry shook his head that the wamphyri monstrous as they were and still are should hold with beliefs in demons devils and such again the shake of his head is hard to understand she shrugged how so isnt hell simply the unknown any terrible place or region of which nothing is understood to the traveller tribes it lay across the mountains in starside while to the wamphyri it waited on the other side of the sphere gate certainly it must be horrible and lethal beyond that gate for no one had ever returned to tell of it that was how the wamphyri saw it i saw it that way too in the days before zek and jazz you and your son and dont forget harry even the wamphyri were once men however monstrous a man may grow still hell remember the night fears of his childhood shaitan harry mused a mystery spanning two worlds the legend was taken into my world by banished wamphyri lords and occasionally their traveller retainers when they were sent through starsides gate but in his own mind oh really or is the socalled legend more properly universal the great evil the lord of lies of all wickedness what of the similarity in the names satan shaitan are there devils in all the universes of light and what of angels better stop thinking of him as a legend karen warned as if shed been listening to his thoughts which she had not the dweller says hes real and coming here which means that in order to live we have to kill him except if shaitan has already lived for how long two three thousand years is it even reasonable to believe that we can kill him harry had scarcely heard her he was still working things out how many of them he finally asked shaitan will be their leader and shaithis with him but who else survivors from the battle at the garden karen answered if they also survived the icelands i remember harry nodded weve considered them before fess ferenc volse pinescu arkis leperson and their thralls no more than a handful or if others of the old lords survived the ordeal of exile a large handful he drew himself up but im still the necroscope and again i say can they come and go through the möbius continuum can they call up the dead out of their graves and once more to himself can you harry can you shaitan may have the art she answered for after all he was the first of the wamphyri since when hes had time enough for studying its possible he can torment the dead for their secrets but will they answer him harry growled his eyes glowing like rubies in the firelight no no i didnt mean necromancy but necroscopy a necromancer may examine a corpse or even a longdead mummy but i talk to the very spirits of the dead and they love me indeed theyll rise up from their dust for me a lie you even lie to yourself now you are wamphyri harry keogh call up the dead ah you used to you used to he started to his feet i have to try and went down to starsides foothills under the garden where long ago he called up an army of mummied trogs to do battle with wamphyri trogs he talked to their spirits in his fashion but only the wind out of the north answered him he sensed that they were there and heard him but they kept silent they were at peace now why should they join the necroscope in his turmoil he went up into the garden there were graves far too many of them but untended now travellers who died in the great battle trogs laid to rest in niches under the crags they heard him too and remembered him well but they felt something different in him which wasnt to their liking ah wamphyri necromancer this man or monster had words which could call them to a horrid semblance of life even against their will and i might he threatened sensing their refusal their terror but from within what like janos ferenczy what price now your humanity harry he went back to the aerie to karen and told her bleakly once i could have commanded an army of the dead now there are just the two of us three the dwellers growl was in their minds but clear as if he stood beside them you fought for me once both of you for my cause my turn now that seemed to decide it to state their case set their course even though it was the only course theyd ever had karen fetched her gauntlet and dipped it in a cleansing acid solution then set to oiling its joints me she said i tore the living heart out of lesk the glut aye and there was a lot more to fear in those days and it dawns on me im not afraid for myself but for the loss of what we have except that when you look at it well what do we have after all harry jumped up strode to and fro shaking his fists and raging inside and out and then grew deadly calm it was his vampire of course still seeking ascendancy he nodded knowingly and grunted well and maybe ive kept you down long enough perhaps its time i let you out what karen looked up from working on her gauntlet nothing nothing she arched her eyebrows i only asked where shall it be the garden said the dweller far away in the mountains they heard him and karen agreed aye the garden has its merits we know it well anyway finally with a furious nod the necroscope surrendered to his vampire in part at least very well he snarled the garden so be it and so it would be in starside it was the hour when all that remains of the furnace sun is a smudgy grey luminosity in a sky gnawed by jutting fangs of mountain and the nameless stars are chunks of alien ice freezing in weird orbits the deepest darkest hour of sundown and the last of the wamphyri shaithis and shaitan harry keogh and karen were coming together to do battle in an empty place once called the garden all four of them the last of their race and the dweller too except he was no longer wamphyri as such or if he was even his vampire scarcely knew it karen had known for some time now that the invaders were close and closing on starside ever since her creatures out on the rim of the rimy ocean called to her one last time to pass on that information before they died and as they died so karen had asked them how many are the enemy and what are their shapes it was easier far to gauge strength and substance that way than from complicated descriptions the distance was great and the brains of warriors are never too large unwise to invest such masses of menace with other than the most rudimentary intelligence nevertheless vague pictures of flyers warriors and controlling beings had come back painetched out of the north showing karen how small was the army of shaitan it consisted only of a pair of controlling lords who rode upon massive flyers with scaleplated heads and underbellies and a halfdozen warriors of generally unorthodox construction unorthodox aye to say the least for the invaders who could only be shaithis and shaitan the fallen though karen held back from any kind of direct contact with their minds had apparently seen fit to break all the olden rules of the wamphyri in the fashioning of these beasts for one they had organs of generation much like karens constructs and for another they seemed to act much of their own accord without the guidance of their supposed controllers lastly one of them was a monster even among monsters so much so that karen didnt even care to dwell upon it at first she was informed there had been an extra pair of flyers weary beasts whose riders landed them in deep drifts close to the edge of the ocean alighting the wamphyri lords had then called down their warriors and fresh flyers out of the sky allowing them to fuel themselves on the exhausted bodies of these first mounts and while they were busy with their food that was when karens guardian creatures had attacked only to discover the overwhelming ferocity and superiority of shaitans warriors that was the message which the last of karens beasts conveyed to her before its feeble mindsendings were swamped by dull pain and quickly extinguished harry had been asleep at that time wracked by nightmares karen had watched him tossing and turning and listened to him mouthing of the coneshaped universes of light and of möbius a wizard hed known in the helllands a mathematician who got religion a madman who believes god is an equation which is more or less what pythagoras believed but centuries before him and of the möbius continuum that fabulous fathomless place where hed made metamorphic love to her and which he now considered an infinite brain controlling the bodies of universes in which simple beings such as myself are mere synapses conveying thoughts and intentions and perhaps carrying out some ones will by then the necroscopes dream had been a feverish thing full of thoughts conversations and associations out of his past even past dreams all tangled in a kaleidoscope of the real and surreal where his life from its onset was observed to have been metamorphic as his flesh in the way it had burst open to sprout weird discoveries and concepts the dream contained even as a dying mans last breath is said to contain crucial elements of that entire life but concertinaed into a single vision of mere moments when the cold sweat started out on his grey brow karen might have gentled him awake except his words fascinated her and anyway he needed to sleep in order to be strong for the coming battle perhaps he would settle down again when the nightmare was past and so she sat by him while he sweated and raved of things quite beyond her conception about times relativity and all history that of the future as well as the past being contemporary but occurring in some strange elsewhere and about the dead the real dead not the undead waiting patiently in their graves for a new beginning their second coming and about a great light the primal light which is the ongoing unending bigger bang as all the universes expand for ever out of darkness he mumbled about numbers with the power to separate space and time and of a metaphysical equation whose only justification is to extend mind beyond the span of the merely physical on one level it was the subconscious whirlpool of harrys instinctive mathematical genius enhanced by his now ascendant vampire while on a higher plane it was a violent confrontation between two entirely elemental powers darkness and light good and evil knowledge for its own sake which is sin and the total absence of knowledge which is innocence it was the necroscopes subconscious battle with himself within himself which must be fought and won lest the final darkness fall for harry himself would be the bright guardian of worlds still to come or their utter destruction before they were even born but karen didnt know any of that only that she mustnt wake him just yet and harry fevered on i could give you formulae you havent even dreamed ofhe sneered out of some all but forgotten past time while the lights of his eyes burned scarlet through lowered frantically fluttering lids an eye for an eye dragosani and a tooth for a tooth i was harry keogh became my own sons sixth sense before alec kyles emptied head sucked me in and made his body mine the great liar faéthor would have lived in there with me but wheres faéthor now eh and wheres thibor and what of the bodescu brat and janos suddenly he sobbed and great tears squeezed themselves out from under his luminous eyelids and brenda sandra penny am i cursed or blessed i had a million friends which would be fine except they were all dead they lived in a dimension beyond life where i could still talk to them and they could still remember what it was to have been alive there are many dimensions planes of existence without number worlds without end the myriad coneshaped universes of light and i know how they came about and möbius knew it before me pythagoras might have guessed something of it but möbius and i know let there be he screwed up his tightly closed eyes let there be great slugs of sweat oozed out of his shuddering leadgrey body let there be until karen could stand his pain for this could only be pain no longer and clutching him where he writhed upon her bed she begged him let there be what harry light he growled and his furious eyes shot open aglow with their own heat light she repeated him her voice full of wonder he struggled to sit up gave in and let himself sink down into her arms and he looked at her nodded and said yes the primal light which shone out of his mind harrys eyes had always been weird even before his vampire stained them with blood but now they were changing from moment to moment karen saw the fury go out of them then the fear and watched fascinated as all alien vitality even the very passion of the wamphyri died in them for with only one exception the necroscope was the first of his sort to know and believe his mind karen repeated him at last wondering at the softness of his face which was that of a child the mind of god even now harry couldnt be absolutely certain but near enough of a god anyway he finally told her smiling a creator and inside him instinctively aware of looming defeat his vampire shrank down and was small and perhaps bemoaned its fate to be one with a man who desired only to be a man sky fight from then on the necroscope had been different his parasites ascendancy had been reversed once again his humanity had the upper hand karen to the contrary she tried to insist that he accompany her on raids into sunside to blood himself naturally he would hear nothing of it and she would be furious but youre not blooded shed growl at him as they made love theres a frenzy in the wamphyri which only blood will release for the blood is the life unless you take you may not partake in your fullness you must fuel yourself for the fight cant you see that how may i explain but in fact there was no need for explanations harry knew well enough what she meant hed seen it in his own world in boxers the moment they draw blood how the first sight and smell of it inspires them to greater effort so that they go at their opponents with even more determination and always hammering away at the same wet redgleaming spot hed seen it in cats large and small the first splash of mouseblood which turns a kitten to a hunter or drives the hunter to a frenzy and as for sharks nothing else in all the unexplored span of their lives has half so much meaning for them but ive eaten well he would answer and hah he would hear her mental snort of derision of what the flesh of pigs and roasted whats that for fuel it fuels me well enough and your vampire not at all then let the bastard starve but he would never allow himself the luxury of greater anger than that sometimes he would try to explain whats coming is coming he told her didnt we see it in the möbius continuum in future time of all the lessons of my life karen this is the one ive learned the best never try to change or avoid whats written in the future for it is written all we can hope for is a better understanding of the writing thats all again her snort hah and bitterly and now who is beaten even before the fight do you think i dont feel tempted he said then oh i do believe me but ive fought this thing inside me for such a long time now that i cant just let it win no matter the cost if i succumbed to rage and lust went out and took the life of a man and drained his blood what then would it give me the strength i need to destroy shaithis and shaitan perhaps but who would be next after them how long before i started the wamphyri cycle all over again but strong this time as never before with all the powers of a necroscope to play with and with my vampires bloodlust raging what then do you think i wouldnt begin to look for a way back into my own world to return there as the greatest plaguebearer of all time perhaps youd be a king there she answered with me to share your bonethrone he nodded but wryly the red king aye and eventually emperor of a scarlet dynasty and all of our undead lieutenants our bloodsons and those who got our vampire eggs and their sons and daughters all of them pouring their pus on a crumbling mankind building their aeries and carving kingdoms of their own as janos would have done from his mediterranean island and thibor the warlord after hed turned wallachia red or faéthor on his bloodcrazed crusades and all of our progeny necroscopes in their own right with neither the living nor the dead safe from them helllands now youre talking karen following which he wouldnt even listen to her but even if he had it would have been too late for that was when karens other watchers great desmodus bats from the aeries colony brought news of the arrival on starsides far northern borders of shaitan and his small but deadly aerial forces inaudible except to karen and to others of their own genus the cries of the great vampires relayed the message back across seven hundred miles of barren boulder plains the fact that after four and a half years of peace the old wamphyri were finally returning to starside she was bringing mewling warriors out of their vats when the warning arrived and went straight to harry where he stood wrapped in his thoughts on a balcony facing north stand there long enough necroscope she told him and youll be able to wave them a welcome nor will you have to wait too long he barely glanced at her acknowledged her presence with a nod i know theyre here he said ive felt them coming like maggots chewing on the ends of my nerves theyre not so many but they shake the ether like an army shakes the earth its time we went to the garden you go she told him touching his arm as some of the sting went out of her voice see if you can call down your son out of the hills maybe hell bring his grey brotherhood with him though what good theyll be is hard to say but me ive a trio of warriors to wean and instruct theyre built of fine fierce stuff right enough good stuff left behind by menor maimbite and lesk the glut which i found intact under the ruins of their stacks but when it comes to the fashioning well its true im a novice compared to them just make sure theyll own me as their master as well as yourself was harrys reply that way even if they havent the measure of shaitans creatures still i might be able to come up with a trick or two then he turned and caught her up so swiftly in his arms that she gasped aloud and karen he said weve seen our futures the red threads of our lives melting into golden fire then fading to nothing it didnt look too good for us but at the same time it could mean anything we simply dont understand it and in any case whatever it means it has to be better than what we saw of our enemies futures for they didnt have any no scarlet threads in starsides tomorrows karen i remember she said without freeing herself pressing more firmly to him and so i stay and fight whatever becomes of us its worth it to know that they die too harry held her very close very tightly and his looks were even more those of a small boy he found himself wishing it were all a fantastic dream and that hed wake up a schoolboy with all his future ahead of him but retaining enough of the dream that hed make no false moves ah if only things worked that way i wish id known you as some ordinary girl in my own world when i was just a man he told her on impulse karen wasnt so romantic she had been an innocent in her time until she was stolen now and then a blushing traveller youth had wanted her but in those days shed kept herself as shed thought for something better hah we would be fumbling giggling lovers for an hour her answer was harsh to hell with it i prefer what weve had anyway you are the necroscope what do you know of ordinary men the fire in her was a catalyst it burned outwards through her shell to illuminate her as she really was wamphyri harry could be like her yes but did he need to be hed gone up against dragosani thibor yulian bodescu and all the others as a man albeit a man with powers no never an ordinary man but neither had he been a monster and now there were others to set himself against but again as a man or as nearly as possible he released her is there a flyer ready in the launching bay yes but wont you use the möbius route he shook his head my son and his grey brothers wouldnt see me he might know in his way and he might not riding a flyer ill be visible a curiosity not many flyers in starsides skies these days at the launching bay watching him take off in the saddle of the pulsing mantashape which was his flyer she saw that he was right other than himself the skies were empty for now feeling empty herself karen went back to her warriors harry and karen were together in the gardens desolation when shaithis and shaitan the fallen came back into the old wamphyri heartland but contrary to expectations the invaders did not launch an immediate attack instead they came gliding and squirting out of dark auroraflickering northern skies and oh so warily circled the debrislittered plains where the tumbled stacks of extinct vampire lords lay in shattered ruin eventually ever cautious they landed in the bays of karens aerie and explored its empty levels finding nothing inimical no hidden pitfalls no hostile creatures waiting in the shadows but neither did they find gasbeasts siphoneers servitors in any shape or form no comforts whatsoever except perhaps in the strength of the aeries ancient walls and even these werent secure enough for shaithis i was witness to the destruction of greater stacks than this one he told shaitan my own included two of them the other chuckled nodding his great black cowl it took both harry keogh and the dweller to control the power of the sun that time cant you see that but there is no more dweller hes gone shrivelled to a wolf and as for his father why on his own this pale unblooded alien is less than a puling child then why dont we attack and without delay we do but not until weve fuelled our beasts and filled our own bellies then after weve rested our bones a little and perhaps seen to other needs too long denied that will be soon enough for weve come a long cold weary way shaithis and not merely to dispose of this hated enemy of yours or to let you sate yourself on the flesh of a female who spurned and betrayed you so calm yourself and be patient and everything you most desire shall be but for all shaitans apparent confidence deep in his black heart he too was concerned about their opponent the socalled helllander harry keogh a vampire who had not yet tasted the blood of other men unknown to shaithis the great leech which was his ancestor had already employed his own superior infinitely furtive vampire powers in a remote partial examination of the necroscope shaitans telepathy was more advanced even than karens and harrys indeed his was the maggot which had gnawed on harrys nerveendings even so what probes hed attempted had been perfunctory the reason was simple only penetrate the outermost shell of the necroscopes psychic aura come within miles of the core of light the unplumbed emerging centre of power which he must never be allowed to become and any sensitive being would feel it for himself as shaithis might if he werent such a dullard but such a beautiful dullard and all wasted for now anyway that pent energy which was so much greater than that of a mere man possibly greater even than that of certain vampires but energy of what from where these were the questions which caused shaitans concern for until he knew what harry keogh was or what he might become he couldnt really be sure how to deal with him far easier when the time was right to deal with shaithis the selfconsidered devious shaithis the very beautiful very dull wouldbe great traitor who would soon prove himself to be shaithis the great fool that same shaithis who kept such a tight guard on his mind lest its vile and treacherous thoughts fly free except why shaitan had long ago made himself privy to his descendants thoughts which were secret no longer but imprudent to fuss over all of that now time enough when starsides weird alien defender was dead or otherwise disposed of or perhaps earlier but only if shaithis himself should bring it to a head these were shaitans thoughts but all kept hidden from shaithis of course they left a lone warrior guarding the aerie and took the rest with them into sunside where soon they spied the fires of a traveller settlement then for a little while the night air was filled with the screams of men the bellowing of warriors and the sounds of their gluttony also with the hot reek of the freshly dead and with the shrieks of those taken alive of the latter there were six and they were all women later the higher windows of karens aerie came flickering alive with the ruddy light of fires smoke went up from the chimneys it was as if a great and merry party took place there for vampires so long denied it was merry anyway what battered broken tidbits were left when shaithis and shaitan were done went to the warriors for sweetmeats a small mercy that nothing of that ravaged flesh still lived in the garden harry and karen slept the necroscope still reckoned time in days and nights as yet when his mind told his body it was night his bodys response was to sleep but in any case his weariness would be as much mental as physical for he knew that in any battle to come he would be fighting himself no less than the enemy the problem which always chased itself in circles until he grew tired never changed how to win without calling on his vampire for its assistance without giving it full rein over the range of its powers for to allow his leech total ascendancy would be to signal his own submission following which hed no longer be his own man but wamphyri in every sense of the word karen had no such problem she already was wamphyri but before that shed been woman and the necroscope was her man when he slept so did she curled in his arms they were not totally unprepared however they were clothed and karens gauntlet lay close to hand and not unmindful of their position theyd set a watch a warrior grunted a little shifting its hugely armoured bulk for comfort where it had been positioned in the shadows beyond the crest of the saddle likewise karens second beast forward in the lee of the wall where the ground fell steeply away to starsides foothills and the plain beyond as for the third creature it was situated at a higher elevation on a ledge under an overhang in the western crags where its many nightoriented eyes peered far out across the boulder plains searching the skies and starlit wastes for any unwarranted movement but unknown to the sleepers there was a fourth far less conspicuous watcher once known as the dweller now he was a lean grey shape who kept himself apart observing the unkempt garden from the cover of the ragged treeline sometimes in a flash of memory he would understand why he had come here but at others he wasnt quite sure anyway here he was and it was his snarled mindcall together with a sudden bellowing and screaming of embattled beasts which startled the necroscope and his lady awake when at last the invaders struck and for all their precautions still they were taken by surprise for the enemy didnt strike out of starside at all but from sunside over the mountains where it was still sundown the invaders had departed karens aerie in full force crossed the peaks far to the east where there was no one to observe them and turned west in the lee of the mountains under cover of the great barrier range their sunside flight path had followed the spine of the crags to the latitude of the garden where rising up over the peaks to look down on the territory of the defenders theyd carefully noted the locations of the warriors and the fact that nothing else was stirring then their probes had discovered karens sleeping mind as for the necroscopes mind even asleep it had been shielded and impenetrable and dreaming harry dreamed that he sped down starsides future timestream his eyes were full of the dazzle of blue green and red lines of life and his ears seemed tuned to the unending ahhhhhhhh monotone of lifes expansion into all of the tomorrows of all the universes of light last time he had been with karen but this time he was alone paying more attention to his surroundings and aware of the convergence of scarlet vampire threads upon his own and just when it seemed they must fuse together in some weird temporal collision that was the point at which möbius time turned golden in that furious meltingpot which terminated everything maybe not but that was when his dream terminated and harry sprang awake in the ruined traveller dwelling which he and karen had made their headquarters and karen too waking up in his arms the warriors she gasped expanding her hand to thrust it into the coarselined matrix of her gauntlet ill see harry answered already on his feet and conjuring a möbius door which coincided with the doorframe of the stonefashioned dwelling and as he stepped through both so he glanced at the sky up there flyers he saw them in the moment before the möbius continuum enveloped him vast manta shapes pulsing on high from whose saddles wamphyri riders directed the attack of their warriors but apart from warriors already landed and joined in battle with karens creatures there were several still airborne squirting across the stars like aerial octopi their vanes extended and propulsion orifices blasting three of them in a protective triangle formation around their controllers but how many were already down harry emerged from the continuum at the back of the saddle karens guardian warrior was under attack from two lesser but incredibly ferocious beasts one was underneath pincers and sickles working to disembowel while the other rode its back biting a way through to the spine even metamorphic flesh must soon succumb to this disengage the necroscope ordered get aloft if you can harass the enemy in the sky in order to address the warrior he had opened his mind karen was in at once ive launched the warrior from the ledge in the crags she immediately informed him hes fast and fierce if you can get that one airborne shaithis and shaitan may well be disadvantaged their flyers are unconventional heavily armoured but still no match for warriors maybe we can knock the bastards out of the sky but now in close proximity with the enemy their thoughts were no longer private ho karen shaithis called down gleefully from on high ever treacherous eh why i do believe youd damn me with your last breath and so you shall for i shall see to it and to harry growlingly as for you helllander ah but i remember you well enow for i had an aerie upon a time till you and your dweller son reduced it to so much rubble but wheres your son now eh a great wolf i hear siring pups by the light of the moon oh ha ha ha and what bitch did you get him out of eh harry heard shaithiss sneering clearly enough also shaitans abrupt interruption which oozed in his mind like mental slime taunting serves no purpose kill him by all means when the time is right but until then let it be the necroscopes vampire raged it wanted its way its demands on harry were mental as well as physical so that he could almost hear it screaming give me the right let me smite them only give your mind and body to me and in my turn ill give you everything but harry knew it was a lie and that in fact his parasite would take everything he heard a buffeting of air adopted a defensive crouch and glanced aloft karen was already airborne harrys flyer which she had sent made a tight turn and descended towards him as the creatures fiftyfoot span of membranous manta wing spongy flesh cartilage and alveolate bone swooped low overhead harry leaped and snatched at the harness fittings under its neck another moment and he was hauling himself into the saddle and on the ground the beleaguered warrior threw off its attackers and squirted aloft good harry told it now get up there with your ugly twin and help him tear those enemy flyers out of the sky lets all assist them came karens mindcall as her beast commenced climbing a spiralling wind off starside to where the invaders seemed to sit among the stars and rising up towards the armoured flyers of shaithis and shaitan within their arrowhead formation of hissing throbbing warriors harry queried wheres our warrior number three dead on the ground necroscope karen answered grimly crushed by the most terrible construct i ever saw in the old days even to conceive of such a beast would have meant automatic banishment the old rule was simple never bring to being anything which might prove difficult to put down for even the feeblest brain will eventually learn tricks of its own as for these things which shaithis and shaitan have devised especially that one why cant you feel their evil intelligence they are abominations harry looked all around in the sky finally glanced down through a thousand feet of dark empty air and saw what followed on behind and i see what you mean he said what he saw was this rising alongside karen and himself in the same section of the spiral the warrior he had ordered aloft dripped fluids from an underbelly whose scaly armour had been breached plasma gouts gleamed red as a ruby necklace where metamorphic tissues were already at work healing deep neck wounds for the present the warriors propulsors blasted as before but harry fancied he could detect a sputtering even now a little higher than he and karen and climbing that much faster the unscathed warrior shed launched from the crags vented propulsive gases in a fury it snorted like a dragon where it made an all too obvious beeline for the alien flyers and their riders overhead responding like monstrous automata to the threat the trio of escorting warriors turned inwards and began to converge lost a little height then fell like stones with their vanes angling them towards their target all of this registered in a moment the fact that here in the middle air and overhead karen and the necroscope were already gravely outnumbered as for the situation below that was worse the enemy warriors which had given karens creature a mauling at the back of the garden had launched themselves into the same updraught and were gaining and coming up even faster behind them was that destroyer of her third creature which shed described as the most terrible warrior she ever saw no expert in such things still harry had to agree it had squidlike lines which was where any comparison with creatures of previous knowledge must break down gigantic it was flesh and blood cartilage and bone but it had the look and grey mottling of some weird flexible metal clusters of gas bladders like strange wattles bulked out its throbbing body and detracted from its manoeuvrability but were necessary to carry the extra weight of its arms and armour these were not additional to the warrior but integral like a great thunderlizard of primal earth its weaponry was all builtin except nature in her wildest dreams had never equipped anything like this no for this thing was of shaithiss fashioning well necroscope karens telepathic voice was suddenly shrill with alarm running for it will simply delay things he answered so panic was rising in her like the wind off starside so lets give it our best shot right here and now overhead a deadly arrowhead formation stooped on karens warrior like hawks to a pigeon harry ordered his flyer stay with your mistress then rolled from his saddle through a hastily conjured möbius door and emerged in the next moment on the scaled back of karens warrior where he could almost taste the hot stench of the incoming warriors that close sideslip he ordered his startled mount and conjuring a massive door he guided the monster through it the enemy trio slammed together in a snarling knot where harry had been but now he came squirting out of the möbius continuum far above them on a level with the armoured flyers of shaithis and shaitan even as his eyes met theirs across the gulf of air so he picked up something of shaithiss telepathic ranting you and your damned magic you ordure of the helllands harry was distracted hed looked into the scarlet eyes of shaitan too and the fallen one had looked burningly into his no hatred in the mind of that great leech no not for the necroscope only an intense curiosity save your curses he told shaithis for this one might yet do us great harm then youll have real reason to curse him and harry heard that too down below the trio of confused warriors had untangled themselves their propulsors roared as they commenced climbing again two of you shaithis called to them to me and hurry but to the third warrior get after the woman you know what to do slimy bastard thing harry hurled the thought at shaithis before realizing it was no great insult he looked for karens flyer and saw it turn out of the rising spiral to follow the mountains east a pair of warriors one of which was her own wounded creature spurted in her wake they clashed sporadically fiercely in the sky karens warrior was getting the worst of it but her flyer was gaining time and distance for the moment harry seemed to have lost the giant warrior chancing that karen was in no immediate danger he clung to the scales of his monstrous mount and sent it spurting headon at his enemies they turned tail and sped out over starsides plain of boulders heading roughly towards the broken aeries of the wamphyri now it became apparent that their flyers had the advantage of speed in level flight seeing that he couldnt hope to catch them this way harry conjured a door and guided his warrior through it and emerged directly above the flyers where they streamlined themselves and winged east shaithis heard the warriors howling propulsors felt its shadow on his back and looked up the necroscopes grin was scarlet furious as he slammed his mount down on shaithiss flyer and tried to crush him in his saddle his target at once hurled himself flat in the hollow of his mounts shoulders harrys warrior extended grapples pincers retractable jaws began cutting the flyer to pieces in midair its razorsharp appendages came dangerously close to shaithis where he squirmed for his life dripping the blood of its torn victim harrys warrior lifted up a little again dashed all of its bulk down on the flyer and slipping from his saddle to hang from its trappings in the scarlet rain shaithis knew his beast was a goner shaitan he cried out where he dangled the great leech flew slightly below and to one side jump he advised passing directly underneath shaithis made to leap for his ancestors flyer was thrown off course as for the third time harrys warrior crashed down on to his mounts back breaking it and tumbling past shaitan shaithis found himself in free fall it was a while since shaithis had flown in his own right but he was in fine fettle and had more than sufficient height his loose clothes ripped as he flattened himself into a prehistoric pterodactyl airfoil and gradually his plummet slowed to a glide far to the east he spied a glowing beacon down on the boulder plain and knew it for the gate to the helllands it made a good marker and he aimed himself in that direction the necroscope had lost him a dark speck in a darker sky shaithis had vanished but shaitan remained to be dealt with meanwhile that immemorial father of vampires had drawn ahead harry could cover the same distance in the time it took to conjure an equation he made to do so and his warrior was hit from behind the shock almost tore him loose from the plates of his mounts back behind him that most monstrous warrior of all gripped his creature in crab claws and tore out great chunks of meat from the musculature of its sputtering propulsive vents shaitans other creatures stayed well back to let their far more monstrous cousin get on with its work in the last few seconds karen had linked minds with harry she saw his problems and he saw hers the lesser warrior which shaithis had sent after her had dispatched her fighting creature and was now closing on her flyer to karen it all seemed ended necroscope its over she sent my mounts a weakling already winded theres only myself to blame for i designed him id head for the furnace lands and a golden death in the rising sun but doubt if wed make it well at least ill go out honourably a gauntlet against a warrior riding karens last creature where its mewling slavering attacker shredded its way to him the necroscope looked out through karens eyes her flyer heaved and panted where she drove it south for the great pass for already its altitude was insufficient to carry it over the peaks but spurting down on her from above and behind came that monster which shaithis had ordered get after the woman you know what to do and directly down below close to where the gash of the great pass split the mountains that glaring light starsides gate of course harry would have known it at once except this aerial view was new to him in the next moment turning that view red the torn carcass of karens defeated warrior crashed down and burst into pieces and its destroyer was falling on karen ever faster harry tumbled from his doomed creatures back through a möbius door stepped out into the foothills rising up from starsides portal the gate was a fault in the matter of the multiverse a huge distortion in the fabric of möbius spacetime but the necroscope was far enough away that it had little effect he scanned the wide mouth of the pass where the enemy warrior was playing with karens exhausted flyer forcing it down a second flyer riderless flapped uselessly close by harrys mount which hed ordered to stay with its mistress he took the möbius route into its saddle and called to karen were not done yet she heard him but so did shaithis at the end of his long fast glide he landed close to the gate and reformed into his manshape and seeing his warrior in the sky where it menaced the flyers and their riders he ordered it bring me the woman in pieces if thats the only way the warriors response was immediate it crashed its bulk down on to karens flyer and knocked her half out of the saddle and while she reeled there and tried to recover her senses and balance both it put out appendages with hooked claspers and snatched her up then with its propulsors roaring triumphantly the monster smashed down on the riderless flyer one last time to break its neck and as karens crippled beast spun and tumbled down out of the sky into the pass so the warrior turned back towards the boulder plain good shaithis applauded his beast bring her to me harry sent his mount plummeting from on high directly into the path of the warrior ignoring him the thing came straight on he sent release her to me directly into its small brain do not its rightful master countered his command knock him aside crush him if you can the monster was upon harry karen held fast in its palps of chitin thorns which pierced her flesh holding her like a fish on a hundred hooks could only scream as its neck arched to strike at him while jaws like a small cave more lethally equipped than the mouth of tyrannosaurus rex opened to sweep him up what happened next was all instinct it was as if faéthor ferenczy lived in the necroscope yet and whispered in his ear when he opens his great jaws at you go in through them harry knew he could never hope to cause this creature any real physical injury not from the outside but somewhere within that monstrous skull was a tiny brain and somewhere inside himself something was or still desired to be wamphyri go in through them harry stood up in the saddle stepped into the stench of the warriors mouth as it snapped shut on him but within that door of teeth was another conjured from his metaphysical mind he passed through that one too into the möbius continuum and out again within the warriors head physically inside its head among the rude materials of its cranium the pulsing pipes and conduits knobs and nodules muck and mucous membrane of its living skull he felt the cringing of displaced mush the shrinking of metamorphic flesh as his body materialized to rub against raw nerveendings and wet spongy tissues and the throb of plasma carrying oxygen to the small agonized brain then reached out with tearing taloned vampire hands to find and fondle the central ganglion itself and to crush it into so much pulp then gravity disappeared as the warriors propulsors closed down and the thing went into free fall and inside its head harry desperately sought to make room for himself and conjure a möbius door he needed space to work in air to breathe he had never before attempted a door underwater or surrounded by viscous solids namely hot blood but now he must must conjure a door get out of here rescue karen from this dead things claw before it hit the ground but even as möbius maths commenced mutating on the screen of the necroscopes mind so he saw how alien how inescapably wrong it was the door pulsed and vibrated but wouldnt firm into being instead its energies fastened upon the region of space on the perimeter of its matrix and violently reshaped it and common matter displaced from its natural shape and form flowed like magmass in the moment before the aborted door exploded into nothingness shaithis saw his creature tumbling to earth and for a moment thought it must fall into the gate astonished he saw its armoured head warp and melt and burst open even before it crashed down only a few paces from the dimensional portal and as it hit he saw something manlike but red yellow and slimegrey vomited from the shattered skull and hurled out on to the boulder plain as the dust settled and the last gobs of slime and plasma arced down to slop among the rocks and the dirt so he went forward shielding his eyes against the glare he stepped wonderingly among the debris of his warrior and gazed on the lady karen bruised and bleeding and unconscious in the things claspers and upon the broken disjointed helllander harry keogh as bloody a sight as the vampire lord ever saw but not yet dead no not by a long shot of course not shaithis thought for he is wamphyri and yet different and hard to understand indeed shaitan agreed as he glided his flyer to earth and yet that is what we must do understand him for his mind contains all the secrets of the gate and the worlds beyond it so do him no more harm but let him heal himself as best he can and when he can answer me then i shall question him betrayed by his own talent when he attempted to materialize a möbius door too close to the gate the necroscopes metaphysical mind had taken the brunt of the shock his flesh was vampiric and would repair itself in time even the core of his damaged brain but until then he must remain largely oblivious and to some extent perhaps he was lucky at that karen on the other hand was not nearly so broken and by no means so lucky while shaitan concerned himself with harry his dark descendants only thought was for karen both of them sought knowledge in the latters case carnal shaitans examination was telepathic as harrys mind healed and shards of splintered memory slowly cemented themselves together so the fallen one extracted what information was of value to him certain concepts were difficult where a memory had been too complicated or too painful for detailed retention harry had kept it in outline only for example the underground complex at perchorsk which hed always considered a dark brooding fortress his mental images of the perchorsk projekt were starkly monochrome what memories he retained of the place their mood and texture were not unlike those of some menacing aerie he shied from filling in details penny was the reason of course for even in his damaged condition harry couldnt bring perchorsk to mind without her intrusion but of harrys life prior to perchorsk and of the world of men in general shaitan had gauged much sufficient to be sure that when he went through the gate and invaded first the underground complex disarming its defences and making it his impregnable fortress and then the rest of the necroscopes world little would stand before him his army of vampire servitors would spread out insidiously through all the earth and his dark disciples would carry his plague into every part until he reigned supreme even as he had sought to reign in that far dim dawn which he was not permitted to remember and each time shaitan thought of that then he would go to where harry lay upon a traveller blanket close to their fire gaze on him anew and wonder where hed seen that vaguely familiar face before in what far land in what dim and unremembered time in what previous existence he wondered too about the necroscopes strange powers amazing powers which he alone possessed brought with him out of an alien world with his own ancient but trustworthy eyes shaitan had seen him move instantaneously from place to place but without crossing the distance between yes he had come through the gate from the world beyond almost as if as if he had fallen from the one into the next as shaitan had once fallen and from the same world possibly except except shaitan had forgotten for they but who had robbed him of all such memories the necroscopes fellow men had cast him out even as shaitan was cast out in that time before the wamphyri exiled him causing him to flee here for his differences so that in a way the father of vampires even felt a weird kinship with the necroscope and when harrys mind was repaired a little shaitan entered it again to ask him do i know you where have i seen you before are you of their order who expelled me from my rightful place harrys mind was frequently coherent in its limbo he knew he was addressed even knew something of the one who addressed him and the meaning of his questions and no he answered to all three shaitan tried again i have heard your thoughts in them you wonder about strange worlds beyond common ken not in the spaces between the stars but in the spaces between the spaces indeed you have access to just such an invisible space where you move more surely and speedily than a fish in water i too would move there in the darkness which is not of the world show me how it had been the necroscopes bestkept secret but damaged in mind and body he could no longer keep it and if he should try the fallen ones mental hypnosis would unlock the mystery anyway and so he showed shaitan the computer screen of his mind where möbius equations at once commenced mounting in a crescendo shaitan saw felt warned was afraid stop he commanded when the faintest pulse of a tortured möbius door began to form out of nothing in his mind and as the screen was wiped clean and the unformed door imploded into itself so the great leech sighed his relief and was pleased to remove himself from harry for having felt the energies emanating from those equations and surrounding that door he suspected that indeed he had known them before in a world beyond where theyd been part and parcel of his downfall but now shaitan knew that harrys secret place was forever beyond him and the knowledge angered him what kinship with this puling babe this infant in dark arts this bruised and bloodied unblooded innocent he must be mad even to have dreamed of it anyway what did it matter that there were forbidden invisible places the visible ones would do for starters and one at a time would suffice now that starside had fallen the world beyond the gate the necroscopes own world would be next and entry into that place would be soon before sunup between times shaitan knew all he needed to know from the necroscope shaithis could have him now let the socalled helllander suffer a vampires agonies and death and him and all of his mystery go up in fire and smoke and so be at an end such were the fallen ones thoughts which he allowed to go out from himself but inside him there were deeper currents fit and well this harry keogh had been a force if he should live he could well become a force again even a power which was why shaithis if he had any vision at all would be wise to deal with him with dispatch aye before shaitan dealt with him in his turn from the necroscopes point of view or rather to his traumatized perceptions events revolved in an endless round of nausea and drifting confusion semiconscious agony and a waking hell of blurred vision haunting flashes of incomplete memories and vivid but all too frequently meaningless bursts of input sometimes while his metamorphic flesh worked hard to heal both body and brain his mind seemed part of a morbid merrygoround turning on its own axis and reviewing the same scenes over and over at others it was trapped in the mirrors of a kaleidoscope where each scrap of coloured tinsel was a disjointed fragment of his past life or current existence in his more lucid moments harry knew that given even the best of conditions his injuries would take time in the healing he had neither the conditions nor the time after shaitan gave him to shaithis the latter had had him crucified close to the gate silver nails held him to the green timbers and a silver spike passed through him through his vampire and the trunk of the cross and out the back where it was bent to one side as fast as his wamphyri flesh worked to repair him so the silver poisoned him and he guessed no he knew that he wouldnt come down off this cross alive at his feet a bonfire of dry broken branches confirmed it a second cross had been erected for karen sometimes she hung there which impaired her healing processes and kept her servile and at others she was absent harry felt for her most when her cross was empty for that was when shaithis used and abused her if he had the strength the necroscope would talk to her telepathically except he suspected she would not let him in no for she would keep her torments to herself and not add to his despair but from time to time when karens cross was empty harry would look down on shaithiss tent of skins and the hatred would burn in him like a fire and then but far too late he would wish hed given his vampire free rein perhaps mercifully such moments of mental clarity understanding and remorse were few and far between he didnt remember the arrival of the travellers called through the pass by shaithis loyal in their way to the wamphyri they were of a fearful muchdespised supplicant tribe of gauntletmakers en route here from sunside and obedient to shaithiss commands theyd stolen away the women and younger men from a party of less subjugated travellers also they had been employed to build the shelters of the vampire lords and to cut and gather the wood for fires and crosses little good any of this did them shaithis and his monstrous ancestor served all of them alike they brutalized and impregnated the women vampirized the pick of the men to be their thralls and lieutenants and fed the rest to the warriors preparatory to the invasion of the gate that last was something which the necroscope did remember the butchery as the last of the travellers tried to flee and the gluttony of the warriors especially he remembered how shaithis for his amusement had given a traveller woman to a warrior with the parts of a man when it was over and apparently aroused shaithis had taken karen down from her cross and into his tent and when that was over and she was nailed up again then he had come to gloat at the foot of harrys cross ive had my fill of your bitch wizard he said with a shrug as if in casual conversation it was even my thought to lie with her in the open and let you watch except as youve seen these beasts of mine are frisky i had no desire to give them ideas but the next time she comes down off her crossah that will be the last time and while you are burning or at least until the skin of your eyes turns black and peels away you shall see it all only a shame that your own agonies must detract from your enjoyment of hers then harrys hatred had been a greater torture than the nails and the spike together so great that he was driven back into the darkness of oblivion but not before he had heard the fallen ones mindwarning to his descendant ware shaithis be advised not to drive this one too far i fancy theres that in him which even he fails to appreciate something beyond his control some weird instinctive mechanism which works through him dont trigger it my son even the travellers when they hunt and kill wild pigs are wise enough not to taunt their prey but in shaithiss secret mind was nothing but scorn hed lived through too many auroras just dreaming of these moments of triumph taunt this tame pig of a necroscope oh yes right to the bitter end fusion fission finale the wamphyri lords stole more women out of sunside with their lust and their bellies satisfied they slept likewise their beasts and thralls sunup gradually approached and the sky began to lighten over sunside when the first soft rains awakened them before the suns first deadly rays could shoot between the peaks into starside and the north then they would pass in through the gate to invade the world beyond but while they slept harry wolfson once harry jr then the dweller and now the leader of the grey brotherhood padded down from the mountains and through the foothills and stood off in the shadows to gaze upon the forces of evil where they lay in the gates glare he gazed on them and upon the naked human figures crucified in their midst and while the great grey wolf had no way of knowing it he his father and shaitan the fallen all three of them shared a common problem their memories were impaired but where in shaitan the deficiency had localized itself and was stable and where in harry sr it gradually improved in harry wolfson it grew worse from moment to moment and would not improve until he was a wolf entire but for now faint memories stirred of the woman in the hard ground who had suckled him of a man on a cross who was his father and of a girl likewise crucified who had been an ally also of a battle long long ago in a place called the garden which had been the end of one life and the beginning of another and of a second more recent battle in the same place in which he and his grey brothers had no part but were only observers he remembered now how he had planned to fight in that battle on the side of the two who were crucified but he didnt remember his reasons in any case it would have made no difference theyd done their fighting in the air and their warriors were huge and he and the pack were only wolves yet still he felt that hed somehow failed these poor crucified creatures the man unconscious on his cross and the woman awake inured and even resigned now to pain but not immune to her own black hatred back in the foothills one of the brothers lay back his head and howled at the moon rising over the mountains in its lower quarter the moon was golden with reflected light soon it would be sunup another howl echoing up to accompany the first caused harry wolf son to issue an instinctive thought hush be quiet let the sleepers sleep on his brothers heard him and so did the lady karen dweller her thoughts were faint shielded from the minds of the sleeping vampires but they evoked a flood of memories however blurred harry wolf son knew she spoke to him i am that one he finally answered and again i was that one but now he must know the truth and asked her did i betray you the fight a shake of her head telepathically sensed no that was doomed from the start your father and i we had already seen our futures golden fire burning in the möbius continuum as for our enemies we thought wed seen the end of them too but we were mistaken for it appears that their futures dont lie here in starside but in the world beyond the gate pictures accompanied her words a scenario straight out of the necroscopes and her own trip in future time and wondered if he would understand them he did and im sorry but his memories were sharper now and coming faster my father should have known better to read the future is a devious thing aye she agreed i thought the golden fire might be that of the sun but no it was only fire they both burn its true but shaithiss will burn the worst because it is his i hate the black bastard he saw the logs and branches heaped beneath her shaithis will burn you whats left when his warriors are through with me and even in a wolfs mind she read horror is there anything i can do harry wolfson came closer on his belly creeping between thralls where they lay in an open circle around the two central black tents go away she answered back into the mountains save yourself become a wolf entire eat what you kill and never bite a man or woman lest they suffer your fate but we were together at the garden he said and in his mind she saw again the fire and death and destruction yes but you were a power then you and your weapons but no sooner that last thought than suddenly there was another in her head one of revenge does anything remain of your armoury his mind was wandering again he looked this way and that and wondered what he was doing here his recently pregnant bitch would be hungry where she waited for him armoury he couldnt remember so she showed him a picture can you bring me one of these some two hundred yards away out on the boulder plain a sated warrior snorted in its sleep harry wolfson snaked back into the shadows loped for the foothills to rejoin the pack a single thought came back to karen before the connection was broken farewell and hanging there in her pain in the night and the chill of starside she thought he wont remember but she was wrong he came again but barely in time came with the clouds from the south with the first warm rain with the grey light glowing in the sky beyond the mountains he came with the false dawn before the true dawn of sunup and braved the circle of thralls where now they scratched and muttered in their sleep and climbing the logs and branches of karens pyre he stood upon his hind legs face to face as if to kiss her but her mouth gaped like a gash in her metamorphic face and what passed between the two was not a kiss wizard necroscope wake up harry gave a start as shaithiss thoughts lashed him like a whip his thoughts and then his spoken words your torment will soon be over necroscope so open your eyes and say goodbye to all of this to your lady your life to everything harrys thoughts had something of form and order his mind was almost healed his body not nearly so silver was present in his vampire blood like grains of arsenic so that his broken flesh and bones couldnt mend but he heard shaithis taunting him and felt a splash of rain and opened his soulful eyes in the dark grey predawn light then he almost wished he was blind lieutenants of shaithis were up on ladders bringing karen down from her cross her head rolled this way and that and her limbs flopped loosely as they tossed her down on a blanket upon the stony ground shaithis turned from harrys cross went to his tent and slashed through its ropes collapsing it like a deflated balloon and so you see necroscope he crowed how i intend to honour my promise for perceiving that you now see hear and understand all this time for the last time i shall take her in the open no thrill in it for me not any more this time my labours are all for you and when im done then you shall witness how my warriors deal with her as well to keep ones creatures happy eh for after all they too were men upon a time the rain came on harder and shaithis issued commands his thralls ripped the collapsed tent into two halves then used its torn skins to cover the faggots of the torture pyres it would not do for them to get too wet shaithis had meanwhile returned to the foot of the cross shaitan too from his own tent more leech than man the fallen ones eyes were glowing embers in the shadow of a black corrugated cowl of flesh its time he said his voice a phlegmy cough and the gate awaits i say have done with all this put the woman on her pyre and burn them shaithis paused he was reminded however briefly of his old dream but dreams are for dreamers and he was weary now of all dark omens especially his ancestors warnings this man was the cause of my exile in the icelands he answered i vowed revenge and now i take it they glared at each other shaitan and shaithis there in the gates white dazzle their eyes blazed where they measured one another but finally the fallen one turned away as you will he said but quietly so be it the clouds were flown and the rain had stopped shaithis called his thralls to light torches he took a torch and held it up to harry on his cross well necroscope and why dont you call up the dead my ancestor has told me that in your own world you were their champion and i saw you call up crumbling trogs in the battle for the dwellers garden so why not now harry hadnt the strength for it which his tormentor knew well enough but even if he were strong he knew that the dead wouldnt answer him no for he was a vampire and they had forsaken him but in the foothills behind the gate a grey shape fretted and whined prowling to and fro to and fro and the pack watching him intently through feral eyes where they lay with their tongues lolling and ears erect the great wolfs memory was imperfect and his nature devolving but for now he understood the necroscopes every thought in a bygone time as a human infant harry wolfsons mind had been one with his fathers the necroscope sensed his son there felt his concern and at once closed his mind to external scrying it was an effort but he did it shaitan knew it at once flowed forward and said to shaithis get on with it this ones not finished i tell you now he has closed his mind so that we dont know whats brewing in there in just a little while the other snarled his brains will be brewing in there but for now leave me ber and again shaitan backed off well harry keogh shaithis called up to the crucified man he waved his torch and tugged aside the skins from the dry branches of the balefires and did you think to shut me out from your delicious agonies and can you ignore the pain itself ah we wamphyri have our arts its true we steel ourselves to the throb of torn flesh and the ache of broken bones aye even as theyre healing but the vampire never lived who was insensitive to fire and youll feel it too necroscope when your flesh begins to melt he reached down with his torch to the base of the pile so what do you say should i light it now are you ready to burn and at last harry answered him you burn you ordure of trogs and stench of gasbeasts burn in hell shaithis slapped his thigh and laughed like a madman oh hah ha ha a taunt for a taunt eh what and do you think to insult you executioner he touched his torch to tufts of kindling and a wisp of smoke at once curled up then a small tongue of flame and in the shadowy foothills harry wolfson issued an ululating howl then turned and at a fast lope headed downhill for the tableau set in the light of the gate the grey brotherhood made to accompany him but he stopped them no return to your mountains what befalls me befalls flames licked up from harrys pyre small bright tongues but gaining rapidly shaithis went to karen where his thralls held her down she was conscious now would throw them off but had no strength for it necroscope the vampire lord continued to taunt wanderer in strange worlds and stranger spaces between the worlds now say why dont you conjure one of your mysterious boltholes and come down from your cross step down and challenge me face to face and champion this bitch whose flesh weve both known come necroscope save her from my embrace instinctively harrys metaphysical mind began to conjure möbius maths invisible to all other men the shimmering frame of a door commenced to form in the eye of his mind except of course it was warped and highly volatile only let it develop fully and all of this would be over so close to the gate harry would probably be shredded and his atoms diffused through the myriad universes of light maybe that was the answer the way to go at least he would be spared the agony of the fire but what of the agony of others what of the future agony of the entire world which lay beyond the gate too late to worry about that earth was already doomed or was it for harry knew that miracles can happen and also that they occasionally happen when all seems lost but in any case he could always conjure another door a bigger more powerful door when things became unbearable but no said harry wolfson in the necroscopes inner mind even as he thought to collapse what hed made hold it there father just for a moment and harry felt his son looking at the möbius equations where they mutated in his mind and at the flickering warping configuration of the partformed door looking trying hard to understand and finally remembering in another moment the great wolf conjured equations which even harry in the fullness of his powers could never have identified symbols revenant of a time when the necroscopes son had been far more powerful than his father for a few seconds certain of harry wolfsons lost talents were recalled and with the effortless skill of all but forgotten times he used one of them to diffuse through his fathers illformed door a picture of their here and now and a warning of possible tomorrows it sped out from him at the instantaneous speed of thought into all the innumerable universes of light the necroscope cancelled his own numbers and let go of the now highly dangerous door which drifted away from him towards the magnet of the gate but his sons message and his warning had been transmitted harry wolfson had completed the mental part of his selfimposed mission all that remained now was the physical but where the first had been merely improbable the rest was impossible that made no difference not to the great grey wolf who remembered now that he had been a man as well then to die like a man in through the encircling thralls he loped like a wraith appearing from the smoke of harrys fire and snarling he made for shaithis where the vampire lord kneeled beside karen but he didnt make it lieutenants got in his way one of them hurled a spear and brought him down slavering and snarling with the spear transfixing his breast and emerging bloody through his hackles still his slender human hands reached spastically for lord shaithis until a sword flashed silver and took his head from his cross through billowing smoke though the flames had not yet reached him harry had seen it all no he cried out loud and in his mind cried out again no no no and something of his agony not merely of the flesh but of the soul went out through the disintegrating möbius door which on the instant imploded into the gate then a single brilliant prolonged flash of lightning illuminating the peaks followed by a long low ominous drum roll of thunder and finally a silence broken only by the crackle of the bonfire and the sputtering of fresh raindrops striking the flames until for the third time shaitan came forward you cannot feel it can you he stood over his descendant glared at him a while then lifted his head to sniff like some great hound the necroscope has released something into the air and into his secret places but you feel only your own lust youve neither thought nor vision for the future only for what you can take today and so i warn you one last time beware son of my sons lest you lose us a world shaithiss face was twisted in its madness he was first and foremost wamphyri and now allowed his vampire full sway a beast his hands were transformed into talons blood slopped from his great jaws where his teeth elongated into fangs and tore the flesh of his mouth with karens once crowning now lustreless hair bunched in his fist he looked up at shaitan and beyond him to the man on the cross and his eyes blazed scarlet as he answered i should feel something some weird mystical thing all i desire to feel is the necroscopes agony and the flight of his and his vampires spirit as he dies but if i can hurt him a little more before he dies so be it fool and a heavy greymottled appendage of shaitans a thing halfhand halfclaw fell on shaithiss shoulder he shrugged it off and came easily to his feet and ancestor mine he ground the words out you have pushed me too far and i sense that i shall never be free of your interference in my affairs well talk more about that shortly but until then with a mindcall he brought forward his warrior out of the shadows placing the creature between himself and shaitan the fallen shaitan backed off and gloomed on the warrior which in the icelands had been shaithiss most recent construct prior to their departure and inquired of his descendant are you threatening my life shaithis knew that sunup was nigh and time of the essence he had none of the latter to waste right now he would confront his ancestor later possibly after the fortress beyond the gate had been taken and so threatening your life he answered of course not we are allies the last of the wamphyri but we are also individuals with our individual needs for which reason shaitan in his turn let shaithis live for the moment and as the fire smoked and blazed up brighter despite a renewed downpour and as harry keogh felt the first breath of heat where flames closed in towards his lower limbs shaithis again turned his attentions to the lady karen while in another world it was midnight in the urals deep under the perchorsk ravine in the confines of his small room viktor luchov snatched himself awake from a monstrous nightmare panting and trembling still only halfawake he stood up on jelly legs and gazed all about at the grey metal walls and leaned on one for its support his dream had been so real it had impressed him so badly that his first thought had been to press his alarm button and call out to the men he kept stationed in the corridor outside even now he would do so except and as hed learned only too well the last time such an action could well be fraught with a terror of its own especially in the claustrophobic nerveracking confines of the perchorsk projekt he had no desire to have anyone come bursting in here with the smoking redglowing muzzle of a flamethrower at the ready as his heartbeat slowed a little and while he fumblingly dressed he examined his nightmare a strange even ominous thing in it he had heard an awful tortured cry go out from the gate at perchorsks core and hed known its author harry keogh the necroscope had cried out his telepathic anguish to any and all who could hear him but mainly to the teeming dead in their myriad resting places across the world and in their turn they had answered him as best they could with a massed moaning and groaning even with their soft and crumbling movements from the airless environs of their innumerable graves for the dead knew how they had misjudged the necroscope how theyd denied and finally forsaken him and it was as if they were griefstricken and preparing for a new golgotha and the departed spirit of paul savinkov a man who had worked for kgb major chingiz khuv right here at perchorsk worked and died here horribly had materialized and spoken to the projekt direktor in his dream telling him about the warning which harry keoghs son had sent out through the gate for in life savinkov had been a telepath and his talent had stayed with him continuing into the afterlife and seeing in luchovs mind the nuclear solution to the threat from beyond the gate savinkov had told him then you know what to do viktor do yes for they are coming through the gate and you know how to stop them coming who is coming you know who luchov had understood and answered but those weapons may not be used until we are sure then when we can see the threat it will be too late savinkov cried if not for us too late for harry keogh weve all wronged him and now must make amends for he suffers needless agonies wake up viktor its in your hands now my god luchov had tossed and turned but savinkov had seen that he wouldnt wake not yet but there were others sleeping here who would and then when luchov heard the telepath talking again to whom and what he asked begged them to do that was when hed started awake now he was dressed and almost in control of himself but still breathless still alert and listening tuned in to the projekts heartbeat the dull throb of an engine somewhere reverberating softly through the floor the clang of a hatch echoing distantly the hum and rattle of the ventilation system in the old days the direktor had been accommodated on an upper level much closer to the exit shaft up there it had seemed quieter less oppressive but down here with the magmass caverns and the core almost directly underfoot it could be that he felt the entire mountain weighing on his shoulders still listening intently luchovs breathing and heartbeat gradually slowed as it became apparent that all was in order and it really had been a dream only a terrible dream or had it that sudden clatter of running footsteps coming closer in the corridor outside and voices shouting hoarse warnings now what in the world he went to open the door to the corridor and heard in the back of his mind like an echo from his dream but viktor you already know what in the world paul savinkovs telepathic voice and clear as a bell except this time it was no dream a hammering at his door which luchov opened with hands which were trembling again he saw his guards astonishment written in their drawn tired faces and a pair of gaunt technicians just this moment arrived here from the core comrade direktor one of the latter gasped clawing at his arm direktor luchov i i would have telephoned but the lines are under repair luchov could see that the technician was stalling the man was terrified to report what must be reported because he knew it was unbelievable and now for the first time there sounded the sharp crack crack crack of distant gunshots at that galvanized luchov found strength to croak its not something from the gate no no but there are things luchovs flesh crawled things from under the gate from the abandoned magmass regions and oh god they are dead things comrade direktor dead things the sort of things harry keogh would understand and which understood him only too well and according to the warnings of a dead man the worst of it still to come but hadnt luchov tried to warn byzarnov what could happen and hadnt he advised him to press that damned button right there and then of course he had even knowing at the time that the major didnt fully understand and that in any case circumstances didnt warrant it also byzarnov was a military man and had his orders well circumstances had changed maybe now he would put his orders aside and take matters into his own hands luchov had experienced and lived through similar disasters before now he felt torn two ways should he make his escape to the upper levels and abandon the projekt entirely or should he see what could be done down below his conscience won there were men down there after all just following bloody orders he headed for the core as he ran along the angled splitlevel steel ramp through the upper magmass cavern to the steep stairwell leading down to the gate the projekt direktor heard the first shouts screams and more gunshots from the core the technicians were right behind him his own men too armed with smgs and a flamethrower but as he approached the actual shaft where it spilled light from the gate up into the cavern so major alexei byzarnovs voice echoed from behind calling for him to wait in a moment the major had caught up i was alerted he gasped the messenger was incoherent a gibbering idiot can you tell me whats going on viktor though luchov hadnt seen it yet not with his own eyes still he had a fair idea what was going on but there was no way he could explain it to byzarnov far better to let him see it for himself so that when he answered i dont know whats happening his simple lie was in fact a halftruth in any case there was no time for further conversation for as a renewed burst of screams and gunshots rang out so the major grasped luchovs arm and shouted then wed damn well better find out a box of plastic eyeshields lay at the head of the ramp just inside the shaft byzarnov luchov and his guards each man paused to snatch up a pair of tinted lenses before continuing down to the core there they emerged in a group spreading out onto a railed platform high in the inwardcurving wall from that vantage point looking down on the glaring gate with its reflective perimeter of steel plates they could take in the entire unbelievable tableau in all its horror dead men oncemen who had become hideous magmass composites whose stench was overpowering even up here were active in the core coming up through hatches in the fishscale plates invading the safety perimeter and the rubberfloored area of the missilelauncher there were nine of them all told six of whom had already emerged and moved clear of the currently inactive electrical and acid spray hazard area but such was their nature that byzarnov could scarcely take in what he was seeing again clutching luchovs arm he reeled like a drunkard at the rail of the platform for christs sake what he mouthed his eyes bugging as they swept over the madness down below luchov knew he need not say anything the major could see for himself what these things were indeed he had seen several of them before down there in the magmass when they had been part of the magmass some were rotting others were mummified none was composed of flesh alone they were part stone rubber metal plastic even paper some were inverted with material foldedin which had tried to become homogeneous with them they were magmass neither pure nor simple but highly complex magmass at its nightmarish worst one of them guarding the perimeter walkway had an open book for a hand he had been reading a repair manual when the original perchorsk incident happened and the book had become a permanent part of him now his left forearm mutated into a stiff paper spine at the wrist with pages fluttering and detaching themselves as he moved this wasnt the worst of it the lower half of his trunk had been reversed so that his feet pointed backwards even the plastic frames of his spectacles had warped into his face and bubbled up in crusts of brittle blisters there while their lenses lay upon his cheeks where first theyd melted then solidified into tears of optical glass and yet he had been one of the luckier ones shut in by magmass crushed in the grip of convulsive forces and confined away from the air he had died instantly and his fleshy parts had later undergone a process of mummification but when the perchorsk incident was over and spacetime righted itself others had been left dead and twisted and isolated out in the open and their condition had been such that ordinary men just could not bring themselves to tend to them fully or partly exposed occasionally joined to the greater magmass whole or partly encysted within it they had simply been left to degrade in areas of the projekt which were then sealed and abandoned eventually their human parts had rotted down to deformed skeletons for even bone had been subject to change in those awful moments when matter had devolved to its inchoate origins byzarnov saw men who were part machine he saw a creature with a face composed of a welding torch jutting from a crumpled oxygen cylinder skull another was skeletal from the waist down but encysted around the chest and head in glassy stone like a figure in a halfspacesuit spiky magmass crystals were growing out of the fused bone of his legs and behind the glass of his viewplate his unaltered face was still trapped in an endless scream another was legless a halfman which the magmass warp had equipped at the hips with the wheels of a porters trolley he propelled himself with arms which were black where scorched flesh had shrivelled into the bone the trolleys long wooden handles projected upwards from his shoulders like weird antennae framing his head the twisted mummied hybrids were bad enough the semimechs were worse but worst of all were those who were partly liquescent who but for their magmass parts must simply collapse into stinking ruin byzarnov had almost stopped breathing he started again with a gasp said but how and what are they doing he turned to one of his terrified technicians why havent we fried them or melted them with acid the first one up made it to the defence mechanism the man told him he ripped out the wiring no one lifted a hand to stop him not then no one believed byzarnov could understand that but what do they want are you blind luchov started down the steps cant you see for yourself and indeed byzarnov could see for himself the nine oncemen had isolated the exorcet module they were closing in on it invading it three of the majors technicians together with a handful of perchorsks soldiers were trying to hold them off an impossible task dead men dont feel pain shoot at these magmass monsters all they would the launchers defenders couldnt kill them a second time but why byzarnov came stumbling down the steps after luchov behind them on the platform the other technicians and luchovs guards were reluctant to follow whats their intention to press the bloody button luchov barked they may be dead warped weird but theyre not stupid were the stupid ones at the foot of the steps the major caught up and grasped luchovs shoulder tress the button fire the missiles but they mustnt luchov turned on him but they must dont you see whatever brought them up knew more than we do the dead dont walk for just anyone or anything no they need a damn good reason to put themselves to torture such as this madman byzarnov hissed he was close to breaking oh quite obviously this is some longterm alien effect of this totally unnatural place but these reanimated things cant have any real purpose theyre blind insensate dead they want to launch those missiles luchov shouted in the others face over the clamour of discharged weapons and we have to help them at which the major knew that the projekt direktor really was mad help them he drew his pistol and pointed it at luchovs chest you poor crazy bastard get the hell back away from there luchov turned from him hurried along the rubberfloored safety perimeter towards the creature with the pageshedding manual for a hand its all right he was gasping let me pass ill do it for you and to byzarnovs amazement the thing shuffled aside for him like hell you will the major shouted and squeezed the trigger of his automatic the bullet hit luchov in the right shoulder and passed right through punching out in a scarlet spray from a hole in his chest he was thrown forward facedown on the walkway where he lay still for a moment and byzarnov came on aiming at him a second time but the magmass things knew an ally when they saw one the thing with the book hand got in byzarnovs way blocking his aim while another whose limbs were cased in stony magmass welded to a trunk which was a jumble of fused bone rubber and glass came lurching to the direktors assistance the major fired at this one pointblank time and again to no avail but as the thing loomed in front of him finally a shot cracked the magmass casing of its left arm the brittle sheath fragmented at once and a black vile soup a decomposed mush of flesh began leaking from inside almost overwhelmed by the stench the major fell against the curving wall still the rotting hybrid came on byzarnov lifted his pistol and pulled the trigger and the firing mechanism made a click he had a spare magazine in his pocket he reached for it and the magmass thing closed a bony hand on his windpipe byzarnov choked he could see luchov getting to his feet staggering moving towards the launching module where most of the defenders had either fainted or stampeded in terror only one technician and one soldier remained there now their weapons were empty and they danced gibbered and clung together like children as decomposing nightmares closed in on them but luchov two of the magmass composites were helping him supporting him where he lurched towards the firing console the major made a final effort drew the spare magazine from his pocket and tried to fit it into the housing in the pistol grip of his weapon as he did so the magmass sheath fell away completely from his assailants left arm byzarnov opened his mouth to yell or throw up and the anomalous thing stuffed its skeletal arm and envelope of jellied rotting flesh right down his throat the major gagged and vibrated where the thing pinned him his eyes stood out in his head and his heart stopped he died there and then but not before hed seen luchov at the firing console not before hed seen him slump there and crumple to the rubber floor even as the klaxons began bellowing their final warning on starside harry keogh burned the rain was a drizzle which tried to but couldnt damp down the flames and the necroscope burned he burned inside and out fire on the outside and a burning consuming hatred within for shaithis who even now took the lady karen by force there in front of harrys cross she seemed completely exhausted resisted not at all as he tore at her and harry thought a beast even a warrior could do no worse but he hoped hed be dead before that was put to the test a moment ago he had tried to conjure a möbius door the biggest door of all right there in front of the gate which with any luck would implode massively and suck the vampires and their creatures and all into eternity but the numbers wouldnt come the computer screen of his mind had stayed blank it was as if his skills had died with his wolf son like a slate wiped clean and indeed such was the case after a lifetime of esoteric use finally harrys mind had given way crumpled under the weight of one too many tragedies now he was a man again just a man and the vampire inside him was too immature even to flee his melting body come down necroscope shaithis taunted should i leave some of this bitch for you the flames were licking higher now and black smoke belching shaitan had somehow got round the obstacle of shaithiss warrior and stood observing all across a short distance and for all that the fallen one was alien unmanlike unreadable still there was that in his poise the way his eyes stared out from the darkness of his cowl which spoke of an almost human uncertainty and apprehension as if hed seen all this before and now waited for some awesome termination harrys lower trunk was being eaten alive by fire now he must sleep and escape from the agonies of life forever except instead of blacking out suddenly he felt the pain laved away from him deflected turned outwards and he knew that this was not simply an art of the wamphyri his body burned but the pain was someone elses many someones were absorbing it all the dead of starside who now that it was too late only desired to comfort him no he tried to tell them trogs and travellers alike you have to let me die but his deadspeak wasnt working wheres your power now shaithis laughed if youre so strong set yourself free call up the teeming dead curse me with words of power necroscope hah your words like the dead themselves are dust and somehow from somewhere harry found the strength to answer put yourself aside shaithis the sight of you hurts worse than any fire these flames are a blessing they cleanse you from my sight enough shaithis raged foaming over karen like a scummy wave one last kiss and shes gone and you with her he fell on her his jaws cracked open he began to close his mouth over karens face to crush her head and her scarlet eyes opened into blazing life perhaps she also opened her mind to let shaithis read his doom at any rate he tried to rear back from her but no her arms and legs were around him and their metamorphic flesh was welded into one and coughing up the dwellers grenade into her throat karen pulled the pin with her forked tongue and buried her face in her tormentors gaping jaws shaithis tried to separate from her another second and he might succeed too late goodbye harry she said and the darkness of starside was split by a single flash of light accompanied by a detonation only slightly muffled by the flesh and bone which it turned to grey and crimson pulp as the red spray settled and their headless shuddering bodies fell apart shaitan flowed forward to stand over them he ignored karen saw only the shell of shaithis and reaching a clawed tentacle into the shattered cavity of his descendants neck shaitan drew out his whipping decapitated leech drew it out and hurled it into the heart of the bonfire and laughed for shaithis had no head no brain and shaitan had no body not the body he wanted anyway not yet you fool he told the empty shell of flesh and would you set your warrior on me we were of one blood you and i but my grip on the minds of creatures such as these was ever greater than yours close on three thousand years i listened to old kehrl lugoz moaning in his iceencased sleep cursing me in his dreams did you think i would not notice when suddenly he stopped ah he cursed me but he was craven too did you really think to inspire your construct with his hatred and passions what old kehrl he had no passion not any longer and as for hatred he turned and hurled a mental dart at shaithiss warrior which at once reared up and shrank back mewling you do not know the meaning of the word what hatred and how i have hated you if i had let my jealousy loose why i could have killed you a hundred times but never so sweetly as this he flowed up to shaithis picked up his loosely flopping corpse and hugged it close and shaitans black corrugated flesh began to crack open down all its length like a wrinkled nut displaying its soft kernel within the cavity of his ancient trunk a smaller more flexible and yet more durable version of himself the original vampire was waiting as it had waited these thousands of years but shaitans plan to join with flesh of his flesh and so be renewed was not to be for the two harrys had sent out word of their agony not only into starside earth and all the worlds beyond but also into the spaces between them their travails were known by all the teeming dead and their warnings had been heard by others who were not dead and never can be in the same moment shaitan and the necroscope sensed the one great truth harry knew and shaitan finally he remembered ahhhh the fallen one gasped staggered by the memory even as his vampire struggled to be free of the old shell and into shaithis so its eyes where they were housed within his cowl looked up at harry keogh burning on his cross shaitan looked at his face framed in fire and knew where he had seen it before but now he saw or sensed rather than saw it was that swift something else something that flashed silver out of the gates white glare and then became an even greater glare as a nuclear sun burst over starside briefly to rival the dawn and between the coming of the exorcet and the bursting of its allconsuming warhead shaitan saw something else a sight which might have drawn one last long sigh from that prime evils throat except he was no more it was harrys cross but empty now and pierced by the spears of a great light where at last it was blasted to atoms epilogue death harry wondered why hed feared it for of all men the necroscope had known it wasnt like that because he had been there before incorporeal bodiless as any dead thing whose flesh has finally failed he was now free of all that except that in his case it seemed a mundane death wasnt part of the scenario he had always known that death wasnt the end that whatever a man pursues in life he will keep pursuing in his afterlife continuation harry keogh had been the master of the möbius continuum so it was hardly a surprise to find himself there now in möbius time hurtling back among the blue green and red threads of starside into their remote past a surprise no but strange anyway for in the end he had not conjured a door he had not contrived an escape which could only mean that hed been rescued but by whom and if indeed someone or ones had seen fit to save his incorporeal mind what possible purpose could he or they have with his burned vampiric body for as harry shot back into starsides past he saw his separate smoking corpse tumbling alongside winding back on its scarlet thread to his point of entry into starside and then plunging on beyond it and he went with it but incorporeal apart speeding blindly into times hed never physically known as for his ruined shells destination and his own for that matter and the question of who was their guide harry had never in his life been one hundred per cent sure positive sure about god or a god but back there in starside hed sensed the arrival the presence of a power and had known that shaitan sensed it too moreover he had known the source of that power and also that möbius and pythagoras before him had been right now harry and his exanimate shell were mere impulses in the mind he had called the möbius continuum integers in the infinite matrix of the great unknowable equation and he wasnt afraid when at long last that mind itself spoke to him things have uses harry always what use to create if your efforts are only to be wasted sometimes we succeed and sometimes we fail but there are always uses for the best and for the worst of our works harry couldnt tell if an answer had been invited and in any case he didnt really have one but he did have a question however brief god he sensed a vast shrug a creator an adviser an angel god is lets say hes a few steps higher up the ladder his mind as you know is vast we carry his thoughts expedite his wishes as best we can ive had my doubts harry admitted so do we sometimes so did shaitan when he was one of us except he would have tried to convince everyone that he was right throughout all the universes of light he would have forced their beliefin him harry believed he understood and understanding should have been enough but because he was or had been human and because he saw that his course was veering angling away from his tumbling corpse even now he was curious so that he asked what now your feet are on the first few rungs youve made your point chosen your course and stuck to it you are a success story we dont believe in waste certainly we wouldnt waste someone as valuable as you like shaitan you wont remember but you will know except where he knew only a great darkness you shall know light in all of your worlds all of my wherever you manifest for his worlds are infinite as his thoughts and that harry indicated his blackened shell where it grew small tumbling towards some undefined purpose causes have effects and effects causes nothing may come to pass which has not passed before the world of sunside and starside was a failure where evil won so maybe a second chance is in order also it will occupy shaitan who has balanced himself against light in a great many worlds here he begins again on the bottom rung for as you well know harry keogh what will be has been time is relative harrys turn to shrug with no vampire in him he was innocent again the very heart of innocence its all very hard to understand he said but i suppose ill learn as i go oh you will the other promised and are you ready harrys corpse had cartwheeled out of sight into the multihued haze of past time pure thought he had no body no head to nod but his deadspeak nodded for him and as his incorporeal mind fragmented in a glorious bombburst a hundred golden splinters breaking up and speeding into as many worlds his thoughts and even his deadspeak were at an end except each and every one of those brilliant shards they were him and they would know starting into awareness shaitan cried out he cried out as he felt consciousness cloaking an intelligence previously bereft will without knowledge inhabiting a mind wiped clean he discovered himself kneeling at the edge of stagnant water and saw his image mirrored in scummy depths and when he saw that he was naked he was ashamed but when he saw that he was beautiful he was proud for shame and pride are of the spirit not of intelligence standing upright shaitan saw that he could walk and in the twilight of a dim misty dawn he moved by the edge of the dark rank waters which were a swamp and he saw how dismal and lonely was this place where he had fallen or into which he had been cast so that he knew himself for a sinner and the place as his punishment such knowledge defined his nature that he instinctively understood such concepts as sin and punishment and he thought his crime must be that he was beautiful which was his pride working which was in fact his crime for shaitan saw beauty as might and might as right and right as he willed it to be which was a will he would impose so thinking he moved away from the rank waters and went to impose his will upon this strange world but in the moment he turned away so the mud bubbled up behind him and he paused to look back where black bubbles came bursting to the surface and with the parting of the weeds shaitan saw a figure floating up into view in its body it was bloated and burned but its face was whole he knew it for an omen but of what he had will he could wait and discover what would be or move on according to his will also he suspected that this thing in the swamp harboured evil why else would such an unclean thing be here in a world which was new for a moment he stood still as at a crossroads then turned back and knelt again beside the swamp for he had willed it that he would know this evil he gazed upon a face he had never known which he would not recall to memory for numberless years and sensed nothing of moment except that he tempted fate which he was proud and glad to do and as the beasts of this dawn world came to the water to drink and as the mists were drawn up from the swamp so the fallen one gazed upon his own future where the weeds anchored it in scum and slime in a while the scorched bloated limbs of the corpse split open and small black mushrooms clustered there growing out of the rotting flesh and opening their gilled caps they released red spores into the twilight before the dawn which of his own free will shaitan breathed his last act of any innocence the wheel had turned full circle and the cycle was closed and opened
