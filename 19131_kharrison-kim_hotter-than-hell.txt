hotter than hell edited by kim harrison and martin h greenberg introduction short stories were where i fell in love with the power behind the printed word a small little nugget of truth or observation a what if of thought pared down to its simplest thought to make the complex easy those masters of the science fiction and fantasy field had created for me a gourmet meal with its small portions elaborately presented to leave the participant impressed knowing that they had taken in something out of the ordinary even if it did leave them hungry for a burger on the way home so it was with great pleasure that i accepted marty greenbergs challenge to put together a short story collection of urban fantasy and paranormal romance tastefully erotic tales of romance love and downright inescapable lust running the stylistic temperature from sweet to spicy to tantalizingly dangerous with urban fantasys goal of finding the reason behind the attraction and paranormal romances open and honest explorations of love and lust i found a refreshingly wide span of storytelling styles but the common thread of an intelligent strongwilled female protagonist in a little over her head rang true in every story i finished deciding that i hadnt helped prepare a gourmet meal in this case but instead somehow created a cool summer fruit salad a bursting of sweet strawberries for romantic love the twang of sour grapes for revenge and loss chunks of apples and peachesthe stories from established worlds we have become familiar with and the exotic flavor of kiwi and passion fruitthe tantalizing glimpses of something new wed like to see more of all mixed up with the sweet dressing of incomparable good storytelling from some of the best authors in the paranormal romance and urban fantasy field today so please pull up a chair in the shade prop up your feet on the cooler full of the icy beverage of your choice set the phone on mute and dig in enjoy and if youre wondering what kind of fruit i think my work is that would be the nuts kim harrison july music hath charms tanya huff as glen maneuvered his car over the rutted field the sign insisted was the parking lot ali frowned out the tinted window at a line of teenagers dressed in white and leading enormous brown cows and wondered if her partner had lost his mind bands that played the county fair circuit might be a step above garage bands but it was usually a small step bedford entertainment needed to sign a group that could pull in some numbers and she didnt think theyd find that here whats up with the kids and the cows she wondered as they bounced to a stop next to an impressively rusted pickup glancing past her as he shifted into park glen shrugged different leash laws in the country i guess come on theyre on in twenty minutes hed brought her here to see a band named noman fiveman countryrock fronted by two brothers brandon and travis noman one sang lead one playedwell in countryrock she supposed it was a fiddle wasnt it she wasnt sure about the name but names were easy enough to change they were backed by guitar bass and drums but she had no information on the musicians when asked glen laughed backup doesnt matter ali its the brothers youre here to see you could back those two withwith boyband leftovers and theyd still kick ass a ringing endorsement he laughed again youll see the stage had been set up at one end of the midway it had a back and a roof of sorts and the ubiquitous three guys in black tshirts screwing around with the sound system but there was no disguising it was actually a hay wagon or that hay bales had been arranged in rows for the audience this explained glens instruction to wear jeans how rustic she murmured as they settled on a bale at the end of the fourth row trust me she closed her hand around his arm please tell me you didnt sleep with them and youve dragged me out to the middle of nowhere to hear a thanksforthefuck audition he laid his hand over hers large and warm and calming i didnt and it isnt although i would have couldnt get close leaning around him ali realized the bales were filling fast with an interesting cross section of humanity she hadnt known baseball caps came in such a wide variety of colors a closer look at the packed first three rowsthe rows between her and the stageand she realized no one sitting there could be considered either old or young and they all exuded a certain visceral anticipation as they waited for the show to start evidently noman had groupies a decent enough showing for a saturday afternoon gig at a county fair but not the kind of numbers that would have kept glen away from the prize nor more importantly the kind of numbers that would make them the saviors bedford entertainment needed on the other hand if they were as good as glen said they were she could build their numbers to the point where theyd become what she needed and if they werentat least shed got out of the city for the afternoon there had to be some truth in what everyone said about fresh air if youd got to them would they she wondered determined to distract herself mouth by her ear he murmured i pegged them as enthusiastically nondiscriminating well she was all for enthusiasm settling her weight against glens shoulder she found a certain amusement in noting the envious looks being sent her way six foot meant a lot of leg in tight jeans the heavy white shirt emphasized the breadth of his shoulders and the rolledup sleeves exposed muscular forearms it might have been gym muscle not work muscle but he didnt look out of place amid the surrounding country boys the light dusting of freckles across his nose just added to the wholesome appeal what are you smiling about the bottle redhead in the front row keeps turning to give you the eye he drew his tongue over a full lower lip watched her squirm and said her boyfriends not bad and thats why i was smiling bitch and thats why you love me ali had a feeling she was attracting some attention herself felt that prickling between her shoulder blades that said someone was staring the feeling grew and although shed had every intention of ignoring it she finally turned no mistaking the familiar figure standing just behind the last row of hay bales he winked he pushed back the curl of thick dark hair that fell over his forehead and he unmistakably winked one brilliant blue eye when he caught her staring bastard she tightened her grip on glens arm tom hartmores here muscle tensed but glen didnt turn if toms here then mikes interested you think she snapped there was nothing michael richters vital music group liked better than finding a band just on the verge of breaking out and thrusting them out onto the world stage vital made stars out of guts and raw talentali had to give them thatand they were so good at it most of the musicians took years to realize theyd signed an ironclad contract giving away rights to everything up to and including posthumous work michael richter didnt believe in death cutting into his bottom line tom could be doing some preliminary scouting working on rumor if he had actual word on the band then mike would be here himself he wouldnt send tom the knot loosened in alis stomach they were still one step ahead a squawk from the sound system drew her attention back to the stage the guitar player was fiddling with his amp the bass player looked stonedalthough that was hardly unusual for bass playersand the drummer looked like hed been borrowed from a thrash metal band no sign of the brothers almost before she finished the thought they were on the stage the matching black cowboy hats seemed to be the only affectationgiven the blazing afternoon sun shed allow traviss sunglasses as a necessityotherwise they were both in jeans and worn boots brandon had on a black tshirt with the bands name in red and travis wore a black shirt tucked in over the biggest belt buckle alid ever seen the sun glinting off it kept drawing her gaze back to his crotch as he tuned up not necessarily a bad thing but she was after the larger picture brandons dark blond hair just covered the back of his neck traviss was longer lighter and tied back as brandon moved to the center microphone the redhead bounced and squealed the redheads boyfriend seemed close to doing the same another vote cast for enthusiastically nondiscriminating then while they wouldnt stop traffic the brothers werent unattractive it was hard to get a handle on their heightgiven the stage and the hatsbut she doubted either of them had hit six foot although travis looked a little taller as far as she could tell they were in good shape and both presented the overt masculinity that often came as a package deal with country singers the way they moved made her think theirs came to them naturally she was obviously missing something though given glens reaction well glen the redhead her boyfriend a pair of busty blondes who waved wildly until brandon acknowledged them with a smile and pretty damned near everyone sitting in the first three rows glen wait for it then travis drew his bow across the strings and ali felt the note dance through blood and bone it was the eeriest damned sound shed ever heard the drummer counted them in as brandon wrapped both hands around the microphone the first song was called sweet southern rain the second wild nights and by the third ali had lost track of the titles she had to move up on her feet like everyone else the crowd growing with every song as men and women abandoned the midway and the show rings she was unable to take her eyes off the way brandons mouth moved mere inches from a big oldfashioned condenser micwhiskey voice caressing or screaming or growling the words all she could think of were those hands cupping her face the way he held the microphone fingers rough against her skin when he started to sweat she breathed deep trying to catch his scent over the hay and the cotton candy wafting in from the midway when he moved she moved with him and imagined his skin slick and hot against hers travis kept playing between songs bow drawing out soft sighs and desperate moans each sound the perfect counterpoint to brandons patter as he introduced songs and the band and flirted with the audience the band and occasionally his brother they took two encores and finally left the stage travis playing one last note that hung over the fairground as it faded ali took a deep breath and sagged against glens side feeling like there wasnt enough oxygen left in the world my god im wet she was drenched sweat molding her tshirt to her sides her hair damp and sticking to the back of her neck but as she smacked him on the arm she knew that wasnt what he meant enthralled her voice sounded raw wanting everything seemedmore the sky seemed bluer the grass seemed greener the breeze didnt just blow past her bare arms it caressed sunwarmed skin no need to look to understand why glen had worn his shirt untucked although given how tight his jeans were that kind of pressure couldnt be fun the redhead sat straddling her boyfriends lap his face against her neck one big hand buried in her hair the other splayed over the patch of creamy skin between her jeans and the edge of her tshirt she rocked her hips slowly the gentle rhythm suggesting the main event was already over and they were just riding out the aftershocks unable to help herself ali rocked forward to the same rhythm seeking the minimal friction her jeans could offer there were a few couples still in the first three rows but most of the bales were empty noman has a very hopeful fanbase glen told her shifting uncomfortably and backstage is probably one of the only private areas on the fairground even if you cant nail the band youll still be able to take the edge off charming she had control of her voice again and could only pray that her own need to take the edge off wasnt showing on her face she turned scanning the fairground tom hartmore was nowhere to be seen if they were lucky he was on his way back to the city to report to the boss and they still had time if they were really lucky he was getting laid by some buxom farm girl and theyd picked up a little more time if their luck truly sucked he was already backstage come on we need to talk to the noman brothers and we cant do that out here so you want them after the way shed bitched and complained during the drive out from the city she supposed he had grounds but she still gave his smug smarmy tone the response it deserved bite me yeah i told you that youd be when his voice trailed off she turned saw where he was looking and smiled big guy heavily built mud on his boots and his jeans straw cowboy hat checked shirt and eyes that tilted catlike up at the outer edges narrowed in a comehither glareas much challenge as invitationdirected right at glen who made a noise low in his throat kind of cross between a growl and a moan she couldnt say she blamed him go ahead take the edge off her hand resting in the warm curve of the small of his back she pushed him forward save a horse ali dont worry i can convince a couple of rockandroll cowboys to come into the office and talk without you by my side not what i was worried about oh please her lip curled if toms back there i can handle him and if not well i like to think i can handle myself in a honkytonk orgy you go handle tall dark and country over there play safe she added as glen started across the trampled grass ill meet you back at the car in half an hour fortyfive minutes dont tell me youre going to talk to him too he turned just far enough to flip her off she laughed and headed backstage competent musicians were a dime a dozen to make it big a band needed to connect with its audience on a visceral level and noman could certainly do that the brothers were exactly what shed been looking for glen was right she wanted them backstage was a white canvas tent about twentyfivefeet long and maybe ten wide it was a shelter for the sound board if the weather got bad a place for the performers to pull it together before the show and this far out in the country it could do double duty as a sheep pen for all ali knew it had the kind of sidewalls that could be tied up or staked down depending at the moment these were staked down no big surprise if what glen said about noman and how close they got to their fans was true she paused one hand on the tent flap the honkytonk orgy crack had been a joke but if even half the noman fans whod headed back here had been as turned on by the music as shed beenas she still waswell orgy might not be too strong a word for it not something she wanted to walk in on mostly because the way she was feeling she wasnt entirely certain she could walk out again still the band wasnt signed and if she didnt want michael richter to grab them first and grabbing them sounded like a damned good idea telling herself to focus she slipped in under the tent flap where things were almost anticlimactically low key like the redhead and her boyfriend the fans present seemed almost postcoital they milled about in the front half of the tent looking dazed and a little like they were starting to come down off a very pleasant high eyes were half closed smiles contented as hands lazily stroked bare arms and cupped the backs of necks and ran up under the edges of shirts and down under the edges of jeans but no one seemed to be taking things farther than they might late at a party with close friends at least not in the front of the tent in the back behind the sound board and a card table holding a box of noman cds a scrawled sign indicating they cost ten dollars and an open cashbox the drummer had his hand shoved in through the front of the bass players open jeans and was slowly jacking him off without breaking his rhythm he took a swallow from the bottle of beer in his other hand leaned forward and pressed his lips to the other mans mouth ali watched mesmerized as a line of liquid escaped the kiss running along the bass players jaw and down his throat she wanted to move forward and catch it on her tongue capturing the taste of the beer and sweat licking her way back up past his tats until the edge of the sound board caught her in the thigh and the pain brought her back to herself as she gasped the guitarist sprawled in an adirondack chair flashed her a satiated smile and waved a sloppy salute with his nearly empty bottle the noman brothers were nowhere around nor was tom hartmore if they were together pleasantly startled by the images that evoked she hastily dropped a ten in the cash box shoved a cd in her purse and slipped back through the crowd to the exit ignoring the moments of warmth as bodies brushed against hers definitely past time to leave once outside she took a deep breath the smell of grease and cotton candy wafting over from the midway combined with the odors of large farm animals and diesel fumes cleared her head and she felt like she was thinking clearly for the first time since travis noman had set bow to strings thinking back the concert seemed wrapped in sensation her memory of everything but the way it made her feel already fading it wasnt the strangest concert experience shed ever had but considering it had happened in a sunny field in the middle of the afternoon it was in the top ten it shouldnt have been so hard to find the car after all it was parked in a fielda big flat field full of lines of cars parked nose to nose that all seemed to look alike after wandering around for nearly fifteen minutes ali spotted what she thought was the rusty pickup glen had parked beside and headed toward it skirting rear bumpers she spotted the cowboy hats first realized who wore them as she moved closer finding a path between two ancient buicks realized they werent alone when shed gotten too close to turn back didnt actually think of turning back brandon and travis noman leaned back against the hood of the pickup side by side shoulders touching kneeling at their feet in the strip of grass between the trucks bumper and the bumper of the car parked facing it were the pair of blondes from the front row although the car blocked all but the top of their heads it was obvious what they were doing and from all the giggling they certainly seemed to be having a good time doing it travis was still wearing his sunglasses and his head was back exposing the long lean line of his throat brandons head was tipped forward and ali knew he was watching she shouldnt be watching she couldnt stop watching it wasnt like she could actually see anything travis moanedthe sound broken on the edge of shattering and his fingers long and tanned threaded through golden hair as his hips came up off the truck no not a moan or not only a moan brandon was humming one of the songs from the show while travis added a weirdly erotic bass line under it the girls heads moved to the beat hardly aware she was doing it ali slid her hand down into her jeans past the edge of her underwear still aroused from the concert she fell easily into the rhythm of brandons song fingertips moving in unison with the quartet filling her vision and then she had to bite her lip to keep from laughing because quartet made her think of chamber music and they werent in a chamber they were in a field and anyone could walk by just like she had and god the memory of the music left her feeling stoned and close really really close both men were breathing hard the rhythm of the song beginning to stutter the girls sped up and ali sped up with them linking her finish to theirs tension was building low and sweet when it happened it happened like flood waters finally breaching a levee brandon travis then both girls a heartbeat behind them ali trembled on the brink until brandon looked uphis pupils dilated his irises reduced to a pale narrow ring of blueand the open fuckedout expression on his face pushed her over the edge riding the wave ali sagged against sunwarmed metal and concentrated on keeping her knees from buckling the world went white around the edges and she closed her eyes just for a moment just long enough to draw in a long steadying breath she opened them again as she eased her hand from her jeans and she may have made a noise because travis raised his head and smiled at her over the honeyblond curls of the girl in his arms something in that smile said hetheyknew shed been there all along still smiling he slid his sunglasses forward a flash of gold and she was standing alone facing the rusty pickup parked next to glens car power chords blared from the midways speakers nearly drowning out the screams of children riding the ancient octopus and scrambler the world no longer wore the sheen given it by nomans musicthe sky was more gray than blue and the grass underfoot dry and yellow if not for the evidence of her own body shed have thought shed imagined the whole thing glen was right if bedford entertainment could sign these guys they were saved the cd wasnt bad but it was strangely flat not evoking much of a reaction she murmured as they sped back to the city glen laughed after that performance id be amazed if you had a reaction left in you he had a point and he hadnt seen the encore performance out in the parking lot noman had a barebones website that held a picture of the band a headshot of the brotherstravis had his sunglasses ona song list and an order form for the cd plus a link to their mailing list there was no concert schedule and the mailing list was the only way to contact them ali added the email address for bedford entertainment including in the body of the message their business number the url for the website their myspace address and an assurance that bedford entertainment was definitely interested in representing them professional bases covered she paused a moment remembering then typed we nearly met in the parking lot theyre twins she hit send before looking up to find glen raising a brow in her direction what youre flushed its warm in here it wasnt who are twins like she didnt know like shed been thinking about anyone else for the last twentyfour hours glen moved a stack of eightbyten glossies out of the way and perched on the edge of her desk travis and brandon noman twentyseven born in tarpon springs florida so theyre american theyre carrying american passports glen allowed their mother was a greek national named thea achelous travis is older by nine minutes when he paused ali frowned thats it thats it and getting that much was like pulling teeth theyre living almost entirely off the grid you said you heard about them from a friend and thats who told me what i just told you hes a fan in the whole fanatic sense of the word and if he cant pull information on them well its not there to be pulled ive left messages with the people who booked them for that fair but were talking volunteer labor and they havent called me back all right staring at the exceedingly unhelpful webpage ali tucked a lock of hair back behind her ear the good news is if we cant find them then mike cant find them and the intercom buzzed wondering what was upshe had nothing on the books until after lunchshe hit the connect what is it brenda theres a michael richter to see you speak of the devil glen muttered dont even joke about that ali told him more than half seriously she didnt get the chance to ask what mike wanted before brenda added he wants to speak with you but he has no appointment her tone while polite suggested shed never heard of anyone named michael richter and couldnt imagine why hed be dropping by mike had heard some of brendas voice work and wanted vital to represent her until he discovered she weighed just over three hundred pounds too much work to make presentable had been his final judgment the position of office manager at bedford entertainment had been a parttime gig to fill in the corners around bookings but gradually the two jobs had evened out and currently office manager was slightly ahead unfortunately it was also about to be made redundant unless they could find an act that actually paid the bills you have an hour open wednesday at nine she announced shall i schedule mr richter for then glen mouthed an exaggerated burn as ali rolled her eyes ill shuffle some things around and see him now brenda we dont want him to have to come back alysha arms spread michael richter walked into her office like he owned it given that he probably could have bought the building for the cost of his wardrobe and accessories he had grounds and the shaved head only added to the whole daddy warbuckslex luthor vibe he was entirely unruffled by brendas little oneact play but that was hardly surprisinghe had tom hartmore to be ruffled for him ali came around her desk and moved into his embrace skin crawling appearances were everything to mike and she knew she couldnt win if she declared war enveloped in a cloud of expensive cologne she touched each cheek gently with her lips felt his touch in return and backed away gesturing toward the more comfortable of the two chairs facing her desk to what do i owe this unexpected pleasure she purred as he sat tom here a slight nod indicated the man whod followed him into the room and now stood glaring behind him says we want the same thing peace on earth a little less david hasselhoff a really kickass pair of black ankle boots noman ah neutral expression locked on her face ali changed her mind about walking back around the desk and perched on the front edge instead she crossed her bare legs dangled one highheeled sandal and smiled down at the man who was trying to put her out of business it appears we both have excellent taste but then her smile flicked up to tom and grew edged i knew that im not here to drag up old conflicts alysha mikes voice had always made her think of that velvet glove over the iron fist im here to offer you a proposition to his credit he smiled when she raised both brows you flatter me my dear he was eleven years older than she was not nearly enough difference to be so damned patronizing i want you to leave noman alone he continued in return i will open up a weekend at the hazard you know what that kind of exposure would do for one of youracts the hazard was currently the place to be seen the place to build the kind of buzz that led to major recording deals and vital had bookings locked down into the next decade mike was right she had people signed who could turn a gig at the hazard to a solid career their success becoming the little engine that dragged bedford entertainment out of the red ali a firm believer in the bird in the hand over two in the bushno matter how extreme her reaction to the two birds in questionwould have taken him up on the offer except for two things the first was the disdain in the moment of silence before he said the word acts the second thats very generous of you mike but i have no desire to become a subsidiary to vital living off scraps from your table no matter how bad it got she wouldnt sell her people out to a man who saw them as inferior product he spread his hands the movement graceful and predetermined as though her response hadnt been entirely unexpected i respect your choice of course but perhaps you should take a moment to think about it my scraps to beat the metaphor vigorously about the head and shoulders have more substance than any meal you can provide and i know you hate to see your people starve no ones starving yet and there in the single word tom dropped into her office was the stick to mikes carrot ali waved glen back and realized almost as an afterthought that she was standing tom looked down at her through narrowed eyes daring her to react further to move in closer not going to happen except one of them had definitely moved but ali was sure it hadnt been her they were less than an arms length away now she stared at the scar bisecting toms upper lip and remembered the night hed got it the lip in question curled as if he could read her thoughts play nice children the amusement in mikes voice moved her back until the edge of her desk digging into her thighs stopped her no way was she providing entertainment by fighting with her ex in front of his bossloverwho the hell knew im sorry you werent able to accept my offer alysha mike stood as he spoke and gifted her with a benevolent smile it would have made everything so much easier for you for all concerned he admonished gently i can see myself out he was at the door before he realized he was alone he turned in the doorway and the velvet glove slipped tom your masters voice ali murmured as tom closed the distance between them she raised her right hand and laid her palm over his heart flat against his chest she could feel the heat of his skin through the black silk shirt it matched the heat of his breath against her cheek the heat in his voice youre going to lose this one ali he growled and ill be there to see you go down youre going to pay for making mike wait she purred back her breath moving the dark hair curling over his ear and i wish i could be there to see you go down he jerked away from her like hed been hit spun on one heel and followed mike out the door slamming it closed behind him ali glens voice dragged her back to the here and now and she realized her hand was still pressed up against the space toms chest had filled slowly she closed her fingers and let it fall to her side that was interesting ill say his tone was so totally neutral she knew he wasnt only referring to mikes offer let it go glen his green eyes were worried as he watched her walk around her desk and drop into the chair maybe you should take your own advice its been three years i know you and tom bring out the worst in each other she thought about the scar i know glen stared at her for a moment longer then spread his hands in surrender fine why do you think mike was trying to keep us away from noman its not like him to care if were after the same band no it isnt usually he enjoyed the competition secure in the knowledge that nine out of ten times hed win something about noman had made him try and tie up that tenth time try to buy her first because that came with added benefits and then threaten when she refused to be bought it was a good thing he didnt know just how bad their situation was or hed have merely waited for time to take care of it and not bothered tipping his hand he cant just be working off toms report and the cd he has to know something about the noman brothers we dont we know almost nothing so that wouldnt be hard and ive tapped out my sources then go at it obliquely you were right when you said it wouldnt matter who was backing them and since they cant be making much money im betting theres been a bit of a revolving door lets start by finding an ex member of the band over the next ten days a hundred small things went wrong not one of them could be definitively laid at mikes door not one of them big enough to confront him about not one of them that would allow her to take any kind of legal recourse its like being nibbled to death by ducks while youre drowning ali muttered hanging up as glen came into the office an argument over a clause in a contract here a sudden renovation of a venue there she slumped down in her chair do you know what i think i think mike has no more idea of how to contact the noman brothers than we do and hes trying to distract us i think thats why he tried to warn us offtheres a chance well luck out and find them first glancing up at her partner she realized he was smiling why are you looking so happy i found a bass player when did you lose one i found a bass player who used to play for noman oh man there was all the pussy you could ever want steve the bass player took a moment to grin at the memory wed stop playing and the girls would meet us backstage ready and willing boys too if that floats your boat me not so much but brandon and travis man the two of them together they could get anyone to do anything you know actually ali had a fairly good idea she leaned forward careful to keep her elbows out of the spilled beer was it always the two of them together always when the two of them wanted something they got it they couldnt have always wanted the same thing glen protested steve shrugged all i know is what i saw dude was it always sex ali wondered hell no steve grinned again broadly enough this time for a gold tooth to flash in the dim light of the bar sometimes it was pie but usually it was sex suppose they asked for money long as they didnt ask me man shit i could never keep two bills together i didnt mean they asked you ali sighed suppose they asked the people who come to their concerts for money steves smile disappeared what part of if the two of them wanted something they got it are you not understanding but i never saw them ask for money they didnt really give a shit about that kind of thing they just wanted to sing and drink and have a good time which made them pretty much the same as every other band that played the bottom of the market except were you their first bass player hell no there were he stared off into the distance lips moving as he counted back seven maybe eight before me and a couple of them they lasted twice as long me two years was all i could handle just too much of a good thing a raised hand cut off whatever glen was about to say ali had a feeling she knew what that was and didnt want to argue about it with an audience why did you leave leave the band steve took a long swallow of beer and frowned down at the amber liquid still in his glass well there wasand it kindayou know not really ali told him while glen rolled his eyes when steve looked up his expression was unreadable sure you do ali remembered the flash of gold as travis lowered his glasses maybe she did steve did you ever see anything weird about traviss eyes nothing wrong with singing and drinking and having a good time but fuck after a while its exhausting he took another long drink i do studio work now got an old lady got a life eyes ali prodded he grinned i got two shaking his head glen leaned into his space do you know how we can contact brandon or travis noman always brandon and travis dude steve told him never or and i dont have a clue that was ninety minutes well never get back glen snorted dropping into the car and reaching for his seatbelt total waste of time no it wasnt we learned a couple of things we learned based on the number of bass players that the noman brothers have been performing for at least twentyfour yearsseven before steve steve and two after him averaging two years a piece with at least two of them hanging in for fourwhich would have made them three when they started and somehow i doubt that im guessing thats what cued mike in that there was something up something about them he could exploit he noticed they were lying about their age he noticed theyve been around a lot longer than the evidence suggests ali if you looked at the evidence the rolling stones should be dead and theyre still performing yes but mick jagger doesnt look twentyseven the noman brothers have a power in their voices she could feel her heart speed up just remembering the way theyd held that crowd with their music the way it lingered even after they stopped playing and mike wants to use it the moment he gets them under contract theyll be singing for more than pie ali you heard what steve said hes got four functioning brain cellsone for each string and nothing extra brandon and travis are goodlooking guys with talent and stage presence they know how to play the crowd of course they can get laid mike mike wants them because he knows he can make money off them its why we want them its as simple as that travis raised his head and smiled at her over the honeyblond curls of the girl in his arms something in that smile said hetheyknew shed been there all along still smiling he slid his sunglasses forward a flash of gold no its not she closed a hand over his forearm willing him to believe her you didnt see what i saw glen was out of the office handholding a client through a recording session when the email came noman was playing at the atlas on friday night ali was pretty sure shed have told glen about it had he been around he had been the one to bring the band to her attention after all even if he continued to insist they were nothing more than they seemed the denim skirt was so short it barely required all five letters and the heels on her boots made her legs look at least three inches longer a white shirt so shed stand out in the dim light of the bar noticeable ali decided checking the mirror as she picked up her black leather messenger bag but practically business casual given the excesses of the music industry the atlas was attached to a downtown hotel that had seen much better days there was a pool table off in one corner a heavy dark wooden bar across one narrow end and a decentsized stage across the other ali arrived at eight for a ninethirty start but the redhead and her boyfriend were already at a table pulling a tshirt from her bag ali arranged her face in her best i can do things for you smile and moved in to make her pitch by ninetwenty she had all six tshirts in place tight and low cut black on white and stretched over the redhead the two blondes from the parking lot and three brunettes with a similar advertising understructure the name bedford entertainment would be impossible for the brothers to miss at fifty dollars a shirt it would be three hundred dollars well spent by ninethirty the press of bodies had raised the temperature in the bar just a little higher than comfortable as far as ali knew anticipation had no actual scent but there was definitely something in the air besides sweat and scotch something that kept her shifting on her high stool at the bar every movement bringing her into contact with the men and women packed around her every contact making her nerves sing that much more shadows moved across the stage then one long note dropped the room into silence as the stage lights came up noman started to play the hats and boots hadnt changed but above torn and battered jeans brandon wore a gray tshirt with the sleeves ripped off that was so tight it looked painted onto his torso bare muscular arms already glistened with sweat traviss jeans were in better shape but his untucked whiteandpinkstriped shirt was half unbuttoned and gold hair glinted between the wings of the shirt every time he pulled back the bow ali wasnt surprised to see he still wore his sunglasses the first two songs were the same as the last time but just like the last time by the third song alid lost any hope of keeping coherent notes all she could do was ride the sensation intensified by the close quarters off her stool now she moved with the music with the crowd touching rubbing as the notes from traviss fiddle burned through her blood and brandons voice licked at her skin hands gripped her hips and dragged her back against a hard body hot breath lapped at her ear and a familiar voice just barely audible over the music growled you drive me crazy ali i look at you like this and i cant keep my hands off you she bit back the moan that possibility evoked and struggled to turn but tom held her in place his erection a line of hard heat against her thigh i could have you right now he said slipping one arm around her waist and pulling her closer still as fingers stroked up her bare leg under the edge of her skirt blunt nails digging lightly at her skin i could lift your skirt drag your panties aside slip into you two fingers pushed under the elastic i could fuck you in time to the music the fingers slid down the wet line of her sex teasing up on her toes alis head fell back against toms shoulder i bet theyd noticeno one else would but brandon and travis theyd watch from the stage then the fingers were gone and his grip was gone and there was only his voice at her ear i want to but i wont because ive moved on she managed to turn in time to see him push the fall of thick dark hair back off his face and eyes tracking the motion she noticed there was something in his ear by the time she got all the way around he was moving away slipping easily through the crowd the only person in the room who hadnt given control of his body over to the music wax plugs in his ears to keep himself from being swept away as heated bodies brushed rhythmically against her and the hands on her skin and the breath raising goosebumps on her neck belonged to strangers ali looked to the stage where brandon held the microphone like a lover and sang of learning to touch and travis danced the bow across the strings of his violin spilling out notes in point and counterpoint and she knew after when the music ended she slid back up onto the stool ordered a scotch and waited the crowd had thinned and those who remained were moving around the room like cats after a killslow deliberate sensual the box of cds on the end of the bar had emptied as people paid for the chance to take the sensation evoked by the music home brandon stood just off the stage brushing damp tendrils of the redheads hair back off her face while travis stood beside him one hand gently kneading her boyfriends broad shoulder all four of them glanced down at her chest and she half turned pointing toward the bar as brandons eyes met hers ali raised her glass and smiled travis laughed the sound falling into the room like pebbles into a pond the ripple of reaction spreading someone dropped a glass someone else moaned brandon leaned toward his brother asked a question and when travis nodded led the way up onto the stage and toward the door at the back they paused at the door standing close enough as they turned that ali knew they had to be touching shoulder to hip still smiling travis beckoned given the sunglasses it should have been impossible to tell who he was beckoning to it wasnt his teeth were very white backstage was nothing more than a long narrow room between the rear wall of the stage and the brick outside wall of the atlas the air was cooler and smelled more like dust than like sex and alcohol following the two men past stacked chairs and empty boxes to where a small lounge had been set up in the far corner ali wondered a little at her willingness to throw caution to the winds if the brothers could make anyone do anything the possibility smoldered in the cradle of her hips the heat shifting and flaring as she walked so alysha bedford of bedford entertainment travis dropped onto one corner of the disreputablelooking couch brandon perching on the arm beside him youve got our attention his right hand rose to rest on his brothers thigh long fingers absently stroking the faded denim what is it you want ali drew her tongue over dry lips she wanted them to touch her to drag rough fingers over her skin to open her to fill her to feast off her that was what she wanted but it wasnt why she was there she was there because they had something she needed and she had to convince them that they in turn needed her i know what you are she said travis laughed but brandon tossed his hat down on the other end of the couch and drew both hands back through damp hair pale eyes never leaving her face i think she does do you travis stretched out one long leg the room narrow enough his boot ended up thrust between alis ankles she looked down saw the black leather and barely stopped her hips from rocking forward all right then he murmured what are we sirens in the silence that followed her heartbeat sounded unnaturally loud well ill be damned brandon growled at last probably his brother agreed he beckoned and ali found herself moving forward straddling first the outstretched leg then both legs then his lap it wasnt so much a compulsion as a mutual acknowledgement of the need to get closer that she knew had to be showing on her face she was still standing but only because the couch was so low a little voicea voice that sounded remarkably like glenreminded her this wasnt the business meeting shed planned but she was too turned on to care besides shed always prided herself on being adaptable and nothing in the rules said business couldnt be discussed over friction so travis reached out and lightly stroked the inside of her leg with his thumb youre half right his touch was distracting but then she could see from his smile that his touch was supposed to be distracting momma was a siren brandon continued shifting enough to watch his brother trace patterns up and down her leg and we split the power between us split and then brandons hand curved around the inside of her other leg and her knees buckled from the rush of sensation traviss grip shifted up her leg sliding up under the edge of her skirt to hold her hips as she folded forward knees going to the couch her sex rubbing against the rough edge of denim over his erection takes both of us to make it work brandons voice was a low heated growl at her ear and she moaned as he dragged his tongue over her neck your nameit was the name ulysses gave the cyclops same story travis grinned different chapter since momma never said who our father was if it is no man then it must be by the will of the gods good girl brandon was behind her now straddling his brothers legs pressed up against her back arms around her hands working the buttons on her shirt this was where she could stop it should stop it should pull the business plan shed drawn up out of her bag and she knocked traviss hat off and bent to devour his mouth as he hiked her skirt higher with one hand and slid the other under the scrap of silk and lace he tasted like honey and sunshine and she could feel him still smiling against her lips when she pulled away fingers buried in his hair he murmured we never saw a lot of point in singing ships onto rocks then brandon took hold of her head and turned it this is a lot more fun he breathed against her lips just before he claimed them he was rougher than his brother his tongue demanding entry she opened for him and rocked down against traviss fingers as brandon fucked her mouth when he finally moved along her jaw and scraped his teeth against the sensitive skin where her neck met her shoulders she fought to bring at least one or two brain cells back on line reminding herself this wasnt all she wanted im not the only one who knows what you are her voice was husky needy desperate and she was actually more than a little impressed she managed to complete the sentence so was travis he wrapped fingers wet with her own arousal around her wrist and stopped her from opening his fly who else michael richter he owns vital music groupoh god brandon brandon snorted something unintelligible against the back of her neck and stopped rolling her nipples between his fingers go on alysha go on where right mike one of richters people was here tonight in the club wearing ear plugs ear plugs brandon straightened his hands going from her breasts to her shoulders lightly stroking the skin exposed when hed pushed back her shirt the motion somehow holding all three of them at that moment held suspended between them ali dredged up a bit more of the myth if you sing and no one reacts then you have to throw yourself into the sea metaphor traviss teeth flashed white if we sing and no one reacts then we surrender to an outside power mythically the sea as things stand right now not so much surrender we give over control ali frowned down at her reflection in traviss glasses the expression looking out of place sharing her face with swollen spitslicked lips and blown pupils thats what mike wants to control you to make you sing up what he desires isnt that what you want alysha bedford of bedford entertainment no not control manage its not the same thing a difference of degree brandon noted i dont want to control you i dont want to use you mike does some day now he knows about you i guarantee youll do a gig where he controls the audience and then hell control you good thing you showed up to protect us then traviss lip curled mockingly we dont mind being courted brandon noted fingers tightening on her shoulders breath stirring her hair but we dont like being threatened threatened someone else knows what we are someone else wants to control us you saw a man in ear plugs and yet we see only you traviss hand rose to his glasses your timing sucks alysha bedford should have waited until we finished to make your pitch that she wholeheartedly agreed with but it didnt change the fact she had to convince them they were in danger you cant travis slipped the glasses down and his eyes flared gold ali came back to herself in a parking lot two blocks from the atlas standing beside her car clothing more or less decently arranged over her bodythe buttons on her shirt were off by one but that was a minor point she remembered everything up to the moment travis lowered his glasses whatever mojo his eyes performed its effect seemed limited twice now hed used it as a way to essentially say were done here she had a feeling the noman brothers werent cuddlers teeth gritted she pulled out her keys and unlocked the car the bastards were mythical creatures and they didnt believe her she had half a mind to let mike have them a few years under his beck and call paranormal control issues added to his usual ironclad contract and theyd be sorry they hadnt listened fortunately the other half of her mind was well aware that the brothers werent the only ones whod suffer working together brandon and travis could get whatever they wanted working for mike they could get whatever mike wanted at the moment mike wanted to exercise his power in the music industry but he sure as hell wouldnt stop there shed have to save noman in spite of itself if she could save bedford entertainment at the same time so much the better mike wouldnt try his pluggedear ploy at a concert thered be too many variables to control it would have to be a private party the brothers might not care much about money according to steve but mike could offer enough to tempt the significantly more saintly tom had left the bar before the concert ended so hed already accomplished what hed had to do since he hadnt spoken to either brother hed probably left an envelope with the bartender to be handed over when they were paid mike wouldnt waste any time his offer of a private venue where they could connect with the industry brass would be in the envelope thered be nothing about vital music group and while hed definitely be present at the concert mike richter wouldnt be hosting the number on the offer would be large enough that the other three members of the band would insist on accepting and the noman brothers wouldnt see the harm theyd been doing this for so long theyd clearly gotten careless too careless to listen to warnings shed have to get invited to the party toms office was about the size of her office and glens office and brendas reception area combined a plush deepblue carpet acted as a stage for ebony furnitureprobably the color not the wood although given the depth of mikes pockets ali wouldnt swear to that head down dark hair falling forward over his eyes tom kept working as she crossed to the desk her sandals making no noise against the thick nap as far as she was concerned the whole i told my secretary to let you in but im far too busy to actually pay any attention to you was a childish power play but she wasnt going to call him on it she needed him to feel superior if this was going to work pushing a pile of paper out of her way she perched on the edge of the desk allowing her skirt to ride up just enough to be distracting so youve invited the noman brothers to play at a private party where youll introduce them to everyone theyll need to know to make it big he looked up then eyes narrowed and just to make sure theyll agree ali continued youve sweetened the pot with a big old wad of cash they told you she smiled youre obvious and youre not he returned her smile then leaning back in his chair silk shirt pulling tight across his chest you didnt sign them last night or you wouldnt be here now frowning he added why are you here ali i came to warn you out of the goodness of your heart dropping her gaze to the hem of her skirt ali rolled a bit of the fabric between thumb and forefinger believe it or not i dont want to see you get hurt not okay fine she looked up then matching the challenge in his eyes i dont want to see you get hurt by anyone but me he looked startled then he threw back his head and laughed white teeth long lean line of throat and his laugh still sent shivers down her spine ali stomped down hard on her reaction all right he said at last what did you want to warn me about i know what they are what the noman brothers are and you cant control them theyre out of your league you cant control them and theyre out of your league toms gesture covered the room the gold records on the wall and managed somehow to include all the resources the vital music group could access what makes you think mike cant bring a couple of good ol boys to their knees because these arent the kind of guys to take it up the ass for a fat paycheck and a chance to throw their weight around but she trapped the words behind a smile because they had nothing to do with the noman brothers and everything to do with tom walking away from bedford entertainment from her toms smile tightened and she knew he could read her thoughts on her face you want proof ali he asked pushing the chair back and standing you want proof weve won this round leaning forward he scrawled an address and a date on a piece of paper straightened and offered it with a mocking flourish why dont you come see for yourself she slid off the edge of the desk and just barely stopped herself from slapping the paper out of his hand this was exactly what shed expected him to do exactly what shed needed him to do if she was going to have any chance of stopping mike from using the sirens power to further his own agenda if to be completely honest she was going to have any chance of signing the band herself it was justno matter how much she knew it had to happen she hated being patronized hated it more when tom acted as the extension of mikes so very superior and entirely infuriating attitude mike will control the noman brothers ali and when he does youre going to want to be on his good side im giving you that chance fortunately hed know something was up if she made no protest her smile had edges so out of the goodness of your heart youre graciously allowing me to play the sycophant i am graciously not throwing you out of here on your ass he growled moving closer too close and suddenly it was that afternoon in her office all over again but this time there was no mike to call him to heel and no glen to tell her this was a bad idea ali knew it was a bad idea and from the way toms eyes narrowed he knew it too one of them had to acknowledge that and back away ali shut up as memory replayed the sirens song she decided shed had all she could take of wanting and not having wrapping her hands around his face she rose up on her toes and sucked the curve of scarred lip into her mouth biting it none too gently then lapping at with the tip of her tongue he closed his hands around her wrists and pushed her away but he didnt let her go his cheeks were flushed and he looked as though he was silently weighing alternatives ali looked up at him from under her lashes and smiled dare you she said just enough mockery in her voice to overrule any remaining remnants of his better nature he released her then but only to shift his grip to her waist as he lifted her back onto the desk she wrapped one leg around him and dragged him up against herhe wasnt starting something and then walking away not this time fingers buried in the thick silken mass of his hair she devoured his mouth using her teeth as much as her lips loving the low growls she evoked tom wasnt about risk he was about control always had been and ali loved making him lose it theyd been together for almost five years before mike had lured him away with the promise of power and no matter how bad things had gotten during those five years the sex had always been incredible he moved his mouth to her throat licking and sucking at the curve where her neck met her shoulder bringing the blood to the surface his hands moving from her waist to her breasts stroking her through the fabric of blouse and bra strong fingers finding her nipples as they hardened and closing around them ali fumbled with the buttons on his shirt needing to feel his skin under her hands youve been working out she gasped both hands brushing quick and rough over the hard hot planes of his chest and stomach as he licked along her collarbone and down over the swell of her breasts shed been trying for glib and had a feeling shed missed it entirely he laughedat her with her at this point she didnt really careand dropped his hands to her thighs running them up under her skirt i dont have time i dont need time not with the siren song still playing in her head he took her at her word reaching into the center drawer for a condom do i want to know why you keep condoms in your desk she asked leaning back on her elbows as he rolled it on eyes dark his lips curled same reason i always did same reason different partner her lips curled in answer to his be a nice change for you then back on top we dont have to do this ali she sat up grabbed the wings of his shirt yet we both know were going to she dragged his mouth back onto hers he tasted like expensive coffee the apple he always had for breakfast and memories the kiss got rougher sloppier wetter one hand splayed against the small of her back tom pulled her toward the edge of the desk the other hand slid up under her skirt trailing lines of want along her inner thighs ali couldnt keep from crying out as he entered her wasted a moment hoping his office was as soundproof as it looked or that his secretary was considerably more discreet then wrapped her legs around him and matched him stroke for stroke matching the rhythm of the music it felt like shed been on the edge since the first time shed heard noman play and it didnt take her long to fall after as she paused at the office door to slip the piece of paper with the date and address of the private concert into her purse she glanced back at tom dark curl of hair falling down into his face his cheeks flushed he looked like a debauched angel buttoning his shirt he frowned down at the glossy surface of his desk like he was trying to work out just what exactly had happened noman had happened that was one hell of a band and there was no way she was letting michael richter have them too how nice of you to join us alysha tom tells me you know what im hoping to accomplish here tonight mikes smile was all dangerous edges and as he moved closer ali felt her heart begin to race behind him toms smile suggested she was totally screwed and not in a fun way not this time the interlude in his office had been just thatwhen it came to choosing sides tom had made his decision three years ago and to give credit where credit was due regardless of any lingering heat between them he stuck to it when it mattered from the hall where mike had stopped her she could see the backs of maybe two dozen wellcoiffed heads heads belonging to the men and women who made the decisionswho recorded what who got the promotion money whod be the new flavor of the month although he continued thoughtfully im not sure just what exactly you hope to accomplish a gesture toward the inner room half of that lot thinks you and your little company that couldnt quite is on the way out make a fuss run about shouting something about sirens like a crazy woman and the other half will come to agree with them he had a point a little screaming might save the band but ruin her if youre planning on warning the brothers well they clearly havent listened to you up to this point or you wouldnt be here ali flashed him her brightest falsest smile im here to witness your victory just ask tom a muscle jumped in the toned line of his jaw toms judgment isnt exactly sound where youre concerned alysha but im willing to give you the benefit of the doubt thank you her response was exactly as sincere as the statement that prompted it given the stakes however you will remain here only under certain conditions before she had time to ask what those conditions were tom grabbed her arms dragged them behind her and mike snapped a pair of handcuffs over her wrists kinky she muttered trying to get free just a precaution mike purred the soft wax pressed into her ear didnt exactly take her by surprise very kinky with toms fingers digging into her jaw angling her head toward his employer mike paused before sealing the second ear when the noman brothers sing he told her quietly no one will hear them and theyll be mine ali pasted the false smile back on isnt this where youre supposed to laugh maniacally if you like one question before her gaze flickered to his fingers and then back to his face how did you convince that lot to stuff wax in their ears tell them a story about ulysses his answering smile was entirely sincere theyre industry executives they dont actually like music the second piece of wax left her feeling as though shed been cut off from the world ali fought the rising panic kept her head high and her expression disdainfula meltdown now would help no one not her not brandon and travis mike held her while tom slid his own plugs in then kissed her forehead gently patronizingly as he handed her back to her ex who seemed to be overcompensating for their tryst in his office his hands wrapped around her arms above the elbows his grip just on the edge of bruising tom held her about a foot out from his body she struggled just enough to know she couldnt get free and then together they watched mike make his way to the makeshift stage drummer bass player guitaristtheyd already taken their places back out of the light they seemed to know what everyone else knew they didnt matter when brandon and travis came on stage mike gestured and ali saw the members of the audience clap politelypart of mikes show prearranged walking away he plugged his own ears then turned just behind the last row of chairs to face the band although she could see both travis and brandon the stage was angled in such a way that unless they turned specifically to face the hall they wouldnt see her toms grip kept her from moving into their line of sight by the middle of the first song the brothers knew something was wrong ali could see it in the way they moved their easy confidence replaced by the wariness of wild creatures sensing a trap trouble was theyd sensed it a little late she fought the urge to yell still think you dont need me and concentrated instead on figuring out a way to get the wax out of her ears companies like vital music group had the luxury of longterm planning companies like bedford entertainment survived by improvising it wasnt a great metaphor but it was all she had first tom had to release her ali stepped back taking him by surprise reaching out with her cuffed hands she cupped him through the fine wool of his dress pants when he gave her a shake she curled her fingers and gently squeezed his grip tightened on her arms but she continued caressing him as he hardened let him think she wanted a replay of that morning in his office and hopefully let him remember what mikes reaction to a replay would be she was starting to think she needed another plan when he jerked back and all but threw her against the nearest wall face flushed he moved to block her view of the stage and silently snarled at her to stay put fine with her the paintings hung along the hall had been illuminated by small halogen lights glad shed worn the threeinch heels ali gritted her teeth and pressed the side of her head against the brass casing over the closest light she could feel blisters rising where casing touched her cheek and the back of her ear but she could also feel the wax softening so she thought about the smell of cotton candy and the wail of a fiddle on a warm summer afternoon about bodies moving together heated and wanting packed into the dark anonymity of a downtown club about brandons hands and traviss mouth about everything noman could do for her bottom line and she forced herself not to move away when tom turned to check on her ali managed a grimace he took for a smile or he assumed she was grimacing about the situation not the pain as long as he left her to it he could make any assumption he wanted finally she felt a tiny dribble of warn liquid roll out of her ear tears sliding down both cheeks she moved her scorched face away from the brass and tossed her head once twice the softened wax shifted slid dropped out brandons voice slid in to fill the space lifting the hair on the back of alis neck the howl of traviss fiddle coiling sleek and dangerous in her belly her body moved to the music as the familiar ache began to build they still couldnt see her but somehow they knew travis drew one final note from his bow and brandon stopped singing hands wrapped around the microphone he smiled and said that was our last song ladies and gentlemen she heard mike growl keep singing although with the wax in he couldnt have heard himself not right now brandon told him and ali wished mike could hear the threat in the singers voice it made every threat hed ever uttered seem like posturing tom grabbed her as she moved forward into the actual room brought his face down to hers and demanded to know what shed done no point in answering since he couldnt hear her so she showed him still handcuffed she darted her head forward caught his right ear between her teeth and holding on as he tried to shake her free plunged her tongue into his ear and worked the wax plug out hed always been impressed by what she could do with her tongue on the stage while the rest of the band watched in confusion travis played a new note and brandon sang the counterpoint the two sounds rose and wound about each other as the noman brothers directed their full attention on the action in the hall releasing her tom straightened listened for a moment and pulled the plug from his other ear heads began to turn as more and more of the industry executives realized something new seemed to be happening expressions ranged from confusion to anger as hands rose and manicured fingers dug at the wax no matter what story mike had spun to gain their initial cooperation this was about to get messy ali turned to show the brothers her wrists little help here guys the note changed tom what the hell are you doing mike might as well have remained silent for all the notice tom took as he pulled out the handcuff key ali grinned as the cuffs dropped to the floor steel ringing against the tile theyre controlling him mike take my advice and cut your losses unfortunately he couldnt hear her when tom wrapped one huge hand around his shoulder crushing the elegant line of his suit holding him effortlessly in place he was too astonished even to shout demanding tom listen to him he grabbed the younger mans wrist with both hands tom ignored both the words and the grip and removed both of mikes earplugs one after the other as the music changed again ali scooped the wax plug shed taken from tom off the floor scrubbed it against her dress and shoved it into her empty ear stepping back into sight of the stage she raised a hand in farewell nomans audience had begun to move to the music and while she had no idea just where theyd be moving to it really wasnt something she needed to see apparently michael richter is taking a wellearned vacation in an undisclosed location no one knows where tom hartmore is two recording companies have filed for bankruptcy one highplaced executive has given everything to charity two more have turned themselves in for tax fraud and there are at least three messy divorces happening in the industry between people wholl be dividing acts with their assets glen set the paper down on her desk and shook his head if brandon and travis are responsibleare you sure you can control them not control manage ali reminded him besides they owe me speaking of he put one finger under her chin and studied the burn across her cheek that looks like its healing well still hurts green eyes crinkled at the corners as he grinned you need something to take your mind off it just say the word and ill break out the champers tell me that nomans finally decided to sign with us ill tell you tomorrow tomorrow why tomorrow because once they sign theyre off limits and tonight ive been invited to a private concert ali leaned back tucked her hair behind her ears and smiled theyve promised me an audition ill never forget minotaur in stone marjorie m liu i dream of the minotaur when my eyes are closed i cannot see him whole just fragments the cold hard sinew of his large hand the corded muscle of a massive thigh i glimpse briefly the line of a collarbone the hollow of a straining throat higher the curve of a horn minotaur son of a wayward queen and a god and he wants me to save his life the first time i dream of the minotaur i am curled in a nook on the basement level of the library the third lowest floor part of the catacomb the labyrinth it is very quiet deathly so almost midnight security guards roam high above i do not fear their discovery at night they are too uneasy to trawl for bottomdwellers in the underground shadows of the librarys belly spooks ghosts axmurderers in the stacks i have heard those men tell ridiculous stories there is nothing to fear books are my friends have always been my friends and when i lived homeless on the street i learned to hide in the tall stacks live in the shadows of musty corners hidden by the illusion of intellectual preoccupation studious charm now barely in my twenties it is a small thing in the evenings after my tiny job at the library café to make myself soft and invisible to blend to become to live as an uninvited guest quiet as a bookand as a book a dull creature on the surface but full of the raging wild dark inside the words of my heart the café closes at eight the library doors at nine by ten all the stragglers have been rounded up thirty minutes later the lights switch off i know this routine though i have never seen it every night as soon as i leave the café munching on some snack i am allowed to take free from the pastry display i meander down the broad marble stairs flowing with the public one more stranger a slip of a girl moving neither fast nor slow sometimes with a book in my free hand going places people leave me we part ways as i descend deep into the catacombs sometimes a crowd then nothing at all it is i often think like walking through a door no one else can seea slipstream gate from one world to the nextinto a forest of stone and tile where branches are straight as shelves holding books and yellow brittle newspapers aisles riding like paths into shadows the illusion of endlessness the maze the winding circle occasionally i find another reader in the labyrinth but no one lingers there is a cold air a sense of oppression eyes in the dark it bothered me once long ago but i did not run i read out loud instead in a whisper to the darkness until the cold air turned warm and those eyes lost their power to scare so that now i pretend i have a friend one friend someone who welcomes me home i hide my sleeping bag and backpack in the gap behind a row of crusty encyclopedias the lights do not function in that particular aisle i move by instinct and memory as i find my belongings and jiggle them free there is a bathroom nearby ancient also unlit no door the toilet works as does the faucet i keep a batteryoperated lantern just inside on the floor i undress folding my clothes putting them aside i toss my underwear in the sink and then cold and naked and barefoot on the ancient tile i clean up wash my short hair under the faucet with cheap shampoo savoring the chemical scent of lavender and jasmine run wet hands over the rest of my body soaping up rinsing as best i can a puddle spreads around me when i am done i drape my wet body in a big floppy tshirt i wash and wring out my underwear hang the pair on the rim of a toilet stall then take down another that has been drying there all day and slip them on it is an easy routine on the night i dream of the minotaur i turn off the bathroom lantern and in pure darkness walk back to my sleeping bag air dries my body i lie down cradle my head on my arm and close my eyes i dream i dream of a place i have never been though in the way of dreams it is familiar there is sand underfoot and the air is warm and wet i look up searching for stars but all i find is stone stone all around i am in a box and there is only one way out so i take it i walk across the sand to a door made of bone smooth and pale and grinning with skulls a warning a promise an invitation one touch and my hand burns i flinch but do not turn away i enter an oubliette a place of forgetting of never turning back i know what that is i know what it is to be forgotten i stand just within the doorway of the void and for the first time in my dream feel fear a terrible urgent despair the kind that begs sounda wail or cry or quick breathbecause sound is life sound means presence and i could forget myself in this place i think i already have but just as i am about to retreat through the door of watching bones i glimpse something in the voida solid curving plane of gray the round edge of a shoulder perhaps holding very still hello my voice is soft there is no answer but in the silence i sense another kind of weight a longing familiar as the unseen eyes that watch me nightly from the shadows of the basement labyrinth i cannot turn from that presence as though a hand wraps around my body i am drawn across the sand i walk into darkness blind the shoulder i saw before disappears but i continue on helpless just a dream i tell myself only a dream except i can feel the grains of sand digging between my toes and the air in my lungs is heavy and hot i feel very much awake very much alive and suddenly i can see again not much just that same sliver of gray a shoulder attached to a long muscular arm higher still the faint outline of a broad chest a strong throat all at a height much grander than my own i am looking at a giant a giant made of stone i stand very still staring then slowly carefully reach out i cannot explain my action i must touch and be touched though it is only rock beneath my hands but i hesitate at the last moment i fear irrationally that i might be burnedand indeed i flinch as though harmed because what my fingers find is not cold or stone but flesh and warm i stagger falling a hand catches my waist then my arm in that grip profound strength terror flutters my heart freezing my voice i think dream but i cannot wake no matter how loud i scream inside my mind a rumble fills the darkness i reach out my palms press against yet more skin a body trembling with sound like a thundercloud sighing in the night i try to see but cannot try to free myself and am held closer let go i breathe struggling no time whispers a low voice rough and masculine listen to me listen but he says nothing else and i gaze up and up staring at shadows gathered around a curving line hard and tipped and ridged a horn i can see nothing else in the oubliette where i should find only darkness gasps of light are playing tricks something grazes my cheek fingers perhaps tell me says the voice quiet tell me what you hear you i whisper my voice shaking on the word only you i hear a sigh another rumble that pushes through my body settling around my heart a sad sound old and tired again my cheek is touched fingers slide into my hair warm and gentle for a moment my breathing steadies and i can think again a dream i tell myself then softly you are a dream a dream murmurs the creature a dream if i could so be your dream better my dream i say but you are no breathes that low voice i am the minotaur and this is no dream the hand holding my arm slips away the body beneath my palms follows i am left standing alone in the darkness i feel bereft lost without that touch which so frightened me i cannot explain it i do not want to soon rumbles the voice soon again wait i say but the world falls away the oubliette spinning fast into a jolt a gasp i wake up a week passes before the minotaur returns to me i think of him often dream or not i cannot help myself i feel his fingers on my cheek as i pour coffee i feel his body beneath my hands as i wrap scones in wax paper i hear his voice inside my body as i count change for an old man in a suit everywhere the minotaur and when i close my eyes for just one moment i return to the oubliette to the darkness filled with thunder and feel him with me like a shadow pressed against my back watching and waiting the longer i wait the more i want to be with him again the more i want to understand some dream i wonder if that is all it is if there is more and whether like ariadne with her ball of golden thread i will be able to find my way home again the next time the minotaur comes for me and i know he will i feel it fear itam even eager for itthough it sows discontent unease for the first time in a long while i think about my life not about the things i do not have but the people who are gone parents friends i had them once i think but at some distant time so far past such people seem more dream than the minotaur all i have is myself all i need is myself until now i follow my routine before bed i must routine keeps me alive but after stretching out inside my sleeping bag i hesitate before closing my eyes i can feel the library breathing around me the labyrinth with its endless maze of books like a forest overhead wilderness bound with my back against the ground i search within my heart for the roots of the home i have made look deep inside for comfort i close my eyes and fall into sleep fall some more into the oubliette this time there is no door of bones just the darkness and shreds of light playing against muscles smooth and hard as stone a dream i tell myself but this time i know it is a lie though not how or why nor does it matter i am here standing in front of the minotaur and the air is hot and the sand is soft and i can feel sweat trickling between my breasts above my pounding heart you came back says the minotaur as quiet as i remember deep and rough and rumbling i didnt think i had a choice i remember his touch and stand very still shadows shift light plays over a sinewy shoulder the edge of a strong jaw the minotaur moves closer a gliding motion impossibly graceful there is always a choice if you had fought me in your heart i would not have been strong enough to bring you here here i echo where is here it is a place with no name closer still he moves i imagine a growing heat in the air between us no name ever only we are at the heart of a maze a house of halls and riddles one way in no way out the minotaur does not stop moving i steady myself refusing to back away i glimpse only fragments of his body but that is enough he is very large i can see his horns what are you i whisper the minotaur stops but not entirely i stifle a gasp as he takes my hands his fingers huge and strong he gently slowly raises my arms i almost resist but i have been thinking of him all weekperhaps foreverand though i fear him i have in my life feared more than the minotaur and i can suffer the unknown for my curiosity i am a man he says softly though i have been made to live as a beast he places my hands upon his head i close my eyes as he forces me to touch him and i see with my palms a hard surface unnatural a helmet a mask even made of bone and steel and hide a terrible thing terrifying i feel straps run down the sides behind all around holding it in place i cannot imagine wearing such a device the minotaur releases me but i do not stop i do not want to my fingers explore and connect with flesh a jaw his lips a flush steals through me i pull away but again the minotaur catches my hands his mouth moves against my fingers as he speaks it feels like a kiss a moment he whispers as his breath flows over my skin just one moment please i give him his moment i cannot help myself i feel in my own heart a pang of longing a sympathetic echo and it cuts i live in my own oubliette my own labyrinth i am a forgotten woman invisible as the minotaur to eyes beyond this dream i cannot remember being anything else i cannot remember being held ever i rest my forehead against his broad chest pressing close to stand between his feet seeing him with my body feeling him lean and strong i listen to his breath catch and inhale a scent of sand and rock and something sharper still i did not bring you here for this whispers the minotaur i did not come here for this i reply i do not know why i am here a selfish reason the minotaurs fingers tighten briefly to save my life i dont save lives i barely have my own you live in darkness amongst the books you go there in the night to hide youve watched me you know i have you have felt me yes i breathe i have felt him for a long time my watcher my only friend in the catacomb darkness who has always felt more real than imagination should allow now here in the flesh perhaps the minotaur loosens his hold his hands sliding away even as my own fingers trail down his throat soothing a path along his shoulders his skin is warm his hands are warm as well he touches me again palms resting against my spine i am wearing very little as is he i open my eyes and tilt back my head trying to see the minotaur i cannot the fleeting light is gone his face is lost i am afraid that i am lost as well why me i ask him why the minotaur stands very still because you know this you know this pain you know what it is to have no one to beno one my heart hurts and so because of that you think i can help you i hope he says simply i hope you will understand i hope you will have compassion no this is not real it is real to me the minotaur pulls me tight against him and i think it is real to you more real than the life you have left behind it is true but i will not say that and this your life this is no life not here in this place you are confined a prisoner why for living for breathing for being much the same as you i think im not locked up are you not the minotaurs hands tighten against my back i think we are the same you and i i close my eyes i am alone thats all alone he echoes this place would be sufficient if i was not alone so you brought me here to stay with you no the minotaurs voice is rough no i would not ask that of anyone only there is a world beyond this darkness and i would see it find it live within it you might not like that world i tell him you might want to come back to this place after youve seen what you want like you says the minotaur softly it is impossible to know his meaning to dare divine those two words all i know is that i wish to echo them to say like you or to add another word i i like you i want to tell him i do not know why but i do and i am crazy for it all of this crazy but the minotaur is right he has chosen well i understand him or at least part of him the rest is mystery the rest is insanity i need to sit i slide out of the minotaurs arms to kneel unsteadily in the sand the odd shadows of light are still gone the darkness is profound i cannot see myself i am only voice thought sensation but i feel the minotaur crouch beside me and savor the contact of his knee against my thigh the heat of his sigh touch is a lifeline in this place a reminder how long have you been here i wonder if i could survive in the oubliette alone the minotaur rumbles years centuries even though time moves more slowly in this place i suppose millennia have passed in your world and how do you live there is water and food magic sustains the rest i look toward the sound of his voice magic it is what brought you here the minotaur touches my hand the first time was the hardest this time easier i feel numb you have magic you should be able to leave this place on your own without me there is nothing i can do for you so you are an expert on such things now his tone is light but i protest anyway embarrassed the minotaur touches my lips with his fingertips the contact startles me into silence i meant no harm he says and if you do not trust me if you still believe this is all a dream so be it i cannot force your heart to change the minotaur pulls way i reach out blind and catch his wrist i feel bold and foolish dream or not i whisper i dont want to be alone i hear his breath catch and i listen for more listen hard there is nothing else beyond the two of us a strong arm drapes over my shoulders i do not flinch the minotaur surrounds he lays me down against his broad smooth chest until we stretch close entwined i have never been held in such a way never been touched so gently it startles me you need to leave soon he rumbles i try again to see his face nothing i reach for where his jaw should be but i find the mask instead my fingers glide along a curving horn wicked and cruel why i ask then forget my question as his large hands trail up my sides beneath my shirt i am surprised at the pleasure i feel even more when my own palms glide down his throat to his chest there is cloth over his groin but nothing else so much skin he swallows hard you do not want to become trapped here no i do not but that does not stop me from inching up his body savoring his long lean muscles touching him with my hands gentle and curious curious about him about myself what are you doing whispers the minotaur hoarsely i dont know i admit i dont know about any of this except i am hereand i want to know you then know me he murmurs be the first to try i hesitate listening to the echo of his words his pain something comes over methe darkness a cocoonand within it i find myself a stranger as strange as this man who calls himself minotaur magic i think dreams and magic i touch him the pulse of his throat is quick his hands raw and hot when he turns us on our sides the sand is gritty and soft climbing into my clothes rubbing my skin i am blind in the oubliette but my fingers are not and i find again his jaw his lips and press close enough to taste his breath to taste him i kiss the corner of his mouth i capture his sigh with another kiss this time on his bottom lip the edge of the mask rubs against my cheek and brow bone and hide protrude over the minotaurs nose more wolf than bull i imagine i stroke the hollow of his throat with my finger who did this to you his chest rumbles i am the child of a queen but made out of wedlock and a bastard still to protect herself my mother made a bargain with her lover to hide me away so that her husband the king would never know of her betrayal it was done as she askedthe king was gone away to war though as such things happen upon his return he discovered the truth the king was a sorcerer and my mothers choice to deceive himpoorly conceived i try to make sense of such a story so you were alone then no one cared for you i had a tutor an old man who raised me a nursemaid too though she was taken from me when i had no more practical use for her a good woman i learned not to miss her and this i tug gently on a horn an act of power says the minotaur grimly and fear he rolls me on my back before i ask another question his mouth hovers over mine hands cradling my face he kisses me it is a deeper kiss than what i gave him and i am taken off guard by the slow heat of it the pleasure i am unfamiliar with intimacy but my body responds as though born to it i rise up against the minotaur clutching his back he tugs on my nightshirtwe part long enough for him to drag it over my headand then i have no time for fear or regret as he strokes my breasts fingers sliding over my nipples at first tentative then with more confidence i moan against his mouth hooking my leg around his waist rubbing against him i am wet between my thighs pleasure clenching in my gut like a delicious fist the minotaur overwhelms i could not fight him off even if i wanted and i do not i have been alone too long and thisno matter how strangeis an opportunity not to be lost i might hide from the world but i am a survivori take what i need what i want what i desire only i have never desired this not until now his loincloth strains hard between my thighs i writhe savoring the luscious friction of his erection stroking my own wet heat i reach down to touch him his skin is soft and hot throbbing and he breaks off his kiss to push hard and long in my hand i squeeze gentle a pulsing rhythm the minotaur groans and slams his fist in the sand he pulls out of my grasp you will finish me he says and then it is my turn to dig my hands into the sand as his fingers slide between my thighs entering me deep his mouth follows tongue running swift as he sucks and licks and a moan tears from my throat as i twist in his arms he captures me hooks my legs over his shoulders and then when i am almost on the brink his mouth and hands disappear and i feel the heat of his body poise above me he does not need to ask i spread my legs wider the minotaur pushes inside and though his size might have predicted discomfort all i feel is delicious warmth so unexpected so overwhelming i am momentarily paralyzed with pleasure stiff with it even as he is stiff the both of us shaking he is hard and hot i feel mounted pinned like a puppet on the head of a spear except this is flesh and blood and dream and there are no strings attached to my body no master controlling my actions one giant hand presses against my thighs tugging them apart the minotaur slides deeper but only just and then his hands move again but only to push my legs together tight squeezing him inside me holding him like a vise even as he begins to move to draw out just as slowly as he entered i shudder a moan escaping from between my clenched teeth the minotaurs own breathing is harsh though he is gentle as he thrusts his large hands holding me close in a careful embrace i wish i could see his eyes and press my lips against his throat feeling in my pounding heart a wild ache that reminds me of my first time in the library labyrinth held safe within the darkness of a new home i do not want that feeling to end more i whisper and the minotaur rumbles with pleasure he sits up holding my hips tight against him as he rises to his knees i tip backward head and arms resting against the sand bound by flesh still large and hot the minotaur is strong he holds me flush against him and thrusts hard driving into me with a strength that is both pain and pleasure he is in complete control as he moves my body rutting with a ferocity that makes me cry out the tips of my toes digging into the sand i try to move with him but give up letting him set the pace as he holds and pulls me with raw hungry strength it is a punishing rhythm but so is my desire and the gathering pleasure inside my body is so devastating i lose myself when it breaks arching violently breath rattling in a silent scream as i come in his armsas he comes in minesinking us down at the last moment to move against each other in the sand we keep thrusting savoring the aftershocks fighting for breathso tangled that as the minotaur turns us i remain pressed against his body one leg hooked over his waist fingers digging into his hard shoulder i do not want to let go neither does the minotaur if his hands are any indication he cradles my body holding me as i have never been held as though i am wanted needed desired his breath ruffles my hair his lips trace a path down my flushed cheek i did not dream whispers the minotaur i did not dare you brought me here i am still breathless muscles limp and warm you must have thought something would happen the minotaur touches my face not this truly i close my eyes not an optimist then a short gasp of laughter escapes him no more than you i think he runs his fingers through my hair and i sigh at the simple pleasure of it the warmth and strength of his fingers there were others long ago he says quietly women who came to me as a novelty a freak to be bedded but never for more not like this you think this is more i press gently the minotaur shifts in my arms and places his hand over my heart after a long moment i do the same to him i cannot help myself yes he breathes i know it i try hard to think of a response but before i can the minotaur stiffens and pulls away what i begin to ask but his large hand claps over my mouth and my heart begins to pound all over again the minotaur is so very quiet i would not know he was there if he did not touch me i try to do the same hardly breathing and after a moment i hear a distant sound it is a cracking note like a whipor a sail kicked by a sharp breeze then suddenly a woman screams a bloodcurdling howl that twists like a sour wind so bitter the sound becomes a taste inside my mouth like ice dragged over by filth or candy doused in gasoline the minotaur stands dragging me with him i do not resist i stare blindly into the darkness my fingers tight around the minotaurs hand you must go he whispers i shake my head i thought you were alone who was that woman not a woman a harpy more than one and they have caught your scent the minotaur embraces me an act that feel so desperate so lost fear cuts my heart stealing my breath i should not have brought you here rasps the minotaur forget me when you leave this place please no i protest no i wont but i hear that odd crack split the airagain and againand in my head i imagine wings snapping like bones breaking and the taste of those rising howls makes me bend gagging the minotaur touches my hair my cheek and then slips away leaving me alone and blind i wipe my mouth with the back of my hand i hear the harpies coming but do not run i do not know how in this place what about you i call into the darkness the minotaurs voice drifts like a ghost they will not hurt me he is lying i know it and i see suddenly sparks of red in the darkness glowing like the embers of hot coals a deep fire slow burning it takes only a moment to realize i am looking at eyes the harpies scream i flinch stumbling backward and for one brief instant glimpse against that hateful light the outline of a man a man wearing the horns of a bull and then the harpies are there with us the air stirring foul with the beat of their wings and the minotaur steps in front of the creatures with his arms outstretched shielding me with his body i watch horrified snatching glimpses of bulbous breasts stringy hair talons sharp as knives the minotaur bellows a word i do not understand then staggers grunting i hear flesh rip and something hot and wet spatters my face i screamand the world disappears i bolt upright in my sleeping bag skin slick with sweat the sudden silence bears down upon me like anchors stuffed in my ears and all i can do for one long moment is sit staring listening to my heart rage and rage i lick my lips and taste something metallic touch my face my fingers come away dark with blood my body is sore my nightshirt is gone i throw back the sleeping bag and grab clothes i dress quickly heart pounding staring into the darkness of the stacks the labyrinth not a dream i tell myself fighting to hold on to that belief it would be easy to forget despite the blood and the aching it would be easy to do as the minotaur asked and pretend my time with him was nothing but fantasy everything about this fast as a dream from beginning to end but i refuse there is no explanation for what has happened what i have allowed myself to become in so short a timebut i am changed now i cannot turn back only finding the minotaur again will be difficult returning impossible if he does not want me if he is hurt i stop myself from thinking stay simple crouch in my bedding and close my eyes willing sleep if that is what it takes nothing happens worse i cannot feel the minotaur in the shadows my watcher who has been with me from the beginning of my time in this place is gone i roll to my feet and stare into the unlit stacks the endless aisles the labyrinth i listen with my heart but still cannot find that quiet presence cannot find inside my head as i close my eyes that warm shadow pressed against my back it makes me hurt it makes me remember loss something i have not felt in years abandoned once abandoned again though the reasons this time are different i walk into the darkness leaving behind my belongings the evidence of my existence in doing so i abandon routine i do not care i enter the labyrinth blind hands stretched to trail across the spines of books taking turns as they come winding deeper and deeper into my own oubliette the catacomb maze is endless but so is my desire and all i can think of is the minotaur somewhere distant sound comes to my ears i stop cold listening and from very far away catch the faint glimmer of a flashlight men speaking entering my home heard a scream says a low voice like someone dying easy enough down here replies another goddamn its creepy i close my eyes listening i know they will find my belongings once they do my life is over my luck the one time i am not careful nothing to lose your life was already over over the moment you began believing in the minotaur i search my heart for regret but find none not yet anyway i turn and walk away slipping deeper into the stacks the labyrinth the voices of the men fade quickly as does the light they shine i try not to think of them i walk for a long time each step a breath of memorymy childhood my abandonment my desperationhow afterward the isolation and solitude of the library was a balm sweetness all of that my life leading to this moment searching for a fantasy that should not exist that perhaps does not exist not anywhere but my heart after a time i stop if the security guards are searching for me i have not heard or seen them and i must rest close my eyes for just a moment i sit on the tile floor my back against the books and think of the minotaur remember him holding me kissing me moving inside my body warmth spreads through my muscles making my eyelids heavy i curl into a ball think of that low rumbling voice and close my eyes perhaps i fall asleep either way when i open my eyes there is sand beneath me darkness all around i sit up i am not afraid not for myself hello i whisper hello rumbles a familiar voice soft and low and startling close hello again i close my eyes fighting down a smile youre alive yes i do not hear the minotaur move but his large warm palm suddenly presses against my cheek i heard you calling for me i felt you i could not say no the harpies gone for now i touch his hand holding it to my face im covered in blood your blood a small injury he says and a moment later i find myself scooped off the ground cradled in strong arms that hold me close against a broad hard chest the minotaur carries me his presence feels like an old friend my friend if i allow myself to imagine him as such and i do i kiss his collarbone i kiss the smooth skin just below his shoulder i run my tongue over the hard nipple near my cheek the minotaur stops walking and hoists me higher in his arms bends his head and captures my mouth in a long hot kiss that makes me sigh he sinks to his knees and sets me on the ground still kissing me his hands fumbling over my clothes i brush him aside and curl close reaching beneath his loincloth to touch him the minotaur shudders i slide even closer i take him in my mouth he is so thick i wonder how he ever fit inside my body but i love the hot feel of him beneath my tonguelove even more giving him pleasurebecause it makes me feel like part of him and that is something i never imagined not with anyone he touches my shoulders he is shaking but he does not tell me to stop and i take the invitation going further deeper using my hands and mouth feeling him ignite as i push closer to some indefinable edge his hips thrust again and again and a low shuddering moan escapes his throat building as i suck hard the minotaur pulls away from my mouth as he comes though i still hold him with my hands savoring his violent release as though it is my own his breathing is ragged harsh and when he grabs me up in his arms i feel a new weakness in his body tremors in his muscles in the breathlessness of his kiss that makes me desire him even more why he murmurs why do you want me why did you want to come back i dont want to be without you the words slip free so easily it frightens me the minotaurs breath catches he cradles my face between his hands i cannot see his eyes but i am sure he can see mine why of all men why me i wish i could see his eyes i wish it so badly why me the minotaur exhales slowly his arms slide around my body he holds me close and whispers in my ear because i wanted you because i wanted your help but i also wanted justyou to touch you once i have watched you for so long i cannot speak he stands and lifts me into his arms there is something i must show you he carries me through the darkness i listen to his heartbeat and the shuffle of sand the air becomes warmer humid nothing of the harpies the minotaur walks for a long time the oubliette is larger than i expected or else we have left that place and his entire home is made of darkness he finally stops though and lowers me to my feet i stay within the circle of his arms and he says in front of you i kneel i reach out and touch water hot water i lean closer and steam bathes my face a natural spring says the minotaur take off your clothes i will wash away the blood and you it was your blood after all youre hurt then we will wash together there is tension in his voice he shows no hesitation though when he helps undress me he holds my hands with care as i step blind into the hot water it feels good though i cannot help but think of the harpies i mention them again as the minotaur slides into the water beside me there are always risks he admits risks for the unwary it is the labyrinth after all ive always thought of the library as a labyrinth i tell him and the minotaur makes a rumbling sound splashing warm water over my arms and rubbing his wet thumbs across my cheeks all places of paths and knowledge are part of the great maze he says some more so than others your library is one of them the veil between worlds is weak there weak enough even for one as untalented as i to reach through why just reach why not step through entirely escape if that is what you really want the minotaurs hands still i am bound here no i think of all that has passed between us what little he has told me no not completely you brought me here to save you thats what you said the minotaur remains silent for along time not until i press my fingertips against his cheek does he make a sound his sigh is warm i should not have brought you to this place he murmurs not the first time not the second and not now selfishness begged it despair and loneliness but i know better and better means keeping you safe you must not free me i must i whisper you know i must again the minotaur says nothing he washes me and i do the same for him discovering in the process a terrible slash across his shoulder it is already healing he says quietly i cannot die here the king forbade it he controls this place the minotaurs laugh is bitter no one controls the labyrinth it is beyond spells and magic beyond anything that can be controlled by mere men or their counterparts but that does not mean that those who come here are so free the flesh is weak i kiss his shoulder not so weak against you powerless he murmurs i never imagined such a thing not in any dream why i kiss him again at the base of his throat my breasts rub against his chest and his hands snake down to cup me tight against him he is hard and i feel a moment of astonishment at how ready i am for him i hook my leg around his hip and he takes me in one long slow movement i groan because i am a monster whispers the minotaur hoarsely moving inside me with delicious strength i have always been so since the beginning no i murmur and cry out as he gently squeezes my breast there is a legend native to your age and time he says breathless as he thrusts hardonce twicethen slows his pace drawing me out the minotaur in the labyrinth a beast of sacrifice and blood child of a queen and a god i have trouble speaking thinking the minotaur leans against the edge of the hot spring i move against him riding his body and manage with some difficulty to say i know that myth the minotaur grabs my hips thrusting up dragging me down again and again he does this i lean into him wrapping my arms around his neck as we bury ourselves in each other with such force i feel stolen by pleasure near death with it as though my heart surely cannot beat one more moment at such a frantic rhythm i break first my body clutching around the minotaur in such brutal waves that all i can do is writhe breath rattling with pleasure i expect the minotaur to follow but before my body is done he turns me and thrusts again still hard hot only now i am bent at the waist with nothing to hold on to but his hands on my hips as he pounds into my body with quick sharp strokes faster and faster frantic i come again and again helpless to stop him unwilling to stop him even though the pleasure is too much his hands move he touches me stroking and i am rocked into one final climax that the minotaur finally joins his voice rumbling into a bellow we drift in the hot waterspent exhausteduntil finally the minotaur pulls me to shore and we lean against each other breathing hard in the silence of the labyrinth for the first time in my life i feel truly satisfiedcomfortable and safethough those feelings do not last long i turn my head brushing my lips against the minotaurs arm and say you were telling me something he kisses the top of my head i was and and you are not easily distracted he rumbles sighing so you know the myth you know what else is part of it death i say the deaths of young men and women that part at least is true the minotaur drags in a deep ragged breath the king thought to use me as a weapon against his enemies so he made me a monster fitted me with the helmet took away my name by magic so that i would know myself as nothing else and then enchanted me into the labyrinth he wanted fear and so he made it in me so you killed i say carefully because to utter those words feels almost as terrible as the crime the minotaur though makes a low soundfrustration maybeand i feel him shake his head i did not he says in a hard voice or rather i did not mean to the young men who found me attacked with all their fear and fury and i was forced to defend myself the girls i did not touch though i tried to help them they ran from me they ran into the darkness of the labyrinth and hurt themselves on the rocks or were killed by the creatures who inhabit the maze how long did that go on years until the king was murdered by his enemies his death sealed the gate into the labyrinth at least that particular gate with you in it forever though the king in a fit of humor before his death left me one chance of escape ah i say and is that where i come in if you wish he says slowly but it will be dangerous harpies worse the minotaur holds me close the kings own magic i close my eyes i try to make sense of what he has told me but it is no use his words live like a fairy tale inside my head indistinct but full of simple truthsa prince cursed trapped in the heart of a tangleand i the poor woman lured to his aid a golden goose will be next i think mice who talk or a woman with hair as long as a river is there light here i ask the minotaur real light any at all he hesitates there is it is part of something i would have shown you later i frown show me now the minotaur sighs and pulls himself from the water i follow stumbling in the dark the air is cool on my wet skin i shiver and suddenly find myself draped in heavy furs soft and warm i hug the hides close to my body and listen to the minotaur move through the darkness then light a blue light flickering and pure it has been such a long time that i find myself momentarily blind and i shield my eyes even as i try to see the minotaur he stands before me so very still and i cannot look away from the hard lines of his body covered in scars or higher yet his face what little i can see of it the mask is as horrific as my fingers told me it would be though it covers only the upper half of his head the bridge of his nose and scalp all bone and fur with giant horns stretching like arms in the air i can see the straps holding it in place cutting into his skin i also see his eyes i move close staring blue i think though it is impossible to say just that there is a soul in them a soul i have only heard and felt until now and i want more of it so much more i want to look into his eyes and hear him speak i want to know what he sees when he gazes at my face what he feels when he touches me when he is inside me the minotaur moves and that is enough to break the spell i look down at the source of light in his hands and find a round mirror complete with silver frame and handle light flees the glass flickering wildly and when the minotaur tilts it toward me i see another worldblue sky trees mountains bathed in snow and sun i found it years ago says the minotaur softly i used it to see the worlds beyond the labyrinth and there are many worlds upon worlds gathered like beating hearts warm and fine i stare at the mirror you left me in the dark on purpose the minotaur glances away i thought you would fear me otherwise you could have tried no i did not dare i fight for words you thought i would be disgusted didnt you he goes very still and are you you can ask me that after everything he opens his mouthstopsand his eyes turn somber forgive me i sway close but do not say what i feelyou do not need to fear me only trust me please before i lose my nerve in the lightand instead point at the mirror is that how you watched me yes the minotaur tears his gaze from my face and holds up the mirror an eagle soars i hear music from beyond the glass a flute lilting and delicate the image shifts suddenly there is darkness again cut with electric beams and men in uniforms standing over a sleeping bag i watch them nudge my belongings with the tips of their shoes and feel in my heart a pang i could send you home again says the minotaur quietly you are not of this placenot yetand as such you are permitted to leave the labyrinth does not hold every heart doesnt it i look him in the eyes how did you bring me here i willed it he holds my gaze with a heat that reminds me of his hands on my body to free you from the labyrinth you could have found another you and no other he says firmly there was never any choice not for me once i found you he has already said as much but those are not words i tire of hearing i touch his waist and slide close until i must crane my neck to look at him his jaw is strong his skin smooth and his eyes caught behind the mask of bone are most certainly blue i kiss the minotaur his arms wrap around my body pulling me off the ground and as my feet dangle and the furs drop away i realize something awful i cannot imagine being without him the minotaur is part of me now and i am part of him a scream cuts the air we both flinch dont send me away i say promise he gives me a hard look if you are truly set on helping me we must go now i say nothingjust nodand the minotaur presses his lips against my foreheadone quick hard kiss full of something more than mere desire he takes the mirror in one hand grabs me with the other and we run i have no clothes but forget to care as the air behind us cracks like a whip distant but close enough i remember how fast the harpies move what do i have to do my voice is breathless i almost trip and the minotaur hauls me close he says nothing and i ask again tugging on his arm his jaw tightens and for a moment i see him as others might the cruel mask the horns the giant body hard with muscle dangerous and powerful a beast i must have a champion he rumbles and his voice returns my heart and mind to its proper place i who have slain so many a champion i say but there is little time for more the harpies grow louder their shrieks violent and sickening i fight the urge to gag struggling to focus only on the minotaur and myself he slows and by the light of the mirror i see a familiar sight the door of bones through which i entered the labyrinth my first time summoned by the minotaur the skulls grin bones polished and white but as i near i see dark liquid trickle from the sockets of their eyes and i know in my gut it is blood the minotaurs own eyes are hard as flint as he looks at the bones his mouth tightens into a thin white line beyond that door is the site of the gate the old king used to usher in his sacrifices it is the gate through which i entered and it is the only gate through which i can leave i thought you said it was sealed sealed yes but the labyrinth is not bound by doors nor would i be bound if the curse upon me was lifted the harpies are nearing i glance over my shoulder into the darkness and the minotaur says also trapped put here by magic through the wiles of some ancient priest perhaps another legend in your time can they be killed the minotaur shakes his head harpies are immortal so much in the labyrinth is i reach for the door the minotaur stops my hand one last chance you could go if you want back to your home i have no home i tell him and haul open the door just in time screams split the darkness and i glimpse red eyes glowing like pincers left too long in flame i dart into the roomthe minotaur followsand together we close the door leaning hard against it bodies slam into the barrier my entire body shakes with the impact beneath my ear i hear faint laughter more than one voice the skulls on this side of the door are also leaking blood my skin is smeared with it so comes the minotaur at last they whisper like ghosts mouths unmoving i back away staring and again hear laughter faint voices drifting high and lilting oh they whisper and i feel the dead staring staring so hard oh a woman now heart so full not like the others minotaur not like them those screaming butterflies in the oubliette enough says the minotaur you know why we are here the kings gift they murmur ah girl you are dead as you stand there is no heart full enough for this man no woman brave enough to hold a minotaur i do not understand i glance at the minotaur and find him pale mouth drawn tight no i say knowing well enough that look on his face the defeat no whatever it is i have to do i am strong enough i step up to the door and look straight into the eyes of a skull tell me what i have to do to free him you must hold him they say no protests the minotaur there is more but i cannot ask because the minotaur suddenly screams back arching so deeply i hear his spine crack like the wings of a harpy he falls to his knees and the skulls whisper hold him hold him tight i scramble to the minotaur and crash into the sand flinging my arms around his heaving chest i press my cheek above his pounding heart and hold him with all my strength he groans my name but his voicefull of painshifts into a howl i cry out with him terrified and then cry out for another reason entirely as the warm skin beneath my hands suddenly becomes fur the minotaur writhes i glimpse his hands long fingers shedding skin and nail to become claws i almost forget myselfalmost let gobut a voice inside my head whispers hold on hold on and i do not loosen my arms the minotaur fights me he is large and strong but i squeeze shut my eyes and dig my nails into his back chanting his name holding on with all my will i am afraid of himafraid for my lifebut i think faith and do not waver the fur shifts gliding into scales a smaller chest i almost lose him but i regain my grip and hear a hiss feel a tongue rasp against my cheek the minotaur struggles flopping wildly dragging me down into the sand and rolling on top of me i cannot breathe but i wrap my legs around the minotaurhis entire body one long tailand hold my breath screaming inside my mind another shiftfeathersa body smaller stillbut i grapple and pull and holdand then againleather tougha beast as big as the roombut i take two handfuls of a mighty ear shouting as my arms pull and my joints tear battered and bruised i fight to keep him fight too for my life again and again he shiftsan endless struggle of creatures i cannot nameuntil suddenly it is simply the minotaur again the man i know he slumps within my arms i do not let go i am too afraid and my fear is good a moment later i feel another transformation steal over the minotaur this time stone stone that takes me with him i do not understand at first only my body feels heavy as though gravity is pulling down and down i hear a scraping sound like rocks rubbing and see from the corner of my eye the minotaurs skin go gray and hard i remember the first time seeing him some ghost light playing tricks the curve of his shoulder resembling stone this time it is no illusion save yourself whisper the skulls let go let go my mind echoes as i watch with horrified fascination as stone crawls up the minotaurs body over my own encasing both our legs in a dull hard shell i feel as though i am being dipped in concrete i feel as though i am dying i gaze into the minotaurs face looking for some sign of the man i am risking my life for his eyes are closed he is unconscious let go whisper the skulls let go and you will be free it is not too late i could pull away but i look again at the minotaur and remember his voice his touch the feeling of home in his arms and i cannot leave him he is all i have all i want and to lose him to lose that part of myself i have given him when for the first time in my life i belong the stone creeps i press as close as i can hooking my arms around the minotaurs neck i kiss him hard and after a moment i feel him stir and kiss me back i smile against his mouth taste tears mine the minotaur murmurs something i do not understand i do not let go i keep kissing him even when he begins struggling protesting trying to push me away from the contagious gathering of stone i hang tight ignoring him he has been betrayed by magicboth of us havebut i will be his champion to the end the stone rises the minotaur and i stop moving we are locked together and all i can do is tilt my head to kiss him i look into his eyesblue like skyblue with griefand try to smile not what you expected i say and the minotaur makes a choking sound that i cut off with a kiss one last kiss the stone covers my face i go blind the next time i learn how to see again i find myself cradled in strong arms i am being carried my feet dangle my head lolls and i feel sick to my stomach i struggle to be put down just in time i bend over gagging eyes streaming then i remember i fall to my knees a hand touches my shoulder i turn find the minotaur crouching beside me he is not wearing the mask it startles me for a moment i do not know him but then i look into his eyes and they are the same soul same heart i touch his mouth with trembling fingertips and he captures my wrist holding me gently his hands are the same as well strong and warm how i murmur i thought we were dead we were says the minotaur a hint of wonder in his voice you gave your life for mine i sag against him we are still naked i run my hands over his body searching for injury explore his face studying the unfamiliar lines the dark curl of his hair he is a handsome man but then i thought so before ever seeing his face before he was anything but a presence in the dark i trail my fingers down his neck following the red imprint of the former straps the minotaur watches my eyes there is such tenderness in his face i want to lower my head and weep i think i might do so anyway how i ask again i was a monster says the minotaur and the king did not think it possible that anyone would ever care for me not enough to do what you did the fact he even allowed one chance to lift the curse was meant more as punishment than hope to break me with the futility of my existence because whowho would ever love a minotaur i do i say quietly and he shuts his eyes shuddering you had faith he whispers you believed in me or else you would not have held me it was difficult i thought you would kill me in the process i almost did he opens his eyes i became the creatures i transformed into only your touch kept me centered only you if you had let go i stop him i do not want to think about what might have been i glance around noticing for the first time that we are in some kind of building the stones are dark and smooth with age and there are pillars rising to a vaulted ceiling that is elegant in its massive simplicity the silence is heavy we are alone but there is lightstreams of it cutting through holes in the upper segments of the high walls i look at the minotaur where is the labyrinth how did we escape the labyrinth is where it always is he says gravely it is everywhere and nowhere but we were able to leave because you freed me and as you know i havesome skills of my own i shiver the minotaur helps me stand come there are clothes nearby how do you know because this is home i raise my eyebrows home has been empty a long time there wont be anything left to find the minotaur smiles we shall see but before we begin walking i lean in for a kiss a soft kiss that becomes urgent fierce i remember fear desperation my decision to die and such memories will never leave me they are another darkness another labyrinth and i want the minotaur to steal me away to save me and he does his own calm face breaking into a mask of grief and desperation he pushes me up against a pillar his breathing unsteady tears shadowing his eyes he kisses me so deeply i feel him in my soul the minotaur takes me he is hard and i am ready and he slides so easily into my body i wonder how two people could fit so well and still be separate hearts i say as much later later when my legs are still wrapped around him and we lie on the cold stone floor the minotaur smiles i can still see the outline of the mask the mighty horns resting like a crown fit for a prince i think a prince of the labyrinth we are two pieces of a puzzle says the minotaur you and i so where do we go now what do we do the minotaur points i narrow my eyes a moment later i see the silver mirror resting close by on the stones set there earlier no doubt when i was ill anywhere he says simply we go anywhere i think of my library my home in the darkness my routine my old life safe and quiet i am not naïve anywhere will not be easy but i look at the minotaur curled around my body staring at me with his shining eyes and i know that he is not naïve either and i would rather face a life with him no matter the danger or difficulty than rest easy by myself i take his hand have we really left the labyrinth i think we are making our own says the minotaur it will be an adventure i hope so i reply and it is demon lover cheyenne mccray chapter he vanished in a whirl of mist leaving behind scents of sandalwood and sex on a hot summers night ericka roberts cried out and clenched her bedcovers in both fists as she woke perspiration coated her body and the sheets clung to her damp skin her breathing was harsh her heart beating so hard it pounded inside her ears these dreams are killing me for the past week since shed arrived at the oceanside condo in san diego shed woken sweating body aching with need and frustration in her dreams her demon lover teased her with his tongue and tasted her until she was on the edge of a climax so powerful she knew it would rock her to her core the moment she reached that pinnacle he would stop hed rise spread her legs with his hips a sensual expression on his strong features hed nudge his cock against her folds and shed hold her breath in anticipation and he would vanish goddamnit he just disappears the dreams were so intense that each morning she woke up pleasantly sore from his rough attention hows that for a vivid imagination she groaned and flung her arm over her eyes ive entered another dimension where sane people dont exist ericka moved her arm from her eyes and turned onto her side facing the window shadows from palm trees and the first hint of morning sunlight winked through the glass as she faced reality not too far away the rush and pound of the surf matched the rush of blood in her ears and the pounding of her heart the scent of sandalwood shifted into salt and brine mixed with the vanilla of candles shed placed on every available surface of the room she attempted to grasp the power of the dream but it faded through her fingers like tendrils of mist yet he was there never leaving her thoughts ericka blew a strand of red hair out of her eyes and chewed on one of her nails she slumped in the deck chair her shorts hiking up her thighs her mind was anywhere but on the page on her laptop another planet maybe it was nearing sunset for most of the day shed been sitting on the porch trying to work on her nonficfion book that included people describing visits by beings from otherworldly realms the freaking book she grumbled as images of her demon lover refused to leave her mind the damned dreams happen because youre studying and writing about similar paranormal occurrences she glanced at the ocean get a grip this hidden stretch of beach outskirting san diego was a perfect place to channel her writing the water called to her calmed her let her slip into a state of mind where her body no longer existed usually okay thats enough she punched a few keys and exited her doc and her web browser before closing her laptop you sure better have a productive day tomorrow when shed rented the condo in the past her fingers always flew over the keys of her laptop as she wrote her nonfiction paranormal books everything about the supernatural attracted her but she especially loved her current topic hence the dreams the wind kicked up and pages of one open research book on mythology flipped one after another in a sudden cascade she reached for the book as the pages stopped at the intro to incubae and succubae she drew the book closer and studied the picture shed practically drooled over the first time shed read the research book a painting of the backside of a man with her finger she traced his shoulderlength black hair muscular back and tight ass her imagination supplied the rest no doubt hed be as toned and fit everywhere if she could manage a peek at him from the front the corner of her mouth curved when she first looked at the picture shed been intrigued by giving up ones soul for ones desires ericka rolled her eyes between that fascination and the topic of her book no wonder shed been experiencing such intense nightly dreams shed been reading about incubae and succubae until her eyes damned near crossed and now her imagination had brought a demon lover of her own she shook her head snatched up her books and her laptop and headed into the condo after she put them away she glanced at her cell phone a tiny red light blinked indicating she had a message ericka checked the recent callers mom mom and mom and oh mom being the youngest child of a huge irish family ericka had to suffer through her mothers constant worrying over nothing and everything she smiled when she saw that julia her sister and closest friend had also called no one in the world knew ericka like julia did for a moment ericka thought about calling her sister and talking about her dreams but shook her head and set the phone aside despite ericka being well known for her books on paranormal occurrences julia refused to believe in anything she couldnt see for herself a real skeptic ericka slipped outside of the condo into the wavering sunlight and trotted barefoot down a rocky sandy path the cool ocean breeze lifted erickas hair from her shoulders she sucked in a deep lungful of salty air erickas thoughts wandered as she looked out at the beauty of the ocean the water was relatively calm only making a deep sucking sound before the onrush of a wave sand squished between erickas toes as she walked closer to the water could a dream man manifest himself as real she said out loud then shook her head julia would be catching the next flight from seattle before ericka could blink if she started talking about a man coming into her condo at nighteven if he was a dream man ericka reached the firm wet sand just as a wave receded and she wiggled her toes water rushed back and the small wave slapped her bare calves and ankles with a salty sting before drawing away again you should be writing fiction ericka she mumbled hes a freaking dream another small wave splashed against ericka this time high enough to reach the hems of her shorts she looked out at the soft swells of the ocean and the reflection of the oranges and pinks of the sunset rippling on the waves her heart rate kicked up a notchit was almost dark anticipation fluttered in her belly almost time for sleep and her dream lover aedan studied the winking stars above his quarters the constellations were so different in his realm than in erickas ericka just the thought of her hardened his cock so that it tented his toga his skin felt tight beneath the material as if he were being stretched from his bedchamber to erickas bedroom in the earth otherworld he took a deep breath before he lowered his gaze from the glittering sky to several pools of exotic fish he had collected from places he had visited over the centuries his mother belisma found it amusing that he an incubus had a sort of hobby he had to admit she was probably right demons didnt have hobbies demons had missions and i have friggin fish he sighed the swimming blurs of the colorful fish were likely proof that his mindand demonic missionwas slowly unraveling his chamber was carved from rock and in one corner a waterfall rushed over stones into a bathing pond moisture dampened the walls moss growing on the surfaces and the floor was soft grasshis own private paradise every incubae or succubae had a different type of chamber depending on whether they were of fire earth air or water a water incubus aedan was the offspring of the water goddess herself which probably explained his fascination with fish sort of his bed commanded the center of the chamber and had a mattress of soft leaves in a carvedout stone shell he wondered what ericka would think of his world never mind the fish what it would be like to bring her here to take her in his bed he pressed his fingertips to his forehead first the fish and now dangerous thoughts way past dangerous why after centuries of fulfilling womens desires was he thinking of such abominations that was never donebringing the human through the veil only souls could travel with the incubae or succubae to where the souls were stored until the humans shell died soul after soul hed collected without a second thought but erickaover the past month he had watched her as he prepared to go to her and work toward winning her soul he had witnessed her strength her beauty her commitment to family and friends her sense of fairness her intelligence as well as her love of writing which ironically enough involved researching his kind something he found both amusing and intriguing for some reason she made him feel more real alive made him want things he had never wanted before made him look at who and what he was and long for something different than he had always known like wishing he was human so he could spend his life with her aedan scowled an idiotic thought why was the woman affecting him like this when a succubus or an incubus was sent to a human the person had projected a powerful desire perhaps a wish for the fulfillment of a fantasy or a longing that included the phrase id give anything for the human usually exchanged his or her soul in payment often unaware of the magnitude of what theyd done and that was the key unaware i will take her soul and she might not even realize what she has surrenderedif i dont tell her he pictured erickas beautiful body as he prepared to take everything from her he imagined the way she would look at him when he finally thrust into her core she was already wild in his arms when he went to herthe way she whimpered and moaned trying to seek the completion he denied her it was his job to drive her insane with need nightly until she reached the point she would tell him anything anything he wanted to hearincluding giving up her soul butdamnation something about ericka made him feel as if he were a part of her and she a part of him an irrational thought that had him grinding his teeth the idea of taking erickas soul tore at him like a piranha eating his gut piranha hmmm maybe i should get a piranha for my collection godsdamn im losing my mind centuries of fucking women yet this one drove him to thoughts of piranha he had to shake off his madness it was time no matter how he felt he had to claim the womans soul it was either that or he would face eternity in the fires of the realm of the dead aedan ground his teeth and left his bedchamber it was time to go to the woman his thoughts churned as he strode down the hall of the lost when he reached the chamber of veils he walked to the archway that would take him to ericka he crossed his arms over his chest and watched her through the veil for a long moment her eyelids were closed hiding her startling blue eyes her lips parted as she shifted in her sleep the sheets rumpling beneath her naked body her red hair was a wild mass against the white of her pillowcase her nipples high and puckered with arousal around the room several candles burned within their holders and the soft light danced upon her skin gods and goddesses he could already smell her womans musk and her warm vanilla scent yes there was something about this one something innocent yet wild at the same time somethingperfect his groin tightened his cock aching he wanted to be inside her so many times he had come close to pushing her over the edge when she neared climax the thought of pleasuring her for the sake of pleasuring her made his lust spiral and his erection harder his muscles tensed and he swallowed the feelings of rebellion rising within him feelings he shouldnt be havingthat contradicted everything an incubus was ericka was his last assignment before he made the great transition to annwn that special place in underworld reserved for those who pleased the gods and goddesses aedan had been successful with every assignment and had earned his place earned the right to live in such peace and beauty he was looking forward to it he had lost his taste for his work years ago it was time for a change more importantly he had earned his reprieve from the flaming depths of the realm of the dead where most demons and the soulless were sent he rubbed his forehead with his thumb and forefingers if he took erickas soul she would go to the realm of the dead when her human shell died the mere thought made him grind his teeth if he did not take erickas soulthat was unthinkable for an incubus or a succubus to fail in the last assignment to be moments from salvation from the realm of the dead then feel the fires hideous terrible bite for all eternity sweat broke out on his skin at thoughts of the endless labor he would be forced to do as liquid heat splashed against his body aedan returned his gaze to ericka to that beauty and innocence that called to his being like no other had before you want her jeff appeared at his side bringing him out of his thoughts the succubus stroked his arm more than anyone you have taken in their dreams this one is important to you aedan forced himself to tear his gaze from the erotic sight of ericka roberts she is naught but another human hmmm the blackhaired beauty at his side looked at him with her brilliant gold gaze her toga sparkled the same color as her eyes this assignment is taking longer than normal she curled her fingers around his biceps that flexed beneath her touch another incubus kyne perhaps should accompany you a low rumble rose in aedans chest his jaw tightened at the thought of another incubus touching ericka that was irrational aedan had played out this drama with countless women over the centuries fulfilling their needs and desires in exchange for their souls what incubae and succubae performed had been twisted into something considered evil when in fact what they did only served to pleasure men and women and bring their fantasies to life so what did their souls matter if they could have every wish granted jett gathered her long hair and pulled it over one of her shoulders perhaps you have become too close to this human maybe you should have kyne take your place completely before you get into trouble no the word came out sharper than aedan intended ericka roberts is my assignment and i shall deal with her aedan caressed jetts back at the base of her spine with his palm touching her in that location always served to distract her and she released his biceps when he moved away as he watched ericka his cock ached enough to drive him senseless he hadnt allowed himself an orgasm just as he refused to let ericka climax he vanished his toga with a thought as he prepared to walk through the veil tonightwould ericka be ready to offer up her soul was he ready to take it chapter when the bed sank beneath the weight of someone easing onto the mattress beside her ericka wasnt surprised she opened her eyes and smiled at her dark lover shadows still hid his gaze from her but because she had left several candles lit this time she could make out his angular jaw a cleft in his chin and his straight nose dark hair skimmed his shoulders and his smile was so sensual it made her squirm his naked body was a work of art if she wrote fiction she couldnt have created a character to rival him broad shoulders carved biceps a muscled chest welldefined absdefinite hero material and his cockwow ericka reached up to touch his face and he captured her hand in his he held it to his heart and she felt his flesh so warm and real against her palm who are you she asked as his mouth neared hers what are you aedan his accent sounded oldworld as if he came from another time another place i am here to fulfill your fantasies that doesnt include leaving me hanging like you have been right his breath teased her lips as she spoke she should have been irritated but somehow she wasnt i certainly havent fantasized about that aedan stroked her naked body with his fingers as he kissed her it was sweet incredible and she hungered for more she grasped his cock and began stroking his erection as their tongues met and she tasted his unique flavor he hissed against her lips before drawing away moonlight spilled through her window and when he moved she saw his face clearly for the first time the man was gorgeous and he had gold eyes not brown or amber or any shade in between they were gold in a powerful sweep of his arms he caught her in his embrace forcing her to release his erection she gasped and wrapped her arms around his neck as he stood she couldnt tear her gaze from his golden eyes as he carried her to the braided rug and laid her on her back in front of the lifeless fireplace additional candles flickered to life around them and she widened her eyes in surprise yet at the same time it seemed as natural as the way he came to her every night candlelight touched his features casting dark shadows on the planes of his face he settled beside her and she caught her breath as he trailed his finger over one of her nipples that tingled beneath his touch in her heart and soul she knew it had been him all week it had never been just a dream he was here now and real hell she did write about paranormal events anything could happen he started to lower his head to slip one of her nipples inside his warm mouth it was all she could do to make herself stop him aedan she captured his face in her palms and it surprised her how smooth his skin was no roughness from stubble he paused and his golden eyes met hers and so many questions rose within her she wanted to know more about the man who came to her each night he caught her wrists in one of his large hands pulling her palms away from his cheeks what sweet one she squeezed her eyes shut then opened them to stare at him we need to talk for a second he furrowed his brows and then his features relaxed he gave her a dark sexy look that made her want to forget about questions and answers and just melt into him i can think of much better things to do he said as he lowered his head and slipped her nipple into his warm mouth at the same time he moved one of his thighs across hers and pressed his cock against her hip something between a sigh and a moan escaped her before she tried to draw her wrists away from his grip im serious she cried out as he bit her nipple then whimpered when he moved his mouth to her other taut bud i cant thinkstop aedan raised his head and studied her she felt his body heat the firmness of his grip around her wrists his thigh pinning hers what do you wish to discuss she tugged her wrists and he released them you something dark flickered in his eyes and for a moment his sensual expression slipped away but then he smiled again he placed his hand on her belly and his warmth seeped into her skin and spread throughout her ericka took a deep breath how do you come here how do you get into my condo you believe in the unbelievable ericka roberts he traced her navel with his fingertip you tell me she frowned thats not an answer with a casual shrug of one shoulder he said i am who i am this was going nowhere in a hurry are you real he pressed his erection tighter against her hip and brushed her brow with his lips as his scent of sandalwood and male swept over her she wanted him to roll her onto her back and feel his body weighing hers down do you think i am real he murmured yesi think so yes she tried to focus as he moved his mouth to her earlobe and gently nipped it but i need to know more he bit her earlobe again before trailing his lips down her jawline and that would be where you come from things about you she brought one of her hands up and placed her palm on his chest forcing him to raise his head and meet her eyes do you have any brothers or sisters what about your mother your father again that dark look flickered in his eyes but vanished when he smiled i have many brothers and sisters and my mothershe is different he gave a low groan as she scraped her fingernails from his chest to his abs different how in ways i find difficult to explain he sighed she has much to attend to and i do not see her often oh her fingers neared his cock as she skimmed past his abs toward his groin at home in seattle my family is constantly around and my mother fusses over all of us sometimes i need to get away you know a soft look came over his features yes her hand reached his erection and she wrapped her fingers around it causing him to suck in his breath ericka smiled at the desire and strength rising within her power she felt so much power over him and his desires it was her turn to drive him crazy she pushed harder at his shoulder and he rolled onto his back at the same time he removed his thigh from where it had rested on hers ericka moved off the braided rug and straddled him you will tell me more she gave him her naughtiest grin but not now before he could speak she eased down his body so that she was between his thighs her mouth brushing the soft skin of his erection aedan groaned and tangled his fingers in her wavy hair after all the teasing he had done she was tempted to draw out his torture as long as possible she ran her tongue along the length of his cock and cupped his balls with her free hand he gripped her hair tighter and raised his hips as she slipped her mouth over the head of his erection he was so big and thick and tasted salty and delicious tenderness filled his voice when he said i want to see your beautiful eyes immediately she looked up and she wanted to melt right into that wonderful golden gaze damnation but the feel of erickas mouth was incredible around him she sucked as he raised his hips and slowly thrust in and out of her mouth she gave just the right pressure that would please any man the thought enraged him he clenched his fist tighter in her soft red hair and she whimpered he wanted to be the only man to please her but then he realized once again that he wasnt a man that he would never be a human male he was an incubus here to take this womans soul only he found himself not wanting her soulbut her heart her innocence her intelligenceeverything that drew him to her again and again made him want her for so much more gods what am i thinking her heart his look must have been fierce because ericka widened her eyes he calmed his expression but gritted his teeth as he felt an orgasm rushing toward him with the power of an underworld storm he thrust in and out a few more times and then jerked his cock out of her mouth just as he was about to reach orgasm he held ericka still his hand fisted in her hair her lips were moist and his cock wet from her mouth he wanted to take her now to fuck her hard and fast until they both reached climax but his nightly visits had been to prepare her for this moment time to take herand take her soul aedan shifted beside ericka on the braided rug as he drew her up from between his thighs so that she lay beside him she sighed as he kissed her and slipped his tongue into her mouth she tasted his wild male flavor and his scent of sandalwood and sex filled her senses when he drew away he smiled and her heart nearly stopped beating your beauty is beyond compare ericka roberts she started to return his smile but instead frowned as a thought occurred to her how do you know my name i know much about you sweet one he brought one of his hands between them and drew a line from between her breasts to her belly button you have a large family whom you love very much you write about otherworldly realms and all that is paranormal aedan pressed a kiss to her forehead before he moved his lips to her ear and whispered what less would you expect of your dream lover he had her there any other thoughts she might have had escaped her as he cupped her mound with one hand while skimming the curve of her neck with his lips and tongue he slipped his finger into her slick folds and she whimpered slowly so slowly he eased down her body licking tasting sucking his tongue left a wet path over her collarbone then up the rise of her breast to her nipple when he latched onto the taut nub ericka cried out and arched her back his long dark hair brushed her skin in a silken caress as he moved his mouth to her other nipple erickas mind spun and she was beyond words as he thrust two fingers into her core and pumped them at the same time she clenched her hands in his hair and squirmed as she rode his fingers while he pounded them in and out of her when he had eased himself down her body so that his head was between her thighs ericka could barely breathe blood rushed in her ears as his breath stirred the curls of her mound ericka let out a cry as he swiped his tongue from the sensitive place between her anus and folds all the way up his hair felt silken between her thighs as he moved his head and drove his fingers in and out of her the intensity of his licking and sucking was almost too much to bear so much so much so much she had to climax she was so close to orgasm she could almost scream she parted her lips with a louder moan while he continued to delve into her folds tingling sensations ran rampant in her body and her mind spun with desire just when she thought she was going to lose control he stopped aedan she shouted and looked down at him she felt dizzy lightheaded and had to have an orgasm so badly she was almost insane with it dont stop please tears stung the backs of her eyes from the incredible need to climax aedan raised his head at the same time she looked down and she saw a spark in his gold eyes he was so goodlooking so masculine so powerful his muscles flexing with every movement he made her breathing grew harsher and her heart thundered as she stared at aedans starkly handsome face her dark lover always shed thought of him as her demon lover the way he came in the night and left her sweating and wanting was he going to leave her aching for fulfillmenteven more so than before not this time not this time he cant do it to me again aedan smiled an incredibly sexy smile that caused more tingling and wetness between her thighs he lowered his head and swiped her folds again with his tongue she gasped as he began pounding his fingers in and out of her core again this time it seemed like her head was going to float away and only the heat and ache in her body kept her grounded what he was doing to her was more than she could bear her body trembled she was so close to losing total control she couldnt think past what she was feeling the edge of an orgasm so powerful rushed toward herit was like she was burning in whitehot fire oh god she needed to climax and climax now he stopped for a moment ericka was disoriented ripped away from the peak she had almost fallen over dont stop she begged again perspiration coated her skin and her hair was damp against her scalp she squirmed as he slipped his fingers out of her core dont do this to me a predatory smile crept over his face he rose up between her thighs and placed his cock at the opening of her core and nudged it enough to make her gasp she held her breath waiting for that moment of penetration that would bring her fulfillment for days shed prepared for this he would finally be inside of her aedans gaze caught hers and for a moment it was like he had cast a spell over her erickas body was still on fire but suddenly she felt suspended in time waiting wanting he opened his mouth as if to say something then stopped again he started then closed his mouth his expression changed to one of anger shes not ready yet he growled like he was talking to himself the spell fell away im ready ericka squirmed wondering what in the hell he meant he shook his head not yet ericka cried out as he moved away and rested on his haunches tears flowed freely down her face she rose so that she was sitting up and pounded her fists on his rockhard chest you cant do this to me he leaned down and kissed her forehead i am sorry frustration and fury tore through ericka you bastard she slapped him as hard as she could aedans head snapped to the side and then he looked directly at her she flinched when he put his fingers to her forehead relaxation flowed through her taking the edge off her need to climax not entirely but enough that she didnt think she was going to die if she didnt have an orgasm aedan drew ericka into his embrace she collapsed against his chest her arms around his neck and she cried she couldnt move couldnt speak as aedan rose to his feet and carried her toward her bed he laid her gently on the mattress and she stared up at him the bedsprings creaked beneath his weight as he sat next to her he stroked her hair from her face and he wore an odd expression regret sadness longing she didnt care this time she was pissed damn you she pushed herself up in her bed and shoved him away why are you doing this to me he shook his head it is difficult to explain what ericka nearly smacked him again how can it be difficult for you to not give me a damn orgasm it is time for me to go he cupped her face and ran his thumb across her cheek i am sorry she knocked his hands away and stared into his eyes tell me who you really are tell me whats going on nothing sweet one he brushed his fingertips over her forehead and closed his eyes the gold of them lost to her for a moment be at ease he opened his eyes and ericka felt a little dizzy as he lowered her fully onto her back and drew a quilt to her shoulders she needed to climax she knew it yet the intensity shed experienced moments ago faded a bit he kissed her cheek sleep i will return erickas eyelids drooped she didnt have the strength to fight off his kiss or tell him to go to hell she was too limp too exhausted she tumbled into a world of crazy crazy dreams chapter aedan narrowed his brows as he turned away from ericka walked through the veil and the archway what in the underworlds had he been thinking at that moment when shed been so close to orgasm when he could have taken her she would have given him anything even though she wouldnt have realized what she was giving up she would have said the words he had sensed it known it and he hadnt asked her for her soul he half expected the guides to the realm of the dead to be waiting for him instead kyne and jett were what the fuck was that about kyne shouted his gold eyes blazing his muscles tightened as he clenched his fists at his sides you had her she would have turned over her soul without thinking twice she wasnt ready with a thought aedan dressed himself in a toga then tried to shoulder his way past kyne and jett but both stepped in front of him are you out of your mind jett was as loud as kyne had been she tossed her long black hair over her shoulder by all that crawls the realm of the dead she was ready you are much too close to this one kyne folded his arms across his chest his look fierce errol or i should finish it you hold no power over me heat washed over aedan and he scowled at kyne this is my assignment and i will complete it neither you nor errol will touch her i will save her from you whispered his mind and from myself too you are coming with us jett took him by his upper arm and tugged her fingers pressing into his flesh he stood firm i am retiring to my quarters no kyne said first we have something you must see a low rumble rose within aedan if it will get you to leave me in peace jett studied him that will be for you to decide aedan growled again but walked between jett and kyne from the chamber of veils into the hall of the lost the floor was cool and smooth beneath his bare feet the silence thick and heavy between the three of them the vast hall stretched endlessly yet it wasnt long before they reached a chamber that aedan had always avoided it was the chamber of futures and he had never desired to see what lay in store for him his future would be whatever he made of it he merely had to make the choice to pacify his companions he allowed kyne and jett to shove him into the room they could not enter as only the being who wished to see his or her future was allowed his throat tightened as he walked into the darkened passageway of a cave rough rock walls surrounded him sharp stones pricked his soles and smells of dust and age filled his nostrils it was akin to a holy place had they not been demons he turned a corner and came to a stop in the doorway of a small round chamber the walls were white and as smooth as polished marble on the floor at the center of the room was a circular mosaic depicting the gods and goddesses of the four elementsfire wind earth water four figures intertwined the god of earth was at the top of the circle north and he bore a green seedling in his palms the goddess of wind was to the east her red hair flowing in a breeze and a bird perched on her shoulder at the base of the circle south was the god of fire he held both hands up to either side of him a flame in each palm and then on the west side of the circle was the likeness of the goddess of water who tipped her head back as rain fell upon her face belisma his mother aedan sucked in his breath and stepped into the center of the mosaic immediately sensations of cool earth beneath his feet warred with sudden heat warming his legs a breeze raised his hair from his shoulders and flattened his tunic to his body it felt as if the welcome caress of water wrapped around him his skin tingled as he stared at the smooth white wall he forced himself to breathe as he waited for his future to be shown to him for a moment nothing then the entire room vanished he stood on a sandy beach looking out at the ocean sunshine warmed his bodya strange sensation he was an incubus never allowed in the sunlight always relegated to the dark annwn i must be in the afterlife where my kind go if the gods and goddesses are pleased the tightness in his throat increased and his heart pounded in time with the waves against the sand of course he would be sent to a place near water but thishe had not expected such beauty such vastness a cry from a sea bird mingled with the roar of the ocean the scent of salt was heavy enough that he even tasted it on his tongue to either side of him grew thick green foliage that hugged the small cove for the first time in all his centuries of being he felt alive and free free of the constraints of serving the gods and goddesses and alive with possibilities in one moment he felt joy in the next terror light and joy vanished aedan shouted as he was enveloped in flame the pain so deep and constant it was as if the flesh was charred from his bones bursts of fire lit the darkness while bubbling pools of lava lapped at his feet like the ocean waves had when he had stood on the shore with every splash of lava against his ankles and calves aedan wanted to cry out but he ground his teeth and held it in as he searched for some way out of this version of the human hell the realm of the dead sweat rolled down his face and arms but quickly dried in the searing heat shrieks cries and sobs of other beings in the realm echoed from sharp and sheer volcanic rock he could make out figures now men women no doubt some he had sent here himself dear gods and goddesses a wave of heat slammed into him forcing him to drop to his knees in a lava pool aedan gave another shout everything vanished he was in the chamber of futures again but on his knees aedans breathing came hard and fast and in his minds eye he could still see the flames and the tortured souls his tunic was now damp with his sweat and clung to his body when the beating of his heart slowed and his breathing calmed he stood and straightened to his full height his choices had been laid out before him annwn or the realm of the dead his choice robbing ericka roberts of her soul was the key aedan clenched his fists at his sides and strode from the chamber nearly running into jett and kyne when he entered the hall of the lost without speaking to either of them he turned and headed away from the pair who remained silent he neededhe needed his quarters the stone the water he needed to think when he reached his quarters he slammed the door raked his fingers through his hair again and looked up at the starry sky gods and goddesses what is happening a sigh and a breeze whirled through his chamber and he turned to face the direction it came from like the reflection of water on a pond his mother belisma appeared before him along with her scent of fresh water and moss the goddess of water was as beautiful as a crystal waterfall tumbling into the river of life surprise sent a jolt down his spine that belisma had answered his cry he knelt before the blond goldeneyed goddess and kept his head lowered rise aedan of the incubae her voice even sounded like water trickling over rocks when his eyes met hers the beautiful goddess did not smile this has never been a battle for the humans soul my son it is a battle for yours aedans mouth wouldnt open as he stared at the water goddess before he had a chance for her response to register and to ask her what in the underworlds she meant belisma wavered like the ripples from a stone tossed in a pond and then she was gone what the fuck this time he scrubbed both hands through his hair what the fuck did she mean my soul he was incubae he was a creation of the gods and goddesses he didnt have a soul he had heard stories in childhood of demons granted reprieve from their soulless state usually at the whim of some godbut he had never known that to happen in modern times aedan shook his head and stared around his room it was no surprise belisma had been the one to answer his cry since she was his mother but why the cryptic message my soul he stalked from one end of his large chamber to the other the sound of the waterfall in the corner made a rushing sound like the blood in his ears it was well past his time of resting before he could lie down and attempt sleep utterly exhausted ericka rolled out of bed got to her feet and stretched cool morning air drifted from the window over her bare skin vivid images flashed through erickas mind and crashed down on her her knees gave out and the bedsprings creaked as she dropped onto the bed she blinked and rubbed her eyes with her fingertips the dream rushed toward heronly it didnt feel like a dream it felt like a memory everything tumbled through her at once she sucked in a deep breath and gripped her sheets in her fists aedan his name was aedan with every fiber of her being she knew he was real a dream lover brought to life hed truly been coming to her every night but hed done it again hed brought her to the peak and hadnt let her climax she ground her teeth and clenched her fists tighter bastard would he come back tonight if he did shed give him a piece of her mind and shed let him have it with her fists this time or a wellplaced knee to the balls until last night she hadnt thought he was real not truly well maybe hed been a phantom there but not there but hes ohsoreal ericka rubbed her temples with the heels of her palms he was real real but where did he come from what about the disappearing act was she going crazy she pushed to her feet even though her legs trembled she headed for the shower and wondered how the hell she was going to get any writing done today with a sigh ericka plopped on the bright patchwork couch in her living room a heavy book in her lap the book contained extensive accounts of people who believed they had been visited by incubae or succubae it was twilight so she flicked on the antique lamp on the end table beside the couch as the day had passed ericka felt like she was caught in a dream everything was so surreal as if she was experiencing life outside her body no matter what she tried her mind wouldnt stray from last night and every other night aedan had come to her shed finally given up trying to write and put away her laptop and research books with the exception of the book spread open in her lap now ericka crossed her legs on the couch as she began to read at first her focus wasnt so hot but as she read she fell deeper into the stories of countless people some were nothing like what shed experienced but when she ran across one by a woman in idaho her heart started pounding against her breastbone a man visited me the woman had said he had a perfect muscular body long dark hairand gold eyes a wash of heat flowed over ericka at the thought of another woman being with aedan the rush of jealousy surprised her and made her grind her teeth it had to be him the sex dear god the woman betty something claimed the man denied her an orgasm each night and would vanish before she climaxed finally when she made the promise he demanded he brought her to completion he never returned what had betty promised erickas hands shook as she held the book her gaze slowly moving down to the end of the womans story her heart lodged in her throat my soul betty said in the interview i promised him my soul erickas heart dropped from her throat to the pit of her stomach and she almost doubled over feeling as if she might throw up sweat broke out on her skin and her body went from hot to cold hot to cold it took long moments but the sickness in her belly finally eased and her heartbeat slowed when she collected herself she took a deep breath and straightened resting her back against the couch aedan truly was a demon an incubus who had come to take her soul what he said last night suddenly made sense shes not ready yet but she would have done it that sick feeling weighted her belly again all hed had to do was ask and she would have said yes without realizing what she was doing ericka closed the book and set it aside on the couch as she stared at the window across the living room the sheer curtains stirred it was already dark and soon it would be time to go to bed did she dare or should she pack her belongings into her suv and drive through the night back to seattle she rubbed her sweaty palms on her shorts and swallowed hard no she wasnt going to run she was prepared armed with the truth she and aedan had some unfinished business and no way in hell was he getting her soul aedan stood at the veil between him and the earth otherworld he watched ericka pace as she glanced at her bed every now and then candlelight from the many candleholders around her room flickered and caused shadows to dance along the walls a fat blue candle burned on her nightstand and he caught the scent of blueberries along with her vanilla scent she chewed on one of her nails while carrying a glass of red wine in her other every so often she would take a sip before returning to pacing and chewing on her fingernail instead of being naked she wore a short sheer gown it didnt hide a lot but the meaning was clear she was placing a barrier between them no doubt because he had denied her again last night at the thought his heart ached he didnt want anything between them it was well into the night when ericka settled on her bed and put the nowempty wine glass on the nightstand she remained sitting her back propped against the pillows shed stacked in front of the headboard her eyelids drooped despite her obvious efforts to keep her eyes wide open she jerked awake a couple of times then slid into an exhausted sleep aedan almost hated to wake ericka but the need to be near her was so great he couldnt stay away he wished away his tunic with his magic then stepped through the veil chapter walking through the veil was like stepping inside gel a sticky gooey sensation aedans feet met the bedrooms carpet and he was free of the veil it was always behind him but was not something a human could see when he reached ericka he watched her sleep what did she have to do with belismas baffling message about his soul his body tightened with frustration then he forced himself to relax to push thoughts of belisma away and concentrate on ericka she took deep even breaths but her forehead was crinkled as if concerned as always her red hair fell in a mass about her face down to her slim shoulders the almostsheer blue nightgown allowed him glimpses of her nipples and areolas seeing her nipples along with the hint of the patch of hair on her mound caused his cock to harden even more than it had while he watched her through the veil aedan settled beside her on the bed trying to ease down slowly enough that the springs didnt whine with the back of his hand he brushed a curl from her cheek and she made a soft sound and turned her face toward his touch he slipped his fingers from her cheek into her hair as he lowered his mouth to hers he heard her soft breathing and even the pounding of her heart gods and goddesses when his lips touched hers fire raced through his body and straight toward his erection she sighed and he slipped his tongue into her mouth and tasted her sweet womanly flavor along with the hint of the wine shed been drinking ericka moaned and returned his kiss he didnt know if she was awake yet but her body responded to him the scent of her musk grew stronger the deeper their kiss became aedan placed his palm over one of her breasts feeling the hard nipple poking through the fabric he squeezed and she moaned louder then slipped her arms around his neck and nibbled at his bottom lip it was his turn to groan he drew away to see her beautiful blue eyes open her lips were parted and moist and she ran her tongue along her bottom lip i knew youd come her voice was husky yet had a slight edge to it but i didnt know if i wanted you to why not he began rolling her nipple between his thumb and forefinger and she groaned ericka looked into his eyes something flickered in her gaze but she said nothing he tried not to frown at not being able to read her expression instead he let it pass slid onto the bed and she scooted over to let him recline beside her she moved so that they were both lying down facing one another he traced the line of her body with his fingers from her shoulder to her waist to her hip her warm vanilla scent and her womans musk filled his senses as an incubus he didnt need light to see in darkness but the candlelight touching her features made her seem softer and more vulnerable an incubus why couldnt he be a man at this moment more than anything he wished he could stay with her forever to wake with her when the first rays of sunlight peeked through the windows and to walk with her in the sunshine by the gods and goddesses if he did have a spiritessence he would offer it to her his gut twisted and ached as he thought about his vision of annwn and the beach that would be his home as long as he took erickas soul the alternativethe constant feeling of being burned alive in the realm of the dead if he didnt take her soul that would be his future if he did take her soul the realm of the dead would be erickas fate ericka didnt pull away when aedan touched her face with his hand how could he make her feel this way make her want him even more when she knew exactly what he was this very moment she should push him away tell him to not come back giving away her soul was not an option god he was good playing the part so well that she could almost believe he cared becky betty whoever she was hadnt mentioned that just the incredible sex and then his vanishing act when she gave him what he wanted her soul ericka shivered as aedan trailed his thumb over her lips and across her cheek a thrill stirred in her belly and between her thighs and her nipples pressed against the sheer nightgown his eyes darkened to a deeper gold and his jaw tightened as he slipped his fingers into her hair and started to draw her to him at the same time he moved his lips toward hers what was wrong with playing along and getting what she wanted from him and wouldnt this go over well in one of my books my own experiences with an incubus his lips brushed hers she groaned and wrapped her arms around his neck she couldnt stop herself his kiss was so exquisite she could think of nothing but him aedan moved his lips from hers licking a path to her ear he nipped at her earlobe causing her to squirm with desire what can i do for you ericka her face screwed in a frown im not having sex with you in any way if youre going to leave before i climax she drew away and darkened her frown i mean it he raised his head and grinned perhaps i should tie you up and ericka slugged him in the shoulder youre getting nothing unless i get an ironclad promise from you sex with an orgasm to end all orgasms he smiled an almost sad wistful smile with the aid of the candlelight she studied his strong features and body he was fit not an ounce of fat on him she loved his muscular thighs and tight ass not to mention his goodsized erectionshe wanted to push him on his back and straddle him he was breathtaking with his long dark hair and golden gaze she reached between them and stroked his cock you have amazing eyes he grasped the bottom of her nightgown all my people have eyes of gold or silver yeah i know any thoughts of further conversation vanished as he pushed up her sheer nightgown it was the only one she had brought with her to the condo shed intended on refusing aedan tonight but she couldnt refuse him anything dear god she was falling for an incubus am i losing my mind ericka pushed away the thoughts and wriggled to help him pull the nightgown over her head and drop it on the floor aedan hooked his thigh over her hip and in a thoroughly possessive movement he brought her tight to him flattening her breasts and making her nipples ache more he rained kisses over her face i want to see you spread out wide for me only me erickas breath caught and her belly fluttered his gaze fixed on hers for this night you will have everything i can give you a lump rose in her throat at the thought that he probably wouldnt be back after she told him what she knewand that he would never get her soul what would you give me she swallowed back thoughts of him never returning would you give me anything i asked of you aedan jerked back a little as if surprised at the way shed turned the tables on him anything he said softly if you wanted my very soul i would give it to you your soul she repeated but he was an incubus he didnt have a soul so his promise was empty he stirred against her the heat of his body making her mind spin with lust she let her body take over her thought process again how about an orgasm instead a slow sensual smile curved the corners of his mouth i will make certain of it she touched the side of his face and stroked his black hair promise to let me climax this time you have my word he kissed the corner of her mouth and palmed one of her breasts you will have an orgasm like youve never had before he brushed his lips over hers and she sighed into his mouth yes she whispered almost without thought she craved him her body craved him everything about her needed him when he drew away his smile was devastating erickas heart beat faster he trailed his fingertips over her breasts and her nipples tightened and ached do you know how beautiful you are you are she stared into his golden eyes no wonder women cant refuse you at first aedan frowned but then appeared to ignore what shed said about other women he moved and spread her thighs wide with his palms as he knelt between them a yellow scarf appeared in his hand er what do you intend to do with that she fixed her gaze on the scarf his grin was absolutely wicked he trailed the yellow scarf up one of her thighs and then through her folds intense sensations swirled through her he continued to make his way up her body until he reached her face she caught the scent of her musk on the scarf the bed dipped as he moved and he brushed his lips over her cheekbone gods and goddesses you look so perfect he murmured he took the scarf and continued to trail it over her body in a featherlight caress goosebumps rose on her skin and she shivered every caress made her want to shout out in ecstasy in his unusual accent he spoke softly in a language she didnt understand which made her hotter yet she needed him inside her so bad she wanted to scream soon love he murmured as if hearing her thoughts i will fuck you hard fast deep the way you beg me for it aedan began licking her body from her toes to the arch of her foot and the inside of her ankle she trembled as he licked and sucked his way up her calf and made her shudder with desire when he flicked his tongue against the skin at the back of her knee so damn slow he made his path up to that sensitive spot between her folds and her thigh and she arched her back he blew his warm breath on her then the bastard moved down to her opposite foot and began taking a lazy trail up that leg just like hed done with her other ericka thought shed die or go crazy the man was driving her mad she trembled needing him to do something lick her or take herright now she didnt care she just needed to climax when he reached her folds again she held her breath but no he moved up her belly he dipped his tongue into her navel and it sent shockwaves straight to her core he continued higher until he reached the spot between her breasts he had to feel how hard her heart was beating she made a combination sigh and groan when his mouth latched onto her nipple it was still sensitive from last night when hed pinched it and that made his attention to it all the more erotic he sucked her other nipple and the wetness of his tongue made her squirm so anxious he moved so that his chest brushed her nipples do you wish for me to take you now yes ericka nodded in fast jerky movements she was so wet so ready and she wanted him so bad aedan groaned and he teased the entrance to her core with his erection he brushed his lips across her cheek i do not think i can wait any longer either my love my love repeated in erickas mind a second before he slammed his cock inside her this time ericka did scream she tossed her head from side to side as he drove in and out of her like hed promised hard fast deep his balls slapped against her and his chest rubbed her nipples her whole body was alive on fire she was burning his sweatslicked skin moved against hers and she smelled sandalwood and sex the way he filled hershe couldnt begin to describe it he stretched her reached deep inside her a climax built and built until it spiraled and spiraled like she was spinning toward some distant peak in her mind if he left her hanging now shed kill him could a person kill an incubus shed sure as hell find out if he left her hanging the thoughts vanished as he kept thrusting into her taking her like shed never been taken before her body shook as his hips pistoned between her thighs his chest rubbed her nipples even harder shed give anything to finally have an orgasm with aedan not her soul though not her soul he jerked and fell out of rhythm and paused his breathing harsh ericka cried out with anger and frustration then he started driving into her harder than ever hard hard harder oh god she was almost there almost there almost there come for me ericka was all aedan said behind her eyelids ericka saw pure white as if her world had just gone supernova she screamed she couldnt think past what she was feeling whitehot fire exploded from inside her aedan continued to slam into her tears rolled down her cheeks from the exquisite sensations ericka soared to places she hadnt been to ever he kept driving into her relentlessly his golden eyes glowed and the sight made her core clamp down on his cock even more aedan she cried please god please she didnt even know what she was begging for hed given her the most powerful orgasm of her life what did she want now his look was intense sweat dripping down the side of his face her spasms went on until they faded then started to build up again come ericka he said i want to see your eyes when you climax again she hadnt thought another orgasm could be even more intense than the last one but it was it was almost too intense her whole body shook and she cried his name over and over again a few more thrusts and he shouted as he climaxed the throb of his cock inside her made her contractions continue on way past the point she was certain she couldnt take anymore apparently she could aedan rolled her in his arms and held her tight i wish i never had to let you go he said his voice shaking i never want to let you go chapter the pain in aedans voice and what hed said sent erickas mind reeling she stiffened in his arms something was wrong had he taken her soul without her permission her heart beat faster and her throat grew too dry to speak he lifted his head and fear rose in a heated rush when she saw his tortured expression he pressed his lips to her forehead then rolled onto his side so they faced each other and she was in his arms he didnt he couldnt have stolen my soul ericka forced herself to take a deep breath dont panic dont panic most likely you will hate me when i tell you the truth aedan brushed her hair from her forehead as her heart pounded harder i am not what you think i am his golden gaze was so intense she couldnt say anything i am incubae and i was sent to take your soul more heat prickled her skin and a slight dizziness overcame her she opened her mouth but he placed two fingers over her lips not allowing her to speak however i will not take anything from you his features relaxed and he gave her a sad smile your soul is your own i only wish i could share your life that would be my greatest dream relief whooshed through her and she relaxed against her pillow he hadnt taken her soul then she realized what hed said about sharing his life with her and a strange feeling settled in her belly aedan she tried to say behind his fingers but he pressed them harder to her lips smells of sandalwood and sex mingled with the vanillascented candles i must go he sighed i cannot return erickas eyes widened whatyou have to come back he moved his fingers and pressed his lips to hers i hope you will remember and think well of me he started to move away from her when she grabbed hold of his hand wait she clenched his fingers tight i already figured out youre an incubus i wont give you my soul but i dont want you to stop coming an ache grew tighter in her chest please aedan gave another melancholy smile it is not my choice i answer to the gods and goddesses and i must face my destiny what is it her hand started to tremble but she didnt let go of his your destiny he stared at her for a long time and she tried to imagine never looking into his golden eyes again the realm of the dead ericka caught her breath in her research books that place was a version of hell where one burned for eternity no she shook her head as she tried to unscramble her thoughts attempting to remember more of her research isnt there another place a good place anan annwn he gently took her hand from his and eased off the bed as she sat and faced him but i have failed in my last mission and my fate does not lie there any longer stay aedan her whole body felt like she was going to shatter stay with me she knew her words were crazy he was a demon a demon i have grown to love you he stroked her cheek with his fingertips thoughts of you will carry me through my destiny tears burned in her eyes and she felt like she had already started breaking apart he moved away from her and she scrambled out of bed and tried to follow him wait panic laced her voice isnt there something we can do aedan gave her an intense look of longing before cupping her cheeks with his hands and brushing his lips over hers he whispered i love you ericka the unreality of it all made her mind spin aedan please she tried to grab his arm to stop him he vanished no no no she held her palm over her mouth as tears burned her eyes and her body shook that cant be it she said as she let her hand drop away i wont let it ericka grabbed her robe that was draped over a chair she wrapped herself in it before running to the living room straight for her mountain of research books there had to be a way to save him aedan knew the escorts would be waiting hideous demons wearing cloaks that rippled like fire aedan didnt bother dressing himself with his thoughts the clothing would simply burn away even though he would not jett and kyne stood to the side jetts eyes were wide and fear was on her features kyne clenched his fist so tightly his muscles bunched give him another chance kynes voice had a rough edge to it as the guards took aedan by his upper arms i will miss you aedan said to jett and kyne as the guards started to take him away may you find much happiness in annwn when you should go jett choked back a sob aedan why why throw your life to the fires for a human aedan shook his head then stared forward as the guards escorted him from the chamber of veils during the long walk down the hall of the lost aedans heart grew heavier he pushed aside his fear with thoughts of ericka and smiled knowing she would be safe when they reached the doorway to the realm of the dead heat blasted aedan he closed his eyes for a moment he opened them before he and the demons stepped through the rock entryway and down steps leading to another archway flames singed his cheeks even before the guards pushed him into fire and lava hours flew as ericka flipped through pages of book after book after book that she had piled beside the couch something had to be here hadnt she read or heard that an incubus could be kept from facing such a horrible fate or was it merely her desperate desire to save him that made her imagine things that couldnt be after aedan left she put on a pot of coffee and even had to brew another batch as she pored over the books her eyes burned her vision swam and she was so jittery she spilled a few drops of coffee onto her robe she set the cup down and picked up another book held it in her palms and stared at the worn cover it was merely a book of very old tales of faeries elves demons and other fables as she opened the book to the table of contents she blinked the tiredness from her eyes she glanced at the table of contents and noted the section on demon fables before rifling through the pages until she reached the first tale disappointment tore at her gut as she saw a picture of a stereotypical demon with a hideous face horns and a forked tail ericka bit the inside of her cheek trying for control she didnt have time for tears she flipped the next page and the next she came to an abrupt stop when a few words caught her eyes annwn realm of the dead butterflies batted her belly and she forced herself to slow down and read the passages annwn a place of beauty almost heaven but not quite the realm of the deadit was hell the butterflies dropped like lead as she read descriptions of each place in the afterlife a section brought her to a complete stop stolen souls are taken to the realm of the dead where they serve the god of death surprisingly incubae and succubae do not face the fate of the realm of the dead unless they fail in the tasks set forth to them by the gods and goddesses the only known way for a demon to escape the realm is for a human to voluntarily release half of his or her soul and offer it to the demon by doing so the human will bind himself or herself to the demon because the demon shares the humans spiritual essence the demon neither fails nor completes his assignment erickas heart raced and she could barely breathe half of her soul was she willing to give that much to save aedan she closed her eyes tight imagined all the times hed come to her and the bond shed felt between them he had sacrificed his own future for hers am i willing to do it for him yes yes ericka sucked in another breath and released it her skin tingling from the magnitude of her decision she slowed and read the ritual carefully she no longer felt tired instead her body buzzed with energy and it wasnt just the caffeine shed need three white candles a lock of her hair and three flat watersmoothed rocks after she gathered all of her supplies shed need to make up some kind of rhyming chant that expressed her desire to share her soul with aedan that would be the hard part still in her robe she dashed out of the condo to the beach and combed the line of kelp for smooth rocks the salty air was moist and humid and wind tugged at her robe as waves slapped the shore over and over in her mind she worked on the words for a chant the sun peeked over the horizon the faint morning light just enough to see by when shed found the rocks she hurried back into the condo and grabbed three candles from her bedroom along with a black marker a lighter and a pair of scissors slightly out of breath from rushing she knelt on the kitchens tiled floor as she snipped a lock of her hair then lit the candles she tossed the scissors aside along with the lighter and they clattered across the floor she grabbed the marker her hand shook as she drew a circle on the kitchen tile around herself and the items beside her ericka eased onto her haunches and stared at the candles the flames danced almost mesmerizing her she swallowed then picked up the lock of hair god she hoped the chant would work as she draped a third of her hair over each flame the strands hissed and curled as they caught fire the smell of burning hair overpowered scents of the vanilla candles her heart pounded in a harsh rhythm and she chanted as she placed the hair on the candle flames all my love and half my soul i give to aedan the incubae with that gift i demand his return this day free him now to find his true fate gods and goddesses i claim him as my mate forever halved twins sharing a soul heart to heart we will both be whole tears stung erickas eyes as she placed the three smooth flat stones one at a time over each flame she snuffed them with the rocks pressing the wick into the melted wax and burned hair when she finished a breeze immediately swept the room lifting her hair from her shoulders goosebumps prickled her skin and butterflies skipped in her belly everything around her wavered like she was looking through a window of water erickas lips parted and her heart thundered as she got to her feet a stone archway appeared and she couldnt see the condos kitchen anymore on the other side of the wavering air was an enormous room with lots of other archways she raised her hand instead of air she touched a rubbery surface she pushed and tumbled through the archway ericka screamed when the sucking sensation grabbed hold of her and the condo vanished the sensation of being engulfed in goo surrounded her before she stumbled out of it and dropped to her hands and knees on a polished marble floor if her heart didnt stop beating so hard it was going to explode what the hell she said as cool marble chilled her knees and hands she glanced up from the floor someone was in front of her erickas gaze slowly traveled up the bluerobed form until she met the golden eyes of a gorgeous blond woman her beauty was marred only by her hard expression rise the woman motioned with her hand for ericka to stand i wish to see the woman who cost my son his future erickas cheeks burned as she got to her feet and stood eyetoeye with the woman i never wanted aedan to go to the realm of the dead she spoke so fast she stumbled over her words dont let him be taken please when she finished speaking she was clenching her hands so hard her nails dug into her palms it istoo late the womans voice softened my son has been banished to the flames no ericka shook her head as her mind began to reel no he cant be heat flushed her as if she was in the fire as a vivid image of him burning alive seared her mind something the woman had said clicked youre aedans mother she inclined her head i am belisma the water goddess aa goddess erickas brain stuttered at belismas statement but she managed to grasp one obvious thread if youre a goddess cant you save him belisma stepped closer to ericka and raised her hand the goddesss fingertips were cool as she brushed them along erickas cheek the goddess stared thoughtfully at ericka as she stroked her fingers through erickas wild red hair she wanted to scream and stomp her feet but instead she felt the power of the goddesss hold and didnt move belisma let her hand fall away you have offered a great gift to my son perhaps only half your soul but you have also given of your love the goddess nodded as if to herself she continued i believe my son has earned his peace and his reward his choice to spare you and love you is a powerful thing in the eyes of the universe he should be free of the realm of the dead by right and fairness ericka swallowed hope welling up within her but she said nothing the goddess now had a faraway look in her eyes i will call for a council session her gaze met erickas again they may disagree nothing is certain you both may be saved or both condemned condemned ericka whispered if the council does not make this exception for aedan you could be forced to join him in the realm of the deadif you indeed choose freely to give him half of your soul belismas expression hardened again are you willing to take that risk as he was willing to send himself to the realm to spare you such a fate ericka hesitated and closed her eyes would she choose an eternity of being burned alive and never seeing her family or friends again would she risk all of that to save aedan the right and true answer came from deep within as she opened her eyes i will take that risk the goddess inclined her head wait in aedans quarters while the council makes its determination thank you ericka said just before her stomach dropped to her toes and the room spun she no longer stood on the marble floor her feet touched down on grass the dizziness vanished as she caught her balance and took in the chamber shed been sent to aedans room the sense of the surreal accompanied her as she explored the chamber a waterfall tumbled over stones in one corner of the room adding the clean scent of water to the smells of grass and moss covering the rock walls she stepped past the large bed carved from rock that had a mattress in it aedan sleeps here this is where he comes when he leaves me no where he slept before she couldnt even finish the thought only positive thoughts from here on out the council would rule in her and aedans favor she didnt know what would happen next but she wasnt going to give up hope ericka stopped in front of one of several pools around the room colorful fish glimmered in the watersome she was familiar with like angelfish and japanese koi but others she didnt remember seeing before at the rainforest café they had the coolest aquariums i dont believe it she tipped her head back to see a starfilled night sky above her aedans burning alive right now im in some strange otherworld and im thinking about fish ericka bit the inside of her cheek and glanced at the bed heart and soul heavy she moved to the bed and perched on the edge of a strawfilled mattress she stared at the wall across from her tracing cracks in the stone with her gaze shed made the right decision no doubt about it no matter what happened right chapter aedan had never known such pain existed he could barely choke back screams from the neverending sensation of his flesh burning away the demons had chained him to jagged volcanic rock the iron manacles seared his flesh he ground his teeth as boiling lava splashed his legs and blasts of flame singed his chest and face sweat immediately dried in the beyondterrifying heat screams shrieks and sobs echoed from every direction his gut twisted at the thought that he was responsible for so many of the people who now spent an eternity here mafia bosses and gang leaders murderers psychopaths rapists thievesthose he didnt regret as much as he did the innocents had he ever been given a choice to do anything but take souls no he was what he was created to be an incubus who served the gods choice never entered his mind he had never given a second thought to what happened to the souls once he retrieved themuntil ericka her name echoed in his mind and he tried to focus on her instead of the blistering pain the fall of her red hair against her pillow the intense blue of her eyes the perfect feel of her thighs around his hips but more than that was all he had witnessed when he studied her before he began visiting her each night her love for her family her dedication her tenacity her kindness her joy aedan couldnt help fighting against his searing bonds even though it did no good even the air he breathed burned his lungs as he kept his thoughts on ericka he had never understood why he had been sent to her until now it had been a test a test he had failed two demons appeared in front of aedan they unshackled him grabbed him under his arms and dragged him through great pools of lava he couldnt help a shout from the excruciating pain surprise shot through him as the demons took him to the entrance to the realm of the dead and tossed him out of the flames and into the cool tunnel his head struck rock and his mind spun but relief from no longer being in the realm was immediate the memory of the pain still caused him to feel like his skin was burning but it was slowly fading he stumbled as the demons took him under his arms again and forced him to his feet before prodding him to walk whatwhat is going on no one ever left the realm of the dead the demons ignored aedan and caught him when his legs gave out they pulled him through the passageway and into the hall of the lost that now seemed chilly he could barely focus as they dragged him along the cool marble floor his vision wavered and time lost meaning then the demons arrived at his chamber more shock prickled his skin when the demons pushed open the door and shoved him into his quarters aedan landed on his knees on the thick grass and rested his forehead in his palms trying to catch his breath as the demons slammed the door he breathed in the sweet scent of grass and water andvanilla aedan he jerked his head up ericka his mind could not process what he was seeingericka rushing across the chamber to him a hallucination he thought until she reached him dropped to her knees and flung her arms around him he almost toppled from the force of her throwing herself against him but he recovered enough to hold her tight oh god tears trickled down her cheeks and slid onto his chest or gods or goddesses whoever brought you to me erickas words shocked him to his senses and he grabbed her by her upper arms what are you doing here he growled as he stared at her beautiful face have they taken you what have they done im okay she caressed his cheek as her blue eyes met his i came for you no he gripped her arms so tight she winced and he immediately relaxed his hold you will return where you will be safe ii have something to tell you ericka cleared her throat then words spilled from her lips ive told your gods and goddesses that im giving you half of my soul and all my love half of your soul aedans whole body tensed he could not have heard right are you daft i realized you mean too much to me to let you go and i couldnt let you be sent there she hurried before he could say anything else your councilbelisma went to them to determine what will happen to both of us no i will not allow you to suffer in any way he shook his head you will go home belisma appeared like the crest of a wave she spun into aedans quarters with the grace and power of the rapids of a river aedan refused to release ericka to bow to the goddess rise aedan of the incubae belismas voice was surprisingly soft he eased to his feet holding ericka tight to him the council made its decision on your fate and erickas belisma said no expression revealing whatever emotions she might have because a mortal has offered half of her soul to you and because you have earned her unconditional love you are spared the fate of the realm of the dead she smiled and added you will return to erickas world and you will live as a mortal you may walk in the daylight take a wife and reproduce he can come back with me erickas voice was one of both disbelief and excitement it is so belismas gaze returned to meet aedans you will be given what papers and human things you need to live in the mortal world you will age and you will die and you will forget your life as an incubus or belisma continued you may go to annwn and continue to live as an immortal the choice is yours aedan had difficulty finding the right words as he looked at the beautiful woman still cradled against him if she will have me i would choose to live a mortals life with ericka what do you mean if id have you ericka turned and threw her arms around his neck i love you aedan ill have you any way i can get you she kissed him hard and hungry and he returned the kiss just as passionately so much so that his thoughts spun and he heard only the pounding of their hearts aedan jerked his eyes open and his head up when his feet no longer touched grass but smooth tile it took a moment for him to realize they were in erickas home he almost laughed when he saw glass tanks now lining one walltanks filled with water and his collections of fish when he looked at ericka she was grinning and his smile widened your eyes are brown now not gold ericka stroked his cheek theyre beautiful aedan had nearly forgotten belisma he turned to see if she had accompanied them but she hadnt even the everpresent veil was gone for a moment he felt lightheaded and stumbled forward ericka caught him by his shoulders her expression concerned whats wrong he looked at her and this time he did laugh i think im feelinghuman wow she murmured my own demon lover aedan settled his hands on her hips your human lover you mean her expression grew serious i love you aedan took her face in his hands and kissed her hard he separated his mouth from hers and whispered against her lips i love you ericka roberts for all of our years i love you equinox la banks chapter she opened her eyes listening to the other goddess murmurs in the moonlight it took a moment to adjust her thoughts and her understanding to the new era to the new languages being spoken to the new weapons available for her use she sat up slowly quietly as a deep sadness claimed her and then shuddered in horror as she became aware of all that had been done silent tears cascaded down her high regal cheekbones she tossed a thicket of dark brunette hair over her caramel shoulders and stood widelegged naked and majestic in a warriors stance her bow in a tight grip her quiver filled with deadly arrows she peered down into the still mountain pool that shimmered like glass i daughter of the nubian queen leto a titan revered in all of greece and begat by the greek god zeus stand i the twin and sister of apolloartemisand vow by my bow and arrows created by the great hephaestus and the cyclopes to avenge this injustice against the wilderness what have they done vancouver canada vincent djardin rubbed his palms down his face in weary agitation how the hell his commanding officer had found him at his favorite bar way out here made every muscle coil in his body with tension but thats what they did in their professionfind people who didnt want to be found still it wasnt right theyd said after the delta job in miami hed have some time off vincent locked gazes with major harcourt for a moment before returning his angry glare to his bourbon this was bullshit i know the major said sliding onto a barstool next to vincent and hailing the bartender for a beer thats why i came myself whats the job and for how long vincent didnt look at the man beside him just took a surly sip from his drink the major slid an arrow tip across the bar toward vincent i figured with your background you might be able to shed some light on this he sat back eyeing him youve heard about them im sure vincent let out an agitated breath hed been undercover in miami not under a rock who hadnt heard about the kooks who were abducting ceos of major mining and lumber firms without a trace and simply leaving dead stags shot up with bronze arrows from wall street to the amazon work sites had been disrupted and dead stags had been left everywhere it was a seriously vexing puzzlewho could get a twelvepoint stag into wall street office buildings past security cameras without a trace and then butcher it to his way of thinking that ruled out environmentalists they wouldnt sacrifice the animal had to be terrorists trying to leave some coded message but he took grave offense at the assumption that because the perpetrators worked with arrows as their calling card he should have some insider knowledge vincent stared at the unfamiliar shape that was a threedimensional cone that was designed to leave a gaping hole in the victim as well as briefly studied the strange etchings on the sides then took a slow sip of his bourbon considering how he would answer you run the markings by the foreign languages boys he asked looking at the arrowhead again but not touching it vincent glanced up into his cos impassive blue eyes or the guys that specialize in antiquitiesor did you think the owiqwidicciat would have some special native american insight through his maternal dna about freakin arrows he narrowed his glare on the major becoming more pissed off as he thought about it or maybe it would be because my father was french haitianperhaps i could check with a voodoo priest and get back to you major harcourt sighed and took a swig of beer to wet his dry throat gimme a break djardin and drop the chip on your shoulder while youre at it i know youre pissed off about us recalling you so soon for another job but it doesnt have anything to do with heritage youre the best man for the situation given where these artemis bastards are tracking he leaned in closer yeah we decoded it off the arrowheads and its ancient greekso weve got some mediterranean assassins go figure id rather not vincent said coolly assessing his co im on leave remember you promised me a month dismissing the comment harcourt pressed on you ever heard of this terrorist group djardin we cant figure out if theyre a splinter cell an individual cell a gang bandits just out for financial gain by kidnapping the wealthy or what but theyre cutting a swath through yukon country crossing international boundaries from the us to canada and back again using the wilderness as camouflage and headedwe thinktoward pipeline outposts up in alaska it hasnt been publicized yet for obvious reasons and we were able to cite the wall street incident as an isolated possibly organizedcrimerelated eventjust like we could clean up the other situations that happened on foreign soil keeping certain details out of the media and on a needtoknow basis however theyve abducted an oil baronthat got presidential attention now the powers that be who are much higher than you or i want this problem to go away very quickly and very quietly with a good group to pin it on no matter what terrorists did it thats the only reason i came to you we clear vincent looked at the major and clenched his jaw with a nod clear just as long as i dont have to cut my hair the major smiled and accepted vincents surly peace offering in good humor no you can leave the manewill probably help you blend in on the job up there anyway he took another swig of his beer and stared at the french barmaids with appreciation id be mad at me too you ornery sob but duty calls its not a mane theyre dreadlocks vincent corrected with a mutter but the majors attention was slow to return what else was there to say the man had always been fair and wasnt a bigot hed give him that but after living underground hustling through the damned everglades after drug dealers the last thing he felt like was a wilderness job his nerves were raw and the accusation leapt from disappointment not to mention oil fat cats mining and logging robber barons were the antithesis of victims to his minds eye they had been the enemy as far as he was concerned the things they did to the environment and their everpresent threat to it made him sick to his stomach as it was hed come home to help vote on the proposed water quality standards for neah bay for submission to the environmental protection agency but now he couldnt even do that and hed have to chuck his personal philosophies to get the job done what do you need in terms of resources vince the major finally looked at him the tension relaxing from his weathered bronze face as he put the arrow tip back in his pants pocket top squad bravo commandos vincent grumbled his gaze on his drink five men all his dreams of going back home to the makah nation where he grew up were evaporating as he sat his mood darkening by the second all he wanted was a few weeks to return to the olympic peninsula in washington statethe small town of neah bay was calling his nameso was home cooking and the beaches flanked with red cedar and pristine wildlife he wanted to find a place of solitude that the people who lived by the rocks and sea gulls had known for thousands of years before invasionto sit in the wilderness to stare across the straight of juan de fuca to vancouver island all hed wanted to do when he walked in this bar was to relax finally tie one on and get laidnow this and a brunette the major gave a start and then caught the joke and laughed he downed his beer and slapped vincent on the back you always get me djardin i can never tell when your surly ass is serious or not ill see you at oeighthundred in anchorage theres a black hawk waiting for you at the military hangars here he shook his head and ran his fingers through his close cut hair as he slapped down a twentydollar bill on the bar and stood to leave you kill me djardini swear vincent watched his co thread his way through the bar toward the exit who was joking he said polishing off his drink as he stood at least he didnt have to go through a bunch of crap with rookies the squad that assembled were familiar faces and slow smiles crept across each one as recognition was made lou short for lu chen everybody respected as a fighting machine despite his wiry compact size it was good to have him on the team and his explosives expertise was undeniable he offered vince a slow confident nod and vince nodded back feeling much improved as he quickly assessed the group dutch the crazy swede was six feet six inches of blond destroyer having a solid artillery man was a must good jermaine an insane brother from brooklyn who was an unparalleled communications whiz stood with sinewcut arms folded over his cinderblock chest attitude raw and cornrows glistening cool vincent laughed to himself as donovan walked up and gave him a cuban brotherhood embrace like him rodriguez could track anybody and find the wings of a fly in the middle of a hurricane if he had to theyd both survived miami jesse one of the best snipers in the unit stood back chewing on a toothpick his shock of red hair blowing from the force of the chopper blades as he pushed his lanky frame off the side of the craft howdy all he said with a wide grin and a distinctive midwest drawl good day for huntin aint it indeed it was chapter she spied them from the towering tree tops she and her nymphs blending into the thick canopy watching their eyes keened like hawks to each male form that walked through the wilderness these hunters carried weapons that no animal would stand a chance of survival against even their method of hunting was unbalanced unfair they made war against the innocenther forests if they came in search of their missing generals of destruction they would be trapped by their own folly those decimators of green places had been turned into stags as her great legends prophesizedhe who befouled artemiss wilderness would be transformed and then hunted to his death was the edict not clear had they forgotten over the eons the thought of such disrespect enraged her she only wished she could deliver to them the fate that had befallen actaeon whom shed turned into a stag and beset his own hounds upon seething artemis followed the men with soundless footsteps her nymphs taking strategic positions they had employed mercenary titans against her these men were of no mere mortal proportions their height and stature like her own was surely a titan blend if not of pure blood closely studying them she keened her eyes taking each in as she steadied her bow one had hair like a flame and loped as he strode another was thick and tall his hair like sunburned wheat another was clearly of nubian origin perhaps ethiopian she couldnt be sure one had hair as dark as egyptian onyx his frame smaller but his agile speed noteworthy another was hard to judgepersian asiatic the most magnificent one in the lead had a mane like a lionshe walked with a royal cats agility his aura almost stroking the trees with uncommon reverence as he passed them splinters of sunlight glinted off his tawny hue his eyes were intense that of a seasoned hunterhis shoulders broad and sure he was at least two hands higher than her and she stood as a goddess at six feet tall her bow lowered slightly but then she reset her stance she would not be tricked this was no immortal and certainly not one with reverence to her pristine lands yet their mission intrigued her and she almost laughed aloud were they so foolish as to be searching for the missing they already had them the dead stags that was the laughable thing she had no real interest in slaughtering soldiers who simply followed ordersshe had gotten to the generals who gave the orders once shed conquered them all no more orders would be given to harm the dear land however there was so much to learn strange customs strange palaces buildings with lights that rendered no flame odd lifts that carried people away in fastmoving boxes higher than the tallest trees shed ever witnessed chariots without horsesthrongs of pedestrians more dense than all of romes populace it seemed and underground dragons that roared so loudly they shook the ground all of this shed seen quickly in her mind as shed acclimated to the new timesome of it shed seen as shed dropped an errant stag in the high palaces but the roaring widetooth monsters that ate at land and trees had broken her heart she had to understand this assault against the beloved earth for it seemed to be everywhere even against the seas if there was one source to negotiate with one king of all these lands shed have his head otherwise it could take years of battle to bring it all to an end and she feared most deeply within her very being that time was running out for the wild its like theyre ghosts vincent said shaking his head as he stooped with donovan to study the ground there was a recent encampment here he added feeling the heat off the small charred remains of a campfire and hunting through the leaves to find where tents could have been pitched this is the only viable hiking path to the main pipeline outpost buildings and all roads leading to it have roadblocks checking ids reporting nothingno helicopter his words were cut off by the whoosh of an arrow that tore through his fatigue jacket at the bicep grazing his arm and then lodged deeply in the trunk of a tree the squad immediately fell back took cover behind trees and open fired in the direction of the arrow automatic weapon report rent the air flashes of bullets sprayed the terrain blasting away ground cover bark setting birds in flight the stench of spent ammunition eclipsing the fresh forest air completely appalled by the woodland destruction artemis gave a hand signal for her nymph warriors to wait the titans had harnessed the lightening of zeus how could they have these were strange titans indeed infuriated she dropped down from the top of a tree landing in a crouch in the center of the glen so startling the soldiers before her they began squeezing lightening from their weapons before she could speak but she was immortal her flips defied the bolts that took down trees and she heard one yelling the magnificent one shouting for the others to hold their fire winded she stood erect and leveled her bow at his forehead he had the expression of awe on his face that was sufficient enough to possibly spare his handsome life who dare penetrate my forests and defile them so she demanded six stunned pairs of male eyes looked at her are you deaf mute speak and you shall live who is your general for a moment no words came to vincents dry throat he had watched a woman back flip through deadaim ak gunfire miss m rounds and the shells from a glock nine millimeter pass through her all after dropping from a seventyfoothigh branch above but there she stood unmarkednot a scratch on her radiant caramel skin she didnt even have leaves or refuse from the tumbles in her thick velvety hair he locked gazes with her dark eyes witnessing how fury seemed to actually cause them to smolder in a hypnotic way rage and adrenaline made the bow she gripped slightly tremble and his line of vision ran the length of her athletic arm to capture her breathtaking face and full lush mouth six feet tall built like an amazon half naked except for a gossamer of sheer white silk everything male in him couldnt help but appreciate her firm round breasts or the way her flat waist cinched in only to give rise to a slim swell of hipsand man oh man the broad was all legs in a standoff he stared at her she at him even if she had guns behind her if she let the arrow gohed dodge it and shed be dog meat if not him one of his men would put her down single shot lou already had a grenade on standby pin in his teeth to lob behind her toward her soldiers what do you want with the hostages vincent said his tone even and controlled as he began to negotiate no demands have been made state your purpose who are we dealing with you are not in a position to question the great artemis she said through her teeth you are their leader im the one talking sis he said put down your weapon and we wont fire no one dares presume to tell me when to disarm without even blinking she let her arrow go then everything seemed to happen in slow motion vincent dodged the tip of the spiraling arrow lou pulled the pin on the grenade and lobbed it over the crazy chicks shoulder the blast felled several trees as more women rained to the forest floor the arrow that was destined for vince hit dutch dead in the chest knocking his shot that would have entered the female attackers forehead off center but instead of the huge swede dying he fell and began screaming as his clothes burned away and his body contorted the men beside him tried to quickly grab him to pull him to safety behind a tree but fell back in horror as he began to change into an animal running forward vince heard the panicladen shouts of his men but he was not about to let the terrorist suspect get away he couldnt understand what they were screamingsomething about a stag then all of a sudden as he neared her nine millimeter drawn something grabbed his feet and his world snapped upside down she slowed down as he bobbed from a vine and then smiled but he hadnt lost his grip on his weapon and he held it with both hands and fired at her dodging the wicked things that flung from his lightning rod like hornets she watched in amazement as he cursed steadied himself and did a situp then had enough upperbody strength to grab the vine extract a huge knife from his boot and cut himself down who the hell are you people he bellowed whirling around in a bulls rage admiration tried to thread itself through her but she fought it as she stepped out from behind a tall tree well done titan but your weapons are no match for immortals even if you did steal zeuss lightening rods he blinked as she sashayed forward and placed one graceful hand on her hip the fact that there was no more weapon report behind him but he could hear his men yelling made him take aim at the center of her forehead an eerie chill slid down his spine and he spoke through his teeth what do you people want where are the hostages and what the fuck are the terms she cocked her head to the side growing amused his fear was beginning to become palpable yet his courage was starting to awaken something else within that had been dormant for centuries she lifted her chin in an attempt to make the coiling flame in her belly recede we want peace we want your people to stop pillaging the forests to stop desecrating the land to stop poisoning the lakes and streams this demand is nonnegotiable the terms are simpledo what i ask or die the urge to pull the trigger was so great that his arm bounced from repressed emotion the hostageswhere are they stags she said calmly moving closer to him and studying his body from head to toe and you have them already stop playing games lady he fingered the trigger but was disturbed by her unusual almost otherworldly calm if you return them alive all you and your environmental terrorist organization face are kidnapping charges and federal property damage and if you tell us whos behind all of this you might even get close to a plea bargain but if you take this bull too far youre going down and might get the chair so dont liewhere i never lie she said taken aback by the charge see for yourself unafraid of his weapon she brushed past him still clutching her bow and walked into the glen where the firefight had erupted he stood there mouth agape watching his men bobbing upside down from vines that had ensnared them but the thing that paralyzed him was the sheer terror on their faces as they looked from each beautiful maiden to the huge blondcoat twelvepoint buck that snorted and pranced seeming bewildered and trapped between the women that had arrows trained on it something very crazy extremely implausible slithered through vince as he stared into the eyes of the trapped animalit had dutchs eyes but that was impossible wheres my soldier vince shouted beginning to panic too female laughter filled the glen he locked gazes with donovan who had tears sliding down his nosedonovan oh shit if he had broken this fast after dealing with all the madness theyd seen in miami and in south america what had the man witnessed jermaines eyes were closed and his mouth was moving as though he was praying lou and jesse wouldnt take their eyes off the buck and stared at it wideeyed upside down not blinking cut one of them down and show him where his soldier is the woman who was clearly the leader said jesse swung a punch that missed as a tall lithe maiden with flaxen hair approached him and nicked his cheek with an arrow tip instantly vince reached out and grabbed the leaders arm pressing the nine millimeter to her skull if he dies you die whatd you do poison him what kind she coolly regarded vince as his man began to convulse cut him down before he hurts himself hell be a magnificent creature like the other one im sure vinces vocal cords seized as he watched them carefully lie jesse down on the forest floor how his clothes began burning he didnt knowbut the way they burned was from a weird cobalt blue flame that didnt seem to harm his skin the other men were shouting and the huge trapped stag was rearing on his hind legs but vince could barely hold his gun as he watched a man slowly painfully change shape his bones snapping and body elongating as a wail ripped from his throat the sound of jesses skull cracking to bear antlers cut through the forest with a horrifying echo red hair from jesses head and beard turned into a thick coat that swallowed his skin and the sound of a whimper fled his lips when his nose became a snout as though growing out from his elbows and knees his limbs extended and fingers fused together vince backed away as he watched his squad sniper roll over and struggle to stand like a newborn fawn what the hell is this he whispered blinking hard and touching the place where an arrow had grazed him he knew there were all sorts of psychotropic drugs out there but hed never known of one that could produce an effect like this a red stag pranced hysterically in the clearing making the blond one become even more skittish vince looked around they were outnumbered three terrorists to one theyd all obviously been drugged somehowhis face was hot and he felt like he was moving forward against his own will can we keep these one of the terrorists asked her gaze pleading with the leader she walked up to the massive blond stag and tried to gentle the frightened creature oddly it bobbed its head stopped its agitated prancing and nuzzled her as she stroked it the halfnude women looked back at their commander please artemis she whispered i dont think they were with the others another joined the willowy brunette that had spoken pushing her long onyx braids over her shoulder hes magnificent she murmured going to the animal to lay her cheek against his neck hes not old like the generals yes a wheathaired captor said producing an apple from thin air and feeding it to the animal with a flat palm then three more female warriors moved forward slowly approached the other large stag attending to it gently and staring at their leader its been thousands of years artemis the tallest one among the women gathered beside the red stag said her voice strained and her expressive brown eyes seeming to beseech reason from their leader we all took the vow with youbutin this new era the things weve it does not matter what temptations youve seen or felt in this new era i care not you will all keep your vow as will ia vow that i made when i was three years old the beautiful warrior folded her arms over her ample breasts and glared at her warriors vince watched the one they called artemis straighten her back as the female expressions became crestfallen he blinked hard trying to get past the drugs they had obviously given him just so he could see straight something in his system was making him short of breath making him stagger forward had made his hand too heavy to hold a weapon he was weaving where he stood beginning to sweat it was as though heat radiated off the leader and even though it went against all of his training he stepped away from her to keep from passing out regardless during their standoff he was beginning to figure out their strange coded languageif it was a thousandyearold vow or so then it had to be a middle eastern group since that was the only reference point in his quickly fogging mind which had disputes that lasted that longgreek or thereabouts in the mediterranean was close enough maybe leaders of each cell were called artemis a fake name likely to denote who was in control of a specific engagement that was plausible his mind scrambled for a rational explanation as an eerie silence folded over the glen it was almost as though theyd become sealed away in a soundless envelope it had to be the drugs whatever was on the tip of the arrowsbut what they didnt know was that he and his men were the tip of the spear be strong maybe all this talk about the environment was bullshit and fearing reprisal the men behind some of the deadliest terrorist activity in the world had sent females out front to do their biddingthat would make sense given the way the us had been leaning on their resources theyd abducted millionaires and billionaires a ransom demand would have to come soonwho would waste such an opportunity dead stags his ass obviously it was some grudge that went back before anyone could remember and loyalists of the group were beginning to mutinynot having the stomach maybe to kill off a bunch of military for whatever environmental cause they had no but it wasnt an environmental cause vince shook his head trying to clear it feeling woozy and hating the calm smug expression on the one called artemiss face somewhere between them one of the members of the group had to have figured out they were in deep shit and perhaps wanted a way out but drugged outgunned outnumbered or not his mission was clear bring back the hostages alive if possible and find out the source of this terrorist cell to take it down you dont care about the environment he said slurring his words and trying to continue standing upright you blow up cars and innocent women and children so stop the charade and tell us how much money you want for the ceos are you mad barbarian she said with a gasp that cut through his skeleton on the verge of passing out he slapped his chest needing something to fracture the group something to cause dissention to buy them time searching for anything that would give him more information while the drugs wore off i am owiqwidicciat my mothers people are from the makah nationwhat gives you the right to invade my forest my trees destroy my land huh we walked here for thousands of years and you come with death and destruction talking about peace thats bull youre no different to me than the first wave of invaders the leader recoiled from his charges and suddenly he could breathe his mind felt clear and he straightened your forest she said as the women with her covered their hearts with their hands thats right lady you heard me my people are from the olympic peninsula as far north as you can go this is our country not yours discernable murmurs filtered through the trees you are from olympus pure shock entered the one called artemiss eyes damned straight i am she opened her mouth and closed it her eyes raking him for the truth your weaponsyou stole them from we stole nothing unlike you i stole nothing we took back what was ours by rights zeus gave them the thunder bolts and lightning rods one woman whispered i must know who sent you artemis demanded i want the same information so i guess that makes it a standoff i wanna know whos poaching on my land vincent walked away and touched a badly damaged tree with clear disgust how many years would it take to replace just one after all the wildfires he added shaking his head and looking at the blaze that had been started from the grenade he watched the female leader cover her heart with her hand briefly close her eyes and the blaze quieted vince rubbed his eyes with his fist cut my men down before they pass out tie em up if you have to but get em right side up hed said it just to see how far theyd go not expecting them to comply and he was shocked when she nodded and wrists got tied then vines got hacked his men fell into female arms and the stags reared he couldnt tell what was happening as the women gathered behind the two animals oh all right but you do not break your vow unless i break mine bring their belongings and weapons extract what we must know without harming them if possible their leader yelled and then she raised her bow withdrew two arrows from her quiver and threaded and released them both before vinces hand could rise with a gun her arrows found their marks and the great stags dropped to their knees come she ordered your men will befall no harm that is no longer the objective of my nymphs it seems the ones transformed will return to the human forms we should speak freely in my tent i have much to ask you about this new world titan chapter they hiked hard for what felt like close to an hour going further into heavily forested terrain until they reached a grouping of nearly inconspicuous tents the semicircle of crude dwellings surrounded a small charred plot of ground where a campfire had recently been vince kept his senses keened looking for signs of more terrorists looking for the males and each man exchanged a glance as they were separated off from one another and forced into a tent with several female captors oddly though he noted jesse and dutch still looked dazed if not drugged but he was counting on lou of any of them to be able to get away lou was so damned flexible and double jointed he could escape from almost anywhere like houdini he didnt need his hands free to kill you just had to get close enough then vince looked at the gun in his hand bizarre they hadnt bound him or stripped his weapon and although artemiss female soldiers had an indefinable but palpable sense of anticipation sweeping their group their leader trudged ahead of him unconcerned there was almost a weary resignation about her a sadness that worried him despite the fact that he was still armedand all the chick had on her was a bow and poisoned arrows after what hed seen so far hed come to the conclusion that that was enough it was all surreal but he was sure that he was drugged once he stepped inside the leaders tent firstly it took him a moment to orient himself to the size outside it seemed about the height and width of a small military pop but when he stepped inside it loomed frighteningly large as though hed walked into a fortybysixty palace chamber everything was draped in white satin and sheer gauze interspersed with finely woven moroccan rugs ornately decorated mediterranean urns and lama hides vince pushed the heel of his hand against his eyes to recapture reality wine or water artemis said on a weary exhale and then dropped her weapon against a white alpaca fleece by the far tent wall when he didnt answer she turned to stare at him if you are not thirsty barbarian then i offer grapesolives goat cheese bread surely by this point you do not think my goal is to poison you she ignored him as she briefly lifted her hair off her lovely neck and stretched and then helped herself to the bounty that graced her table she settled herself in one lithe move and continued her solitary meal unfazed i have many questions many things i do not understand that i must know if i am to be the protectress of the wilderness sit titan and talk genuinely or draw my wrathi grow weary of rage so let us find an accord she popped a grape into her mouth and cocked an eyebrow why do your people behave as they dodont they realize that if you hurt the beloved forest you will also starve he watched her eat and take a careful sip of dark mulberryhued wine and despite the incomprehensible circumstances found himself drawn to the stain it left on her mouth tentatively he approached her table and sat on an ornately carved wooden stool across from her as though reading his mind she handed him her challis and then poured wine into the empty one that he didnt remember being there earlier yes hed drink only what she drank and eat only what shed eaten breaking bread with the enemy to better understand but would not subject himself to be drugged or poisoned again my people used everything the bounty of the wilderness offered he said quietly taking a sip of wine and studying her eyes very carefully we wasted nothing never hunted more than we could use we respected the wilderness an eerie tingling began in his chest and fanned out to slowly consume his body as she stared at him then she nodded i believe you she said quietly my search of your soul agrees with your words continueworthy warrior know that in all my years of battle you are the only one i have allowed to enter my tent her bizarre statement was accompanied by a rosy flush on her high regal cheeks and she looked away as though somehow embarrassed he couldnt fathom why or what had happened and he glanced into his challis for answers albeit he knew his people worked with some pretty potent hallucinogens but whatever these chicks were plyingman he just wondered what shed spiked the arrow with because not only was he seeing strange things but he also had the irrational urge to tell this woman the truthnot that such a thing was allowed but if telling her beliefs from his people could give her something to identify with and maybe save a hostages life make her drop her guard then it was a tactic hed employ he searched her gorgeous face trying not to become hypnotized by the subtle beauty of her eyes or the strange innocence that seemed to hide just beneath the surface of her placid expression her sad philosophical tone washed through him reminiscent of the elders hed listened to as a boy on the reservation when theyd orally recite the history of lands lost and treaties broken you cant win this fight he murmured not meaning to allow his voice to drop the way it had at least not through these methods he watched tears rise and shimmer in her luminous dark eyes i know she whispered my nymphs do not yet understand that however i have seen the new weapons of this erathe suns that explode against the ground and burn all that is alive for eons nuclear bombs daisycutters napalm he said flatly for some reason wanting to reach across the table and hold her hands so badly his ached every fiber in him knew this tone of defeat hed heard it all his life spoken on the reservation spoken in french by his haitian father spoken by people whose history would be distorted by the conquerors the tears in her eyes fell yes she said nodding i am not the enemy then who is he asked quietly unable to forebear reaching across the table to clasp her hands he set his gun aside and stared at her but it was impossible to touch her satin hands and stare into her eyes at the same time without feeling her thread throughout his system you do not believe in the cause you fight do you she whispered you know they are wrong you know who desecrates the land he nodded but i cant let you execute them there are courts other wayslaws the words are hollow even to your own ears she said squeezing his hands your people heard those words and laws too and were betrayed by failed treaties he looked away but could not remain out of the gravitational pull of her dark irises except briefly who are you his voice came out as a hoarse broken whisper the tingle that began in his chest and spread throughout his body had become a dull ache centered in his groin i am artemis she said her gaze rambling over his face goddessand i have never in my existence wanted to break my vow so thoroughly therefore the true question that besets me is who are you titan of what hidden olympus do you herald i have never felt honor as pure as yours enter my ethereal body and lay siege to it he couldnt answer thatnot because his actual hometown was classified data which it was but simply because as she touched his jaw and allowed her fingers to gingerly explore his lips his voice failed you are definitely a goddess he finally managed and i wish the world was differentwished they understood your heartbreak and mine but they dont are you displaced too she asked leaning forward a being greater than mere mortal trapped by the disbelief of the era her question made him smile i am trapped by the disbelief of this era yes and therefore i guess displaced she sat back quickly and laid her hand over her heart gaping at him for a moment i felt the earth people in your aura i felt the reverence of the trees toward you as you passed themthe forest welcomes you and you understand ithonor it that is why i didnt her words trailed off as her gaze slid away that is why you are still standing her admission snapped him out of the haze he had to remember that she was an adversary was he crazy but damn shed turned him on you felt the trees too he asked unable to hold back the question they hold the spirits of the ancestors you know yes she closed her eyes and he almost leaned across the table to take her mouth but thought better of it i honor the wilderness its a part of me how i was raised artemis i you never looked at me like the others long ago she added her voice both sad and filled with wonder you saw me as a hunter an equal you didnt try to molest mewhy not because you had a bow and arrow a serious squad and obviously were evenly matched in a firefight but that wasnt why i came here anyway we came for the hostages he had to wrest his mind back to the mission she nodded her exotic eyes smoldering with something he didnt want to acknowledge your words again ring true you saw me as an equalnone of the others did before that is why they sealed their own fatesbut that was a very long and bitter time ago he stared at this beauty a black widow that could most assuredly take lives wondering how a gorgeous woman like this ended up as an assassin how many bodies if i ask you the same could you answer she said evenly no apology or defensiveness in her tone touché were both soldiers warriors she corrected to be a soldier is to take orders hence why i rarely execute soldiers they are only doing the bidding of those who control them a warrior however is under his or her own command he nodded but looked away for a moment wishing that the times were different and that he could be a warrior you may be conscripted into service by them but you still have the presence of a warrior she said quietly i did not mean to offend no offense taken you spoke the truth again his gaze searched her face there was something magnetic about her something almost supernatural like she claimed and you are definitely a goddess with a sound mind and decent heartyou know that no good end will come of this if you persist why dont you let the hostages go or tell me your demands for them give us a chance to work something out before you have blood on your hands and a murder rap you cant shake she sighed their bodies will return and they will not be dead in this era of disbelief nothing i do holds together for long the temples are now for tourists true believers are too few against the world gone awry with carnal distractions i just wanted them to feel the terror of being hunted for no purpose that will stay with them forever even as all else fades my goal was to humble that was all the melancholy tone of her voice the new shimmer of tears in her eyes and the way her fingers traced his open palms was mesmerizing relief also wafted through himshed promised not to kill the hostages progresseven though shed given him ridiculous wood what do you want in exchange for their release she looked away and he slowly closed his hand around hers almost swearing that he could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears when he did to break my vow it is no longer of use i have fought the good fight and now wish to take my place with the others as a distant memory he wanted to tell her not to commit suicide that she didnt have to become a distant memory but what promises for a good life beyond prison walls could he offer a free spirit like this would surely die behind bars once she turned over the hostages the authorities would hunt her down to the ends of the earth he could offer her no assurances he was in no position to cut a deal that was the stuff of lawyers he was just special forces a soldier and all of this was well outside his realm of expertise and comprehension but peoples lives were at stake so he had to set aside any personal concerns about this abductress break your vow with me artemis he said not even sure what her vow was trust me i the sound of one of his mens tortured moans made him stand and grab his weapon artemis was also on her feet in a flash but staring at the tent wall rather than down the barrel of a gun if any of my men are violated she covered her heart for a moment and grabbed her bow never that was not supposed to happen if it has then my own have betrayed and shamed me take me to them now he shouted all previous negotiations vanished as you wish she said unafraid and seeming to do so from some personal sense of integrity not from any threat he imposed running in tandem they followed the sound of the cries barging into a very small tent that expanded inside into a huge space with floors covered in white pelts and pillows artemis and vincent stood at the entrance and became very very still he opened his mouth and then closed it she tried to look away but couldnt artemis felt her face flame hot she did not believe her eyes never in her existence had humiliation singed her so completely there was no way to blame this on the barbarian he was bound deep shame made her simply give her bow over to the titan beside her the nymphs of her sacred grove had desecrated a body the reign of the goddesses was surely at an end if it had come to this the soldier with long onyx hair who had the likeness of a persian barbarian was lashed to a tent post with his hands over his head his body drawn flat against the floor pelts his legs were splayed each ankle bound by heavy silk cordshis manhood naked and rigid that is as much as one could see beyond the homage her most loyal nymphs paid to it she didnt need to investigate further knowing full well the extent of the socalled torture being delivered to her captives men so engrossed in their love play the nymphs never looked up and the captive never opened his eyes artemis thrust her bow at vince and turned away shoot them all she said her voice thick with emotion it is your right i would have done no less if three of your men ravished one of my maidens your soldier probably wants to die from this humiliation as well the room went still nymphs shrieked and scurried away from donovans body vincent looked at the bow in one hand the glock nine in the other confusion tore at him as he stared at artemiss back and then the plea on donovans face he frowned at his man for a momentthese chicks could claim they were raped in the capture would have dna evidence on his man and all of this bull could compromise a case and military careers shit lets uhlet this matter go under the banner of détente and not kill anybody theres been enough bloodshed and i dont think these ladies meant him too much harm while trying to extract vital information vince said returning artemiss bow without arrows what good was the partial weapon besides he needed to understand what freaky trap they were laying that was our only desire goddess one of the nymphs said covering her nudity with her hands as she knelt on the floor throughout the ages we have remained celibate in your honorbut we were instructed not to hurt them and to extract vital informationthat was our quest vince looked at donovan and tried not to crack a smile despite the compromising position the man could barely catch his breath and since donovan was still tied up it wasnt like he savaged themmaybe a lie detector test would save the man if the madness ever came out can i check on my other menjust to be sure theyre not uhmmm being molested and maybe let this one be untied so he can defend himself against further ravishment again all in the spirit of dètente he shot donovan a glance and his man silently acknowledged the look while trying to steady his breathing what is dètente spirit i dont know this word i have never heard of this entity artemis stared at vincent for a second and then looked away appearing horrified and flushed by what shed witnessed she wouldnt even dignify her nymphs entreaties it means relaxing the hostilities between warring nations i believe artemis nodded in dètente then release that prisoner and feed and clothe him she stormed out of the tent with her head held high and her back rigid cool forest air from the chilly spring slapped her cheeks and the sudden temperature drop was welcomed a troubling heat had unleashed itself between her thighsalong with a thawed river that dampened her hotly swollen valley she could barely take a step without a stab of need piercing her as though one of her arrows and her breasts suddenly felt heavy the very tips aching like bees had stung them when the barbarian stood next to her it seemed as though all the air had left the clearing even taking the smallest amount that remained in her lungs with it what was this magic he owned not sure where to begin and for the first time in her life feeling shaky she glanced at the semicircle of tents pointing toward one at random she sucked in a deep breath set her shoulders and forged ahead she didnt care that the barbarian found this amusing his customs were clearly very different from hers closing her eyes briefly she peeked in a tent and then dipped her head out before the large warrior beside her could enter she stopped him with both hands against his chest dont she said her voice a raw whisper ii dont know what has become of my followers she covered her mouth and then turned away allow me to inspect my men vincent insisted hoping that nothing crazy like a butchering would meet his eyes if they all went out like donovan fine but crazy people had a way of turning fun and games into something deadly still on guard he pulled back the flap a bit and peered in after a long pause he let the flap fall very slowly and straightened himself rolling his shoulders he needed to walk away for a minute to get his mind together and to shake off the hot shard of desire that had filled his shaft the image of what hed witnessed replayed itself a few times like a cd with a skip in it before he could get the visual out of his mind horrible wasnt it artemis said quietly touching his shoulders virgins since longer than i can remember and now it has come to this she looked up and swallowed hard i wish they would have never called me back here for a moment he just stared at her virgins they were all virgins what kinda insane environmental cult was this can i check on my remaining soldiers he asked forcing his voice to be rough forcing his mind to remain focused on the very real dangers these women presentedtrying to get the hardon to die down artemis nodded but didnt move he could tell that she was giving him permission to go look but that she didnt want to see any more for herself in a way he couldnt blame her and was glad that shed simply be staring at his back as he took a glimpse inside each tent it is bad is it not artemis asked as he slowly returned to her side he nodded mouth dry and kept his gaze on the horizon yeah that was all he could say before turning so that she couldnt see his arousal i have one more man to check artemis graciously nodded as he strode away peeped into the tent that held jesse captive and winced he quickly dropped the tent flap inhaled a deep breath through his nose and tried to do math in his head to regain focus on the mission the offense is grave artemis murmured when vince returned to stand before her yeah he said quietly so how do we resolve this my nymphs are in the wrong therefore by rights as has always been you may decide the punishmenteven though i am a goddess there are still laws all i want he said quietly is for the hostages to be returned unharmed and for me and my men to be able to walk out of here alive she frowned that you would doubt my word when i said they would be unharmed is troubling she turned away and headed toward her tent you also said they would be unmolested and they have been there was amusement in his tone as she stiffened and dipped inside her tent he put the safety back on his gun and watched her pour water from an urn into a basin to splash her face mind if i do the same he said calmly watching her from across the expanse yes i mean noyou are more than welcome to wash the stain of humiliation from your face i am not embarrassed he said in a low rumble its spring she dabbed her damp cheeks with a thick towel and then wound her hair up into a knot atop her head applying the wet side of the towel against the nape of her neck a deep rosy hue stained her cheeks and small beads of perspiration kissed her cleavage he couldnt help allowing his eyes to travel down her breasts and over her erect peaks knowing that if she felt anything near what he was feeling she was also wet against his better judgment he neared her and gently removed the towel from her hands dipping it in the cool basin water and then dabbing her collarbone with it what was the vow he murmured staring at her that i would remain a virgin always until the end of timeas would my nymphs her breathing had become shallow from his attention and it had the effect of stilting his too why he asked hoarsely to what end she licked her lips as they parted and the pink tip of her tongue darted out because rutting males are barbarians that pillage the wilderness she whispered but what about marriages to honorable men and then having children he asked stepping in closer you need us barbarians for that right then again he thought about the advances of technology and realized that that wasnt a given i dont understand what has happenedwhy this time when we were called it was so differentwhy they would break a vow held for so long her voice was an exhausted lament as she stared up at him unless they felt the decency in each of you that i felt i dont know he admitted finding it very hard to keep up any ruse with her or even to think of her as the enemy there was something completely disorienting about her the moment he stood physically close to her it also dredged the truth this magnetic pulse and he fought with himself not to ask but caved to the need to what is it about you that the moment im close like this i my aura she murmured in a near rasp her eyes now heavylidded and her breathing shallow ive never let any male being get this closeyou have one tooan aura field that isspectacular really he asked quietly his groin throbbing so hard that he could barely breathe your nymphs they have this toois that what seduced my men or were they drugged we dont use drugs only aphrodite doesit is their auras which is why we stay in the wilderness and away from humansnormally he didnt know if it was complete hocus pocus or what but the rational side of his brain was oozing out of his ears as she began to slightly pant her dewy skin made his fingertips burn to touch it but he didnt want to take liberties that could get anybody killed so he kept wetting the towel and slowly bringing it over the swell of her breasts and down her bare arms teasing her neck as they spoke in dètente i am not against marriage she gasped and i am the protectress of women in laborduring childbirth then why do you shun one of the most fundamental rites of springmating making love and becoming one from two he couldnt deny it he wanted this womanbad guy or not her answer was a quick gasp and a shudder as his thumbs finally grazed the swell of her breasts and he dropped the towel standing inches from her i cannot remember chapter a year of abstinence while undercover imploded in his groin as he took her mouth and summarily drowned in the sweetest kiss hed ever tasted he couldnt help it it was an involuntary reaction to stimuli too great to ignore her smooth hands fought with his jacket and stripped away the heavy outer layer and she pulled back her eyes glittering with pure fascination as her fingertips gently outlined the definition of his chest making him suck in air quickly between his teeth your bodies are so different from ours she murmured her gaze following her hands he didnt breathe for a moment as she explored then gasped as her fingertips left his abdomen and settled on his groin she drew away confused and concerned im sorry i hurt you i he stopped her apology with a kiss and sought her ear no it doesnt hurtbut aches like this he murmured and then kissed down her neck to spill the attention down her collarbone to bring a distended nipple between his lips through the sheer fabric she wore when she gasped and arched he gently thumbed the other nipple and then kissed her earlobe it hurts like that oh she whispered on a rush of breath sealing the space between them then it is normal for every place else to hurt too he gently cradled her face with both hands and kissed her forehead her eyelids the bridge of her nose and then softly swept her mouth yesyou tell me where it hurts and ill kiss it till it stops aching she closed her eyes and turned her face away especially there he murmured gently bringing her face back to his with a finger beneath her chin and then slowly taking her mouth he lifted her with care knowing he was wrong knowing he was out of order was so far off mission he couldnt get back on trackbut another more primal mission had taken priority at least for the moment right now there was only right now and the goddess draped in his arms clung to his neck with complete faith in her eyes when he deposited her on the bed amid the silk and pelts he studied her taking his time to pull his tshirt over head slowly cautiously removing his weapon unlacing his boots wondering if hed lost his mindbut her agonized stare wasnt something that could be feigned he unzipped his pants she licked her dry lips and slid off her sheath that was when he was sure it was safe if she knifed him in bedwellthat was a risk he was willing to take never in his life had he been so drawn to a woman so fast who was this beautiful and so very off limits thousands of years came to a central ache of need between her legs so strong that she almost cried out with no shame when he freed himself from his clothes definitely a titan his body was pure chiseled symmetry his mane a gorgeous rival to the most majestic of creatures on earth her hands throbbed to touch him the center of her palms burning her fingertips tingling unable to restrain herself she reached out and his burning body covered hers the sound that rushed from her came up from her diaphragm forced out of her by the sheer weight of him covering her she arched and writhed against him not exactly knowing what her body craved but sure that he owned it torturous kisses flowed over her shoulders and breasts his body heat receding like a hard tide pulling down her abdomen over the swell of her hips sweeping over her thighs opening them plundering the very sensitive ache that throbbed between them until her body spasmed with sobs limp gasping set adrift on her own sea she never knew a kiss or a gentle tip of a tongue could cause then release such a building floodwall of pain yet before she could summon her wits the hot tide of him flattened her and she clung to his back wrapping her legs around his waist holding on as he kissed her deeply making her taste her own salty sweet essence a strong hand flatpalmed the small of her back agonized eyes met hers his dark bronze skin was damp with a glistening sheen the scent of him was the very wilderness itself she breathed him in with tears of appreciation in her eyes as her fingers twined in his luscious textured hair he didnt speak but stared at her easing himself inside her by infinitesimal degrees holding her still by his weight and his firm grip that now captured her buttock his eyes making her trust him his grimace making her know how difficult his slow advance wasuntil she couldnt watch him any longer the painpleasure too great a beast to contain each brick of his defined abdomen pressed against hers his pelvis locked into her pelvic cradle his thick muscular thighs trembling holding backher hands swept down his spine trying to gain purchase on his sensual tight rise of haunches that were the source of his locomotion and power he had to let whatever he held back go she was going mad needed to hunt it needed to let it run wild and free and had to chase it with her body lunging her quick breaths must have told him that his breathing grew shallow as he lodged deeper within her a groan forced from them both in unison then he movedbeginning as a slow rolling motion that clenched every muscle in her body his long thick shaft a spear of pure pleasure each time it slid in and out of her the exquisite sensation made her need to run hard nearly gallop after what hed loosed but he held her firm refusing to let her go until she arched and begged him let me hunt you he let go of her hip kissed her hard threw back his head and ran tears stung her eyes as he thundered against her soft ground her nails digging into his shoulders her body lunging with his against his at times outpacing him and making him holler sweat slicked skin air scorched lungs muscles strained veins standing in necks they caught up to each other the capture complete total bedlama battle of flesh and searing bodies their mutual deaths coming in waves of convulsions blinding ecstasy and then they dropped twitching heaving in air sweat dripping off the bridge of his nose eyes shut tightly he slowly gathered her in his arms and rolled over so she could breathe she laid her cheek against his chest eyes shut listening to his heart thud gasping hair wet wild a massive spill across his chest and shoulders his warm caress up and down her back offered reassurance what had she done on the vernal equinox the power of this titans pull was so strong that she shuddered and yet she could feel panic rising within him as his haze of passion abated she also understood why he kissed the crown of her head this yes i know even though it wasnt supposed to happen it wassupernatural she felt his body relax im just a soldier artemis i have to eventually report backi have to tell the authorities somethinghave to take back the hostages she nodded shush i know at least wait until your heart stops beating so hard he smiled she could feel it against the crown of her head that might be hours from now he whispered that too she knew what are we gonna tell the major vince donovan glanced around the glen where theyd originally been ambushed as the men gathered into a tight huddle surrounded by beautiful nymphs we were drugged dutch said nervously glancing around but a mellow smile cascading across his face as the women from his tent waved coyly at him yeah uh the fight broke out here vincent whispered indicating with a nod a firefight ensued several grenades got lobbedwe were running got hit with arrows that had the hallucinogen couple of us were caught in the vinesuh then we staggered in that direction and found an encampment after freeing our own men more fire power got unleashed and the abductors fled we dropped from the effects of the drugbut the other side had already pulled backwe hit one or two but they dragged their own to safety but we got all the hostages that were stashed i dont know brother jermaine said nervously some of us left a lot of dna evidence back there ballistics wont match up unless we go back through and act it out lou said glancing around and wiping his palms down his face for bigwigs that important theyll raze the forest looking for a trail i know but what else can we say dutch said raking his finger through his hair they didnt kill nobody didnt ransom them like they could have jesse said glancing around the group and seriously made up for the inconvenience if you ask me thats the thing dude lou fussed under his breath nobodys gonna ask you what you think youd better get this story tight and right or all our asses are gonna spend a very long time in the brink damned straight vincent said he looked around we go back to the original glen anything we say were gonna do we do if we say we blew it upwe gotta blow it up if we say we sprayed an areawe gotta spray the area if his voice trailed off as he watched a goddess walk toward him artemis sauntered over to the group and the small circle of men opened to allow her in she touched vincents face with trembling fingers and then lifted up to take his mouth dont worry she whispered im a goddessit will all work out men will see what they need to the hostages will remember what they should and you will each be honored for your courage he couldnt take his eyes off hers wondering if this very insane woman really did have something supernatural about her he wanted to tell her he was going to miss her one very long afternoon with her wasnt enough but with his men standing there each with the same expression on their faces as they stared at their temporary captors he couldnt contact with her after this would have vast repercussions her sad gaze told him that she understood as she touched his face one last time goodbye gentle titanif you ever want to see me visit my temple in crete and call me by nameor simply go to your olympus and find a meadow beneath the crescent moonand whisper my name i will come to you there his ranks splintered the men in his squad walked over to the respective nymphs trying to get their names the method to contact them and all pandemonium broke loose artemis shook her head and smiled with a quiet chuckle vincent raked his fingers through his locks hoping all would be well then he watched sadly as artemis began running her long tresses sweeping her back and her nymphs waving goodbye somehow going into a tent to collect bound and gagged old men with tears running down their faces seemed completely anticlimactic but as the squad opened the tents they backed away in pure horror leaving the flaps flung up each tent was tiny the size it appeared on the outside what happened to the sumptuous love dens where were the bound and gagged hostages theyd been shown a buck was bound and gagged in each tent now the animals had congealed blood on their coats exactly where the original mortal injuries had been glassy dead animal eyes stared at vincent and his men the poor creatures had been dead so long that rigor mortis had set in and each animal was washboard stiff oh shitwe got played partner donovan whispered a cold sweat made vincents tshirt cling to him the twitching of one deer freaked everybody out what the fuck do we do now jermaine yelled beginning to walk in a circle then another deer twitched and still another until the fragile nervous systems around vince snapped frayed and popped and guns got drawn toward the carcasses no vince shouted not sure why dont screw with any more evidence leave it lets put our heads together we have to think through this pick up the trail we gotta his voice trailed off as a human cough riveted everyones attention to one of the tents a pudgy ceo lay naked shivering and bound by vines leaves stuffed in his mouth terrorstricken they watched each dead animal reanimate and then transform into a hostage jesse and dutch stared at each other voices choked we werent drugged jesse whispered it happened dutch wheezed grappling at his chest as though having a heart attack and then stumbled away and puked nervous glances passed around the squad gotta still be the crap thats in our systems lou said his voice quavering vincent looked at the tents and then out into the vast wilderness knowing yeah he said thats all it is epilogue artemis kept her word things worked out more than he could have imagined since the glen every man on the squad retired donovan got a boat as an unspoken and untold gesture of appreciation from the ceo he helped half carry to the rendezvous point he headed down to the caribbean and disappeared last anyone heard donovan regularly had three gorgeous outofthis world babes on his yacht jermaine went back to brooklyn and then moved to harlem to buy a brownstone in the upandcoming sectionthe squad quietly heard tell that some appreciation dollars fell off the table now jermaine is tracing his family genealogy after a nymph mentioned something about him being a deadringer for an ancient king jesse went to wyoming and somehow some cattle land got ceded to him mysteriously enough along with a hundred head of healthy beef hes a happy man who only takes a harmonica into the woods these days his hunting days are over dutch was traveling abroad last anyone heard and getting vip treatment wherever he goesno expense sparedall financed from a nice quiet swiss account lou moved to southern california joined greenpeace and became a new age guru some say that a nice investment portfolio that changed hands as a private thank you allows him to pursue his environmental platform with gusto major harcourt still knows something about the whole story wasnt right there were no hallucinogens found in anyones systems but all insisted on such bizarre occurrences that mind control or a new experimental substance that leaves no trace could be the culprit he is still searching for that drug or method of group hypnosis that day in the glen changed each and every manboth those who were captives and those who were hostages vincewellhe went back on home to neah bay on the olympic peninsula and is using his quiet unspoken gift from the appreciative wealthy to help build up the town and rebuild the traditions of his peoplepreserving especially the culture and the oral stories called by some legends and myths he

ranch house was small and rustic surrounded by empty corrals and a few scrawny cottonwoods the prairie stretched all the way to the foot of the mountains the countryside seemed almost desolate mile upon mile of nothing but sage chamisa and open sky it was exactly what she wanted can i do anything else for you miss the aging cowboy asked cat managed a smile ill be fine thanks then ill be headed back to taos turk and pilar will look after you right and proper he got back into his truck and drove away on the rutted track that passed for a road cat picked up her bags and walked to the porch the boards creaked under her feet the smell of cooking beans wafted out one of the windows she closed her eyes and let the tension drain from her shoulders it doesnt look like much heather had said but the place always seems to help me get my head on straight when i cant take la one minute longer just give it a chance give it a chance she didnt have anything to lose with a rueful shrug cat stepped through the door turk adjusted the buckle under the saddles fender and stepped back thatll do ya he said perfect fit and you dont have to worry about ol kelpie herehes the gentlest horse we got hes miss heathers favorite cat shifted in the saddle already anticipating the sore muscles to come seventeen years ago she would have given anything to be where she was now mounted on a handsome buckskin with the prospect of a long solitary ride ahead of her but she wasnt thirteen anymore if shed had any sense she would have admitted to turk that she hadnt been on a horse in well over a decade but she didnt want to admit weakness to any man even one as inoffensive as turk she wanted to be left alone even if it meant taking a few small risks god knew shed almost forgotten what it was like to take a chance on anything outside the courtroom like i told you mrs kirkland cat call me cat turk cleared his throat cat like i told you just stick close to the river gorge and you cant get lost kelpie knows his way home even in the dark he scratched his chin still think you ought to take someone along ill be back by nightfall cat pulled on the reins turning kelpie toward the barn door please tell pilar not to wait dinner for me turk touched one grizzled hand to the brim of his hat a faintly worried look on his leathery face cat pretended not to see she started out along the rutted road and then cut across the plain the sense of vastness shed felt when shed first arrived redoubled the sky was a landscape in itself she knew the rio grande gorge was nearby winding its way south from colorado until it became the broad brown river that bordered mexico and texas but there seemed to be hardly any other landmarks except for the sangre de cristo mountains rising sharply from the prairie like skyscrapers built of earth and stone for most of the day she let kelpie wander at will basking in the late summer sun that warmed her face and shoulders she stopped for lunch in the shade of an abandoned cabin listening to the wind rattling in the rabbitbrush while she ate her sandwich a hawk circled in the sky but aside from him she was completely alone she was glad a good dose of solitude even loneliness was just the cure for what ailed her no more of neals hypocritical lies no more strict and unvarying routines just a sense of freedom she hadnt felt since childhood by late afternoon she was ready to return to the ranch kelpie looking forward to his ration of hay broke into a trot as soon as she reined him south neither he nor cat noticed the prairie dog town until his hoof plunged down into an unexpected hole he staggered cat lurched in the saddle and grabbed at kelpies coarse mane immediately she knew the gelding was injured she dismounted and bent to study his near foreleg it didnt seem to be broken but kelpies limp told cat that his fetlock had suffered some damage he wouldnt be carrying a rider anytime soon the only thing cat could do was lead him home as slowly as possible and hope she didnt get lost in the dark night fell with surprising swiftness cat buttoned her coat against an unexpected chill kelpie snorted and bobbed his head im sorry boy she murmured i should have taken turks advice she paused to let kelpie rest it isnt his fault that ive had my fill of the male sex kelpie lifted his head ears pricked as if hed heard a sound that had escaped cats ears youll tell me i was stupid to trust him that i should have seen it coming all the signs were there she clenched her fists he used me and then when he got what he wanted kelpie stretched his neck and nickered cat cocked her head listening the earth vibrated under her feet a low rumble beat the air a blast of wind warmed by the heat of a dozen bodies swept over cat an instant before the horses leapt out of the darkness they were every color men had named buckskin and appaloosa chestnut and bay pinto and sorrel white and gray their eyes glittered with starlight their hooves flashed like dark jewels cats heart surged into her throat she clung to kelpies reins and closed her eyes the herd rushed on implacable parting at the last moment to flow around woman and horse in a swift and savage tide an incredible feeling claimed cats body her breath came in sharp bursts she flung back her head surrendering to sensation her legs buckled and she dropped to her knees dizzy and stunned are you well señorita the voice was soft but it carried through the darkness like a roll of thunder cat tried to stand but her legs refused to obey her commands hello she said using her courtroom voice whos there the man seemed to appear little by little as if the shadows gave him up with only the greatest reluctance cats first impression was of dark hair and broad shoulders a lithe and muscular figure that moved with the grace of the horses that had preceded him he wore the typical uniform of a working cowboy battered leather boots scuffed jeans longsleeved shirt sweatstained stetson the jeans fit him like a glove molding strong thighs and an imposing package cat shivered and looked up he wasnt particularly tall his face was a little too angular to be handsome but no one could have denied that it was striking the long thick hair that trailed from beneath his stetson was jetblack his lips were sensuous and slightly curved his nose a little arched his eyes oh his eyes they welcomed the moonlight like a lover pale they were though she couldnt make out the color they stripped cat naked and left her utterly defenseless señorita he said touching the brim of his hat how may i assist you cat grabbed kelpies stirrup and pulled herself to her feet half afraid she might fall without the gelding to support her the stranger spoke only the simplest of phrases and yet his faintly accented voice raised goosebumps on her skin its nothing she said thickly my horsehe stepped in a prairie dog hole im taking him back to the ranch indeed would that be the blue moon señorita his tone was mild and courteous but the steadiness of his gaze unnerved her she tried to calculate how much farther she and kelpie had to gohow far she was from any help at all shed never thought to bring her pepper spray shed fight of course but he was all whipcord muscle and supple strength she wouldnt last long what in hells wrong with you hed offered no threat whatsoever he wasnt armed he didnt even have a horse that she could see the blue moon yes she said theyll be waiting up for me he smiled as if he fully recognized the false bravado in her words i have no doubt he said he reached for kelpies head the gelding stood very still cat held her breath so querido the man stroked kelpies muzzle but his gaze remained on cat shall we see what ails you he knelt to examine the geldings leg murmuring in spanish all the while it is not so bad mi amigo a poultice a few weeks rest he rose slowly cat felt as though he were running his hands over her body i will guide you back to the ranch señorita he said thanks but that wont be necessary but you are traveling in the wrong direction he said those who wait for you will surely worry was he mocking her she drew up all her anger against men spilling into her chest ill be all right will you he moved closer it is not wise to travel alone even in a place like this he smelled she thought of sagebrush and horses and a unique completely masculine scent that threatened to overwhelm her senses he was dangerous but not in the way shed feared if youll point me in the right direction she said im sure i can make it the rest of the way his dark brows lifted and his nostrils flared cat began to feel hothot in the face in her belly in between her legs she could almost feel the pressure of those sensuous lips on hers the thrust of his tongue his hands slipping beneath her shirt to caress her nipples she swallowed hard thank you but no i prefer to travel alone for a moment his pale eyes flashed with something that might have been anger then he touched the brim of his hat again and gave a slight ironic bow as you wish he leaned toward kelpies ear and whispered words cat couldnt hear kelpie nickered and nibbled at the strangers sleeve as he withdrew adiós he said fading into the night the same way he had come we shall meet again señorita the silence was absolute even the wind had stilled cat pressed her hand to her chest trying to quiet her racing heart remembering the mans advice she turned kelpie around and started in the opposite direction two hours later she saw the lights of the ranch house turk ran out to meet her miss cat are you all right im fine its kelpie whos hurt immediately turk lifted the geldings leg dont look too bad he glanced up at cat ill take care of kelpie youd better get yourself into the house pilars worried sick over you cat gladly obeyed her mouth was dry as a desert and she felt more than a little weak at the knees the housekeeper greeted her with relief and goodnatured scolding which cat accepted as her just due she drank the cocoa pilar set down in front of her and meekly retreated to the guest room no bed no matter how luxurious had ever looked so welcome cat stripped out of her dusty clothes threw them across a chair and climbed naked between the sheets the plain cotton felt incredibly soft against her skin every movement awakened strong sensations as if her nerves had been lit on fire her imagination conjured up vivid images of the stranger spawning pictures of sleek muscle and a strong angular face a face that looked at her out of the darkness eyes burning with unreserved lust cat tried to close her eyes fighting the images and the reaction of her body finally exhaustion claimed her and she slid gratefully into sleep she had never seen men like these before they came boldly into the village sitting on great beasts with long necks and sweeping tails the metal on their heads and chests gleaming in the sun they smiled as they leaped from the backs of their mounts speaking a tongue she had never heard the village headman welcomed them with courtesy and care for he too had no knowledge of this tribe of paleskinned warriors with their sharpedged weapons it was best to be safe until more was known about them for her it was enough to know that a new excitement had come to the village she watched the men with fascination as they removed the leather chairs from the great beasts backs and brushed the creatures coats until they gleamed she stared in fascination as they shed their heavy clothing to reveal skin that surely had never been touched by the sun she spied on the elders as they spoke with the strangers and always her gaze was drawn to one among the foreign warriors he was tall compared to the villagers though his hair was as black as that of the people the shape of his face was different but she found it handsome in its own way his eyes drew her most for they were the color of the first light of dawn one day he caught her watching him though she had done her best not to let him see he spoke to her in his strangers tongue gently and with admiration in those pale eyes sometimes his companions seemed crude and loud but he was not she began to teach him the peoples language he was a swift learner and at last he began to speak the words she had longed to hear too soon it was time for him and his companions to leave the village to rejoin their tribe she could not wait for him to return and for the marriage to take place when he asked her to come with him into the forest she went eagerly knowing that what they were about to do would change her life forever cat woke to the glory of an orgasm at first she wasnt sure exactly what she was feeling shed almost forgotten what it was like neal hadnt bothered to satisfy her in years but she felt between her thighs and her fingers came away wet panic sent her heart into overdrive she sprang up and stood in the center of the room searching every corner he wasnt there how could he be he had been a dream in a time and place that had seemed alien and yet utterly familiar a dream who had walked out of the shadows and into reality cat sank into the chair and began to laugh there was no reason for the levity except that she felt more than a little loco and laughter seemed the best medicine for her ailment señora pilar was knocking on the door undoubtedly alarmed by the racket cat put on her thick chenille robe and opened the door im sorry to have disturbed you she said im all right i just had a crazy dream the older womans brown eyes were skeptical you should rest today señora catalina i will make you a good breakfast im not very hungry ill take a little fruit if you have any si pilar continued to regard cat in a way that made her feel like a naughty little girl you say nothing happened to you last night nothing nothing that really mattered anyway i think ill go for another ride this morning pilar sighed and walked back toward the kitchen cat showered dressed in jeans and denim shirt and grabbed a slice of melon and an apple on her way out the door turk wasnt in the stables cat leaned on the corral fence wondering if she ought to try saddling one of the horses herself shed done it a few times when shed gone to riding camp as a teenager but that had been a lifetime ago as she kicked at the dirt and debated her course of action she looked up and saw the black horse heand she had no doubt that it was indeed a hestood outside the fence on the opposite side of the corral unburdened by either saddle or bridle his coat was a true black not burned brown like so many dark horses his mane was a luxurious ebon wave that fell almost to the bottom of his neck and his tail was held high as a flag a white star in the shape of a cross blazed his face cat shivered remembering how a horse exactly like this one had haunted her childhood dreams he had been so far away then impossible to catch now he stood no more than twenty yards distant and his eyeshis strangely pale eyesgazed at her with uncanny intensity she never knew why she did what she did then without a moments thought she circled the corral and approached the horse walking slowly and carefully she still had the apple in her jacket pocket her fingers closed around the smooth polished surface and pulled it out the stallion watched her come with elegant ears swiveled forward and nostrils flared he arched his neck and shifted from foot to foot as if to display his strength and elegance cat felt no fear at all she offered the apple in her extended hand he took it with remarkable gentleness his lips sliding across her fingertips youre a beautiful boy she said patting his silky neck where did you come from the stallion finished the apple watching her all the while he made a low coaxing sound deep in his throat you must be valuable she said maybe i should go ask turk who the stallion reared ears flat cat stepped back suddenly aware of his sharp hooves and sheer size it was almost as if hed understood her okay she murmured im not going anywhere the stallion danced tossing his head and eying cat with suspicion after a moment he approached her again stretching his neck and nibbling her shoulder i sure wish i knew what was going on in that head of yours she said are you hungry i can bring some oats he snorted with contemptuous eloquence his blue eyes seemed virtually human the pupil more round than oblong cat was eerily convinced that he really did understand every word she said what do you want she asked softly how can i help you drawing back his head the stallion dropped to his knees there was nothing in the least humble in his posture he nickered an invitation surely his odd behavior couldnt mean what it seemed to mean cat moved to his side and laid her hand on his back he rumbled approvingly you want me to ride you he nodded there was no other word for his reaction cautiously cat leaned across him enchanted by the muscular curve of his withers and hindquarters he remained quiet cat swung her leg over his back looking toward the house to make sure no one was watching the instant she was settled the stallion surged to his feet cat grabbed for his mane as he wheeled about and began to run the horse was kidnapping her and she had absolutely no way to stop him for several minutes all she could do was hang on the air was crip and cool the sun was just beginning to peek above the mountains to the east the stallion galloped straight north his tail streaming behind him cat caught her breath the stallions gait was so smooth that she felt in not the slightest danger of falling off even though she had no reins stirrups or handy saddle horn her initial concern had passed in fact she felt an undeniable exhilaration at the feel of her mounts muscles flexing between her thighs the snap of her hair the sense of flying over the earth this was true freedom this was what shed been seeking ever since those dreams fifteen years ago she flung back her head and laughed aloud the stallion twitched his ears to listen and stretched his legs in an even faster pace miles passed in a blur cat hardly noticed when the stallion slowed his coat gleamed with sweat but his neck was still arched and his sheer magnificence claimed obeisance from every creature that shared his world a small grove of cottonwoods crouched over an unexpected green jewel nestled in the brown setting of the plain cat thought gratefully of water even if it wasnt sterilized and out of a tap another dozen yards revealed a tiny pool and the bubbling of a spring a pair of pronghorn antelope sprang away from the bank white rumps flashing the stallion ignored them and paced to the waters edge he twisted his head back to look at cat his message was clear enough cat slid from his back staggered a little as she got her land legs again and sat down under the shade of a cottonwood the stallion dipped his muzzle into the pool and drank i cant just keep calling you the stallion you know cat said youre black as a storm cloud let me see if i can remember she snapped her fingers ive got it what about trueno thats thunder nice and succinct trueno bobbed his head cat chuckled and stretched out on the green grass it was well into midmorning and not by any means hot but cat keenly felt the confinement of her clothing she removed her jacket and scarf undid the top several buttons of her shirt and kicked off her boots she should have been thinking about where she was and how shed get back to the ranch she should have asked herself a few more questions about why the stallion had behaved as he had why shed climbed onto his back with a complete lack of the most basic common sense but she didnt she closed her eyes blissfully relaxed and dozed while trueno grazed nearby once or twice she woke noted vaguely that the sun had moved again and sank back into sleep the forest closed in around them a perfect bower for secret lovers firm lips pressed against hers demanding entrance she opened her mouth in a cry of surprise and a warm insistent tongue thrust into her mouth hungry and caressing she felt calloused fingers inside her blouse circling her nipples she gloried in the heat of a hard lean body stretched out beside her wetness pooled between her legs sí my beautiful one he said running his tongue over her lips with long lean fingers he pushed her blouse above her breasts muy linda he murmured she gasped as he bent and took her nipple in his mouth dark unruly hair brushed against her face and shoulders she whimpered while he suckled her licking and kissing and grazing her breasts with his teeth she was so close so close to something wonderful somehow she knew that if she opened her eyes the pleasure would stop if she dared to question even for a moment it would all go away cat opened her eyes the sky was dark and studded with stars the branches of the cottonwood shivered overhead and she remembered the man didnt resist as she pushed him away in one fluid motion he detached himself and settled into a crouch pale eyes catching moonlight oh god shed seen him before he was the cowboy shed met last night and he had beendoing things to her while she slept and in her dreams with trembling fingers she buttoned her shirt her nipples were wet from his kisses her mouth throbbed she nearly groaned with the intensity of her arousal she stared at the strangers lips and slowly raised her eyes to his señorita he said his voice husky and low cat scooted away i warn you i can fight if you try anything he shook his head oh no señorita i will not do anything you do not wish me to do his long hair drifted across his face softening the angles of his cheekbones and jaw cats heart was beating hard enough to be heard in california she had been lying there doing nothing believing it was all another dream but he was real and shed wanted him to keep on doing what he was doing both in the dream and in reality she still did where is my horse she demanded her voice cracking he stood up her eyes were level with his hips there was no mistaking his impressive erection dont worry querida he is here cat glanced around if the stallion were more than a few feet away she wouldnt be able to see his black coat in the darkness who are you cat demanded what are you doing here he tilted his head she saw that he wore the same shirt as he had last night but it was unbuttoned almost to his waist sleek black hair dusted his chest his pecs were beautifully developed his stomach ridged with muscle my name he said is andrés and you are catalina the sound of her name on his tongue left her shaken god he was beautiful all she had to do was hold out her arms and he would take her just like that a stranger she wanted with every fiber of her being not a stranger her heart insisted you know him you know him you arent afraid he said you will never be afraid of me i she swallowed im going to find my horse and leave it would be far wiser for you to remain here until sunrise he was right damn him she couldnt risk letting trueno hurt himself as kelpie had presuming she could get the stallion to come to her in the first place andrés dropped back into a crouch his arms draped over his knees you will suffer no harm from me señorita he said or is it señora cat couldnt quite believe that he was asking her such questions after what hed been doing thats none of your business she snapped his smile was devastating you are no virgin catalina your response wasmost satisfactory satisfactory cat suppressed a moan youyou dont know anything about me i know that you deny your own passions mi gatita i dont deny anyth cat stopped stung with outrage gatitakittenwas what her grandmother had called her when she was a child andrés whoeverhewas had no right to use that nickname no right i dont generally welcome the advances of total strangers she said and if i were not a stranger his question compelled her to relive the dream in all its astonishing detail why did it seem almost like a memory why was part of her so convinced that she had lain in andréss arms in another life cat dug her fingers into the bark of the tree trunk this was ridiculous the dream didnt mean a thing except that her fantasy life had become a little too vivid vivid enough to make her lose her hardwon control here she was holding a normal conversation with a stranger who was clearly crazy and possibly dangerous except he hadnt hurt her hed backed off when she told him to for all her legal expertise she couldnt define the man who crouched before her the best thing you can do now is be completely objective treat him as a hostile witness why did you follow me she asked follow you señorita but i did not are you saying youve been here all along no how did you get here on my own feet hostile indeed where do you live i call no place home no horse no home apparently no vehicle or significant belongings but if he were truly an indigent hed probably be in much worse shape than he was no one could claim he was anything but hardy healthy and unmistakably virile he could still be certifiably insane and whats so sane about the way you felt when he touched you catalina oroarke she folded her arms tightly across her chest shed slept through most of the afternoon and a good portion of the night and yet her legs were growing heavy and her thoughts were sluggish she was very much afraid that shed begin to ramble if she tried to keep the conversation going much longer you are tired andrés said sleep gatita no harm will come to you laughter bubbled out of her throat before she could stop it i think ill stay awake thank you very much andrés stretched out where he was and made himself comfortable resting on his elbow you were not always so frightened he said cat straightened what the hell does that mean you are from la ciudad are you not im from los angeles what of it i have heard that your great cities have no soul that those who live in them have forgotten the look of the sky and the feel of the earth thats crazy careful havent you been to a city before sí long ago in another place his gaze turned inward remembering i had no love for them even then it is why i came to this continent youre not from mexico his eyes cleared did your own people not come from méjico my grandmother was born there she journeyed alone to the united states when she was sixteen was it she who named you catalina was her name ah he plucked a blade of dry fringed grass from a clump near his shoulder do you know its meaning he twirled the grass between his fingers pure innocent when did you lose your innocence mi gatita what is the name of the man who hurt you no one hurt me your eyes betray you querida was he your esposo the subject is private he got to his feet with that same feral grace and approached her hands loose at his sides he was not the man for you he mistreated you he gave you no pleasure cat blinked startled to realize that she was on the brink of tears he didntit had nothing to do with you would blame yourself he stopped with the tips of his boots touching hers such gentleness in his expression that she could hardly bear it no i should never havei thought i knew what i wanted and still you do not know he lifted his hand his fingers lightly touching her cheek i could teach you her mind told her to jerk away but her body held her captive to his caresses i came hereto be alone so alone he leaned into her lips parted his body pressed her thighs and hip and breast his mouth closed over hers tongue seeking cat plunged into a maelstrom of desire she returned the kiss panting with excitement she had no defense when he seized both of her wrists and pulled them up above her head trapping them against the cottonwoods trunk he held her easily with one hand while his other stroked her face trailed over her breasts and paused to unfasten the button of her jeans the rational part of cats brain knew how simple it would be for him to complete what hed begun while she slept how easy it would be to give in you want it you want it more than youve ever wanted anything in your life his fingers slipped under her panties teasing hot and swollen flesh so wet he murmured into her ear so ready for me ii dont he traced her lips with his tongue while his fingers circled you do he said tell me gatita tell me what you want she tried to answer but he didnt wait he withdrew his hand and began to push her jeans down her thighs working her panties off as he cupped her bottom he released her hands and held her with the weight of his body while he unzipped his jeans the heat of his cock caressed her inner thigh eased over slick flesh thrust aggressively against her damp curls sanity returned like a blast of icy wind panic gave cat strength she didnt know she had a sharp shove was enough to throw andrés off balance cat stumbled away from the cottonwood and stopped frozen by emotions that demanded more of her than she could ever give andrés turned to face her his expression unreadable slowly he bent and picked up her jeans he tossed them toward her and she caught them reflexively i see that the time is not yet right he said but it will come catalina it will come without another word he walked into the darkness cat pulled on her jeans fingers numb and trembling she could think of nothing but getting far away from this place even if she had to walk all the way back to the ranch it wasnt fear of andrés that drove her it was fear of herself with only the vaguest idea of direction she began to run her ears straining for sounds of pursuit andrés didnt follow after ten minutes cats legs were aching and her lungs burned for air she slowed to a jog and then a fast walk the vast sky had paled to sapphire the stars flickering out one by one she estimated that shed gone about two miles when trueno reappeared he trotted up alongside her neck arched and hooves dancing as if he had nothing for which to be ashamed cat stopped chilled by the sweat cooling on her body where have you been she asked more weary than angry you couldnt have picked a worse time to disappear trueno gazed at her without the slightest hint of shame cat laughed of course not youre only an animal i was the stupid one the stallion shook his head with broad movements of his neck and shoulders yes stupid i guess ive learned my lesson she began walking again already contemplating what turk and pilar would say when she finally appeared at the ranch windblown and limping from a bootful of blisters trueno slowed his walk to keep pace with her occasionally lipping her collar or nickering in her ear she pushed his head away someone must be missing you she said go home horse he cut in front of her pivoted around and butted her in the chest sorry id rather walk this time trueno fell back pawing at her dusty footprints she thought hed finally gone and an immense weight of sadness collected in the space beneath her ribs but then the soft clop of his hooves resumed and she found a little extra energy to keep walking she spotted the dark band of exposed basalt that marked the deep gorge of the rio grande and set her course beside it turk and another cowboy met her around midmorning the old hand dismounted and hurried toward her his face long with concern miss cat are you all right her skin went hot im fine she shoved her hands in her pockets have you been looking for me just about all night he tipped his hat back on his head and subjected her to a thorough examination she was almost certain that he knew exactly what shed been doinghow close shed come to making a very bad mistake im really sorry she said staring at the toes of her boots it was very foolish of me to ride a horse i knew nothing about turk frowned what horse she turned around trueno was gone its a long story she said i promise i wont let anything like this happen again even turks unfailing courtesy couldnt quite conceal his skepticism youll ride with me miss cat he addressed the other cowboy thanks for the help john ill take it from here the cowboy waved and rode off turk held out his hand pulling cat up behind him pilar met them at the house tightlipped with concern cat found it impossible to meet the older womans gaze she retreated to her room still trying to make sense of the nonsensical it was almost as if her mysterious encounters with andrés were about much more than just sex shed never before been in the least bit tempted to make love with a complete stranger she couldnt dismiss the idea that her uncharacteristically wanton behavior had some rational basis dreams arent rational theres no excuse for you catalina oroarke night was slow in coming cat tossed and turned imagining she felt invisible hands stroking her body she got up threw on her robe and went to the kitchen for a glass of milk someone scratched on the front door cat nearly dropped her glass she set it down on the kitchen table crept to the door and checked the lock who is it there was no answer just your imagination but she was struck by the uncanny certainty that someone was waiting outside waiting for her andrés fear and anticipation held her paralyzed for a dozen heartbeats she unlocked the door holding her arm firm against the shaking of her fingers the porch was empty cat flipped on the light a small cloaked figure stood several yards away dark eyes deeply set in a nutbrown face cat released her breath buenos noches she said can i help you the woman only stared cat stepped onto the porch pulling her robe close around her throat necesitas ayuda gnarled fingers shaped the sign of the cross bruja the old woman whispered witch cat remembered the word from the childhood stories abuelita had so delighted in telling her i dont understand she said cuidado conel caballo oscuro qué ha venido a jugar contigo the woman backed away clutching the crucifix about her neck cuidado cuidado wait what is it catalina pilar stood in the doorway behind her peering sleepily over cats shoulder who were you talking to cat drew pilar back inside the house an old woman she said ive never seen her before she came out of nowhere gave some kind of warning and then disappeared what did she say i didnt understand all of it first she called me a witch and then she said something about a horse at least i think she did cat repeated the words the old woman had spoken beware the dark horse pilar translated he has come to deceive you all the warmth drained from cats body the dark horse whatwhat do you think she meant pilar sat down at the table i have heard stories about a black horse that wanders the meseta a great stallion who has never been caught some say he is a ghost others a demon she shook her head i myself have never seen the beast but there is always talk especially among the old why would the old woman come to warn me i dont know pilar met cats gaze this means nothing to you nothing at all imay have seen this horse ah then perhaps you should heed the old womans warning you dont really believe its a ghost or a demon no but it does no harm to be careful pilar returned to her room preoccupied with her own musings cat made another attempt to sleep halfformed images of black horses and paleeyed strangers flickered in and out of her consciousness they seemed to blend together hurling her into a dark space suspended between vision and nightmare the day of his return was the happiest in her life his face was darker than she remembered carved with deeper lines of sorrow yet the joy came back into his eyes when he saw her he shed his heavy armor and tightfitting clothing putting on the proper garments of the people the marriage was arranged as quickly as possible taking into account the most auspicious days and the advice of the tonalpouhqui the headman and elders were convinced that andrés brought good luck with him they provided him with a house to which she went when the ceremonies were complete they lay together on the reed mat and once again she knew the ecstasy of his touch the shout sent cat bolting from her bed scattering pillows across the polished hardwood floor several moments passed before she realized that the noise had come from her own throat the dreams were getting stronger cat didnt know how to stop them she was beginning to believe they were something more than dreams but what did they mean what was that alien world where andrés wore armor and rode a horse and who was the girl who am i anxious to banish the alien memories cat plunged into the shower and stood under the spray until the hot water was gone then she dressed snatched a piece of freshly baked bread from the kitchen and looked desperately for a distraction it was turk who provided one morning miss cat he said looking up from the tack he was mending dont know if it would interest you but theres a music festival going on in taos this weekend mostly local stufffolk and something called world music youre welcome to take the dakota into town for a couple days cat closed her eyes bless you turk she went back into the house throwing a few pairs of shirts and jeans into her duffel after a brief exchange with pilarduring which neither one of them mentioned last nights peculiar visitationcat settled behind the wheel of the dakota and drove south on the dirt road leading to state route sixtyfour taos was a colorful village vivid with hispanic and native american influence a little rustic in spite of the thriving arts community that revealed itself in numerous studios and gift shops around the plaza the majority of the buildings were adobe or mockadobe painted in tones of terracotta turquoise and gold hollyhocks and blanket flowers graced neatly fenced gardens the narrow streets were busier than usual clogged with outoftowners arriving for the music festival cat found a room in a modest motel at the southern edge of town tossed her duffel on the bed and headed out to explore though cat had spent most of her life in the dynamic world of urban los angeles she found taos no less stimulating the locals were easygoing and sometimes eccentric reminding her of people shed met in berkeley and san francisco the mood was both peaceful and inspiring she felt remarkably free as she rambled about the town stopping as the mood struck her listening to a mariachi band in kit carson park and finnish folk music at an eclectic coffee house she had a sandwich and iced tea for lunch browsed shops on the plaza for several hours and then decided to have a drink at a bar off paseo del pueblo she found music there as well a young longhaired man perched on a stool in the corner and played melancholy airs on a native american flute cat claimed an empty bar stool and sat feeling in great good charity with the world though she seldom enjoyed beer she tried a pale ale from a local microbrewery and found it quite congenial shed just started on the second glass when the young flautist stepped down and another musician took his place she didnt pay much attention until she heard the first golden strains of the guitar beginning a melody rich with the distant and exotic sounds of another age the voice that accompanied the music sang in liquid spanish a voice she recognized even before she turned to see the man who owned it even from his corner andrés dominated the room he sat with one knee drawn up cradling the guitar like a lover while his fingers danced over the strings he sang with such intensity and sorrow that every eye in the room was drawn to him yet he never glanced up from his intricate finger work the melody curled around cat like a silken rope binding her limbs and her loins and her heart do you understand the song she started turning toward the bar the bartender a man of middle years and a slight spanish accent leaned on the scarred wood and nodded toward the singer it is a very old song he said the words he sings are from an ancient form of spanishone only scholars would know today really cat said feeling stupid and confused is he a scholar he doesnt look like one does he but looks can deceive he smiled i was a teacher myself once shall i translate please the bartender began to recite i dont know how i can reveal to you the ardent fire that burns me to the bone and i cant see any time or place alas im burning in the fire without any comfort cat shivered she could almost imagine that andrés was singing directly to her but surely he hadnt even noticed her surely the fact that they were together in this bar was the sheerest coincidence andrés looked up his gaze met hers do you know him the bartender asked no she heard her own trepidation and deliberately turned her back on andrés do you ive never seen him here before would you like me to ask around no no thats all right thanks she placed several small bills on the bar and headed for the door wherere you going so fast beautiful the man at the table caught cats arm and held on stopping her in her tracks he was blond muscular and handsome plenty of women would have been flattered by his attention cat wasnt excuse me she said shaking him off hey no need to be so unfriendly he gave her a dazzling grin and patted the chair beside him have a seat ill get you whatever you want sorry ive gotthings to do it cant be all that urgent come on he grabbed the hem of her jacket and tugged she lost her balance and banged her hip on the table the blond looped his arm around her waist and pulled her against him cat could smell the alcohol on his breath id advise you to let me go she said advise he laughed you a lawyer or something as a matter of fact i am he rolled his eyes oooh im seared he pushed her into the chair you need some loosening up princess and im just the man to do it you will unhand the lady cabrón or you will regret it the jerk looked up into andréss face with blank incomprehension what did you call me do you require a translation pajero andrés glanced at cat are you hurt señorita no she scrambled up and backed away its all right i was just leaving all her hopes of defusing the situation were shattered when the blond stood up toppling his chair behind him he towered over andrés by a good six inches and he was nearly twice as wide you shouldnt have stuck your nose where it dont belong he said flexing his muscles the lady is with me andrés said that so he turned to cat this is what you like some pansy musician pretending to be a man andrés met cats gaze go outside mi gatita only if you come with me when this is finished that wont take long the blond said he beckoned to andrés go ahead faggot just be careful not to hurt your pretty little fingers he had barely lifted his own massive fists when andrés struck hitting the blond with a series of punches that snapped his head from side to side as if it were made of rubber the bigger man crashed into the table and collapsed to the floor sprawling in an ungainly heap the bartender appeared beside cat youd better get him out of here he said nodding toward andrés i know this guy and hes trouble i dont want a brawl of course ill pay for any damages cat took andréss arm feeling the muscles bunched beneath his shirt sleeve please andrés lets go he regarded her with a wild look and suddenly relaxed as you wish mi gatita together they left the bar it had grown dark the plaza twinkled with lights that rivaled the stars cat paused to get her bearings where shall we go andrés said close to her ear have you a bed querida prickles of excitement raced from the back of cats neck to the base of her spine thanks for your attempt to help back there but it really wasnt necessary that cabrón was mistreating you i could have handled it few men are to be trusted by a woman alone she turned to stare at him challenging her own unease does that include you is that not for you to decide amada the very sound of his voice was a caress cat retreated several steps i dont know why you just happened to be here in taos but i came to spend some time alone thats what i intend to do andrés searched her eyes if that is what you truly wish it is goodbye she began to walk away feeling his gaze like fire licking between her shoulder blades only when she was in the parking lot of her motel did she let down her guard she ran up the stairs to her room on the second floor went inside and leaned against the door her breath coming fast and shallow it wasnt a coincidence she was certain of that andrés hadnt been here just to join the music festival either hed followed her or hed known somehow and thats ridiculous he couldnt have cat flung herself down on the bed grabbed a pillow and hugged it to her chest no matter where she went she couldnt escape not andrés not this feeling that made her wish shed invited him up to her room and let him have his way with her she could imagine his lean muscular body naked beside her his cock hard and high his eyes blazing with lust the way neals never had she saw herself lying on a reed mat beside him enjoying the pleasures of their wedding night she pounded the pillow with her fists she was wet again desperate for release that wouldnt come it was too early to sleep she jumped up paced the small room for a quarter of an hour turned on the television to some abominable madefortv movie and finally decided on a nice long hot shower the bathtub was hardly luxuriousone of those featureless molded plastic stalls that was about as welcoming as a tombstone in a graveyard cat was too muddled to care she turned on the spray to its hottest shed her clothes and stepped in with a sigh of relief but her mind would not be still the water cascading over her breasts and hips made her shiver her body was transformed as if she had become a creature of pure sensuality she stroked her stomach suddenly fascinated by the slight mound that had never matched the washboard ideal but now seemed a proclamation of her womanhood she cupped her breasts circling her nipples until they rose to firm peaks she turned her face up into the water and let it cascade over her face while her fingers skimmed down her thighs and came to rest on warm plump flesh andrés oh god andrés her imagination was so vivid that she could almost hear the shower curtain sliding aside feel the heat of a body behind her masculine hands resting on her waist and massaging her hips she could feel his tongue licking moisture from her neck as his cock worked between her parted thighs mi gatita he whispered she turned eyes tightly closed he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her urgently tangling his tongue with hers after an eternity of such kisses he bent his head following the slope of her chest lower lower until his tongue found her breast you want more querida he murmured god oh god yes he flicked the tip of her nipple and then took her into his mouth the cool plastic of the shower stall supported cats weight as he suckled first one breast and then the other demanding devouring he wedged his hands behind her bottom squeezing lifting his cock was trapped between them hot and heavy he withdrew to reposition himself and worked her thighs apart she made no attempt to resist he rubbed against her the head of his cock caressing her swollen lips what do you want he asked tell me i she gasped as he pushed a little deeper and then pulled back please someone knocked on the door cat came crashing back to reality she staggered and clutched at the shower curtain to keep her balance there was no one else in the shower she was alone silently screaming for deliverance the knock sounded again cat half stumbled out of the tub and reached for the towels folded on the rack above the toilet they were barely big enough to cover her from breast to upper thigh the door seemed a million miles away she leaned against it and looked through the peephole who is it but she knew even before he answered his voice all seductive music she hesitated for a second two then she opened the door she didnt ask how hed found her or why he had come she grabbed his hand dragged him into the room and kissed him his reaction was everything it had been in her dream he thrust with his tongue as he stripped the towel from her body and tossed it aside leading her to the bed she went willingly expecting him to shed his clothes and take her then and there instead he knelt at the foot of the bed pulled her toward him and spread her thighs his lips pressed against her vulva then his tongue stroked over the moist folds of her labia she couldnt remember the last time she had experienced such a sensation or wanted it so much andrés licked upward and found her clitoris already distended and burning with something very near pain but he didnt touch it he kissed her mons driving her crazy with need you taste of wine and honey he purred cat groaned dont stop he bent and drew her into his mouth she arched up demanding more his teeth grazed her his tongue fluttered and teased bringing closer ever closer to the release she had so desperately craved he thrust his tongue deep inside her she spiraled toward climax higher and higher and once again andrés denied her he stood and began to unbutton his shirt revealing his beautifully developed pecs cat couldnt take her eyes from him he removed the shirt folded it and draped it over the chair by the window then he unbuttoned his jeans the zipper slid down with a sensual hiss he wore nothing underneath his cock sprang free bigger than even cats fantasies had predicted his jeans fell to the floor and he kicked them away his cock arced high against his stomach ridged below and capped with the silkysmooth head cats thighs slackened in anticipation andrés knelt on the bed and positioned himself between her legs he worked his fingers inside her she bucked and moaned he stretched out atop her his cock gliding easily over the slickness of her sex she strained against him urging him to end her torment deliberately he rubbed himself over her glazing his cock in her wetness his lips closed over her nipple just as they had in her shower dream circling her breast while he flicked at the aching tip with his tongue cat was delirious with pleasure and pain she felt a vast searing emptiness that only andrés could fill she lifted her legs higher praying that his next move would send him thrusting into her but he held his body still and kissed her mouth with the greatest tenderness andrés she whispered he licked her chin i told you once that i would not do anything you did not wish me to do he said his voice husky with lust tell me what you want but cat didnt speak she pushed him away and kept pushing until he was forced off the bed he stood there uncertain for the first time his eyes reflecting much more than disappointment cat moved to the foot of the bed sat on the edge and took andréss cock into her mouth he gasped in surprise and pleasure he laced his fingers through her hair and held on as she sucked and licked and tugged moving his hips as his breathing quickened within a few minutes he was rigid and ready to come but he drew back panting hoarsely he lifted her to her feet turned her around and laid her facedown on the bed strong calloused hands raised her hips and buttocks holding her in place are you ready he asked softly yes oh god he hesitated and for a shattering moment she thought he was going to leave her but then without warning he drove into her from behind she moaned his name he withdrew taking a firmer grip on her hips and thrust again his movements slowed he pulled out waited and then slid inside with astonishing gentleness he was massaging her to orgasm but she didnt want it soft shed gone too far harder she begged he continued to move with steady strokes we have waited so long he said we can wait a little longer just when cat believed she could tolerate no more andrés began to pump more urgently rocking her forward with each thrust she gasped as he reached beneath their joining and rubbed her in time to his driving rhythm the climax was so overwhelming that she cried aloud her body glorying in sensations shed never known before andrés remained inside her she expected him to soften but his cock was still firm and full somehow hed brought her to orgasm without enjoying one himself andrés she said her voice shaking with reaction you didntyou need to he brushed damp hair from the back of her neck i will mi gatita he wrapped his arms around her waist and turned her to face him adjusting her legs so that she was sitting on his lap with his cock trapped between them cat touched his face from the angle of his cheekbone to the straight line of his dark brows i never thought it could be like this it is not over querida she found his erection with her fingertips caressing the velvety head tell me what you want a shudder ran through him forgive me for what she leaned her cheek against his chest youve given me somethingi didnt even know could exist neal she bit down hard on her lip cursing herself for even mentioning her exhusbands name but andrés was untroubled you have never had a real man before this i knew when we first met she drew back and met his gaze but why me why did you seek me out who are you andrés he put his finger to her lips lifted her and eased her down onto his cock she was so wet that there was no discomfort she felt a tingle as if she might come all over again but when she began to move sliding up and down he stopped her with casual strength he rose from the bed holding her impaled and carried her to the wall he clasped his hands around her cheeks and supported her as if she weighed no more than cottonwood down he held her tight as he entered her and she recognized with disbelief that she was on the edge of another incredible orgasm she clasped her legs around his waist moving with him he closed his eyes and worked until beads of sweat stood out on his forehead plunging grinding pounding the glorious pulsing started in the pit of cats belly let it go she whispered come to me for a moment he gazed right into her eyes and she saw pain and desperation and centuries of suffering forgive me he said hoarsely yes yes i forgive he stiffened the muscles of his stomach standing out in harsh relief his hips slamming against hers he finished with a cry of triumph gathering her against him as his shuddering came to an end cat dropped her chin on to his shoulder breathless and exultant andrés kissed her mouth and forehead and carried her back to the bed he laid her down with her head on the pillow and smoothed the tangled sheets over her tucking the edges under her chin as if she were a child then he backed away his eyes still full of sorrow dont go she said reaching for his hand he glanced toward the window there is little time time for what she tried to push the sheets away but he pressed her back and sat on the edge of the bed with a sigh perhaps it is over he said perhaps there will be no change what change instead of answering he stretched out beside her and tucked her head into the curve of his arm rest now mi gatita cat realized that she was exhausted not only by the vigorous sex but also by emotions she couldnt quite comprehend a minute ago andrés had been dominant guiding and controlling their lovemaking with her full cooperation but now he was something else entirely tender solicitous and melancholy in a way that made her want to take him in her arms and tell him everything was going to be all right you wont go she asked sleepily he kissed her forehead and brushed his fingers over her eyelids sleep the caballos charged into the village nostrils flared and teeth bared like the fangs of the jaguar ready to slaughter its prey their riders were gods of destruction and malice helmets and weapons flashing as they trampled the villagers who came to meet them itzel stood at the door of her house mouth open to cry out no sound would come men she had known all her life collapsed into the dust great gaping wounds spilling blood bright as forest flowers women screamed and fled some falling under the horses hooves others dragged by their hair to be violated and cast aside children wept and yet the conquerors slew on laughing and merciless filled with despair she turned to the one who stood behind her she begged andrés to stop those with whom he had once ridden to save the village from their murderous rampage but andrés didnt move he stared his skin the color of bleached bone his eyes no longer the hue of clear water but swallowed up in obsidian black he had become like some forgotten stone idol unable or unwilling to interfere in the fates of men only when one of the conquistadores his hair golden as the sun drove his huge mount toward the house and reached for itzel did andrés act he pushed her behind him and looked up at the man on the horse he spoke words in the enemy tongue hairofthesun laughed again spun his beast about and rode away his followers behind him itzel staggered from the doorway her eyes glazed with horror she knelt beside the lifeless body of her brother and stroked the matted hair from the terrible gash across his forehead there were a few others left alive they like her wandered from one body to the next searching for those they had loved much time passed before itzel turned back to the house andrés still waited there empty as one whose heart had been given in sacrifice to the gods she had loved him she had made the others see that he was not like those he had abandoned but she had been wrong he was no different itzel he whispered his voice a broken husk but she felt no pity she came to stand before him fists clenched at her sides you have betrayed us she said no i you did not stop them for this she closed her eyes for this you must pay for the first time in many suns she drew upon the powers her grandmother and mother had passed to her powers bestowed by the earth and the sky you will suffer as you have watched the people suffer she said your kind are bound to the great beasts you call caballos now you shall run as such a beast for all the days of your life walking as a man only at night but you shall not die you shall have no relief until one of my blood forgives you for your cowardice this day andrés heard her but he did not believe she saw that in his eyes but a few minutes of daylight remained he grew taut the curse beginning to work its way through his body itzel turned her back on him and walked away ignoring the wordless cries of agony and terror as andrés lost his ability to speak with a human voice the last she heard of him was the drumming of his hooves as he fled into the forest cat shot up in the bed her heart hammering and her breath locked in her throat it took several moments before she recognized the room around her andrés stood by the window his shoulder propped against the wall as he gazed outside tension had turned the muscle of torso and buttock and thigh to sculpted stone he still looked exactly the same as he had in that other ancient world not even his name was different he had begged her forgiveness she had given it unthinking never questioning why he had asked from the very beginning hed tried to seduce her while revealing as little about himself as he could get away with suddenly she had a reason for his behavior incredulous laughter roiled in cats stomach like an overrich meal it isnt possible but andrés had appeared only when trueno had vanished and the black stallion hadnt returned until daylight coincidence no more yet the anger from the dream was a bleak knot in cats chest she felt itzels despair the agony she had experienced when shed placed the spell on the man she loved if it were trueif in spite of every rule of logic andrés and the black horse were onethen he had deceived her from the first moment theyd met the only reason hed have asked her to forgive him was if hed believed that itzels blood ran in her veins hed arrogantly assumed that the way to control a female was to give her a good banging hed made her so helpless with passion that shed hand him anything he asked even her love she got out of bed dragging the top sheet from the mattress and wrapping it around her body trueno she said its almost daylight andrés looked at heronly for an instant barely long enough for her to see the flash of shock in his eyes when he recognized the trap she had set he smiled though it was too late mi gatita he said you have been dreaming yes she walked toward him righteous fury flowing through her body very vivid dreams dreams of a man who would not defend those who had welcomed him the color drained from andréss face catalina dont lie to me she stopped inches away holding his gaze i saw it all i saw her itzel he whispered yes she let her heart become a block of ice you are trueno he must have known then that denial would do him no good yes he said despair weighting the word like an anchor thrown to a drowning man cat didnt falter you must have been looking for centurieslooking for someone who could lift the curse then you discovered me somehow you knew that itzel was my distant kin you needed to win my forgiveness by any means necessary no it is not so simple queri do you have an excuse andrés she loved you and you let them destroy everything she cared about have i not paid enough he reached out to touch her face listen to me it was five hundred years she jerked free maybe if youd been honest if youd really tried to atonebut you set out to use me instead no when i first saw youyour grace your strengthi could not helpcould not help but its too late andrés i wont play catalina i beg of you his voice thinned and he grabbed at his throat his skin began to ripple as if every muscle and tendon beneath were attempting to assume a new shape he fell against the wall pushed away violently and staggered toward the door his hands extended before him cat rushed after him ready to take back every word shed spoken but andrés flung open the door and rushed onto the landing he stumbled downstairs into the parking lot cat dashed back into the room and threw on jeans and a shirt she practically fell down the stairs the black stallion stood trembling among the trucks and suvs his coat shining with sweat andrés he looked toward her ears flat against his head and spun on his hind legs before shed taken another step hed set off at a wild gallop toward the weedy field that backed the smattering of motels fastfood joints and garages to the west dawn had just broken cars on the road were sparse and only a few earlyrising souls noticed the saddleless horse charging across the street cat slumped cursing her pride and the implacable judgment that had driven him away even if she got right into turks truck and drove as fast as she could she knew shed never catch up with him he could cover terrain no vehicle could manage and he had every reason to run and keep running until sunset found him human again friendless and alone there was no reason in the world for him to come back shed given him not a shred of hope and all her hope had gone with him she checked out quickly tossed her duffel in the truck and drove back to the ranch by a circuitous route indifferent about when she arrived or what shed do once she got there she pulled up in front of the ranch house well after noon as weary as if shed walked all the way from taos turk tapped on the window she rolled it down and summoned a smile back so soon he asked thought you might be spending the weekend in town i had a good time but i think i may be coming down with something if i have to be sick id rather be sick in my own room sorry to hear it miss cat ill put the truck away he opened the door for her and took her place in the drivers seat cat looped the duffel over her shoulder and plodded toward the house pilar met her in the kitchen the housekeepers hands and lower arms coated with flour a ball of pie dough sat on a wooden board beside the sink catalina pilar hastily washed her hands and dried them on a thick cotton towel how was the festival it was fine cat dropped into a chair and stared at the pretty bouquet of wildflowers pilar had set on the table i justgot a little lonely ah pilar rubbed at a patch of flour left on a fingernail did you find no one to keep you company the inevitable blush burned cats cheeks pilar nodded gravely i saw the change in you the night kelpie came back lame i see it even more strongly now who is he cat found that she had no desire to pretend any longer i met him that night he helped with kelpie and she broke off unable to describe how shed felt that first time he wasisunlike any man ive ever known what is his name where does he live all of pilars questions were logical but the answers would tell her nothing his name is andrés she said i dont think he has a home yet he has won your heart pilars words so simple and blunt stopped the air in cats lungs she tried to stand and fell back again her muscles gone weak and useless shed known andrés all of three days it just wasnt possible to fall in love so quickly but shed never believed in curses or men who could change into horses either he was not what you expect to find when you came to us pilar said no your mind tells you to stay away yet you cannot the older woman placed a plump hand on cats shoulder has he done you some wrong this andrés a wrong you cant forgive how could pilar possibly have guessed andrés had betrayed itzel hed let her people die while he stood by refusing to intervene his punishment had been no less than he deserved but that isnt why you turned on him it isnt what happened hundreds of years ago that matters is it its what he did to you how he deceived and manipulated you perhaps you came to us for a reason pilar said not only to find love but to free yourself from your own past and to free andrés as well cat jumped to her feet i have to go out pilar dont expect me back before dawn the housekeeper nodded smiled and returned to her pie crust cat grabbed several bottles of water and a chunk of cheese from the refrigerator fetched a blanket from her room and ran outside to look for turk when she didnt find him she saddled a mare and placed the blanket food and a supply of oats in a pair of saddlebags she hung over the mares hindquarters rosie was more than ready to cooperate with cats eagerness to be gone cat rode north toward the colorado border certain that andrés would head away from civilization she paused at five to drink and eat and rest the mare refusing to give up hope by eight the sun was beginning to set cat had no idea how far shed gone the countryside had hardly changed and shed encountered only cattle horses and a few pronghorn antelope her legs ached and rosie was beginning to droop cat dismounted at the foot of a small hill stretched and left rosie to graze while she finished off the last bottle of water her heart was a leaden weight in her chest she couldnt continue with only the supplies remaining in the saddlebags when morning came shed have to turn around the chances that shed find andrés were growing smaller by the moment wearily she spread the blanket on the brown grass and lay down she had just closed her eyes when rosie nickered softly half afraid to hope cat opened her eyes again the stallion stood at the top of the hill the plume of his tail stirring in the evening breeze cat rose adrenaline rushing through her body come she begged silently come to me for a handful of minutes it seemed he would turn and flee but slowly hesitantly he started down the hill head lowered and ears pressed flat he stopped several yards away his eyes filled with that very human sadness andrés cat whispered his ears flickered but he came no nearer cat offered her upturned hands i was wrong she said youve paid enough its time you had a second chance the stallion lifted his head an eldritch light sprang up around him gilding his coat and crackling the grass under his hooves cat was never sure what she saw then andrés changed four legs became two and the ebon mane became a shock of thick dark hair he stood naked before her still silent still waiting love and desire tangled in cats mind one inseparable from the other she too had been transformed we forgive you she said i forgive you andrés be free he began to shake and she realized he was laughing his voice boomed in a cry of triumph and joy he opened his arms and she walked into them breathing in the sharp clean scent of his body mi gatita he said taking her face between his hands gracias gracias desde el fondó de mi corazón he searched her eyes how may i repay you in answer she kissed him her hand wandering between them to stroke his erect cock if you really want to repay me she murmured dont make me wait a second longer she took his hand and led him to the blanket he removed her clothing with something like reverence worshiping her body with lips and tongue but when he parted her thighs to enter she rolled over and pushed him onto his back its my turn now she said and mounted him with a groan of pleasure that night she had the ride of her life and when it was over and they lay together gazing up at the fading stars she knew itzel was at peace stay with me she said stay with me forever he traced her lips with his fingertip forever is a long time not nearly long enough you hardly know me how can you be sure let me show you just how sure i am and they rode together bound as one until they could ride no farther to die for keri arthur chapter the worst thing about working for an investigative agency specializing in paranormal and psychic events was the long often irregular hours my field of expertise might be missing persons rather than things that went bump in the night but it still involved late nights and long shifts monsters mostly preferred the cover of darkness it seemed but the second worst thing about working for the aforementioned agency was having a boss who had no respect for the eight hours between shifts rule made law years ago so when franks phone call woke me up after id barely been asleep for three hours i was neither happy nor surprised rioli he said his voice more gravelly than usual meaning hed either been up all night or hed hit the smokes again need you in here asap frank i only just got home from the harbor case this ones important grace be here by seven i glared blearily at the clock hed given me a whole thirty minutes how generous of him i hung up dragged myself out of bed and threw on some clothes luckily for us both the traffic at that hour of a sunday morning was practically nonexistent and i found a parking spot right out in front of the agencys multistory building it turns out i wasnt the only investigator frank had called in early and when i heard the rapid tattoo of footsteps coming up behind me i barely restrained a groan there was only one man in this building who could make the mere act of walking sound so sexy and i really wasnt in the mood to cope with his banter this morning hey ravioli wait up ravioli is a food i said tartly not breaking stride as i headed for the elevator and my name is rioli id appreciate it if youd actually remember that are you always this touchy in the mornings he asked his voice so warm so rich that shivers of delight ran down my spine but then id been supersensitive to this mans presence from the moment hed walked elegantlyand ohso sexilyinto the preternatural investigations offices eighteen months ago luckily for me i was not alone in my admiration and ethan had wasted no time dipping into the pool so to speak the man was a werewolf who knew how to work both his aura and his lean powerful body he was sex on a stick as one of my cubicle mates had noted right before shed taken him home and enjoyed his stick thankfully id been spared the grittier details of their activities the following morning i had imagination enough when it came to ethan which wasnt to say id never been tempted to do more than imagine but i often worked with the man on missing persons investigations unless you were very lucky mixing business and pleasure always got messy not that id actually mind a little of ethans mess every now and again i blew out a breath and punched the elevator button control i needed control ethan would smell the merest hint of arousal and that would only stir his interest more and i needed that like i needed a hole in the head especially when it had been so damn long since id had anything decent in the way of sex weres of any breed might be free and easy when it came to sex but i was a wolf shifter and my parents were depressingly oldfashioned when it came to the whole mating act though i was pretty sure i could shake their overly strict sensibilities if the right man and moment came along ethan certainly wasnt that man hence the cobwebs and me feeling hornier than a bitch in heat whenever he got within hormonal radar distance i punched the button again as usual the damn elevator was taking its freaking time getting here or is it just me that brings out the worst in you he continued from right behind me i took a breath that was filled with the warm spicy scent of him then slowly turned to meet the vivid blue of his gaze a gaze that was too bright and saw too much a gaze that never gave much away no matter what the situation but ethan garrison wasnt just sex on a stick he was exmilitary and a dangerous man despite his todiefor smile he was dressed in black this morning his roughly rolled up shirtsleeves emphasizing the strength of his shoulders and upper arms while his closefitting jeans paid homage to the long lean length of his legs even his boots and baseball cap were black with his golden hair and skin it was a potent combination going for the bad boy look today are we i said more to break the tension that always seemed to build between us than from any real need to talk to the man heard you liked a bit of bad thought it worth a shot his grin was pure cheek and crinkles of amusement touched the corners of his bright watchful eyes a combination that had my hormones doing happy little cartwheels the bad boy is getting no closer to me than the other incarnations youve dreamt up i said and wished my words would come out less breathy you and i work together thats enough one dark eyebrow rose as he stepped a little closer care to take a bet on that ravioli the sheer heat of him slid across my senses like a caress a caress i so wanted my heart was doing a tripletime dance and desire not only swirled through me but around me his nose flared and a lusty spark ignited deep in his eyes damn i was in trouble now still i raised my chin defiant to the end that was me i dont bet especially when i was likely to lose shame that i enjoy a challenge then i challenge you to take a flying leap out of a twentiethfloor window and make like a bird he smiled and my breath caught somewhere in my throat and refused to budge smiles like that should be declared lethal weapons youd miss me if i did yeah i said forcing a note of dryness into my voice like id miss a proverbial pain in the butt his gaze slid downwards and a very nice butt it is too the chime of the elevator arriving saved me from answering i gave a silent sigh of reliefthen wondered why as the doors opened revealing the empty interior confined elevator spaces and ethan were not a wise combination right now are you going to stand there gawking all day he asked voice dry and a knowing smile touching his lips it was a thought not a practical one but a thought all the same i stepped inside and punched the tenthfloor button what floor you going to tenth same as you he stopped beside me so close he made me burn damn damn damn i stepped back trying to get some space between us trying to cool my overheated body so frank has called you in yes something urgent has come up oh i had no doubt about that i thought my gaze detouring briefly down his long lean length man what i wouldnt give to be ablei wrenched my mind away from that particular direction and tried to think of boring things in an effort to calm my pulse only nothing boring would come to mind the doors slid closed and the elevator began to rise at what seemed like a snails pace ethan took a step towards me i couldnt help taking another one backthough there werent many places i could go in such a confined space i pressed my back against the cool steel wall and watched him almost breathlessly anticipating his touch even though common sense suggested he was only teasing after all there wasnt much he could do in an elevator in the space of ten floors was there he moved closer my breath stuttered to a brief stop like a rabbit caught in a spotlight i watched as he bracketed his hands on either side of my head then he leaned forward sending my senses into a spiral of delight my nipples hardened as if reaching out to brush his body which they couldnt because he wasnt that close part of me wished he was wished i could just melt against all that warm hard flesh and allow my fingers the freedom to roam but that would only be asking for more than i could probably handle so i raised a hand and simply pressed it against his chest stopping him from coming closer even through the soft silk of his shirt his muscles felt like iron under my fingertips and my skin itched with the need to feel to caress dont i said unfortunately my voice came out husky and that only ignited the spark in his eyes all the more dont what he said his breath a whisper across my cheeks do this his weight pressed against my hand a gentle force i suddenly couldnt stop and couldnt resist my aching nipples finally came in contact with the softness of his shirt and something akin to electricity shot through my body lord it felt good and he was so close so tempting and his lips there right there right within tasting distance oh how i wanted to taste them and he knew it damn him or this he added then brushed his mouth across mine it felt like the touch of fire or maybe it was only me who burned not him not his delicious lips you want me ravioli he murmured his lips moved from my mouth to my chin then my neck tasting teasing arousing i closed my eyes savoring the heat zinging across every fiber of my being go on admit it i didnt have to admit anything especially when the scent of my arousal was so damn obvious how can i want a man who cant even remember my name i somehow managed to say his lips brushed the pulse point at the base of my neck sending a tremor through my limbs then continued down following the v of my shirt i closed my eyes torn between the sweet desire of his kisses and the knowledge that i needed to push him away before this got out of hand and it would get out of hand he was a werewolf and an alpha and the wolf within me just couldnt help reacting to the power and masculinity of his presence not to mention his sheer musthaveyounow sexiness ravioli suits you he murmured his teeth grazed a nipple i shuddered and barely resisted the urge to arch into him to offer myself to that tantalizing tempting touch so does my name my voice sounded as liquid as i felt which is grace rioli in case youve forgotten i havent his lips trailed fire back up my neck when his tongue flirted with my ear my knees threatened to buckle but ravioli is my favorite food and this particular dish is one ive longed to taste more fully if he kept this up hed be able to drink me because id be little more than a puddle at his feet so basically youre saying i remind you of a small square pasta his chuckle vibrated against my neck and my toes curled in delight you may be small in height and waist grace but youre sure not small in other departments his tongue alternated with his teeth against my ear teasing the exact right spot and my body vibrated with the force of pleasure shooting through me god why was the elevator taking so damn long to climb ten floors this had to stop not the elevatorhim or i wouldnt want to i squeezed my other hand between us and pushed with both not too much just enough to remove the heat of his lips from my neck so now youre saying ive got a fat ass charming his gaze scorched mine blue eyes rich with amusement and lust it was the same sort of lust that pounded through methe hot lets get down and dirty right here right now type of lust damn it why couldnt i find that sort of intensity with someone i didnt work with youre determined to twist everything i say arent you he said deep voice edged with amusement yes because sarcasm was my only line of safety i was far too susceptible to this mans charms otherwise i ducked under his arms as the elevator finally halted and the doors opened the simple act of walking was an effort because my heart still raced a million miles an hour and my legs were all fluid and wobbly it was just as well franks office was down the far end of the hallat least it gave me time to gather some sort of composure ethan reappeared by my side his long strides curtailed to match my shorter ones why he said i was still so attuned to him his voice seemed to flow over my skin as sensually as a warm summer breeze the attraction between us is getting stronger and you cant keep denying it exists i could and i would for as long as we had to work together and maybe even after that there has to be hundreds of women working in this building why dont you go try your luck with the half you havent sampled something flashed in his eyes something that looked an awful lot like annoyance because im attracted to you not them attracted to the challenge more than the person i suspected yeah well i have no intention of becoming another notch on your bedpost as much as my hormones danced excitedly at the very idea what if i promise to make that notch worthwhile his grin was pure cheek and i couldnt help responding in kind the man might be a dangerous rogue but he was undoubtedly a sexy one not even then he stopped to open franks door then ushered me through his fingers searing my spine though his touch was feather light the more you challenge me the more determined i get he murmured his words sent another tremor racing across my skin lord if what he was doing now wasnt determination what was and how was i going to survive it janet franks secretary glanced up as we both walked in go straight through she said her gaze lingering appreciably on ethan thanks janet he said voice so intimate the older woman blushed i shook my head and continued on through the second door like most werewolves the man just couldnt help flirtingand that was part of the problem if id had any reason to believe he was after anything more serious than a quick roll in the sack then maybe id reconsider i scratched the rest of that thought from my mind as frank our semibald boss glanced up sit down he said whats the problem i crossed my legs so that my feet pointed away from ethan even an accidental touch could be deadly given the aroused state hed so easily worked me into weve got a couple of missing kids i want you to look for when and where ethan asked voice becoming cool and businesslike something inside me relaxed this ethan i could handle it was the flirty ohsosexy version of his personality that got me all flustered and outofsorts the first was three nights ago frank shoved several files across the desk ethan leaned forward and picked one up quickly scanning it before handing it across to me i was careful not to touch his fingers and amusement flared briefly across his lush lips the basic details were all therename location and the particulars of where and how hed gone missing i looked up were there any threats ransom demands anything to suggest this was a standard crime frank shook his head the kid disappeared from his bedroom in the middle of the night no evidence of a breakin and all the doors and windows were still locked in the morning from the inside he flicked a glance my way yeah meaning someone had a key ghosts might be able to get past locked doors and windows but humanslarge or smallcouldnt why were we called in ethan asked the official investigation would still be underway we usually dont get pulled in until after the dust has settled a second teenager went missing last night under the same circumstances frank pushed the other file closer that teenager is my nephew ah ethans voice was neutral and yet as attuned as i currently was to the man i sensed his distaste he hated jobs that involved personal connectionsthough hed never actually said why i want answers frank said and i want them fast and that was probably why ethan hated personal connections hard to do your job properly when someone closely connected rode your back i glanced at the file in my hand the teenagers had gone missing from wild dog creek a small beachside town about ten minutes beyond the popular apollo bay getting accommodations at the height of summer holidays is going to be a problem my sisterinlaw has a guest house shes putting you up there i glanced briefly at ethan he still wasnt giving much away but the taste of his displeasure was thicker in the air do you think thats wise mari wont get in the way of the investigation the problem wasnt so much his sisterinlaw or the investigation it was more me staying with a man i was only barely resisting why the two of us i asked i can handle a missing person case by myself i dont need ethan to babysit frank raised his eyebrows at that do you have a problem with ethan yeah he was too damn sexy for my own good i had a hard enough time resisting the man in the few minutes our paths crossed each dayhow much more difficult was it going to be if i had to spend all day and all night with him spending that much time together could only have one resultus in bed getting hot and heavy my sex drive was perfectly normal even if the works were a little rusty and there was no denying the fact i did want him i just didnt want to end up getting hurt thanks to my parents i wasnt very good at the casual stuff and ethan was the sort of man i could fall for except he didnt seem to want a relationship of any kind i just think its a waste of resources i said then realized just what id said the minute franks expression darkened its my company and my people and ill send who i damn well please to find my nephew he glared at me for several seconds then said now get going i got outside the door i said this is going to suck big time the job or the fact that im going with you i glanced at him saw the amusement playing about the mouth i so wanted to kiss again what do you think i think your psi abilities mesh extremely well with my pragmatism and innate ability to track a killer which is why frank put us on this one probably i punched the elevator button and crossed my arms and tried not to think about constricted space and what had happened not so long ago it still sucks he leaned casually against the wall and managed to look so damn hot my hormones started their crazy cartwheels again why are you so afraid of being alone with me im not afraid of being alone with you he smiled a long slow dangerous smile then its game on ravioli i knew in that moment my resolution to keep him at arms length was in big big trouble chapter the socalled guest house turned out to be a tiny little cabin barely big enough to contain the ancient old brass bed that dominated the main room a creakylooking wooden table and several chairs were squeezed into one corner and in the other a small kitchenette the door leading to the bathroom was at the other end of the tiny house on the left side of the bed which was my side heaven only knew id need plenty of cold showers to get through the night without giving in to the delicious temptation that would be lying beside me what can you tell me about the night your son disappeared mrs symmonds ethan said throwing his sports bag on the bed beside my case hed packed light id packed heavy lots of layers was now my motto whatever the actual temperature mari took a shuddery breath and exhaled it softly she was a small pale woman with even paler hair not an albino because her eyes were brown but she still possessed that almost ethereal delicateness albinos often had it was rare for a cat shifter to give off that sort of vibe because they were usually the independent dontyouworryaboutme types but maybe it was simply the stress of the situation he went to bed at ten as usual his light was still on at eleven so he was probably online chatting she shrugged he does that most nights and you went to bed when ethan asked his voice all business all matteroffact which should have put me at ease but didnt after the long closequarters drive down here i was still far too aware of the man i blew out a breath and tried to concentrate on her voice listening for anything out of place in her answers that might help find the missing teenagers midnight she answered i said goodnight and he answered and you heard nothing all night nothing at all the dogs didnt even bark and they certainly had at us but then we were wolves and basically invading their turf what time did you notice he was missing i asked softly she looked at me as soon as i got up at seven his door was open and the bed empty what did you do then looked for him of course but he was nowhere she stopped and gulped then looked back at ethan frank said youd find him he promised frank was a freaking fool who should have known better than that ethan touched the womans frail shoulder and squeezed it lightly well do our best mrs symmonds thank you ethan looked briefly my way the dangerous spark still glittered bright in his eyes but i wasnt entirely sure if it was anger or desire we should go to his room and look around mrs symmonds she led the way along the daisystrewn stone path to the main housea rambling twostory affair so often found on older farms which this had once been before mari and her nowdead hubby had sold it off to developers as we neared the back door ethan pressed a hand to my back guiding me inside even that slightest of touches had my system going into meltdown this wasnt good not when the lives of a couple kids might well depend on my ability to concentrate i stepped away from him but the air between us still seemed so very heated if you dont mind i said touching maris arm gently ill get you to wait here the less interfering vibrations up there the better she didnt ask what i meant simply nodded ethan and i moved up the stairs we knew the layout of the houseit had been included in the files frank had given us ethan stopped in the doorway while i continued on wed worked together enough now that this side of our relationship had almost become routine lord how i wished the other part the part i kept denying had the same easygoing feel sense anything he asked i stopped near the bed and drew in a deep breath tasting the flavors in the air feeling for the emotions and shadows that rode underneath the world was filled with such things id learned to leash and control the senses that detected them but had never truly been able to explain it especially since i come from a very long line of mundane normal wolves that wouldnt know a psychic skill if they fell over it but for me the very air i breathed was alive and sometimes that wasnt a good thing there were the standard everyday emotions that everyone could see and feel and sometimes taste but there were just as many that ran underneath normal sensory lines many of these were the darker more destructive emotions and aromas and they lingered like a cancer in the air polluting and destroying any sweeter scent this room was filled with such a darkness it feels like a vampire i said the chill running across my flesh making me suddenly glad of the multiple layers of clothing vampires cant cross thresholds uninvited ethans footsteps echoed on the wooden boards as he walked across to the window theres no saying jon didnt invite it in except the cops reported that all windows and doors had still been locked from the inside he paused looking out the seasalt blasted pane of glass besides were on the second floor and there are no nearby trees vampires cant fly but they can climb ladders soft soil they would have found ladder imprints i sucked in the air again felt the foulness of it swirl through me its definitely a vampire or at least something along those lines it has that same dead feeling and theres nothing else i sifted through the undercurrents and deeper threads of lingering emotions no fear whatever took him he wasnt afraid not at first anyway he glanced at me not at first i crossed my arms and frowned no i have a feeling that fear might have come later but at the very beginning he was a dreamer caught in a dream i paused finding a hint of arousal and excitementand neither emotion had anything to do with ethan or me he was chasing sexual completion ethan raised his eyebrows hes run off with a girlfriend i shrugged it would explain the locked doors and windows most teenagers his age have keys he studied me for a moment then walked over to the rumbled sheets his nostrils flaring as he breathed deep theres no lingering scent of sex i raised my eyebrows would you have sex with your girlfriend when your mom was in the room next door his sudden smile was decidedly roguish and had my pulse doing one of those excited little quicksteps youd be surprised what i got away with when my mom was in the next room actually no i wouldnt he picked up a photograph and stared at the image going off with a girlfriend doesnt explain why you smell vampire it would if the girlfriend was some sort of succubus succubaeor energy vamps as they were sometimes calledsucked life force rather than life blood and unlike true vamps they had fewer restrictions like being able to cross thresholds theyre rareespecially in a small outoftheway place like this rare doesnt mean cant exist true he put the photo frame back down you up to visiting the other kids room part of me wanted to say no tasting shadows and darkness was never a pleasant thing and usually i avoided doing it more than once a day its doubtful any useful scents will remain after a week but are you up to trying i rubbed my arms yeah i guess but only because time was of the essence if we were dealing with a succubus unlike regular suckers they didnt drain their victims in one hit but rather over a couple of days we still had a chance of finding jon alive if we hurried hope had all but faded when it came to the first boy though succubae rarely went after another victim until theyd finished with the first did it say anywhere in the file whether the two boys hung out together he shook his head but in a town this size they probably would he paused why because it just seems odd an energy vamp would go after two teenage boys i always thought they went after older stronger life forces normally yeah he looked down at the bed for a moment then walked around it and lightly touched my elbow come on lets get you out of here warmth flared where he touched spreading like a wildfire up my arm and across my body washing the chill and the thick feeling of darkness from my skin normally i would have pulled away but right then i needed that warmth needed the reminder of life and healthy normal emotions to erase the last remainders of evil from my soul we walked down the stairs and back into the kitchen mari turned around as we entered her hands gripped around a steaming mug of coffee and hope in her eyes anything perhaps i said cautiously not wanting to feed the hope but unwilling to crush it either tell me did jon have a girlfriend she smiled no he preferred hanging out with his mates could you write out their names and addresses and give it to us when we come back this afternoon well need to talk to them just in case they know or saw something she nodded i think the police already talked to them wed still like to doublecheck ethan said and lightly squeezed the elbow he still held we continued on outside and i took a deep breath of the warm summery air felt it brush the last vestiges of darkness from my lungs now you look a little healthier ethan said his gaze sweeping my face i pulled free of his grip and got some space between us again it always feels like the darkness is invading my soul eating away at my very self a shudder ran through me and i always fear that one day there wont be any me left just a memory and the sweeping strands of darkness which is something id told so very few people maybe my brush with evil had left me feeling more vulnerable than normal though youd think id be used to such brushes by now he frowned then why do it why take that risk because i have a gift and it can sometimes save lives i shrugged my parents were the type who ingrained the ideology that if we have a skill we should use it even at the risk of your very self even at i rubbed my arms again as we made our way towards ethans car can we talk about something else how about sex other than that i said dryly he opened the car door and ushered me inside i dont believe my topics of conversations contain anything else why am i not surprised because im a werewolf and werewolves only talk about two things dont they sex and how to get sex he slammed the door shut and walked around to the drivers side of the car leaving me wondering about the slight edge in his voice it wasnt like id actually brought the damn subject up far from it he climbed into the drivers seat started the car then accelerated down the driveway and onto the great ocean road three streets and a quick left and we were outside the second boys house like ethan had said this town wasnt very big a woman waited out in front her arms crossed over massive bosoms and an anxious expression on her fleshy face mari rang and explained why you were coming she said voice filled with strain and tiredness do you really think you can help we can only try i said then held out my hand and introduced myself ethan did the same what can you tell us about your sons activities in the days before his disappearance she shrugged he was out with his mates most days was one of those mates jon she nodded then gave us an anxious sort of look are the two connected the police wont say whether they are or arent maybe the police werent but the local papers sure as hell were which undoubtedly was making life even harder for the parents of the other teenagers in brad and jons gang we dont know as yet i paused looking past her can we go inside and look at his room she nodded and led us inside brads room was at the rear of the house and had easy access to the back door and the garden beyond it would have been a simple task for a determined teenager armed with a key to get out of the house without his parents knowing i stepped into the room gaze sweeping walls hung with pictures of seminaked women jon had football stars maybe brad was more sexually advanced than his mateand perhaps that was a factor of him going first if indeed we were dealing with an energy vamp anything ethan asked i shook my head and stepped further into the room scents and emotions swirled around me fading wisps of teenage hopes and dreams but no darkness no shadows i turned and looked at ethan his gaze roamed the pictures the energy vamp didnt enter this room i said a touch sharper than i should have not that i actually cared if he ogled pictures of other women i just wanted a little attention on the job damn it if i could find the strength to resist base emotions and concentrate then so could he amusement briefly flared in his bright eyes she might have called him out it looks like brad was more sexually motivated than jon i picked my way through the clothingstrewn mess on the floor to the window i still dont understand why this vamp would be going after teenagers if its sexual energy she wants older men would be more viable and strong wouldnt they ethan followed my steps a heat i could feel more than see he stopped just behind me his breath brushing warmth across my neck sending little flash fires of desire skittering across my too aware too hot skin it would depend on whether she prefers innocence or experience i didnt think vamps of any kind were picky when it came to sustenance all creatures do what they must to survive doesnt mean they arent picky when they have a choice i looked over my shoulder and raised an eyebrow even werewolves his bright gaze was still aware still watchful for what i wasnt entirely sure a werewolf has to have sex during the week leading up to the full moon but that doesnt mean we arent more choosy beyond those times and yet werewolves have a reputation for wanting sex twentyfourseven and for not being particularly caring about who their partner is he reached out and lightly brushed a hair from my cheek his fingers barely even touched my skin but i was a moth to his flame and a shudder of sheer delight ran through me enjoying sex is not a crime and i like most werewolves i know am more choosy than you seem to believe it didnt matter i wanted to say because we werent going to happen and whatever i might think or feel wasnt important but i couldnt force my tongue around the words because probably sooner rather than later we would happen i knew it he knew it all my protests to date were merely delaying the inevitable he might not be the right man this might not be the right situation but it just didnt seem so important any more not to hormones that had hungered for so long i might not be a creature whose needs were swayed by the blooming of the moon but i was still a wolf still a woman and i still needed the touch of another every now and again i stepped sideways fighting the inevitable just that little bit longer what next he shoved his hands in his pockets it didnt do much to hide the bulge of his erection it was good to know i wasnt the only one aching we need to talk to the other kids in the meantime well get frank to check the database and see if theres any records of an energy vamp being active in this area i raised my eyebrows would there be records vampires tend to be territorial so maybe he shrugged come on lets get out of here he didnt touch me this time perhaps his control was as tenuous as mine i followed him out and let him answer the mothers questions with his usual charm and reassurance he was better at that sort of stuff than me the werewolf aura and all that we got into the car and headed back to maris to collect the list of jons friends there were four other teenagers in his gang and after interviewing three of them one thing became clear they were all lying but why i asked as we climbed back into the car after interviewing the third kid it just doesnt make sense they were all scared that what had happened to jon and brad would happen to them so why wouldnt they want to do everything they can to protect themselves were talking about teenage boys here i frowned at him so so he said starting the car teenage boys dont tattle on their friends especially if they were doing something illegal and you think they were he shrugged logical reason for the lies you want to grab some dinner before we interview the last kid i looked at my watch and nodded weve got an hour or so before hes home time enough there was something in the way he said those words that had my pulse skipping time enough for what he gave me one of those todiefor smiles time enough to eat what else do you think i meant i have absolutely no idea i muttered looking away from his knowing gaze he laughed softly i continued to ignore him we grabbed a couple of burgers and some chips and headed on down to the beach ethan parked then grabbed a blanket from the back seat and climbed out i followed with the food and drinks so i said once the blanket was spread over the sand and we were munching our burgers what sort of illegal activities do you think the boys were up to he shrugged it could be anything from peeking into bedroom windows to breaking into houses whatever it is theyve obviously made a pact not to talk about it boys are weird he raised an eyebrow amusement playing around his lips and girls arent its a wellknown fact girls are the sensible species you boys are just all hormones and need meaning girls dont need meaning girls arent a prisoner to their needs and this was a conversation i should not be having not with this man oh really that gleam was back in his eyes stronger lustier than before want to bet on that ravioli i finished my burger and brushed the crumbs from my hands all the while avoiding his heated steady gaze i told you before i dont bet and why is that afraid youll lose my gaze rose to his yes he somehow seemed closer though he hadnt actually moved maybe it was merely a sharpening in my awareness of him maybe it was simply the erotic and sensual heat of him wrapping around me cradling me like a lover afraid of me he asked softly no i answered afraid of me afraid of wanting more than would ever be offered ah if one single word could say many things then that one word did he understood what i meant but as i stared into bright gaze i realized understanding did not equate to backing away or backing down that it had in fact only hardened resolve dont i said my words a bare whisper quickly whisked away by the wind play with me he rose on all fours and moved toward me i watched him warily knowing i should move and yet not wanting to he straddled my legs and stared at me eye to eye i have never played with you grace the delicious scent of man and musk and spices swept around me sending my hormones into another wild dance he raised an eyebrow as if daring me to retreat i couldnt wouldnt not this time only because ive never given you the chance then you have one chance now he lowered his mouth toward mine but didnt quite kiss me his breath a delicious whisper on my lips as he added yes or no for one second the sane half of me raised a reminder that getting physically involved with this man was utter madness that he was after a good time not a long time and i was the one whod be left feeling awkward and uncomfortable long after the brief affair had ended that he would go on just fine pretending nothing had ever happened and that we could just be casual friends and sometimes partners but the part that had gone hungry for well over two years shouted the reminders down and said yes if you can avoid sand in bits no sand he promised then kissed me it was an urgent hungry thing that kiss and so very very thorough he kissed me until my head was spinning and my heart was pounding so loudly it seemed to drown out the sound of crashing surf kissed me until the thick scent of desire filled the air until it felt like a blanket that burned and suffocated kissed me until i wanted him as id never wanted another man all with a kiss i couldnt wait to see what he could do once his hands and body were involved why dont we strip he said after a long long while sounds like a plan i murmured and began to do just that he removed his clothes more slowly a master of control and a man who knew how to work a striptease i smiled when we were both naked and ran a hand across the warm hard planes of his abs in the sunshine his golden skin glowed with an almost unearthly fire it was beautiful as he was beautiful he caught my hand brought it up to his lips and kissed it gently then he tugged on my fingers lightly dragging me down until we were both kneeling on the rug again let the games begin i murmured softly its never been a game grace its all been foreplay building to this moment his hand gently touched my cheek then slid slowly sensually down my neck and onto my shoulders his mouth followed his caress kissing and nipping my flesh making me shudder and squirm in pleasure when his tongue circled the dark ring of one nipple teasing but not touching the oversensitive center i moaned wanting more wanting it now but at the same time not wanting to rush every inch of me trembledachedwith expectation and waiting that moment when he did more than circle was a part of that i closed my eyes and pushed my breasts forward offering them fully to the delight that was his tongue he nipped lightly then drew one aching nipple deep into his mouth sucking on it hard the unexpected rush of pleasure had me gasping as he suckled and nipped my breasts his caress moved with agonizing slowness down my belly touching teasing exploring drawing ever closer to the one place i wanted him most goosebumps scurried across my sweatbeaded skin and my heart hammered so loudly its beat seemed to echo across the evening when his fingers finally brushed my clit i could only shudder and press harder into his touch then his caress delved deeper sliding through wetness one finger plunging inside then two but neither staying long enough longing flowed like a fire through my veins until my whole body quivered and throbbed to the tune of that gentle yet insistent caress a caress that quickly created a tide threatening to overload my senses and as much as i wanted the rush his touch was building i wanted him more wanted to caress and stroke and taste him so i pulled away and began my own explorations allowing my fingers the freedom to roam his beautiful body reveling in the feeling of power that seemed barely contained under skin i kissed him nipped him licked the salty taste of sweat and desire from his skin all the while my hand slid ever further down until i was stroking the long glorious length of him i watched his eyes watched the lust grow felt the power of it roll through me pooling deep so very deep until i was barely resisting the urge to simply mount him to thrust his thick erection inside and ride him until we both came hard and fast i pushed him back until he was forced to brace his body with his arms to stop from falling over then bent and ran my tongue across the tip of his cock his groan was thick and filled with pleasure i swirled my tongue around the tip of him for a while then moved to his shaft and balls enjoying his reaction the tremble that ran through his body the way his cock leapt and throbbed with eagerness with every careful stroke of my tongue he groaned again stronger more urgent i smiled and took him fully into my mouth he thrust in response his body shaking with the effort of restraint as i drew him deep sucking and tasting and teasing him until his movements became desperate and the salty taste of pre cum began seeping into my mouth only then did i release him kissing my way back up his body until my lips found his it was a desperate thing that kiss filled with the urgency that fueled our bodies on your hands and knees grace he murmured against my mouth i obeyed and a second later he took me from behind thrusting hard and deep god it felt good he stretched me filled me in a way no man ever had and all i could do was groan in pleasure for several seconds neither of us moved enjoying the sensation of oneness enjoying the tension and the pulsing heat of need that swirled through and around us then he began to thrust sliding through my slickness with ease claiming me fully deeply and so very thoroughly the feel of him penetrated every fiber enveloping me with a heat that was so basic so powerful and so very wonderful his hands were on my hips holding me steady as he rocked deep it was a touch that seemed to brand my skin as his thrusts gradually became more urgent jolts shuddered through me and desire raged flaring across my body like an outofcontrol wildfire building quickly to the final crescendo come with me grace i want to hear it i want to hear you his words were hoarse urgent his breath hot as it whispered across my skin his powerful body pumped fast and deep driving me insane with pleasure i pressed back harder against him urging him deeper still wanting needing every inch of him he groaned thrusting harder faster and it felt so good i cried out still he stroked and the sweet pressure built and built until it felt like i was going to explode and then everything did oh god yes he came with me his roar echoing across the silence his body slamming mine so hard my hands were sliding in the sand i clawed at it trying to gain some purchase as i shuddered and groaned and drowned in a myriad of delicious sensations and the thick feeling of repletion and when it was over one thought echoed through my mind it would be all too easy to become addicted to ethans style of loving chapter once we get dressed and pack up itll be time to go see the other kid he said sitting back on his heels and looking at his watch not a man for afterfucking small talk obviously not that that entirely surprised me weres were notorious for not caring about that sort of stuff you pack up i need to clean up i rose and walked down to the beach rinsing the scent of man and sex from my skin in the gentle waves maybe now that the cobwebs had been cleared i could get back on an even keel and act a little more sensibly around the damn man but given the ripple of pleasure that ran across my body as i watched him dress perhaps that was a faint hope seems my hormones werent finished with him yet i walked out of the waves and grabbed my tshirt using that to dry myself off before getting dressed the salty scent of sea clung to my skin and i could feel the grit of sand in places that were just damn uncomfortable so much for being careful ready ethan asked once i was dressed yeah i said keeping my tone as matteroffact as his something flickered in his eyes but hed turned before i could pin it down we walked in single file up the beach and back to the car the kid was home from football practice by the time we arrived at his house and like the other teenagers he was nervous moving restlessly on the old kitchen chair and not meeting either of our gazes when his mom introduced us in fact he was so nervous i could taste it on the air this one you can push i murmured hell tell ethan nodded briefly then squatted down in front of the kid jimmy you know whats happened to brad and jon dont you he shook his head sending long blond strands flying i dont know anything but you do know what brad and jon were doing just before they disappeared no he said it too quickly then looked up at his mom can i go now i squeezed ethans shoulder to stop him answering then said jimmy telling us the truth might mean the difference between saving jons life and killing him his eyes widened the papers lied jons not dead maybe not yet which is why we need all the help we can get i dont know do you want to save your friend or not it was horrible to lump that sort of guilt onto the kid but we werent only trying to save jons life here he swallowed heavily okay what were you doing last week that you shouldnt have ethan asked immediately we were over at the manton house the kid looked at his mom it was a dare jimmy how many times do we have to tell you that damn place is danger mrs jenkins thats not helping right now ethan cut in voice curt then added what did you do there jimmy went to the cellars dead things live in the cellars i shared a glance with ethan what sort of dead things he shrugged never seen them but theres bones and stuff and a coffin its neat only a teenage boy would classify finding a coffin as a neat thing was there anyone in the coffin nah but it was moved around a lot other teenage boys or something more sinister did you ever see anything or anyone else out there he snorted like a vampire get real vampires dont live in wild dog creek the place is too boring says the authority of youth ethan muttered as he rose wheres the manton house mrs jenkins just follow this road to the top of the hill you cant miss the place thanks he half turned then hesitated can i suggest you take any house keys off jimmy and keep an eye on him for the next few days we dont think someones breaking in to grab the boys we think the boys are willingly walking out with her what jimmy said obviously horrified at the prospect of losing his freedom no way am i giving up my keys how will i get back into the house if i go out thats the whole point his mom said with a grim sort of relish you arent going out for a while the kid groaned i restrained my smile and followed ethan out to the car once we were on our way again i asked why would a vampireeven an energy vampireneed a coffin they dont but some vamps do enjoy living up to human expectations he shrugged but if this vamp is trying to remain under the wire why leave a coffin laying around until we know the history of the house and whatever is in it thats not a question i can answer i looked upwards as the car started climbing all there was to see on the horizon was an oddly leaning chimney reaching for the sky past a line of pines maybe we should call frank and get in some specialists werewolves and shifters were fast and strong but vampires outdid us in both areas and had the advantage of being able to disappear into shadows we might be able to track her with scent but we might never get near enough to kill her and i wasnt entirely sure i was up to the whole killing bit anyway that wasnt my field of expertise but it was ethans and he seemed more than a little put out by my suggestion we dont need help to deal with one lone vampire i raised an eyebrow you have the equipment here he gave me a grin that had my toes curling i always come equipped ravioli heard that about you i looked up at the pines we were rapidly approaching dusk was settling in and the sky above the chimney was streaked with pink not sure its a wise move to be entering a vamps lair on the cusp of night if we want to save that kid then we have to move now i knew all that i just didnt like the sensations that were already beginning to crawl across my skin the nearer we got to that house the road ended we drove through an old wooden gate and up the winding drive the house revealed itself slowly a long twostory building that was all angles and windows wrapped in shadows and age goosebumps tripped across my skin and i couldnt help shivering this place just felt wrong and i hadnt even gone inside it yet i can see why teenagers would enjoy this place ethan commented as he parked the car out front its kinda spookylooking isnt it understatement of the year i muttered and climbed out of the car the breeze that swayed the pine tops merely whispered across the old building as if reluctant to stir the house to life the air was thick and filled with a gloom that felt heavy on my tongue traces of darkness and evil teased my psychic senses taunting indications of what was to come once i entered the house ethan had raided the trunk and handed me a flashlight and several stakes they werent particularly large those stakes but thick and sharp i shoved them into my pocket pointy end down so they didnt stab me in the back as i moved and watched while he strapped on a gun a bullet wont stop a vampire i said eventually it will if you shoot their fucking brains out he slammed the trunk closed you ready no i thought then blew out a breath and nodded as one we walked up the old steps and approached the front door paint peeled from its battered surface like old skin and another tremor ran through me ethan raised a hand and with his fingertips pushed open the door it didnt creak nor did the dying sunlight seem to penetrate very far past the threshold the inside of the house was all shadows and gloom just like the outside he took a step then stopped his nostrils flaring i can smell the dead he looked at me and not vampiretype dead i drew in a breath tasting the flavors that ran with the air shadows of evil and darkness ran across my psychic senses an evil that felt old and yet young at the same time but underneath that the aroma of decay of rotting flesh and putridity it cant be the boys it tastes older than that he nodded then motioned me to follow we stepped into the shadows it felt like we were stepping into another world it was still this house so still and yet somehow so watchful though there were broken windows in the rooms that we passed as we made our way down the hall neither sunshine nor wind seemed to go beyond their threshold the musty smell of decay and age lay thick on the air and yet these scents were almost pleasant when compared to the deeper darker aromas that ran underneath whatever used this house for a sanctuary it had been here a long time so long the house seemed a part of it rather than merely a refuge we walked past some worseforwear stairs the beams of the flashlight highlighting long dustcovered webs that trailed like a curtain from the ceiling high above the scent of dead flesh led us to the rear of the house ethan pressed open another door took the flashlight and had a quick look around kitchen he said theres a cellar door to the right dead things lived in the cellars jimmy had said i shuddered and had to fight the urge to run to just get out of this house and away from the evil it sheltered but if teenagers had the courage to go down those stairs then i damn well could he directed the flashlights beam into the cellar door illuminating the wellworn stairs and the boardedup walls the air drifting up was damp musty and the scent of flesh and decay stronger i swallowed heavily and started breathing through my mouth it only helped a little the stairs creaked as we went down them the sound jarring sharply against the thick silence the watchfulness of the house seemed to increase the further we descended into the cellars darkness and yet i couldnt pinpoint it to the presence of a vampire which didnt mean it wasnt near just that i couldnt sense it in the stinking air the stairs finally met floor ethan swept the light across the black the bright beam pinpointing corners cobwebs and shelving stocked with cans and other goods that looked as old as the house no bones or coffins though i wasnt sure whether to be relieved or not theres another door over here he pointed the light to a right corner then he reached back with his free hand and wrapped his fingers around mine are you all right for a moment i clung to him needing the warmth and the strength that flowed from his grip to battle the chill beginning to invade my soul just you can go upstairs no i cut in we both need to confront this evil he didnt question the certainty in my voice just squeezed my fingers again then released me the room seemed darker more depressing without his touch we went through the second door our footsteps echoed and the boards creaked under our weight it was here we found jimmys bones and coffin these are years old ethan said picking up what looked like a femur and studying it i shuddered it was bad enough feeling the wisps of agony stirring the air touching the bones of the dead would only intensify that connection and that i didnt need i walked over to the coffin sitting against the wall with the lid open it was squat and fat and far wider than a normal coffin and it was made of hardwood that had hastily been banged together and then lined on the inside with what looked like an old blanket homemade rather than professional this isnt the coffin of an adult i said squatting down next to it strands of eagerness and darkness rose from the inside of the box as if the emotions had soaked through the wood over time and it belongs to our vampire but why would a vamp use it when they dont need to maybe she gets off on scaring the crap out of visiting teenagers he shrugged and rose none of these things is the source of our smell we need to find that we may have needed to but i didnt particularly want to i might not be able to talk to souls but i could hear them could feel their hopes their dreams and their deaths lingering on the air and these particular deaths already felt bad enough i didnt know if i could face the pain that waited where their bodies lay we walked on the creaking in the boards increased until the whole floor seemed to vibrate under each step this doesnt feel particularly safe i muttered ethan stopped again and held out one hand i wrapped my fingers in his gratefully it might not be any safer but damn if i didnt feel more secure a large crack ran across the silence as we moved on i paused but ethan tugged me forward i doubt wed fall very far even if the flooring gave away he said there are probably only a couple of inches between the boards and the earth just for ventilation the words were barely out of his mouth when there was an almighty snap and the flooring underneath us fell away and we were falling tumbling into deeper darkness chapter i hit earth with a crunch that jarred every bone from toes to neck and fell sideways with a gasp wood and dust rained around me and something sharp speared into my leg i yelped and scrambled to my hands and feet moving into the deeper darkness desperate to get out of the path of the stillfalling wood grace ethan said his voice little more than a hiss of air you okay yeah just gotta stop a cut from bleeding i called to my wolf shape felt the surge of magic roll my body shifting changing and in the process healing to my wolf nose the scents in the air sharpened dramatically and i knew without even seeing it that bloody death awaited discovery a hairsbreadth away i shifted shape again and said point the flashlight my way there were several clicks then light flared across the utter black i turned bodies lay before me bodies in various stages of disintegration some fully fleshed some not but all rotting and the smell my stomach turned and bile rose thick and fast up my throat i gagged and quickly backed away not wanting to puke over those who already suffered enough not that theyd know but their ghosts might and their ghosts were here in this room filling the shadows with their pain and confusion and horror the sheer force of it flooded my senses making my whole body shudder and my heart ache my god ethan said softly there have to be at least twenty of them the ghosts were stirring whispering warning i gulped down air trying to keep calm trying to keep their shadows and pain at arms length and then something else stirred out there in the blackness there was no sound no shifting of air nothing to indicate movement but i felt it all the same evil had woken i backed away until i reached ethan and slowly reached for the flashlight directing the bright beam toward the distant shadows ahead there was a quick gleam like the sparkle of a cats eyes caught in moonlight then it was gone evil was on the move ethan swore softly keep behind me he said taking his gun from the holster the click of the safety being released echoed across the heavy silence i reached back freeing the stakes and gripping them tightly can you smell it i asked he shook his head the reek of decay is so strong its overwhelming everything else you i flared my nostrils sucking in the foul air letting it run across my other senses even against the thick stink of rotting flesh the taste of evil could not hide its to our right near the wall waiting watching he swept the light in that direction again eyes sparkled briefly before disappearing its retreating i said softly then lets follow it to its lair lets not i thought but followed him onwards anyway the utter blackness seemed to close in on us as thick and as heavy as a blanket the vampire was out there but it wasnt running wasnt scared just moving away trying to avoid us like a kid who knows she shouldnt be out i thought as a chill ran across my skin if there was a kid could there be a parent was this evil swirling through the air the sum of two vampires not one the room ended in a shoredup wall ethan swept the light left then right until the bright beam highlighted a break in the wall a break that led into stone and dirt and the chill of deeper underground i didnt know there were any caverns in this area i said wincing a little as my voice echoed across the heavy silence its not natural there are pick marks could be part of an old mine that the house was built over an old mine that a vampire had labeled homei stilled suddenly and raised my nose sucking in the foul air there entwined in darkness and old evil was another familiar scent jons here i whispered to the left i smell him i cant hear him though though i strained my ears i couldnt hear anything either no breathing no scent of life nothing that would indicate anything else lived in this foul place we moved into the cavern ethan swept the light across dank walls until it finally came to rest on the body of a boy there was no sign of life because jon was dead his face gaunt and pale his neck torn open his mouth red from bloody kisses kisses that had sucked his life force after it had sucked his blood shit ethan said and moved forward in that moment evil attacked look out i yelled a heartbeat before the vampire hit ethan he leapt aside but not fast enough a whirlwind of evil swamped him scrawny arms and legs all force all power the gun and light went flying and for an instant we plunged into darkness then the flashlight flickered back to life and for several heartbeats i could only watchheart in my mouthas ethan battled the thin but farfromfrail vampire he blocked more blows than a werewolf should have been able to but the vampires speed still allowed many others to get through i gripped the stakes so hard my knuckles were practically glowing and ran at the pair of them the vampire spun and hissed sharp teeth gleaming and green eyes glowing with unearthly fire in the dark i propped and stabbed with the stake aiming for her heart the vamp twisted away then dropped and lashed out with a bare foot i jumped the blow saw ethan dive forward tackling the vampire at waist height in an obvious attempt to drag her down wolves were strong but vamps were stronger and this one had the power of a fresh feed behind her he barely even moved her she hissed again then twisted around and smashed ethan in the head throwing him down and back and then she lunged at me i dropped to the ground her shadow soared over my head and the stench of blood and death and sheer evil was so bad i gagged the soft thump of her landing told me where she was even if her scent was too overwhelming to pinpoint it exactly i spun and lashed out with a booted foot the blow connected with solid darkness and she grunted but it didnt stop her i twisted whipping the stake across the darkness felt it scrape across flesh saw sparks flicker like fireflies she howled and lashed out with a clenched fist i leaned back felt the breeze of the blow brush past my chin i didnt even see her other fist it caught the side of my face with enough force to knock me off my feet i hit the floorboards with a grunt the stakes flying from my hands as i battled to catch my breath then her weight hit me her body covering my length pinning me to the floor her stench flooded my senses making it hard to breathe to think to feel anything but darkness and evil grace thrust up ethan yelled i bucked with my body dislodging her grip on me slightly then i shoved my arms between us and thrust her back with every ounce of strength i had it was enough to push her up and away from me a gunshot rang out and the vampires head exploded blood and flesh and god knows what else sprayed across the wall as the vampires body slumped to the floor i scrambled to my hands and feet sweeping the floor with my fingers looking for the stakes and finding them let me ethan said taking one from me and moving with grim resolution to the vampire in one smooth clean motion he drove the stake through her sternum into her heart fire flared where wood met flesh quickly becoming an inferno that consumed what remained of the vampire i released a shuddery breath and closed my eyes at least she could no longer threaten anyone so why did it feel as if evil still resided in this house are you okay ethans voice was filled with concern as he dropped to his knees in front of me i nodded it doesnt feel like its over though it still feels like this house has secrets yeah and that secret is just how many people have found their deaths at that vampires hands no its more than that he looked past me nostrils flaring as his gaze swept the darkness i cant smell anything beyond old death and new blood can your psychic senses pick anything up just a continuing sense of evil if this vamp was a fosterling then its creator would have appeared the minute we attacked her i know i know it still didnt ease the feeling we were missing something or someone but maybe that was merely nerves a leftover of the evil that had been entrenched in this house for generations lets go back to the guest house and write up a report for frank he said taking my hand and tugging me to my feet well let him and the cops deal with the rest of this mess with that i couldnt argue chapter writing the report turned out to be a euphemism for getting back and having sex not that i minded after all the death and decay of that house i needed to feel life and heat and healthy emotions needed it to sweep away the remaining strands of darkness latched to my soul the minute the door slammed shut he grabbed my hand and drew me into his arms his body was warm and hard against mine his gaze fierce im so glad you werent seriously hurt he muttered and i have so needed to do this this was his mouth on mine plundering hard our tongues tangling tasting the kiss urgent and hungry he pushed me back until i hit the wall the thunder of his heart matched mine and the heat of him warmed every pore but the hard length of him pressed firmly against my belly was nowhere near close enough his hands were on me his fingers scorching my flesh as he ripped off my clothes i unbuttoned his pants tore off his shirt then he was in me filling me liquefying me his thick groan of pleasure was a sound i echoed he began to move and there was nothing gentle about it his body plundered as his lips had plundered his movements hard and fast and urgent the rich ache grew becoming a kaleidoscope of sensations that washed through every corner of my mind then the shuddering took hold and i gasped grabbing his shoulders clambering up his body to wrap my legs around his waist and push him deeper still pleasure exploded between us as he thrust and thrust and thrust when the tremors finally eased he laughed softly and rested his forehead against mine i could get addicted to this what sex i thought all werewolves were anyway trust me theres sex and then theres sex he kissed me gently but its you grace thats addictive an addiction cannot be gained after only two nibbles i refuted not wanting to give any credence to the tiny spark of hope that flared deep inside the flare that dared to think this could be more than just another brief fling i said you grace not the sex you dont know me well enough to get addicted i let my legs slide to the ground and pushed him back a little coffee when are you going to learn that pushing me away only makes me more determined he asked voice hinting at frustration though there was little enough to be seen in his expression perhaps thats why i wasnt willing to trust his words i told you before its selfpreservation and i have never given you a reason to distrust me nor do i intend to what could i say to that that i didnt trust the fact a werewolf could stay with one partner for more than a couple of days that my heart wasnt willing to give him the chance of proving me wrong simply because i was afraid of him breaking it how could i win what i wanted if i wasnt willing to put anything more than my body on the line that was a cowards way and up until now id never been a coward i turned on the coffee machine and looked out the window as i reached for the coffee mugs and saw the thin pale face that was almost the spitting image of the vampire wed killed felt the sudden thickening in the air the charge of darkness and evil across my senses i barely had time to open my mouth and she was through that window and at me she was thin and weedy and stinking of blood and sex and grief and i knew id been right before that it hadnt been just one vampire who was killing the boys but two they were twins of darkness one a blood vampire the other an energy vamp she hit me in a rush pushing me back and down the back of my head cracked against the floorboards and the shock of it left me gasping for air the vamp snarled her breath fetid as it washed across my face i looked up saw fangs gleaming brightly in the pale kitchen light saw them slash down toward my neck i shoved my arms between us felt her teeth slice into skin not to feed but to mutilate and maim and kill she twisted her head dragging her teeth through muscle and flesh slicing through both as cleanly as a knife through butter pain rolled through me and i screamed she sucked in the sound and an excited gleam flared in the dead dark depths of her eyes this one was the energy vamp not the other and then she was gone thrown across the room like so much rubbish and ethan was hauling me up thrusting me behind him we have no weapons i gasped cradling my wounded arm blood dripped between my fingertips dropping to the floor filling the room with its sweet metallic scent run for the car he said ill keep it occupied he lunged for the vampire but it moved so fast it literally blurred swinging and kicking in one fluid movement ethan dodged sucking in his gut somehow avoiding the blow and landing one of his own the vamp staggered back then caught her balance and threw a punch it landed in ethans side so hard i heard bone snap he grunted but didnt back away hitting the vamp a second time his fist smashing into the vamps face and mashing her nose back against his face blood spurted and she snarled in fury as much as i didnt want to i turned from the fight and ran for the door we needed weapons and we needed them fast but suddenly the vampire was there her fist flying i ducked but not fast enough and the blow hit my chin and sent me reeling backwards i crashed into the table felt it give underneath me and fell to the floor amongst the ruins of wood dimly i saw ethan and the vampire struggling fighting against the door frame saw ethan being flung back the vampire coming at me yet again i scrambled backwards desperate to get out of her way the jagged remains of the table speared into my butt and scattered across the floor wood i thought and grabbed the nearest sharpest bit gripping it tight and thrusting it with all the force i could muster at the vampire the needlesharp point arrowed through flesh and bone straight into her heart fire flared where wood met flesh and spread quickly across her body the heat of it burning me setting my clothes alight she screamed i screamed and the smell of burning flesh and material rent the air i struggled against her weight trying to push her off me but she wouldnt move wouldnt budge and i was panicking burning and then she was gone and ethan was there yet again tearing off my shirt and stamping out the flames before dragging me into his arms he kissed my cheeks my nose my lips and he was shuddering shaking as much as i was next time i ignore your instincts feel free to knock me over the head with a baseball bat he said after a while i laughed shakily and pulled back i need to shift shape to stop the bleeding he nodded and sat back i shifted to wolf form healing the wound enough to stop the bleeding then shifted back to my human shape well at least thats over with you sure i nodded i only felt one other presence how long do you think they were living in that house probably as long as the house has been around if the bodies and bones are anything to go by but how could so many deaths go unreported im betting they mostly snatched tourists or teenagers who were on their own i guess as towns like this got built up there were fewer drifters and farmhands that could be taken unnoticedand that only left the unwary but why go after kids with families especially if they were trying to avoid notice who knows maybe the lone tourists have been scarce and they had no other choice maybe the boys were simply easy prey he shrugged and reached out cupping my cheek with his palm letting his thumb brush my lips heat slithered through me an aching that was mind and body and as i stared into his bright watchful eyes i knew that whatever the consequences to my heart i had to see this thing through had to see where we went ethan im not asking for commitment grace he cut in i just want you to stop running and give me some time i smiled and kissed his fingertips time i can give good he said as that dangerously sexy light came back into his eyes so now we can get back to our report making i grinned is this going to become a standard feature of our working together totally his breath washed heat across my lips sending anticipation and desire racing through my limbs cant think of a better way to get over the tedium of writing a report neither could i curse of the dragons tears heidi betts chapter he watched her from the shadows his breath speeding up the blood pumping hard through his veins it had been years since anyone had set foot inside the walls of his refuge anyone other than juveniles up to no good daring each other to cross the threshold of the eerie and reportedly haunted castle mackay but this onethis womanwas no adolescent bent on mischief she was up to something he could tell by the way she glanced around slowly and with great interest and by the bags she was carrying one thrown over her shoulder the other clutched in her hand at knee level long shafts of evening sunlight shone through the tall thin windows illuminating the specks of dust in the air and sending wavering slivers of blue and violet through the womans otherwise inky black hair she wore a loose pink top with some type of picture and writing on it and a small golden cross that hung to just between her full rounded breasts her legs were covered in denim a thin black belt at her slim waist and sturdy brown hiking boots on her feet with a sigh she let the duffle in her hand fall to the dirt floor lowering the bag on her shoulder much more gently this should be fun she muttered she twisted around looking for a moment in his direction and he jerked back standing even tighter against the wall from the corner of his eye he could still see her but he didnt think shed seen him if she had she wouldnt even now be walking back outside at a leisurely pace no if shed seen him she would be running and screaming in fear only a few minutes after shed disappeared through the castles main if crumbling entrance she returned with a rolledup sleeping bag a worn leather satchel and a large silver thermos his heart thrummed in his ears pounding hard against his ribcage as she began spreading out the sleeping bag and he realized she meant to stay here overnight in his secret lair fists clenching at his sides he watched her torn between fury at having his private sanctuary invaded and acute interest at being so close to another human beinga womanfor the first time in a hundred years stifling a yawn laura tomescu finished spreading out her things and creating a space on the ground to both sleep and work though she wasnt entirely sure where to begin she was itching to get started on the undertaking that had brought her here in the first place and to explore castle mackay which had apparently been abandoned nearly a century ago from the dirt on the floor and the cobwebs coating the ceiling she could believe it she shuddered at the thought of what was likely crawling around in this shadowed room but she knew in her bones that this would be where shed find the answers to all of her questions and so she was ready to face almost anythingeven the creepy crawlies living in this abandoned keep but it was late and shed already had a long day of traveling and talking with townspeople from the village below it seemed that everyone in this part of scotland knew of the halfman halfbeast who was said to haunt the area whether he truly lived in castle mackay no one could say for sure what they would say depending on who shed asked was that he was either a saint or a monster some claimed that he butchered sheep or stole children from their beds others swore that he left gifts of food or clothing on their doorsteps or had saved them from harm in one way or another laura didnt know what to believe and she wasnt sure it mattered she was here because of her familys part in the legend of dougal mackayor perhaps she should say her familys part in the curse and because of the dreams shed been having about him for the past several years dreams that were growing stronger and more vivid with each passing day so she would bunk down here for the night then wake up early to begin her exploration as eager as she was to solve the mystery eating up such a large chunk of her life she wasnt quite as enthusiastic about poking around a dark dingy supposedly haunted castle by herself with nothing to light her way but a flashlight better to wait until morning when she could see and maybe if she was lucky when there would be less chance of running into things that went bump in the night kicking off her boots and jeans she shook out the hem of her tshirt until it fell to midthigh as sleepwear went it was sorely lacking but it would do for a single night alone on a dirt floor shoving her feet into the opening of her sleeping bag she scrunched down and made herself as comfortable as possible she closed her eyes and yawned again a faint trace of uneasiness skittering down her spine not for the first time she felt as though she was being watched and if her dreams and research could be believed she had a pretty good idea whator rather whoher observer might be the good news was she didnt think itor hewould hurt her but since she couldnt be positive that was one more reason to put off her search until tomorrow confrontations of this sort were better left for the bright light of day screwing her eyes tightly shut she gave a slight shiver and snuggled deeper beneath the folds of her sleeping bag if she started thinking about him and rats and all the other creepycrawly things that might be sneaking around this place shed never get any rest and the sooner she fell asleep the sooner it would be morning so she could wake up and get started on her quest forliterallythe man of her dreams shed been asleep only a few minutes when the dream began and she knew it was a dream knew it was one of those dreams even as she drifted through that delicate space between slumber and reality she was in castle mackay curled up in her sleeping bag but she wasnt alone it was no rat or spider keeping her company either but a man dougal he stepped out of the shadows all sixplusfeet of him and walked toward her he moved slowly making no sound as he crossed the earthen floor giving her a chance to study him he was barechested wearing nothing more than a kilt and softsoled worn leather boots his hair was black tousled and long enough to brush his broad wellformed shoulders his green eyes glowed looking serpentine in the dark with their thin vertical pupils and his fleshevery inch of that strong impressive chest that she could seewas covered with a beautiful almost iridescent sort of tattoo but not of any picture or form she could make out instead it looked like layer after layer of lovely colorfulscales that might have seemed odd to her probably had in the beginning but after so many dreams of this man she was not only used to the unique markings but found them attractive and erotic to the extreme even as that thought flitted through her brain he was upon her kneeling down and flipping back the top fold of the sleeping bag heat radiated from every pore of his body as he stared down at her taking in her pale pink tshirt with its hibiscus flowers and hula girl advertising hawaii as a great place to get leied the hem had ridden up around her hips leaving her stark white frenchcut bikini panties in full view he murmured a single word low and emphatic but in a language she didnt understand had never heard before shed begun having these dreams and then he was loosening the wide belt at his waist kicking off his calfhigh boots and letting the blue black and green fabric of his family tartan fall to the floor a second later he was stretched out full length on top of her his mouth covered hers furnace hot sending flickering flames down her throat and to her very center he bit licked sucked devoured her like a starving man at an allyoucaneat buffet the firm contours of his muscled chest and arms pressed in on her his legs straddling her own the rigid length of his arousal rubbing against the soft material at the apex of her thighs she had been wet long before he touched her one glance at his rippling masculine body towering over her and shed turned liquid with fiery lust her nipples were puckered and jutting beneath the cotton of her top as she writhed beneath him his lips and teeth burned her flesh tugged at her lips skimming her cheek trailing down the line of her throat he lifted up only long enough to grab the bottom of her shirt in his large longfingered hands and strip it off over her head then he lowered his head again and feasted at her breast her back arched on a moan her fingers threading through his black hair as his tongue circled her areola the budded tip and then drew her fully into his mouth yes please she scratched at his back with her nails lifting reaching for more the heat of his long seeking member brushing between her legs made her want him inside her now hard hot fast she rotated her hips trying to hurry him trying to take him in even before she was fully naked andthank you jesushe took the hint his rough callused fingers traced her waist and then her legs taking her underwear with them without ceremony he shoved her legs apart settled himself between them and thrust home laura gasped at the feel of him embedded so deeply and stretching her to accommodate his incredible size she took a moment to concentrate on her breathing and before she knew it her body relaxed going soft and loose around him he gave her only a moment to recover before lifting her legs over the crooks of his elbows growling low in his throat and beginning to pump her back arched at the intensity of sensations racing through her blood he was a demon pounding into her like a jackhammer harder faster and she responded rising to meet his rapid movements raking his back with her nails emitting highpitched keens of delight from the back of her throat that shed never heard herself make before almost without warning the orgasm ripped over her sharp and powerful she screamed her pleasure clutching at him more tightly as he continued to thrust frantically and then he stopped going still above her as he came with a roar spilling inside her as quickly as the dream had begun it faded away and she drifted more deeply into sleep she was exhausted and nowthanks to one of the most violent orgasms of her lifethoroughly sated long after the woman had crawled under the blankets and gone to sleep dougal watched her watched her chest rise and fall with her deep even breathing watched her mouth drift open and her eyelids flutter as she slipped further into slumber he wished that he could show himself go to her and coax her slowly awake with passionate kisses and a slow caress he imagined stripping her of blankets and that fitted shirt devouring her as he hadnt had the chance to devour a woman in a century or more when she moaned and rolled to her back he straightened away from the wall afraid she may have sensed his presence he shouldnt have to hide in his own castle but nor could he risk discovery a moment later it became obvious she was still asleep but the moans continued perhaps she was dreaming of monsters and ghouls and other things that went bump in the night he was sure any woman spending the night alone in an abandoned scottish castle was likely to be skittish his brows crossed though when she threw off half of the thick red sleeping bag as hed pictured himself doing revealing her torso and the tops of her smooth shapely legs and then his brows arched shooting high up on his forehead as one hand with its softly painted nails lifted to cup her own breast through the material of her formfitting top the other slid over her waist and under the small wisp of material that covered her private areas his erection which had already been at halfmast simply from observing her for the past few hours shot to full attention in his mind he pictured where he wanted her hands to go the areas he wished his own hands could explore and to his amazement she seemed to follow his silent commands she continued to touch herself making tiny mewling sounds of need and arching up as though meeting a lovers caress the hand at her breast moved beneath the shirt to tease bare flesh her nipples hardened to swollen pointing peaks sending a lightning bolt of lust straight to his groin clenching his teeth to keep from groaning aloud he lifted his kilt and wrapped his hand firmly around his shaft it had been a hundred years since hed touched a woman and though he wasnt shy about relieving his own pentup desires when the need grew too great he hadnt had the luxury of watching a woman in the throes of passion to help himself along for a hundred years either he was hot and heavy his erection pointing skyward with an arousal he hadnt felt in recentor extendedmemory several feet away the woman began to thrash spreading her legs wider driving her hand deeper into what he knew would be full slick pink folds it took every ounce of his control not to stalk forward remove her hand and replace it with his eager raging erection what would it feel like to bury himself inside a woman again to kiss and fondle and thrust his way to completion of all the things he missed from his former life he thought perhaps he missed fucking a willing lass most her cries threatening to send him over the brink he tightened his hold on himself his fingers dancing and tugging on the rigid length his own breathing grew ragged as he continued to watch the woman pleasuring herself as his movements sped up and his legs turned weak with impending climax it was all he could do not to close his eyes in ecstasy but he wanted to see her wanted to watch the muscles in her thighs tighten her back bow her face contort as she reached her peak when she did her shout echoed off the stone walls and through the keep sending his blood past the boiling point with it went the last of his control as he came in great wracking spasms if hed ever had an orgasm such as that before in his misbegotten life he certainly couldnt recall it it made him almost glad the woman had come to his castle encroaching upon his invisible but private boundaries it even made a part of him wish she might stay a while chapter laura awoke bright and early feeling relaxed looselimbed and happy as she always did after one of her erotic dreams about the mysterious dougal mackay as she dressed and gathered her things she found herself smiling for no particular reason and actually looking forward to the task ahead of exploring this intimidating rundown keep also typical of the mornings after having one of her bizarre dreams about a man shed never met she wondered how much of them might be true and how much was simply her imagination running wild did dougal mackay really exist according to family stories and journals left behind by her greatgrandmother cosmina he had at one time but that didnt mean that the legends of his continued existence were true he could have died years ago many many years ago if his age at the time of her greatgrandmother cosminas curse was any indication if the curse had worked however he would still be alive and may not have aged a day since the enthralling words were spoken she also wondered at the scales that covered his body in her dreams and the breath that was hot as lava were those too a result of the hex her greatgrandmother had thrust upon him or merely the way her subconscious chose to picture a man who would have been cursed in such a way she didnt know but she prayed she would find out after all she hadnt made the trip all the way from the united states to scotland for nothing outside the day was glorious with the sun shining and a gentle breeze ruffling the tall green grass surrounding the castle to document her search shed brought along a number of notebooks as well as her camera she snapped several pictures inside the first initial room of the keep then walked around outside to do the same the landscape really was beautiful and she could understand why someone hundreds of years ago had decided to build their castle here overlooking both the ocean and the valley below but the longer she lingered outdoors and the more she found to photograph the more she realized she was stalling because as much as she wanted to find dougal mackay and discover the facts of the legend and her dreams the truth was she was afraid afraid of what she would findand afraid of finding nothing afraid of learning that the images that had haunted her for years now werent realor that they were to further her procrastination she considered going into town for breakfast but then decided that was only avoiding the inevitable she should get down to business and see what she could discover before she was faced with another long lonely night inside this dreary castle ignoring the tickle of anticipation that skated down her spine she carried her camera back inside and gathered her other more wellworn leather tote that contained some of the notes and clippings and research shed gathered for this trek as well as several cans of soda and the energy bars shed brought along for situations just like this when she might not have the timeor the inclinationto go into town for a bite to eat with her camera dangling in the crook of her elbow she tossed the satchel strap over her shoulder and tore open the wrapper of one of the bars biting into the yogurtcovered granola while she slowly made her way deeper into the keep chewing worked as a bit of a distraction but still her heart pounded inside her chest and the muscles of her diaphragm contracted as she struggled to breathe normally nothing will hurt you nothing will hurt you she told herself over and over she was here for a reason and even if she was very afraid monstersat least the storybook kindreally did exist she was determined to see this quest through to the end sunlight shone in narrow muted beams through the door and tall windows of the main room but past that the structure was still fairly dark and dank that didnt keep her from noticing a great number of cobwebs she hadnt the night before though her booted feet scuffed through the dirt covering the stone floor as she tiptoed deeper into the structure it was beautiful in a way she could picture it one or two hundred years agoa fire blazing in the hearth tapestries covering the walls a long trestle table crowded with people eating roasted boar and mutton stew she lifted her camera to snap a picture here or there as she moved along but found nothing of exceptional interest with the exception of an occasional brokendown table or chair any furniture had been removed long ago to her right a wide stone staircase led to the second level where she imagined bedchambers and maybe a solar had been located she was just turning to move in that direction when a noise from the other side of the keep deep in the heart of the castle startled her she stood frozen pulse kicking as she slowly turned her head toward where she thought the sound had come from something had rattled like glasses clinking together only louder it was probably just one of those rats shed envisioned sharing her space last night but if it wasntwell she was looking for the castles rumored inhabitant so following the noise might be the way to go whether she wanted to or not taking a deep breath she slowly spun on one foot and tiptoed across the earthen floor far at the back of the keep to the left of one of the hearths was the shadow of a doorway she hadnt noticed before stepping carefully and quietly she entered the cavernous area her hand tracing the rough stone of the wall to guide her path about six steps in she hit a curved set of narrow stairs leading downwards shed left her flashlight behind but her eyes adjusted to the light enough to keep from tripping and falling to her death at first there was pitch dark but the closer she got to the bottom of the stairs the lighter it became a muted orange glow flickering at the base of the steps her eyes narrowed as she considered how that was even possible this had to be a basement or dungeon area underground where there couldnt be any windows and even if there were she would expect the light from outside to be whiter more like daylight than candle glow rounding the corner she sucked in a breath realizing it was candlelight there was a single thick taper stuffed into the neck of a stout wine bottle in the center of a small round wooden table burning strongly enough to illuminate the center of the room and cast shadows farther out it didnt take long for her mind to shake off the sense of surprise she was feeling and make the logical conclusion that for a candle to be burning here in the depths of the rundown abandoned castle there would have to be someone to light the candle she swallowed concentrating on the soft even rhythm of her breathing as she took in her surroundings there was a buildup of melted wax running in thick rivulets down the sides of the bottle holding the candle telling her it had been used for just that purpose many times before she also noticed several more bottles strewn aboutsome empty in a pile in the corner others full or halffull standing upright on the table or on the floor along the far wall there was a palletmuch like her own upstairsmade up of blankets and a single rattylooking pillow books and old food wrappers littered the floor it didnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that someone was living here living here in this old abandoned keep where there was no running water no electricity no anything but stone and dirt spiders and vermin until this moment she didnt think shed truly believe shed find the person she sought shed hoped shed told herself she would just to bolster her own spirits but deep down she wasnt sure shed actually expected to find the infamous dougal mackay now thoughsomeone was living here exactly where all of her research had led her and who else could it be but the man the villagers both feared and revered the man her greatgrandmother had cursed to a life of isolation a scuffling sound near the stairs had her spinning back around as a tall dark figure stepped out of the shadows he blocked the only exit her only means of escape and she was chagrined to realize that her brain was indeed urging her to run for her life she stayed where she was though even as her heart lurched and a scream worked its way involuntarily into her throat she locked her lips holding it back and did the same with her knees which had turned to rubber he loomed over her making her feel like jack after hed climbed his beanstalk to confront the giant he was covered from head to toe with some sort of cloak the hood large enough to hide his face from view and heat seemed to emanate from him in waves the same as it did in her dreams her fingers flexed at her sides and she shifted slightly fighting the urge to lift her camera and immediately begin snapping pictures of the man who until this moment had been more legend to her than fleshandblood fact hi she said cautiously licking her dry lips and then because she couldnt think of a single other thing to say beyond what was bouncing around in her head she blurted youre dougal mackay arent you even in the muted light of this underground room she could sense his surprise and sudden wariness its all right she continued when he seemed unwilling to answer the question im not here to hurt you or expose you or anything like that my name is laura tomescu and i believe you knew my greatgrandmother the woman who cursed you chapter dougal stared at the woman in front of him everything about her screamed danger and it took every ounce of bravery in his bones not to turn and make his escape running did not come naturally to him he had been no coward during his mortal years but after nearly a century of being reviled and hunted hed learned well when to flee and how to hide from those who would do him harm last night when this woman had first encroached upon his sanctuary hed thought her dangerous only in the way that all strangers could be dangerous to his safety if discovered they would be terrified of his appearance and perhaps cost him his last refuge now however he knew that she was a threat to him in much more dire ways get out he ordered the words scalding his throat as fury and alarm mingled in his gut excuse me her dark brows rose and instead of fear her expression conveyed only a whisper of shocked annoyance you dont belong here he took a menacing step forward letting the full brunt of his rage sweep forward in his words and the heat of his fiery breath get out or face my wrath if possible her brows lifted even higher but she stood her ground not the least intimidated by either his size or his wrath crossing her arms beneath the full swell of her breasts she cocked her head and tapped an impatient foot if this is how you talked to my greatgrandmother cosmina i can understand why she put a curse on you because dougal was used to people quaking in fear in his presence he was unsure how to respond to this slip of a woman who not only didnt flee in horror but had the nerve to return his ire with a sharp retort of her own perhaps retreat was the best plan of action after all he thought still somewhat taken aback by her behavior with a huff he turned for the stairs intending to leave her here and find somewhere outside deep in the woods to hide until the wretched wench was gone but just as his foot hit the first step she reached out to grab his arm it wasnt her attempt to stop him that did so but the fact that she was touching him no one had touched him in a hundred years not even those who had run him off from his own home with torches and pitchforks screaming that he was demon spawn and cursing him back to the devil and certainly no woman of her own free will but this onethis one was touching him not by accident but on purpose a ripple of something he was afraid came too close to abject gratitude and relief shuddered through him and he locked his knees to keep from sinking to the ground turning slowly back to face her he found her staring at him full in the face and her expression was not one of disgust or terror but of awe dont go she said softly im sorry i shouldnt have said that perhaps not but that didnt make her words any less true did it had he learned nothing in the hundred years since hed been transformed into a monster i dont even know she paused licked her lips seemed to struggle to put voice to her thoughts i dont even know if the stories ive heard are true if what the legends say my family did to you are fact or fiction fiction he snapped anger once again pushing the boundaries of his selfcontrol pulling back his hood he threw his cloak to the ground does this look to you like the work of an imaginary tale he expected to see revulsion in her eyes to hear the shrieks that had grown so familiar to his ears over the years instead he saw a strange curiosity fascination even her gaze roamed over him over every inch of exposed skin that even now flushed with the shame of his disfigurement she looked her fill taking in the reptilian slits of his eyes the multicolored patches marring his face the rough scales that covered his hands and arms and then she reached outreached out and touched him flesh to flesh he made a sound of protest and tried to shrug away out of instinct and selfpreservation but she held fast her grip tightening on his wrist not the least aghast by the feel of his flawed skin he held himself rigid still awaiting the moment when she would realize he was a fiend and she needed to run for her life but as the seconds ticked by eagerness began to pour through his blood like an elixir she was touching him caressing him now and she wasnt afraid how long had it been since hed experienced such a gift too long a century at least since his last clear memory of human contact he swallowed every muscle of his body growing tense as her fingers continued their exploration his mind spun back to the evening before when hed watched her writhing in pleasure and imagined her touching more than his arm stroking him with lust more than mere inquisitiveness it really was you she whispered the words breathy and low as she lifted her head and met his gaze her fingers continued to move in slow circles over the roughened flesh of his forearm sending streaks of longing straight to his groin last night every night it really was you in my dreams laura didnt think she imagined that they both stopped breathing at the same time the entire situation was incredible to her he was incredible to her he was real the man who had been plaguing herand pleasuring herin her dreams for so long was real and solid and standing right in front of her despite his appearance and the cruel reaction he seemed to expect from her he was beautiful not something to be hidden away or scorned but to be admired and celebrated the same colorful tattoo of scales that marked his arms circled his neck and fell in patches over his face and his eyeshis eyes were like nothing shed ever seen before a bright glowing green with black almost serpentine pupils at their centers a shiver ran down her spine but not from fear from delight it was him the man shed been dreaming of for what felt like forever the man who had touched her held her done unspeakably satisfying things to her body night after night shed nearly convinced herself that he was some strange erotic figment of her untamed imagination but even she hadnt truly believed her subconscious could concoct someone with eyes and skin just like his he was even hot to the touch the same as hed been in the dream it was startling amazing and though he was standing directly in front of her with her hands resting gently on his arms she still had a hard time wrapping her mind around the fact that fantasy had just become reality and she had finally found the man shed been dreaming of the one at the center of so many of the stories her family told and the legends passed down from generation to generation youdreamt about me he asked no longer looking as though he was desperate to get away from her his voice was low and deep and tinged with the scottish brogue she was just beginning to get used to last night she responded with a small nod so many nights i thought i was going crazy but theni remembered the stories i was told as a little girl of the man my greatgrandmother cursed to live as a beast and i started to wonder ive been looking for you confiding that to anyone else would have made laura feel like a fool but with dougal she felt completely comfortable as if shed known him for years and though they were only fantasies that came to her in the darkest hours of the night shed had him inside of her too many times to count if that didnt build a certain level of familiarity she didnt know what would his lips twisted into a snarl and the rough timbre of his voice grew even rougher your grandmother did this to me he askedthe words part statement part question all accusation beneath her fingers his muscles tensed growing rock hard and hot to the touch im afraid so will you tell me why and how she knew the stories knew what her family said had happened but she wanted to hear it from him hear his opinion and his telling of the tale momentarily releasing him she moved to the small table in the center of the room and set down her camera and tote reaching into the bag she pulled out a couple of energy bars and cans of soda here she said holding one of each out to him like a peace offering we can sit and have a bite to eat while you tell me what happened why my grandmother felt the need to do this to you he made a sound low in his throat but followed her when she moved to the far wall and sat amongst the blankets and rags that made up his sleeping pallet taking a spot beside her close but not touching he opened the bar shed given him and began to chew slowly and methodically the minutes ticked by while she did the same throwing them into an eerie but relaxed silence when shed finished her bar and sipped half the soda she shifted slightly in his direction once again meeting his dark intense gaze tell me she pressed when he showed no signs of speaking once again letting the tips of her fingers slide over the scaled flesh of his forearm please i really do need to know dougal finished off the chunk of granola laura had handed him and tossed the wrapper aside his lips pursed as he considered how much to tell her she was a stranger yet she claimed to be a descendant of the woman who had damned him to this unending life of hell on earth he had spent the last hundred years alone in hiding with only himself for company yet the pain of that isolation was quickly giving way to the desire to speak to share to take advantage of the opportunity to converse with another human being and if he understood her earlier remark correctly at the same time hed been watching herwatching her pleasure herself while he in turn pleasured himselfshed been dreaming of him as well shed never seen him before had certainly never seen his markings and disfigurement yet her subconscious had apparently caused her to dream of him in a most erotic manner not once but multiple times like a match tip flaring to life heat raced through his body bringing his shaft to rockhard attention his blood boiled with want and need and memory and a sense of possibility he hadnt experienced in a century swallowing hard he drew his attention back to her face even as his mind lingered on thoughts of yanking down her trousers and having his way with her pinning her to the wall and taking her until every ounce of pentup passion and desire poured out of him i was young he began young and arrogant and foolish i was the firstborn son of the great laird mackay and i thought i had the right how wrong he had been but then with age came wisdom and though his physical body showed no signs of the span of his life he certainly had the years to claim great insight the wild yearning humming in his veins slowed to a low simmer as he spoke and he expected the second less pleasant memory he was being forced to recall to begin a sour roil in his gut and burn his tongue like acid but a hundred years had apparently dulled the pain and degradation of that moment for he felt himself relating the story as though it was just thata story an unfortunate incident that had occurred to someone else it was a harsh winter that year with little food to be found and when i discovered a band of gypsies he cocked his head and met her eye your ancestors i presumehunting on my familys land i tried to drive them off one of the old womenyour greatgrandmotherwas not impressed by my grandiose behavior or my threat to remove them bodily if they refused to leave of their own free will she cursed me threw a bottle of some thick amber liquid at my chest which she claimed were dragons tears it soaked immediately through my clothes and onto my skin not burning but tingling i could feel it seeping into my pores spreading through my body that was when she began to chant a language i couldnt comprehend at first followed by one that i could she told me i would be forever hunted trapped in a form between man and beast the bodies of man and dragon becoming one until i learned the gifts of kindness and generosity of putting others needs before my own almost immediately i began to change i grew hot nearly unbearably so my flesh my bloodi could barely breathe from the heat and the pain but when i did those breaths hissed with smoke and sometimes fire i could feel my eyes changing to this he said waving a hand in front of his face to encompass what he knew laura saw when she looked at him at some point i lost consciousness when i woke the gypsies were gone as though theyd never been there to begin with i staggered home thinking id imagined the whole thing or perhaps that whatever the old crone had thrown at me had caused me to hallucinate it wasnt until i arrived back at the keepnot this one but one built later where my family residedthat i came to understand it was all too real by then the scales had broken out to cover most of my body as soon as the villagers and my family saw me they began to scream and cast me out for the demon i had become story told he fell silent and for a moment laura remained so too then her brow puckered and with censure clear in her tone she said your own family did that to you couldnt they understand didnt they at least want to know what had happened to you he shook his head once again stunned by her quick acceptance of both him and his accounting of past events as well as the fact that she instantly jumped to the defense of the youth hed once been it was a different time things that today would be considered merely unfortunate were then thought to be the work of the devil they ran me off with curses and prayers in the middle of the night i came to this keep which had been empty many years by then to hide and have been here ever since still laura didnt know what else to say after that so she let her words trail off her mind racing with the comparisons between her greatgrandmothers version of the incident with dougal mackay and what he had just told her shed listened to dougals deep scottish brogue with keen interest and more than a modicum of exhilaration not doubting his claims for a second any other sane person might have but she knew better though his tale had been flavored by his personal viewpoint the details were too close to what she already knew of the legend not to believe and know that what shed heard all of her life had really happened that this man cursed to life in the skin of a beast really existed there was no denying that the markings on his body and the vertical slits of his eyes made him look like a dragon which had been one of the hardest parts of her greatgrandmothers story to believe but if that could be true then everything else could be too can i see she asked slowly climbing to her feet and drawing him up with her her palms gently explored every inch of bare skin she could find she found him fascinating and handsome beyond belief it didnt help either that she remembered every touch every kiss every moan and thrust from the many erotic dreams hed starred in while she slept dougal didnt move didnt tell her she could or couldnt look her fill so she continued to explore loosening the ties at the front of his shirt everywhere she glanced there were scales the flickering orangeish glow of the candle still burning in the middle of the room actually accentuated the colors making the pale greens blues pinks lavenders and yellows glitter and glow it was like staring into a bowl of precious gems or standing directly before a disco ball wanting to see it all she slipped her hands beneath the bottom hem of his shirt and peeled it slowly upwards he raised his arms without prompting letting her lift it up and over his head she bit back a gasp at the sight of him he was glorious a true masterpiece and it was only moderately due to the dragonlike markings lining his chest and abdomen wrapping around his waist to his back spreading down beneath the waistband of his pants they were beautiful and fascinating no doubt but his body would have been a work of art even without them he was sculpted and firm each muscle smooth and well defined he was the epitome of manliness every womans fantasy her fantasy come to life her hands trailed along his washboard abdomen around his waist to his back where the same rough texture of scales covered the skin there as well she let her fingertips drop lower just inside the top of his pants his stomach muscles tightened as he inhaled sharply and a thrill rolled through her own belly she was being exceptionally bold not at all like her usual self but she simply didnt care she knew what she wanteddougal again just like last night laura his voice was a harsh whisper of sound through clenched teeth his hand clamped on her wrist keeping her from dipping any lower but she flexed her fingers tugging against his hold in an attempt to delve deeper beneath his waistband laura he growled again dont you dont know how long its beenhow much i want his words trailed off as excitement skated through her veins if hed been hiding from humanity for a hundred years then it was a pretty good guess that he hadnt had sex in that long either the thought of being the first woman hed touched in a century turned her wet in an instant and made her ache he let her have her hand and she immediately moved it to the clasp at the front of his pants i do know she told him softly and i want too if she thought there would be any gentleness in a man whod been celibate for a century she was dead wrong the minute she spoke and he realized she wouldnt try to stop him he caught her under the arms and backed her against the nearest wall she gave a yelp of surprise her fingers slipping from the front of his trousers but it didnt matter holding her to the wall with his body he reached between them to wrench open her own jeans and strip them down her legs in one swift motion he had the pants her underwear and her boots completely off leaving them in a pile on the ground then he moved back to his own zipper shoving his pants down just enough to free his rigid erection she watched his every motion with a sense of awe and anticipation inside the cups of her bra her nipples puckered painfully and she licked her lips eager for what was to come rising out of a nest of tight black curls his arousal was long and thick and covered with the same pattern of scales as the rest of his body she didnt think shed ever seen a man this hard this enflamed with each ridge and vein of his straining erection standing out in stark relief she reached for him wanting to feel that heat and sturdiness but he slapped her hand away with any other man she might have taken exception to that and walked away but not with him not during this particular encounter his hands clamped on her ass lifting her off her feet while he pried her legs apart with one knee she knew what he wanted she wanted it too wrapping her arms around his neck she crawled up the back of his calves and thighs until she was at just the right height for his entry ankles locked behind his back breasts rubbing his chest through the thin cotton of her top she held on tight and bit her bottom lip as he plunged inside filling her to the hilt he started to thrustno preliminaries no tenderness just pounding into her again and again her breath was coming in pants her nails raking his sweaty back and scraping at the rows of scales there she moaned his name arching even closer her inner muscles squeezing and milking him begging him to come instead he stopped his chest was heaving his breaths blowing in and out in huffs of exertion her own breathing was none too steady whats wrong she gasped out why did you stop he leaned forward resting his brow on hers you made a noise i didnt want to hurt you she tried to laugh but it came out as nothing more than a strangled oxygendeprived wheeze you werent hurting me she told him without a hint of hesitation her fingers tunneled through his hair clutching the back of his head as she gave a demanding little tug if you hurt me ill yell ouch otherwise keep doing what you were doing one dark brow winged upwards youre sure you want me to yes she stressed tightening her grip on his hair fuck me please it took a second for her words to sink in but only a second in the next instant his eyes turned stormy and narrowed with erotic intent then his mouth swooped in to cover hers in a kiss so hot it nearly singed her eyelashes his grip tightened on her butt and he was moving again banging into her like he was drilling a hole through the stone wall at her back she loved it every pump every flex every grind she thrust back angling her hips and meeting him halfway sliding his hands from the globes of her bottom he let them skim her hips her waist up under the material of her fitted tee to her chest his palms were rough and callused heightening the sensations of his touch as he pushed her bra up and out of the way so he could cup her breasts he kneaded the soft mounds pinching the nipples and scraping them with the side of his thumb and tip of his nail the action sent rockets of ecstasy into every cell of her being and where they were joined each time he filled her he hit her clitoris making the sensations even stronger pulling her mouth from his she made sounds shed never heard come from her own lips before and she even thought she might have exhaled a puff of smoke testament to the heat that pulsed through dougals entire system the muscles of her throat tightened as she threw her head back cracking her skull into the stones at her back she barely felt the sting focused instead on the excruciating pleasure building in her veins in her belly deep in the engorged tissues of her feminine channel her nails dug into the meat of his shoulders as his thrusts gained even more speed yes she groaned spurring him on wanting more harder deeper everything now now now he gripped her buttocks again yanking her forward and back as he gritted words through his teeth in a language she didnt understand and then she broke apart coming hard enough to shake her to the core and make her scream beneath her dougal pounded into her twice more before stiffening with a shout of completion and pouring his essence into her she felt every burst every tremor the walls of her sex rippling with a second orgasm as it tried to suck up every drop for long minutes they stayed as they were propped against the wall like two marble statues struggling for breath lacking the strength or energy to move so much as an inch when dougal finally recovered enough to lift his head from the crook of her shoulder it was to center his glowing serpentine gaze directly on her face thank you he whispered and then he kissed her a light almost reverent brush of lips on lips chapter they ended up completely naked on the pile of blankets in the corner through the rest of that day and into the next between bouts of incredible combustible mouthwatering sex dougal told laura more about his life since being cursedhow hed survived how hed remained hidden from the world for so long how hed tried in as many ways as he could think of to do selfless deeds and remove the magical enchantment her greatgrandmother had forced upon him she found him fascinating his struggle and subsistence how intelligent he had to be to have remained invisible yet find everything he needed such as food and clothing and she told him a little of her life of her family of the dreams and compulsions that had brought her here to find him to her amazement he didnt hold her greatgrandmothers actions against her or carry any animosity toward her family he had it seemed learned his lesson about messing with gypsies at his request she explained some of the details of the modern world things hed never had the opportunity to see or experience she wanted to take him out and show him everything introduce him to society and help him acclimate back into a normal existence not to mention find a way to help him remove her greatgrandmothers curse though he held no grudge against her for her ancestors actions she felt the guilt of it all the same yes hed been cruel to her people when theyd been desperate and starving just trying to survive but that had been more than a hundred years ago and she thought that whatever his crime hed certainly paid enough of a price for it by now and if his version of events was accurate they knew the key to removing the spell and returning him to his regular appearancean act of selflessness or becoming a more understanding generous person she wasnt sure exactly how to achieve that but certainly there were things they could try dougal however didnt seem nearly as interested in the idea of venturing out into the world as shed hoped and she supposed she understood why the last time hed revealed his markings to someone other than herself hed been threatened and ostracized she didnt want to believe the same thing would happen to him in this day and age but she couldnt be certain and it was possible that even if he werent reviled for his affliction he might be enough of an oddity for scientists and the media to turn his life into a nightmare of flashbulbs and needle pricks so maybe he was right maybe it was better that he stay here at least for now they could discuss other options later at the moment his attention was focused on more important things anywaylike making love to her as frequently and creatively as possible shed had her share of lovers in the past and would have thought that a few of those encounters qualified as being quite risqué now she realized that for all her experiences before meeting dougal she might as well have been a nun he did things to her body that made her eyes roll back in her head took her to heights she hadnt known existed took her in ways she hadnt thought possible after reviving enough from their energetic bout against the wall to go at it again hed turned her over onto her hands and knees and taken her from behind until she was panting for release hed sunk between her legs and consumed her like a man dying of thirst whod finally found an oasis and when she recovered she was only too happy to return the favor as much as shed enjoyed every touch of his hands and mouth and body and every earthshattering orgasm hed wrung from her she thought she enjoyed having him in her mouth even more she liked his taste and smell the unique texture of his long hot arousal against her tongue she liked leaning over him being able to explore his body with her hands while she watched his face contort with pleasure her hands smoothed over his flat abdomen narrow hips and muscled thighs slipping between to toy with the soft twin globes of his testicles the extra caress drove him crazy causing his hips to cant off the floor in an effort to get deeper closer to the pleasure she was bringing him hiding a grin she licked the plumshaped tip like a lollipop around and around in one direction then back around and around in the other his moans grew lower and more frequent the thrust of his pelvis more powerful and she moved with him rolling riding never letting her concentration waver until shed brought him off as thoroughly and violently as possible crawling back up the length of his amazing body she smiled and kissed his cheek before nestling close to his side he tucked his arm around her using his other hand to brush a stray strand of hair away from her face mo gaol he murmured pressing his lips to her forehead what language is that she asked the tips of her fingers drifted through the light sprinkling of hair covering his chest circling his nipples and counting the lines of his rib cage while she rested her head on his shoulder youve used it before but its not one i recognize is it scottish aye he answered in a low voice his brogue slightly more pronounced than usual scottish gaelic its what my family spoke most often when i was growing up and what does that meanwhat you just said he hesitated a moment and she felt him tense beneath her she was about to lift her head and look at him to find out what the problem was when he answered my love he told her tone rough with emotion mo gaol means my love a wide grin spread across her face while a blossom of happiness shed never felt before unfurled in her chest at any other time with any other man it might feel as though things were happening too fast but here now she knew it was absolutely right thanks to the stories shed heard about dougal since childhood and the dreams shed been having about him on a regular basis since adulthood she felt as though shed known him forever is that what i am she asked your love she held her breath waiting for his reply a thousand thoughts racing through her brain depending on his response yes he said finally in a near whisper i think perhaps you are at that she inhaled sharply tipping her head back to meet his eyes her own felt suspiciously damp i think you are too mo gaol with a growl he swooped in to capture her lips kissing her with more than passion more than desirethis kiss was filled with love a noise from the upper floor of the keep woke her some time later from the second guttering candle on the small tabletop she suspected hours had passed while she and dougal had slept the sleep of the exhausted and thoroughly sated the sound came again and she sat up dougal doing the same beside her as they both became aware that someone else was in the castle with them he rose grabbing his clothes and quickly starting to dress scrambling across the dirtcovered floor she found her own jeans and tshirt and wiggled into them dougal headed for the stairwell but she stopped him with a hand on his arm wait she said in a hushed whisper let me go up and see who it is ill try to get rid of them so you wont be seen he hesitated and she felt the rigid muscles of his forearm twitch beneath her fingers but then he nodded and she started forward she jogged silently up the stairs wanting to catch whoever was snooping around before they reached the back of the keep and discovered dougals secret lair near the front entrance of the castle a man stood by her things leaning on a gnarled walking stick as he surveyed her sleeping bag camera bag and the other assorted things shed brought for her stay at castle mackay he was older with white hair and a full white beard his worn and patched work pants were held up by a pair of red suspenders over a plaid flannel shirt the ball of dread that had been sitting so heavy in her stomach broke up and disappeared as she recognized him as one of the patrons of the small cafe in town where shed stopped before making the rest of the trek to the keep mr abernethy she thought was his name hello she said stepping forward her fingers buried casually in the back pockets of her jeans mr abernethys head came up and he smiled backlit by the bright morning sunshine of another beautiful scottish summer morning as he turned she noticed the walking stick wasnt the only thing he was holding he also had a long dangerouslooking shotgun tucked under his other arm she swallowed hard stopping in her tracks hi there he said his accent similar to dougals i came to see how you were doing up here in this place all alone oh im fine she told him she forced her lips to curve her shoulders to relax in an im not hiding anything pose taking a lot of pictures making a lot of notes its beautiful up here good good when he started forward still scanning the place with blatant curiosity she quickly did the same moving closer to the front of the keep to keep him from getting near the back she had no doubt dougal was standing at the top of the stairs just on the other side of the opening that led to his underground room and she wanted to keep mr abernethy as far away from that spot as possible they say this castle is haunted did ye know that not haunted she thought occupied there was a difference yes so id heard she responded doing her best to nudge him back outside but he seemed happy right where he was and didnt move thats part of the reason i wanted to visit have you noticed anything then anythingout of the ordinary he asked his eyes moving all the time scanning the surroundings not unless he considered a man cursed to bear the traits of a mythical beast out of the ordinary no nothing its a great place but i havent seen or heard any signs of otherworldly inhabitation yet she gave a light chuckle trying to lighten the mood and emphasize again that there was nothing going on here that he needed to be concerned abouton her behalf or his own well he scratched his chin through the thick hair of his beard i guess ill be letting you get back to your work then if you need anything just let us know i will she said happy that he was finally leaving thank you abernethy started to turn but before he was all the way around he stopped his head swinging back to stare over her right shoulder with a keen sharp gaze what was that he asked his voice going cautious and alert what she repeated turning in the direction of his gaze even though she was pretty sure she knew exactly what hed seen i dont see anything and she didnt but it was possible dougal had peered around the corner just long enough for abernethy to spot him dammit theres someone back there abernethy took a single dogged step forward his boot crunching on the dirt of the floor mr abernethy theres no one there she told him firmly moving directly into his path ive been here all day exploring taking pictures if anyone else had come into the castle i would know it i knew you were here didnt i but her assurances didnt sway him one bit his gaze never faltered from the dark doorway to the underground room theres someone there he said lower this time and with a distinct edge to his tone bringing the barrel of his shotgun up and positioning it for easy firing he stalked forward no she threw herself in front of him shuffling back as he advanced mr abernethy no ones here and id appreciate it if you would leave he didnt even acknowledge that shed spoken but continued as though he was hunting an elusive prey mr abernethy mr abernethy please she pushed at his chest pressed up against him and used her body weight to try to halt his advance finally he stopped but it was only to raise the shotgun to his shoulder and aim it at the darkness that concealed dougals presence somebodys back there her heart was racing her stomach twisted in knots but before she could deny his assertions again dougal stepped out from the doorway to tower at her back she stopped breathing waiting to see what would happen and she knew the exact moment abernethy saw dougals reptilian gaze and the colored scales marring his face and neck abernethys eyes widened his mouth going slack with fear the barrel of the gun lifted slightly so that it bypassed her and pointed straight at dougals heart get out of the way abernethy ordered both his voice and his hands shaking no mr abernethy its not what you think dougal belongs here this is his castle but her words were falling on deaf ears she could see it on his face and in the twitch of his finger on the guns trigger the rest happened so fast her brain could barely register it all dougal took a step toward her his hands brushing her arms abernethy took his actions as a threat raised the shotgun a fraction higher and fired laura screamed a high drawnout frantic noooooooooo and tried to throw herself in front of dougal at the same time his hold on her arms tightened and he pushed her to the side away from danger even as he walked directly into it it all happened in slow motion only speeding up again after the boom of the shotgun blast finished echoing in her ears and through the stone walls of the keep pushing herself up from the ground she immediately turned to see what had happened to dougal she let out another shout when she saw himlying on the ground motionless a splotch of bright red spreading sickeningly across his chest chapter no no no she chanted over and over tears streaming down her cheeks as she huddled over dougals prone body she tore her tshirt off and used it to staunch the flow of blood seeping from the wound in his chest with her free hand she brushed the hair back from his face trying not to panic at the cool and clammy feel of his skin dont just stand there she snapped at abernethy who had gone as pale as his beard go for help call and get an ambulance up here hurry apparently realizing what hed done and as worried as she was that dougal would die he spun on his heel and raced from the castle turning back to dougal she leaned even harder on his wound please dont die she begged throat clogging with emotion please dougal dont die i dont want to live without you i think im in love with you and now that ive found you i cant lose you ill stay here with you i dont care just please dont die his chest heaved with a ragged breath and he stirred lashes fluttering as he fought to open his eyes lines of pain bracketed his mouth his lips white with it oh god she didnt know if his regaining consciousness was good or bad but his blood had already soaked through the material of her shirt covering her hand in a warm sticky layer of red hang on dougal help is coming just hang on though it cost him he raised a hand to clutch her arm i love you too i waiteda hundred years for human contactbut dont regreta single momentbecause in the end it brought you to me his voice was little more than a hitching rasp but she heard every word as clear as day she sucked in a breath struggling not to break down even as her vision clouded and her heart took an unsteady dip before she could respond tell him again that she loved him desperately and didnt want him to die his head rolled to the side and his body went slack no no no no pressing on his chest she scrambled to feel for a pulse for any indication that he was still alive growing more and more terrified as the seconds ticked by and she couldnt find any signs of life she slumped forward her head resting on his unmoving chest as she sobbed out her overwhelming grief he couldnt be gone he just couldnt only moments ago hed been so vital and hot to the touch with his amazing life force now he was still and cool shuddering with misery she took a deep stuttering breath only to let it out again in a wave of fresh tears she was ready to lie down beside him and die too when his lips suddenly parted to suck in great gulps of air his eyes popped open and his chest heaved bowing his body up and off the ground laura jerked back watching him writhe in agony gasping for breath her eyes widened and her own heart nearly stopped beating as the scales on his face and neck began to lighten the colors becoming paler the bumpy texture becoming smoother his pupils slowly rounded from slits to a more natural human shape she was too stunned to say anything too shocked to even move she simply sat there legs folded beneath her arms hanging limply at her side mesmerized by the transformation taking place in front of her seconds later the spasms seeming to wrack dougals body stopped and he stilled again his chest rising and falling slowly normally his lashes fluttered as he blinked a few times taking in his surroundings dougal she called his name softly crawling forward to hover over him her fingers skimmed his face coming to rest on the side of his throat where his pulse beat steady and strong his skin was warmer than before but not overly so not burning the way it had when theyd made love swallowing hard she very carefully lifted the bloodsoaked tshirt shed used to cover the bullet wound in his chest the thought of what she might find underneath made her stomach clench but though the area was red the hole in his shirt jagged there was no matching hole in his flesh she reached out to touch him and was startled to find the spot totally intact oh my god she murmured pushing up on his elbows he looked down then probed the area himself your eyes she told him they were still a gorgeous glorious shade of green but the slits were gone leaving them as human and normal as any shed ever seen your scales he raised an arm studying the back of his hand where the colorful markings used to be fully visible then he lifted that hand to his neck and face feeling for signs of the scaling hed lived with for the last hundred years theyre gone he breathed awe and disbelief evident in his tone all she could do was nod her eyes turning damp again at the realization that he was alive and wellbetter than well if his new appearance was anything to go by so is the bullet wound she said voice shaky youre alive pushing to his feet he pulled her up with him the bloody shirt fell to the ground and he quickly shrugged out of his own ruined garment tossing it aside his sculpted chest was smooth now bare and clear but no less attractive for its lack of iridescent scales i guess throwing yourself in front of a panicked gunman to save my life counted as enough of a selfless act to lift the curse she told him with a watery laugh crossing her arms beneath her breasts covered only by her white bra which was now smeared in places with dougals blood were going to have some explaining to do when mr abernethy gets back with help though lets clean up a bit find something else to wear and figure out what well tell them my presence alone will make them wonder he turned toward the darkened doorway that led to the underground room but stopped when laura made a small sound of dismay she couldnt hold back what is it he asked cocking his head to look at her your back she stepped forward to run her fingers over the beautiful rainbow of color there rising out of the waistband of his pants to the right of his spine and curving upwards toward his shoulder blades it was a peculiar shape almost like one of those twisting chinese dragons itself but absolutely stunning to behold and looked almost as though hed had it tattooed there on purpose he twisted his body trying to catch a glimpse of the new markings which had apparently been left behind as a reminder of the years hed spent living under the gypsy womans curse his brows crossed as he scowled a low growl working its way up his throat i like it she said moving close enough to wrap her arms around his waist and hug him tight it reminds me of the dragon i fell in love with and it will certainly be easier to explain than the rest when i take you home with me his fingers feathered through the hair at her temples tucking the jetblack strands behind her ears as he tipped her face up to his take me home with you he asked humor lacing his tone like a stray cat she shrugged one shoulder holding his gaze even as her insides turned liquid with nerves or like a lover or a husband his eyes still the most gorgeous shed ever seen flashed with heat and desire husband he said testing the word on his tongue i like the sound of that he lowered his head to capture her mouth his kiss burning through her as hotly as it had while he was still cursed and breathing fire so do i she whispered when they came up for air so do i brothers keeper lilith saintcrow chapter a shrill scream jerked her out of the deep well of sleep selene fumbled for the phone pushed her hair back pressed the talk button mrph she managed the trick of rolling over and blinking at the alarm clock oh god what now this had better be good lena a familiar voice wheezed into the other end of the phone he gasped again lena its me oh no not another panic attack danny selene sat straight up her heart pounding danny whats wrong are you okay sweat began to prickle under her arms the covers turned to strangling fingers before she realized she was awake cold he whispered breath coming in

what was i dreaming something about the sea again she raced for the bathroom grabbing a handful of clothes from the dirtylaundry hamper by the bathroom door just keep breathing danny dont let the panic get too big for you im on my way she tripped nearly fell facefirst banging her forehead on the door shit she yanked her jeans up with one hand and turned on the faucet with the other splashed her face with cold water she fastened her thick blond mane with an elastic band and raced for the door ripping her sweater at the neck as she forced it over her head she had to hop on one foot to yank her socks on she jammed her feet into her boots and flung her bag over her head catching the strap in her hair just keep him calm enough to remember not to hurt himself god please she slowed down at the end of her block searching for a cab one down nine to go she sprinted across the street rain kissed her cheeks and made the sidewalk slick and slightly gritty under the orange wash of city light deep heaving gasps of chill air made her lungs burn her forehead smarted making her eyes water she crossed cliff street slowing down pacing herself cant run myself out on the first blocks or ill be useless before i get halfway there if this is another one of his practical jokes i am just going to kill him three down seven to go selenes boots pounded into the sidewalk rain whispered on the deserted streets and along the length of her messy ponytail dripped down her neck as she crossed martin street and cut across the intersection there were more streetlamps here she checked her watch as she ran twothirty santiago city held its breath under the mantle of chill night the back of selenes neck prickled uneasiness rippling just under her skin why cant these things happen in the daylight

her throat the silver medallion was still under her sweater warm against her skin she hadnt taken it off good god dont do that she clenched her hands at her side if only he was human i could punch him bruce grinned down at her canines glittering in the pallid orange light his eyes glowing just like a small nocturnal animals beneath his loud polyester sport jacket and eyesearing yellow tie his narrow spotted chest was pale and hairless dont worry so much lena i wouldnt dream of taking a taste his highness wouldnt like that one little bit his lips curled back even more exposing more gleaming teeth selenes heart slammed once against her ribs taking a long deep breath she willed her pulse to slow focus goddammit danny needs you you cant fight anyone or anything if youre busy screaming i dont have time bruce she gasped dannys in trouble ill go with you bruce shrugged and peeled his lanky frame away from the streetlamp he had just been turned and still looked almost human almost the feral glow in his eyes and the quick jerking of his movements screamed notquitenormal still for a nichtvren bruce was as close to human as possible hed just been turned so he didnt have the scary immobility of older suckheads small blessing but shed take it thats not neces she began bruce folded his arms the smile gone dannys under nikolais protection too selene if i let you go over there and get hurt his highness will peel off my skin in strips and salt me down bruce shivered his long pink tongue wetting his lips trust me ill go with you oh for christs sweet sake selene wasnt about to argue with a dead lounge lizard he fell into step beside her long legs easily keeping pace as she trotted up the sidewalk she glanced down black loafers and no socks all youre missing is a clutch of gold chains and chest hair she tried to keep her breathing quiet pushing down a lunatic desire to giggle nervously danny danny im on my way dont hurt yourself i dontknow whathes thinking she gasped speeding up imperfectlysafe bruce managed a high thin giggle oh no youre not chickadee you should be glad his highness took an interest in you he didnt even sound winded i dont need nikolais protection i did just fine on my own okay so she didnt want nikolais protection shed rather tap dance naked through a minefield singing petticoat junction just because nikolai was the prime paranormal power in the city responsible for keeping the peace among all the other factions of paranormal citizenry didnt mean she would ever kowtow to him his highness nikolai indeed just another suckhead come out from the shadows under the protection of the paranormal species act only this one had an interest in her dont think about things like that danny please be okay dont bite your tongue or cut yourself her bag shifted clinking when it banged against her shoulder steel and salt the tools she needed to banish anything evil or unwanted it didnt pay as well as teaching but god knew there was a need for her talents shed been so tired when she got home she hadnt unpacked poltergeist infestations were like that not very difficult but messy and draining she pushed the strap higher i dont need hisprotection oryours suckhead thats what you think bruce grinned down at her his words soft and even want me to carry your bag ofcoursenot selene sped up to hell with pacing myself danny needs me selenes medallion warmed against her skin reacting to bruces presenceat least she hoped that was what it was reacting to by the time they reached dannys building the metal thrummed with power gooseflesh raced down her body she choked back a final gasp as she rounded the final corner bruce smirked letting out a soft little snort of laughter selene curled her hands into fists resisting the urge to claw the smile from his face jumping the nichtvren wont get you anywhere selene just ignore him and concentrate on what matters danny my god please be okay remember the visualizations i taught you the tall blackclad shape rose from the shadows lying over the concrete steps oh no could this possibly get any worse of course not of course nikolai would show up now he always seemed to know when there was trouble bruce dropped back behind selene at least i wont have to see that fucking smirk on his face danny please be okay dont be banging your head on the wall again im on my way im coming her heart slammed once against the cage of her ribs and her fingers curled into fists fire bloomed in her cheeks spread down her neck and merged with the growing heat of the medallion between her breasts she fought for control ribs flaring as she struggled against hyperventilation hands in his coat pockets chin tilted toward her nikolais dark eyes catalogued her tangled blond hair camel coat scuffed boots her fingers itched to straighten her clothes brush back her hair check for loose threads as usual he was so contained she longed to see him roughed up a little i suppose you learn a little selfcontrol when youre a master powerful enough to rule saint city hes the prime after all we all live our little lives in his long dark shadow a few strands of crowblack hair fell over his eyes as selene impelled by the medallions growing heat skidded to a stop inches from him her ponytail swung heavily but he didnt reach out to grab her arm and protect her from falling headlong on the steps her heart actually leapt to see him again stop that hes not human you know that stop staring at him nikolai said nothing the light stroking his high cheekbones his mouth usually curled into a halfsmile was compressed into a thin line his dark electric eyes flicked over bruce who cringed another three steps back selene suppressed a burst of nasty satisfaction serves you right she started up the stairs pressing her left hand against the sudden stitch gripping her side her toe caught on the second step she fetched up short when nikolai closed his hand around her left arm steadied her before she could fall over and let her go all in the space of a moment selene the chill rainsoaked air shivered under the word his voice soft and irresistible at least he didnt have the scary goldgreen sheen on his eyes tonight selene hated that stirling i was on watch bruce didnt sound half so smug now of course he was an accident turned as a joke or mistake nichtvren didnt turn ugly humans it was an unwritten rule only the pretty or the ruthless were given the gift of immortality and bruce was neither why nikolai kept him around was anyones guess and selene didnt want to ask bruces doglike attachment and gratefulness for any crumb nikolai threw his way was telling enough besides if she asked she had a sneaking suspicion bruce might answer and she wouldnt like the answer at all not to mention what she might have to pay for it selene brushed past nikolai her boots smacked against the cold wet concrete of the steps she reached the glassedin front door and stopped short digging in her coat pocket for her keys so nikolais having me watched she filed the information away her fingers rooted fruitlessly around in her pocket and found nothing but an empty gum wrapper oh no her keys were on the table by the door at her apartment she had not scooped them up on her way out just run right past them in her frantic dash bloody fucking hell on a cheesecoated stick you need to go in nikolais breath brushed her cheek the faint smell of aftershave and male closing around her he was right behind her so far into her personal space it wasnt even funny a violent start nearly toppled her into the firmlyshut door she hadnt heard or sensed him behind her he just appeared out of thin air dammit does he have to do that all the time the only place she could go to escape him was through the glass she stared at the door taking in deep harsh breaths and willing it to open there was a quick light patter of footstepsbruce making off into the night i left my keys at home danny called i think its a panic attack and when he gets them he sometimes hurts himself theres an intercom nikolai reached around her his body molded to hers and touched the lock the gold and carnelian signet ring gleamed wetly in the uncertain light as his pale fingers brushed the metal he went absolutely still the medallions metal cooled abruptly between selenes breasts responding to the controlled flare of energy nikolai was using she could almost see what he was doing despite the stealthy camouflage of a master nichtvrens aura the only thing scarier than their power was their creepy invisibility i really wish hed quit crowding me her worry returned sharp and acrid her lungs burned the stitch knotting her left side again please danny please be okay i dont even care anymore if its one of your midnight games i hope youre all right the lock clicked open with a muffled thunk and selene grabbed the handle before it could close again nikolais hand brushed hers slid over the handle he stepped aside and pulled the door open she yanked her hand away he didnt have to touch me he did that on purpose thanks she managed around the dry lump in her throat stop it she thought desperately biting the inside of her cheek the pain helped her focus its only nikolai you know what he is and why hes doing this youre here for danny remember my pleasure his eyes dropped down to the medallion safely hidden under her sweater the metal flushed with icy heat now hes looking at my chest like he sees dinner there heat sizzled along selenes nerves oh stop that she stepped through the door sliding past him suddenly grateful for someone elses presence her heart hammered thinly the taste of burning in her mouth danny just remember to breathe kiddo little sisters almost there to take care of you i suppose you want to come up of course his voice stroked her cheek slid down her neck he leaned back against the open door his dark eyes now fixed on her face selene gulped down another breath her heartbeat evening out the familiar bank of mailbox doors was on her right and the peeling linoleum floor glared back at the dirty ceiling it is pleasant to see you selene nikolai catstepped into the foyer gracefully avoiding the closing door little droplets of rain glittered in his hair sparked by the fluorescent lights under his coat he wore a darkblue silk tshirt and a pair of designer jeans the shirt moved slightly as muscle flickered in his chest selene dropped her eyes turned away from him oddly enough he wore a highend pair of black nikes vampire fashion just aint what it used to be selene had to stifle another mad giggle wheres the fangs and the black cape not to mention the evening wear her heart sped up thundered in her ears god love me im going to have a fucking cardiac arrest right here in the foyer well come on then she started up the orangecarpeted stairs sidling away from him nikolai followed closely behind but not too close letting selene take the lead for once given how hes always going on about how i need protecting its a wonder hes letting me in the building at all but dammit if he showed up at the door hed just scare danny more hes being tactful for once lucky me her legs trembled and she rubbed at her eyes as she trooped up the stairs nikolai made no sound would you make a little noise she immediately regretted asking the silence behind her intensified danny sometimes has panic attacks so he calls me i just hope hes okay he hasnt left the apartment for years shut up selene nikolai knows dannyll be okay its probably nothing he just stayed out of his body for too long and had trouble when he came back another panic attack and the numbness hes okay be okay danny please nikolais footsteps echoed hers as he climbed behind her that was a relief but selene still felt the weight of his black eyes as they reached the fourth floor her thighs and ass burned climbing stairs after almostrunning ten blocks without rest was a workout she could do without nikolais arm came over her shoulder again and held the heavy fire door open the hall was dingy most of the light fixtures missing bulbs and a drift of fast food wrappers curled up from the far end selenes nose dripped from the chill she rubbed at it with the back of her hand tried not to sniff too loudly threadbare orange carpet whispered under her boots the entire hall was so familiar she barely paid any attention down the hall a wedge of light speared through the gloom dannys door was open chapter long jagged splinters popped out from the frame the door loosely hanging from its hinges lighter unpainted wood peered through ragged vertical cracks oh jesus oh no danny selene leapt forward just as nikolais hand closed around her arm and pulled her back jerking her arm almost out of its socket let go of me no he said quietly let me hes my brother she struggled frantically achieved exactly nothing nikolais fingers tightened digging into her softer human flesh he pushed her back against the wall stay here he looked down at her his lips a thin line and his dark eyes fathomless no catshine in them now either he must be worried selenes lungs labored to catch even a small breath her back and arms prickled nikolai she began but he laid a finger on her lips the contact was electric her entire body went liquid a moan starting in her chest selene strangled it before it reached her lips making a thin dry sound instead stop it stop it no time for this stop it god what kind of a talent did you give me if it makes me feel like this goddammit please help me nikolais skin was feverwarm he must have fed he was metabolizing whatever hed taken that nightblood or death or pain or sex was it wrong to be grateful it hadnt been her though god knew shed done her share of feeding him being fed by him danny selene tried to slip along the wall away from nikolai but he pinned her in place without even trying he was being gentle he could have broken her arm or put her through the wall if hed wanted to with hardly any effort he wasnt human after all move again and i will force your compliance nikolai leaned closer his lips a breath away from selenes inhaling tasting her breath well the dead do breathe when they want to she thought in a lunatic singsong just like the first night i met him she hastily shoved the thought away freezing in place it was a mark of possession smelling her breath like that a nichtvren didnt get that close unless he or she intended to feed or mark you if she struggled his predatory instinct might come into play and he might well decide to sink his fangs in her throat right here so instead of looking at him she stared over his shoulder there was a spot of discolored peeling paint on the opposite wall selene looked intently at it her eyes hot and dry she felt his eyes on her waiting for her to speak argue something selene bit the inside of her cheek im not going to give you the fucking satisfaction something hacked his door down oh god oh god oh danny the weight of nikolais gaze slowly lessened when she didnt struggle it took everything selene had not to move to stay still and passive i will not give you the excuse danny please be okay come on nikolai youre so blasted interested in both of us help him danny the whisper escaped despite her nikolai took another long breath leaning close inhaling her scent deeply her knees went weak stay here he disappeared selene felt the shimmer of power in the close still air of the hallway to a human it would feel like a chill walking up the spine a tightness under the lungs if they were sensitive someone without psychic sensitivity might feel a momentary breeze a cold draft a sudden flash of fear that would quickly be disregarded the shimmer slipped through the space between the door and the shattered frame god please she prayed please god please always begging they called witches like hertantraiikenthe beggars always moaning and pleasing it was hard not to when you had a talent that made your body betray you over and over again stop it think about something useful why was nikolai here or bruce bruces hunting ground wasnt around selenes apartment building at least it hadnt been three weeks ago when hed turned upwell turned nikolai must have set bruce to watch her why now when shed known nikolai for all this time known might be too strong a word you cant know a nichtvren theyre not human no matter how charming they can occasionally be youre food to them thats all selenes back prickled her breath coming in shallow adrenalineladen sips danny be okay god please let him just be panicked let him just be upset but okay or even just a little hurt let him be alive caught between fear and excitement selene let out a slow sharp gasp her knees shook slightly the outer edges of her shields thickening reflexively the jeans shed thrown on were damp at the ankles from the rain and would be damp between her legs soon oh god it was her cursed talent a sexwitch didnt feel fear the way other people did no being afraid just turned into a different sensation entirely one below the belt thick and warm enough to make her heartbeat pound in her ears a trickle of heat beginning way down low the agonized dread spiraled kickstarted a wave of desire that tipped her head back against the wall forced her breath into another jagged halfgasp any more of this and shed be a quivering ball of need and nerves by the time nikolai reappeared goddammit selene focus she shook out her trembling hands if she had to throw power she would need her fingers her heartbeat thundered in her ears she repeated the mantra as if it would help please god please let my brother be safe begging again loathing crawled up her spine mixed with the desire and turned her stomach into a sudsing bubbling washing machine the shimmer returned nikolai solidified right in front of her a faint breeze blowing stray strands of hair back her forehead cold as the moisture evaporated wisps of hair stirred at her nape her ponytail was loose he looked absolutely solid real did his victims ever see him coming it was like swimming with a shark and suddenly wondering if youd cut yourself shaving that morning selene met his eyes tipping her head back nothing she blinked then looked at the shattered door again nikolai caught her shoulders pushed her back against the wall we will call the police her body traitor that it was understood before she did her heart plummeted into her belly with a splash and the stew of desire and horror faded under a wave of stark chemical adrenaline whats this we whats wrong with danny whats happened he smiled and selene backed upor tried to her shoulders hit the wall again there were few things worse than nikolais lazy genuinely goodhumored grin especially his eyeteethfangs she corrected herself the word is fangs lets call it what it is youre old enough to call things what they are she could all too well imagine what those teeth could do to her jugular its not his teeth though its the rest of him i have trouble with you will disturb the evidence we cant have that can we the police prefer to observe the formalities nikolai was calm too calm and that grin danny she thought but it was merely a despairing moan nikolai continued softly and pitilessly we will go downstairs and call the police verscht za she slid away toward the door blindly nikolai pinned her to the wall his body curving into hers heat slammed through her she tasted copper adrenaline selene drew in a sharp breath and kicked missing him somehow he smiled caught her wrists he could hold her all night and struggling would only excite himand her stop it then she said it out loud stop it her voice broke helplessly you are being unwise his tone was a mere murmur so reasonable do as i say selene help me help you help you you bastard the steel vise of his fingers strangled her wrists a twisting wire of pain lanced up both arms jerking backward she smacked her head against the wall brief starry pain twinkling in front of her eyes tell me what happened your brother is dead selene now we must call the police will you come with me or shall i drag you nikolai smiled his eyes twinkling i would enjoy carrying you particularly if you struggle let go of me ill go downstairs and call the police like a good little girl her teeth clenched together her jaw aching shed have a gooseegg on the back of her head for sure danny very good he breathed and released her finger by finger selene stared up into the lightless pools of his eyes a kind of stunned calm slipped down over her body nikolais eyes were so dark so endlessly dark when he spoke next it was in something approximating a normal voice i am sorry selene i will help you however i can christ does he have to sound like he means it any help from you is help i can do without nikolai leave me alone her lips were too numb to work properly if you wont let me see just leave me alone you do not want to see it isdisturbing now come the metal box of the pay phone gleamed dully under the fluorescents a fouryearold phone book scarred with permanent marker dangled from a rustpitted chain someone had tagged the plastic hood at the top of the boxan outofdate gang sign a phone number a caricature of a donkey other symbols much less pleasant selene picked up the receiver in nerveless fingers staring at the graffiticovered plastic i suspect you will want to call your police friend first nikolai produced two quarters with a flick of his fingers dropped them in selenes eyes burned dryly the numbers on the square silver buttons blurring nikolai even dialed his signet ring flashing dully blood on gold somewhere in the numbness a thought surfaced how does nikolai know jacks number the phone rang four times urmph selene couldnt get the words past the dust in her throat nikolai bumped against her sending a rush of fire through her veins kickstarting her brain maureen she whispered her voice coming from a deep screaming well of panic its selene thompson i need to talk to jack now what the maureens tone changed suddenly mother to the world that was maureen shed cooked selene dinner more than once during the cases jack needed paranormal help on sweetheart are you okay jack wake up selenes knees nearly buckled a moan bubbling up the vision of the hacked and shattered door rose up in front of her dear god what happened to his doordanny nikolais fingers slid under her ponytail feverhot fire spread from her nape a deluge of sensation pooling in her belly she hated the feeling hated him but the power would help her she was going into shock years of training kicked in turning the desire into power shocking her back in control her mind adding subtracting calculating what happened he hasnt left here in five years what went wrong danny was a journeyman an adept at etheric and astral travel he didnt need to leave his apartment and anyway couldnt bear to be away from the safety of the wards and defenses selene erected around his threeroom world nothing touched him inside his magickal cocoon no thoughts or emotions that might compromise his body when he projected time had strengthened dannys gifts making him more sensitive to random buffetings but also more sensitive to selenes defenses and powers he couldnt be with her all the time so an apartment of his own with heavy shielding was the best she stiffened the wards they were a part of danny now he had taken over maintaining them since selene had other problems but they were originally her wards and would answer her call and they would have recorded what went on inside dannys walls jack here detective jack peppers cigaretterough voice came over the line what the hell her voice almost refused to work its selene somethings killed danny jack nikolais here i sound like im twelve years old again and scared i sound so scared selene heard jack breathing jesus why is he there forget it i dont want to know hang up and call you got it the sound of cloth against cloth filtered through the phone jack was sitting up maureens whispered questions thensilence ihe cccalled me said he was cccold and something about danger autopilot pushed the words out she listened to her own ragged gasping breath danny oh god danny jesus christ selene put nikolai on the phone honey now jack was fully awake a click and a flare of a lighter deep indrawn breath it must be bad if hes smoking in bed maureen wont like that she handed the phone to nikolai he slid closer pressing her into the phone booth his fingers kneading heat into her neck i wonder what a gun would do to him the thought surfaced she pushed it hastily away she wasnt sure if he could hear it nichtvren were psychic as well as physical predators if he heard her what would he do yes nikolai paused bad enoughno not humani did not nor did she the door is shattered she will of course not enter the apartment selene strained to listen of course i will stay out of sight i would not want to cause trouble for my selene her neck muscles burned my selene oh boy were going to have to have a talk about that suckhead selenes mind skittered sideways danny the door what happened nikolai brushed his thumb over her nape lightning shot down her spine and burst in the pit of her stomach oh god i will nikolai reached over her shoulder again hung up he gently turned her to face him selene didnt resist her head was full of a rushing roaring noise his voice came from very far away you must call the emergency services selene you received a call from your brother it was interrupted and you came to see if he was well you noticed the door had been forced and decided to call do you understand she stared up at him his face suddenly oddly foreign he looked more like a stranger than ever selene took a deep shuddering breath fury crystallizing under the surface of her mind why are you doing this nikolai one dead human more or less his fingers tightened one dead human under my protection dear one whatever killed him is very dangerous now you will call the emergency services and you will be a very good girl for me he touched his lips to her forehead a gentle kiss that made her body burn fire spilling through her veins how can i even think about that when dannys upstairs hot acid guilt rose in the back of her throat i should have gone in there i should have seen her eyes filled with tears i hate you she whispered looking up into nikolais dark eyes i hate you call them the corner of his mouth quirked up as if he found her amusing she turned back to the phone and blindly picked up the receiver punched the nine the one the one a deep breath nikolai moved away suddenly and she swayed grabbing the metal edge of the booth to steady herself one ring two three four five what are you reporting a passionless professional voice possibly female for one awful moment selene couldnt remember who she was or what she was doing the metal bit into her fingers blood pounded in her ears and the hallway swirled beneath her mymy brother he cccalled me i cccame to his apartment and the dddoor is bbroken and im afraid ttto go inside how strange she thought from inside the glass ball of hysterical calm descending upon her i sound like im scared to death it was her voice giving information stammering out the story to the operator danny never left his apartment the door was broken she was afraid tiny diamond mice fleeing the huge black wolf running around in her brain made her voice jittery made her hands tremble she glanced over her shoulder the empty foyer glared under the fluorescents there was no sign of bruce or of nikolai though the medallion throbbed a heated beat between her breasts a heartbeat his heartbeat the urge to tear it off and throw it away made her shake danny oh danny please please god she slumped trembling against the phone box her nails drove into her palm the terrified mice spun round and round inside her brain miss please try to be calm we have dispatched a unit to your location try to be calm danny oh god how can i be calm if youre dead chapter the fourth time the operator told her to be calm selene jammed the phone back down she looked across the mailboxes to the stairs and the medallion tingled harshly against her skin a warning her throat was full of something hard and slick she swallowed several times resting her forehead against cool cheap metal dont go back the operator had said stay outside the building stay and wait for the police its safest to wait for the police maam selenes hoarse inarticulate moan bounced off the stairwell walls the stairs squeaked under her slow feet her legs burned numbly she only got halfway up to the first floor before nikolais hand closed over her elbow she gave a startled wounded little cry and found herself facing him looking at his chest he was somehow on the step above her and his mouth moved fangs flashing in something less than a goodnatured grin it was more like a smirk or a warning no he said selene stared at him and he gave her a little shake her head wobbled the entire stairwell reeling outside this is not for you hes my her mouth was so dry the words were a croak your brother yes he used his grip on her arm to pull her down the stairs selene went limp resisting him but he simply dragged her as if she weighed nothing her boots dropped from stair to stair as if they werent attached to the rest of her you cannot help him now and i would not have you see this milaya i hate you the fluorescents seared her wet eyes i wish id never met you he gave a gracious nod as if shed complimented him thank you they reached the bottom of the stairs he halfcarried her across the peeling linoleum he shouldered the door to the building open dragged her out and let the door go the lock engaged selene looked up at him he set her down on the cold wet sidewalk and brushed her hair back settled her camel coat on her shoulders stroked her sore damp forehead shed be lucky to escape a bruise from cracking her head against the wall his fingers were still warm too warm to be human feverish but oddly soothing she hated that comfort distant sirens cracked the still air breathe she repeated in through the nose out through the mouth breathe the mantra didnt help i mean it i hate you her voice shook i hate you and yet you need me he smiled an almosttender expression that made her entire body go cold selene would have fallen over backward but his fingers closed around her wrist a loose bracelet sirens hammered at the roof of the night selene you do not wish to see what lies in that room remember your brother the way he was i dont need you selene tore her wrist away his fingers tightened slightly just to let her know he could hold her before he let her go and she stumbled there was something hard and small and spiny in her hand cold metal a police cruiser materialized around the corner whooping and braying she opened her hand to find her key ring he must have had bruce sneak into my house and get my keys the little thief always creeping around peeping in windows and doing nikolais bidding no wonder his highness keeps him around she looked up except for the police carsiren flashing lightsthe street was deserted nikolai had vanished she saw the blurring in the air the shimmer that might have been him or just the tears filling her eyes she fumbled on the ring for the key to the front of dannys building numb her cheeks wet with rain and tears she raised her hand to flag the cops down thankfully they cut the siren as soon as they pulled to a stop selene waved her bag bumping at her hip no poltergeist here no curse to be broken no client looking down their nose at me no this time the person needing help is me two cops a rookie and a graying veteran who looked at her as if he recognized her selene hoped he didnt if he recognized her he might ask questions hey arent you that freak who hangs around with jack pepper my brother her teeth chattered hes a shutin he doesnt leave the apartment he called mehis doorjambs all busted upits not normal they barked questions at her who was her brother what apartment who was she was anyone armed what did she see the mice scurrying in selenes head supplied answers c apartment c danny thompson im selene im his sisterno nothing just the door thats all i saw its busted all to hell before she unlocked the building door for them the medallion scorched against her skin warning her fuck you nikolai she followed the cops up the stairs sliding the medallions chain up over her head she pulled it out of her sweater light flared sharply from the silver disc before she tossed it into a dark corner of the secondfloor landing the cops didnt noticethey were too busy looking up the stairs and speaking back and forth in cryptic coptalk both had their guns out fourth floor apartment c she repeated and took a deep breath choking on tears go back downstairs the older cop told her go back downstairs fourth floor they saw the shattered door the wedge of light slicing through the dim hall the older cop radioed for backup they edged forward and cautiously pushed the splintered door open told her again to go downstairs selene told them she would and stood where she was hot tears spilling down her cheeks now that she wasnt standing next to nikolai the wards vibrated with selenes nearness lines of light bleeding out from the hole torn where the door used to be something had blasted right through the careful layers of defense shed painstakingly applied to the walls what could do that she took two steps and the rookie backed up out of the apartment he was paperwhite and trembling freckles standing out on his fair face his blond mustache quivering after glancing past him once selene could see why she clamped her right hand over her mouth staring past the rookie who stumbled to the side and vomited onto the hall rug selene didnt blame him she could only see a short distance down the entry hall and into the studio room the kitchen was to the left bathroom to the right and she had a clear view almost to the nightdark window with the orange streetlamps glowing outside a moment later her eyes tracked a shimmer up over the streetlamp a shimmer that resolved into a dark shape balancing atop the streetlamps arm a tall shape crouched down hands wrapped around the bar eyes reflecting the light with the greengold sheen of a cats eyes at night i wish he wouldnt do that perch up there like some kind of vulture selene looked down again and her hand tightened over her mouth her throat burned with bile the shapes she was seeing refused to snap into a coherent picture blood painted the white walls soaked into the thin beige carpeting and thethe pieces footsteps echoed in the hall shouts radios squawking four more cops selene stepped back against the wall her hand still clamped over her mouth fingernails digging into her cheek she struggled to swallow the hot acid bile instead of puking like the rookie detective jack pepper his graying buzzcut and familiar rumpled gray wool coat steaming in the halls heat came striding from the other end she stumbled back hitting her head against the wall jack gave her a look that could have peeled paint aw christ get her downstairs he said as one of the cops took a look past selene and into the apartment swearing viciously selene couldnt help herself she began to giggle into her hand her eyes streaming the shrill sound echoed under the crackle of radio talk and more sirens outside after wiping his mouth the blond rookie was finally delegated to take her downstairs selene had to steady him her fingers against the creaking leather of his jacket the queasy flickers of fear coming off the young man were enough to make her flush her stomach tightening her mental shields were as transparent and brittle as crystal he was hyped enough to broadcast all over the mental spectrum lawrence his name is lawrence hes an open door right now and i dont have enough control to shut him out knowledge burned through her the fear turning into a wash of heat that made her nipples peak and her entire body tighten her jeans were definitely damp between her legs i wish id stopped to put my panties on the sanity of that thought saved her slapped her back into herself focus selene in through the nose out through the mouth breathe she filled her lungs and tapped in the rush of power sparking along her nerves i hope he puts me in a car i can use this and yank the wards off the apartment a killing like that leaves a mark on the air the wards will be vibrating with it ill be able to track whoever did this to him selene made a slight crooning noise patted the rookies shoulder when they reached the foyer he was looking a little green again his cheeks pooching out and his lips wet selene smelled fear the sharp tang of human vomit and her own smell rich floral musk tantraiiken musk the smell of a sexwitch put me in a police car she patted the rookies back as he heaved near the stairs a loose ring of cop cars sat in the wet street more sirens cut the distant darkness i dont want to work magick right here on the street god alone knows what sort of notice it will attract if i pass out too its okay lawrence she looked up in time to see another cop come flying out of the doorsome thoughtful soul had braced it open with a chunk of pavement this mantall stocky brown hair combed over a bald head selene could see because hed lost his hatmade it to the bottom of the stairs before he puked too vomit spraying out onto the street selenes gorge rose she swallowed against it nice boy she said softly stroking lawrences back its okay you okay quit retching and put me somewhere quiet where i can work you waste the coldness of the thought almost surprised her he was just the type of ordinary civilian to come running to selene for her help in dealing with something extraordinaryand then decide she was less than a used kleenex when everything was said and done they were all alike every one of them except danny and danny was gone selenes jaw clenched her teeth grinding together come on quit puking so i can work he did put her in a police car mumbling something about her safety and a report and she closed her eyes settling back into the cracked vinyl seat finally what did you eat for dinner anyway it certainly stankoh god what am i going to do now danny tears pricked behind selenes eyes quit it focus she pictured the hallway leading into dannys living space the foldout bed and salvaged wooden shelves of books and curios and the blood her concentration guttered came back her ability to visualize under stress had plenty of practice dont fail me now she thought and dropped through the floor of her own consciousness into the place where she truly lived her breathing stilled her heartbeat paused an onlooker would have thought she was sleeping or just sitting with her eyes closed head tilted back mouth slackly open in shock she dove into a black bloodwarm sea her concentration narrowing to a single point pulled on the threads of the power shed spent warding dannys apartment the defenses recognized her left the place in the world where they had been bleeding free and leapt for her selene caught the energy folded it deftly the resultant mass shrank a small bright star to her mental vision taking on more mass as she compressed it selenes body arched upward gasping for air the energy shed taken from the hypedup rookie drained away her skin was prickling and her lips wet her hips rocking forward slightly tensing tighter tighter aching for release she couldnt afford to let it spend she had to find something physical to hold the power until she could take a closer look her fingers dipped into her black canvas shoulderbag and found smooth wood my athame christ here i am in the back of a police car with an illegaltocarry eightinch ritual knife why did i have to be born a tantraiiken training brought her focus back and the star of power drained into the knife leaving her sick and shaking her entire body aching for completion the pain was low between her legs and it would torture her all night unless she found some way to bleed off the pressure the whole event had taken less than five minutes the rookie was gesturing to an ambulance crew lurid light from the cop cars and stuttering flashes from the ambulance painted the street in gaudy flickers the entire street was now swarming with cops and emergency personnel selene slumped down against the cracked vinyl and peered out the window her senses dilated looking for a dark blot or a breath of anything that didnt belong nothing not even a shimmer in the air was nikolai gone she couldnt be that lucky danny the numbness was still there whatever was locked inside her athame would give her a direction somewhere to gohopefully at the very least she would see how her brother died the how might tell her who and once she knew she could start planning there werent many things she could take on as a tantraiiken she was worse than useless in a fight since pain and fear turned to desire and swallowed her whole but she could give it a try couldnt she nikolai wouldnt help he would be too interested in getting leverage on her one more dead human wouldnt matter even if it was the brother of his semipet sexwitch i hate you nikolai the hate was a bright red slash across the middle of her mind she closed her eyes set her jaw her fingers itched to unzip her jeans slide down touch the slick heat between her legs hate you hate you she felt her face contort into a screaming mask tears spilling down her cheeks the door creaked open letting in a burst of chill rainy air hi princess jack said get your ass out we got a hot date with some paperwork selene blinked her fists curled at her sides she let out the breath shed been holding her cheeks hurt so did her lower belly her eyes were hot and dry jack didnt mean to be cruel he was just used to treating her like one of the boys if she had been waiting to join another investigation he would have acted the same way selene would have had an equally brisk response for him she searched for something sharp and hard as a shield to say instead her throat swelled with grief danny she whispered it was stupid she knew it nikolai would not have lied and her own eyes had told her the truth but still she had hoped hope that great human drug jacks face turned milkpale he was thin and stooped except for his potbelly straining at his dingy white shirt his lean hounddog face under its gray buzzcut was almost always mournful now it was actively sad lenajesus im sorry nikolai was supposed to keep you from seeingany of that i have a right to see what happened to my brother jack selene slid her legs out of the car she had to catch her breath as the material of her jeans rasped against swollen tissues she needed and there was no way to fill that need tonight nikolai can go to hell she rasped around the obstruction in her throat that helpedit sounded like the old selene the tough selene im sure its where hes bound sooner or later she twisted her hands together her palms slid against each other damp with sweat the image of dannys apartment framed by a shattered bloodpainted doorway rose up again numb disbelief rose with it her jeans were uncomfortably wet and she was starting to sweat under her arms her neck prickled and she was suddenly aware of empty hunger she was starving how can i think of food at a time like this jesus ill do your report up for you come by sign it in the morning look selene he offered her his hand and she took it nervous sweat slicking her palm he pulled her to her feet the cars windows were frosted with vapor how long was i in there he also firmly took his hand away from her tearing her fingers free selene would have kept his hand run her thumb along the crease on the inside of his wrist wet her lips with her tongue her eyes met his she needed and he was male women were also good for what she needed but there werent any around god look at me look at what i almost did im a whore and my brother is dead im sorry jack continued awkwardly he was starting to sweat now too looking down until he realized he was looking at her chest then staring up over her shoulder at the circus of lights and people in uniforms milling around christ im sorry lenaim so sorry selene crossed her arms cupped her elbows in her hands jack took her upper arm kicked the cruisers door shut and steered her away from the hive of activity the street had become people were starting to peek through their windows lights were coming on the cops were too busy to pay much attention to one lone woman being led away by detective pepperespecially when some of them recognized her as his tame spook the woman that had broken the bowan case last month just how she did it nobody knewbut then again nobody wanted to know the girl was just too weird and pepper was starting to look a little weird himself the joke was that hed apply for the new spook squad soon just as soon as he could get his head out of a bottle and quit working hopeless freezercold homicide cases selene shivered hugging herself their easy dismissal of her roaring through the open wound she was becoming ive got to get home before i start to scream im in bad shape youre pretty worn out jack said diffidently look go home im sorry lena im glad you called me i wish you wouldnt have gone up there he stopped near a pool of convenient shadow and selene looked up of course nikolai was there part of the darkness itself his long black coat melding with the gloom that filled an alleys entrance jack faced her here numb and shocked with her shields thin and the aftermath of the power shed jacked and the magick shed worked pounding in her pulse with insistent need she drowned in what he was feeling agonizing pain nausea sick aching in his chest the heartburn that wouldnt go awayshe shouldnt have to see this shouldnt have seen it jack sighed his shoulders slumping its bad selene something i aint never seen before and nikolai says its not human which means his brown eyes were almost black in the uncertain light christ he finished when she just stared at him her mouth slightly open her breath rasped in the chill rainwashed air just go home come by the station tomorrow to sign your statement im sorry selene shrugged great just go home he says she heard the funny breathless tone in her own voice she was close to the edge so closedid jack think she was numb and grieving or did he guess that she wouldnt be able to grieve until the need pounding in her blood was blotted out grieve hell there was something sharp as a broken bone in her chest im going to get whoever did this nikolai stepped forward his eyes were depthless i will take her jack thank you jack nodded go with like a good little girl right her voice sounded shrill even to herself it bounced off the alleys walls and came back to her through a layer of cotton wool what im hearing is that youre not going to work too hard because its a pfuckingc right jacks shoulders hunched as if shed hit him paranormal cases are technically not the jurisdiction of the saint city police force until the new laws go into effect theyre the jurisdiction of of the reigning prime paranormal power in the city she stepped away from jack and his hand fell down to his side releasing her which means nikolai which means i can kiss any hope of finding out who did this to my brother goodbye not necessarily nikolais eyes never left her he moved closer not precisely crowding her but stepping past jack without so much as glancing at the detective cooperate with me selene and i will see the killer brought to you for your revenge will you take that bargain jack coughed uncomfortably ive got to go sorry selene you son of a bitch both of you are you really she said flatly and turned on her heel she put her head down started to walk at least she wasnt staggering oh god danny what happened to you who did this to you nikolai murmured something behind herno doubt talking to jack something along the lines of women irrational what can you do shell see reason in the morning it was too much rage and something like a sob made flesh draw tighter and tighter under her breastbone and the tension snapped selene ran chapter by the time she reached cliff street she was stumbling shed fallen once scraping her palms on pavement and scrambled to her feet looking up to see a shadow flitting over a rooftop above her he didnt even have the decency to try and conceal himself her hands jittered her keys jangled her scraped palms singing in pain her heart threatened to burst out of her chest sweat rolled down her spine soaked into the waistband of her jeans she checked the street behind her deserted under the orange streetlamps it took her three tries to unlock the door to her apartment building her breath coming high and harsh and fast expecting to feel a hand closing on her shoulder at any moment the run up her own stairs took on a nightmarish quality moving too slowly while something chased her from behind those had been the worst dreams when she was little running through syrup while the monster snarled behind gaining on her doors her own door she fumbled out her keys tried to unlock it made a short sound of agonized frustration when her fingers slipped finally the key slid into the lock she twisted it opened her door yanked the key out kicked the door shut with a resounding slam she threw the deadbolt then turned around and hurled her keys down her dark hall nikolai plucked the keyring out of the air his signet ring glittering one moment her pretty spacious onebedroom apartment was emptythe next moment a slight breeze brushed selenes cheek and she let out a strangled scream the protections placed in the walls of her apartment and the whole building shuddered with a sound like a crystal wineglass ringing stroked just right dont worry nobody will hear it im the only talent in the building a merry little party just nikolai and me and whatever hes going to do to me selene whirled and started trying to unbolt the door her sweatslick fingers slipped against cold metal christ why cant he leave me alone stop he was suddenly there laying the keys down on the small table by the front door his fingers bit into her shoulder and he yanked her back locked the second deadbolt with his other hand the sound of the lock going home was the clang of a prison cell closing selene heard her own harsh sobs the low moaning sound of a strangled scream nikolai slid the coat off her shoulders while he dragged her along tossed it over the back of the couch as he pulled her into the living room then he grabbed the canvas strap of her bag wrapped it around his fist and jerked it up over her head selene let out a short cry cut off midway when he clamped his free hand over her mouth he dropped the bag on the couch as well and looked down at her silence except for the muffled sounds slipping past his fingers fire raced up her side tearing through her ribsthe stitch in her side getting worse her calves were burning too her lower back ached and her palms were scraped raw worse than that was the miserable hot prickling need slamming through her the low relentless burn between her legs spreading through her entire body now that she wasnt running it returned when would she start to beg he considered her cocking his head to one side a few soft strands of black hair fell over his forehead i told you not to look there was no inflection to his voice it was a passionless murmur but look you must are you happy are you satisfied selenes shoulders slumped i could bite him what would he do if i bit him would he hold me down and nikolai let out a low pent breath it was for effecthe didnt need to breathe did he he only did it when he wanted to he slid one hand around her waist flattened it against the small of her back his fingers scorched through her sweater i forgive you much his hand exerted a little pressure enough that she shifted back away from him resisting i forgive you because you are young and because you are unique and because you amuse me a ghost of a smile touched his lips sometimes you even surprise me which is rare but sometimes my selene i wonder if i forgive too much she tried to twist free but he had her one hand on the small of her back the other over her mouth tears trickled down her cheeks he pulled her close to him closer until she could feel something very definitely alive pressing against her belly through his jeans and her sweater i could give a lecture on this she thought hysterically vampire anatomy dead or alive i never even knew a nichtvren could get a hardonthey didnt cover that in the textbooks it was her effect on himher effect on any man maybe it was pheromones maybe it was only her cursed power making sure it could complete itself nikolai had known what she was the first time he smelled her or so he said now he said leaning down just a little whispering in her ear you disobeyed me you tossed my last gift to you away like a piece of trash you also acted as a complete fool dropping your defenses and working the art while you sat in the back of a police car and i saw where you found the power for that trick my sweet he was murmuring and selene shut her eyes her entire body shook now straining against his recognizing that here was something it needed something that could take the ache away i wonder how youre feeling he took a step and let her move too back toward the bedroom only the nightlight in the hall broke the darkness of her apartment but that would present no difficulty to him not to a nichtvren who could see in complete dark well he moved his legs bumping hers selenes body betrayed her her hips jerked forward and her hands came up sliding along his arms to find his shoulders and clenching trying to pull him forward her lips parted and she sobbed in a breath behind his hand two i hate myself it was the only clear thought in the straining welter of sensation shed become her curse awake and alive under her skin i hate him and i hate myself she tasted salt and kissed his palm her lips softening unable to help herself i see he continued pitilessly the succubus needs her food thats not what i am she wanted to scream but his hand was still over her mouth you are the only tantraiiken of adult age to walk the earth freely for five hundred years and you do so because of my protection he moved her back a step at a time toward the bedroom if i were cruel dear one sweet selene id chain you in a stone cell and let you suffer let you burn for a little while until you better appreciated me and the liberty i allow you then he gave a bitter little laugh and selene went liquid against him relieved she knew that sound he would give her what she needed he would make it stop then she could do what she had to do find out who had donethatto danny please she mouthed against his palm before she could stop herself nikolai i am such a whore loathing filled her mouth like spilled wine added another complex layer to the straining need pounding in her blood hush he pushed her through the bedroom door kicked it shut she flinched shaking so hard she couldnt walk and he pushed her down on the bed she landed hard her head flung back her back arching the covers were still thrown back danny the part of her that wasnt crazed with need sobbed danny oh my god my brother is dead and what am i doing god help me he stood there watching her shake against the cotton sheets selene bit her lower lip that was a mistakethe pain now fed the loop of sensation fear and pain and lust driving in a circle that wrung shuddering little sounds from her finally he shed his coat draping it over the chair set by the closet selene closed her eyes twisting her hips rising falling back down her clothes were impossibly hot confining scraping against suddenly sensitive skin he knelt down and worked her damp boots off and her socks touched the inside of her ankle with a fingertip under the damp cuff of her jeans the touch sent a spark racing up her leg through her entire body selene why did he have to sound so human so soft and reasonable i wanted to save you that sight my brother she whispered then moaned as the bed accepted nikolais weight next to her he propped himself up on one elbow and used the other hand to pop the button on her waistband im going to kill whoever did that to him just get this over with so i can go on she drew in a sobbing breath her hips lifting helplessly i would rather have you remember him alive nikolai slowly unzipped her jeans the sound of the zipper was loud in the dark stillness of her bedroom tears leaked out between selenes eyelids and her sweater was drenched with sweat addicted to this but i have no choice i never have a choice the need would get worse and worse a tantraiikens curse burning through her bones until she was little more than an animal shed gone that far sometimes when she was young and thought she could rule her own body at least before shed learned how to use the curse for her own benefit and before shed met him since shed come to nikolais notice she hadnt needed to feed her curse in alleys or cheap hotel rooms even if she could forget it he reminded her often enough she owed him owed and was owned by there wasnt much of a difference where nichtvren were concerned nikolai it was a long despairing moan it wouldnt take long before she started to beg shed drained her batteries and worked herself into a frenzy he slid his hand into her jeans settling the heel of his palm against her mound his fingers slipped down and made a slight beckoning motion selene arched her breath hissing in but then torture of tortures he stopped why disobey me his breath was warm against her cheek why selene you leave me no choice nikolai it was all she had left the pleading he would give her what she needed and then she could think again ponder consider plan but how much would he make her suffer first and how much of the suffering would she enjoy because of her traitorous body he took pity on her then and made another little beckoning motion with his fingers and another he knew exactly what to do it was all selene needed and she cried out arching her head tipped back and her entire body shuddering it was like being dipped in fire and the relief was instant reliefand fresh need she would need more much more but now she could think the first edge of her curse was blunted nikolai she said when she could speak again you were in there what did you see give me something you fucking suckhead get it selene fucking suckhead youre such a whore the image of dannys apartment rose in front of her eyes again and she struggled away from nikolais hand curling into a ball pulling her knees up while she hugged herself making small sobbing sounds like an animal in a trap her wet clothes rasped uncomfortably against her skin nikolai sighed again he sounded frustrated good for him later dear one right now you are in pain he sliced her sweater up the backhis claws extended delicately not even brushing her skin beneath the wool chill air met her wet skin then his fingers skating down the muscles on either side of her spine his claws were retracted but she could still feel the strength in his hands he pushed her hair asidethe elastic band holding her ponytail snappedand his mouth met her nape she shivered curling even more tightly into herself he stroked her shoulder touched the two dimples down low at the small of her back the first edge of pain was gone and the burning settled back into a low dull agony her talent wasnt like others she had to fuel it with sex it was the only thing that worked but christ do i have to let him touch me like this hes not human cant he just fuck me and get it over with leave me alone so i can do what i need to do the rest of her ruined sweater was discarded over the side of the bed he worked her jeans free and tossed them away too then took her in his arms his own clothes were gonehow he did that she couldnt guess but it probably had something to do with his claws and the fact that she was too busy trying to gulp down air and fight her bodys need to really pay attention to him she was paying for the magick shed done earlier no preparation no patterningshed simply dropped her defenses and gone for it performed a major work without any thought of the consequences no wonder she was shaking with need everything has to be paid for she realized shed said it out loud everything has to be paid for in magick nikolai everything do you think i do not know he pushed her onto her back slid his hand between her legs she was slick and feverish damp with need hush lie still it took a massive effort to do what he said it would be quicker if she just let himif she submitted if she gave in selene erupted into wild motion trying to fight him off he caught her wrists stretching them above her head and pinned her to the mattress she would have been screaming but his mouth was on hers catching the scream killing it she tried to kick him straining but he slid a knee between hers then all of his weight and selene felt the edges of his hips against the soft insides of her thighs he was much warmer now his skin almost scorching hers the energetic discharge of sex would feed him too that was why a tantraiiken was such a valuable paranormal pet pet slave it was frowned upon of course but paranormals and talents werent that tightly policed even though the laws were almost in effect to give them some protection and codify them the higher echelons of the human worldthe powerbrokers and politiciansknew about the slavery of course it was an open secret in some circles but no newspaper would ever report on it and no television anchor would ever talk about the things that went on under the blanket of normality how sometimes people born with certain talents were lost to the night side of life he found the entrance to her body thrust in and his hands tightened around her wrists the small bones grinding together selene gulped back another useless scream relief spilling through her his fingers gentled threaded through hers he murmured somethingmaybe it was russian she didnt know didnt care the only thing she cared about was that the agony had stopped he was in her to the hilt stretching her her hips slamming up silently begging he moved again and selene closed her eyes pleasure tore through her a dark screaming pleasure wrapped in barbed wire and dragging hot velvet laceration through tender flesh soon enough she would be able to think about grieving getitoverwith she set her teeth together even as her hips rocked and her ankles linked together at the small of his back her body betrayed her over and over again that was the worst her body was an enemy a traitor it didnt care who he was as long as he had what she needed oh no he whispered into her ear then caught her earlobe in his teeth gently delicately a slight nip of razor teeth and she sucked in a breath he laughed a low harsh breath against her cheek there are a few hours until morning i hate you she whispered back even as her body shook and the blind fire took her again and again chapter in the end exhausted she lay limp against the bed hugging a pillow rescued from the floor nikolai curled against her back sweat slicking his skin so it slid against hers her entire body sparked pleasantly and her shields were back up thick enough to protect her again if danny had been able to shield himself would he have died if hed been able to run away from whatever had battered his door down maybe he would have survived dont worry danny little sisters on the job ill get whoever did this to you i promise the words were a lump behind her breastbone steel closing around her beating heart i swear to you danny im going to find who did this to you ill do whatever i have to do that was one thing being a whore was good for it let her contemplate doing just about anything to get what she wanted what she needed nikolais hand polished the curve of her hip something cool and metallic sliding against her skin he drew it up over her ribs under her breast until the medallion lay where it used to half the chain spilling down to pool on the sheet he fastened it at the back of her neck onehanded and flattened his other palm against the silver lying between her breasts there this is important selene without it youre at risk this gives you protection you cannot throw it away understood shut up suckhead someone killed my brother her throat rasped from choking back screams what happened what was it if i tell you what i know it would be nothing if i tell you what i suspect it will be confusing because i suspect many things he yawned burying his face in her hair then spread one hand against her belly he was warm enough to pass for a feverish human metabolizing the jolt of sex into fuel if i tell you what i expect we will be here for many hours since i have learned to expect everything it is too soon to tell my brother she said tonelessly his knees were behind hers one arm under her head the other holding her to him a huge exhausted yawn took her unaware threatened to crack her jaw someone killed my brother nikolai if you wont help me cooperate with me and i will find whatever killed your brother he sighed again relaxing against her back the way a cat might a very big very warm cat dawn is approaching will you come with me she should have known the same offer as always delivered as if she should be grateful for it leave it to nikolai to use even her brothers murder to try and get what he wanted out of her i have work tomorrow she watched the edge of her pillowcase breathing shallowly leave me alone you got what you wanted now go away already attended to you are not expected there for another two weeks jesus i cant afford with pay i dont want your money i dont want to fuck you either see how well that works out mh it is not mine it is from the college you may call it a gift for my selene she closed her eyes if he was human what would i do id ask him to help me and he might even do it without turning it into a power play dont call me that im not yours you must belong somewhere he said softly i belonged with my brother poor danny locked in his apartment except for those times he slipped the chain of his own body and went journeying how many times had selene climbed the steps to his apartment to ask his help for the cases jack pepper brought her how many times had she brought him meals or little things he needed because he couldnt stand to leave the wards selene had made for him danny had been immune to her pheromones immune to her curse he had been the only man capable of seeing her without her goddamn body complicating things i belonged with him plenty you undead jerk now hes gone and you wouldnt have even let me look at his body i hate you and he was so easy to hate wasnt he a nichtvren inhuman for all that hed been mortal once however long ago how old was he anyway he was under my protection too nikolai said come with me selene you will be safer like hell i will no one day you will he didnt push the issue for once jorge will come to offer you use of a car and to keep an eye on me no thanks nikolai selene bit her lower lip it was bruised already she tasted blood she would ache tomorrow it had been too long shed built up a heavy debt and her body had exacted its toll with a vengeance not only had she cleared a poltergeist infestation and pulled the wards from dannys apartment but there had also been the work for that witch over on seventeenth street shed needed the money she always needed the money lecturing didnt pay nearly enough for both her rent and dannys and by god selene never wanted to be poor again she agreed with scarlett ohara on that count thank you very much nikolai paused and his hand tensed against her belly she held her breath but he didnt move just tightened his arm around her this is not a request jorge will come and if you leave this place it will be with him if you do anything foolish i will be vexed even his breath was warm against her hair does he breathe because he knows it makes me a little more comfortable i suppose he has to breathe to talk doesnt he i should ask exhaustion crept in if she fell asleep now she might be able to get a few hours of rest beforeno the fatigue blurred everything made it difficult to think vex all you want nik she said and his fingers tapped against her belly once twice then he stopped im not your servant i dont take your orders yeah selene if you lie often enough you might even be able to halfway believe it he made a low sound against her hair and selenes entire body leapt the medallion gave one scorching burst of heat of course if jorge is incompetent enough to lose you i suppose he will need punishment you bastard i should have known you wouldnt i would selene i would also make you watch he sounded calm as if he was discussing a grocery list i dislike the thought of damage to you i will take steps to avoid it everyone knows im your little pet nobody messes with me anymore you jerk i might even be able to use that to find out who killed danny nothings going to happen to me especially not with jorge watching over you he sounded pleased to have painted her into a logical corner fine she said ill wait for him ill be a good little girl now go away and leave me alone so i can cry in peace leave me that at least just leave me alone so i can cry nikolai rolled away from her his arm sliding out from beneath her head she heard him moving getting into his clothes she could imagine him getting dressed pulling his jeans up pulling his tshirt back over his head running his fingers back through his hair to push it back out of his face then his coat she heard the sound of the heavy wool moving best of both worlds he has to go home before dawn cant stay to make things sticky and hes so fucking careful not to damage me though i can take it cant i its hard to kill me with sex at least he leaned over the bed to pull the sheet and the blankets up tucking her in gently and efficiently finally when the covers were smoothed he settled on the side of the bed and touched her hair ran his fingers through the heavy mass lifting it slightly and gathering it all up pulling it back from her face he stroked her cheek with his fingertips delicately his claws didnt prickle but she knew they were there go away i have to cry first then i will figure out what to do oh god danny selene kept her eyes shut her breathing evened out she hugged the pillow her right hand was under the covers and she made a fist her nails biting into her palm squeezed tighter tighter finally nikolai touched the corner of her mouth with a fingertip selene didnt open her eyesbut she did peek out through her lashes under the bedroom window shade a faint grayness showed dawn was coming there was a slight sounda breath of air a cold breeze touched selenes cheek nikolai was gone selene drove her fingernails into her palms and took in a shuddering breath now at last she could cry like a virgin of the spring susan sizemore and denise little ginger was certain that there had been a time in her life when she found public fornication shocking that time was long behind her now crossing the courtyard between the baths and the sanctuary of the sacred spring she barely glanced at the naked couple coupling on the altar at the center what the pair was doing was a sacred rite meant to please the gods she did take a moment to glance their way and observed that the lad had a truly fine ass the way his broad back narrowed down to his waist was a work of art but the offering to the gods being shared out there with such energy was business not pleasurefor her at least it was spring festival time and people were crowding in to the stronghold from all over the countryside of southern britain it was a joyful season for most people one that embraced relief at surviving the winter appreciation of the new life emerging in field and flock and enthusiastic participation in the fertility rites so important to the gods ginger normally would have been overseeing the celebrations but her knowledge of the darkness moving ever closer toward them overwhelmed her interest in this seasonal festival as priestess of the spring she had responsibilities that ran far beyond the rites taking place on the altar she already knew that the next few days were going to be hard on her and she was certain that her talent as a seeress was going to be called upon on this day when she was supposed to be resting up for the festival the future was hers to see and to interpret for others and now it seemed the gathering storm had managed to alarm even the highest power in this land the lord of ched had called for his senior advisors to gather before him at the sanctuary lord ched was there when she arrived a big man going to fat his grizzled gray hair cut short in the roman manner despite being near to fifty a great age he was still handsome it was obvious where his daughter morga got her beauty morga was chosen of the mother and she and the year king should have been here with her father bracing for the coming storm instead of outside worshiping on the altar ginger wondered at the exclusion but it wasnt just a warning from her extrasensory perception that twisted her belly with apprehension she hadnt always been the priestess of the well at one time shed been a student of history a collector of the great stories from the past shed studied the manipulation of power by men strong enough to seize and keep it their names lived on in tales long after they diedphillip of macedonia his son alexander the great caesar augustus claudius constantius even the cursed vortigern whose illfated dealings with the saxons had torn britannia apart less than a century ago the machinations of power and politics were as much a part of her original world as science and psychic research but that world had changed forever when shed decided to put her knowledge to good use traveling back in time hadnt made her life any simpler of course back home shed been more of an observer than a player she was well aware of the irony that the disaster of a time transfer gone wrong had turned her from the observer she was supposed to be into a person of importance in this time and place not much importance thank goodness she wasnt trying to change historyshe wasnt even sure what history was supposed to look like here the sixth century in britain was notorious for its lack of reliable documentation sources like the monks gildas and venerable bede were great tellers of tales but short on reliable details so now she was trying to survive in a dangerous alien world where her psychic gift gave her a small edge or to be more precise a job the seeress gig put a roof over her head and two meals a day in her belly and gave her the protection of the most powerful person in the region but all that could change soon if the invaders who she knew were coming thanks to both her studies of history and her gift moved inland from their raids on the coast not today not even tomorrow but one day soon death would be beating a path to the walls of this sanctuary it could only mean war war seemed a certainty really her existence could be hanging by a threadalong with that of every person in this room she needed to know which side to foster which army to influence if she was to survive her recent visions had shown her fire and death but no clear images of who the victors would be the steward of the manor followed ginger into the sanctuary after him came the harriedlooking commander of the guard the bishop visiting from wales came inside as well it was not a large space though the entrance was wide and open to the courtyard the four of them gathered around the tiled basin into which the waters of the sacred spring trickled from the back of the sanctuary ginger made up a quick prayer to the goddess of the water and to the new god of the cross and when she was done with the blessing they got down to business the guardsman did not wait for his lord to speak can we make this quick with the crowds coming in we need a new war leader lord ched cut him off he looked around the gathering his expression hard daring them to argue right now this very day would be good do you want the job he demanded of the guardsman a scar ran over the empty socket of the guards left eye he glanced toward the courtyard with his one good eye they all followed his gaze the couple was still busy on the altar morgas thighs were wrapped tightly around the year kings slender waist and the beautiful young man was pistoning away with hard swift strokes he was covered with a glowing sheen of sweat his muscles bulging damn but that boy had stamina hes perfect the guard said how could i take his place hes not perfect lord ched said hes an idiot a fool and a braggart he pleases my daughter and her bellys already swelling with a second brat but hes useless for anything else in normal times that would be enough the steward spoke up he rubbed his jaw the tough stubble on his cheeks making scratching sounds i suppose we could go back to the old ways we could sacrifice him come the planting ceremony instead of just letting the lads wrestle for rights to morga this year the gods might like that the crowd certainly would morga would not ginger said nor would i added the bishop they were both ignored even if we return to the old ways the lord said we need someone to replace the year king first someone who can fight someone who can lead im too old morgas son is still with the wetnurse tradition dictates that the year king lead us into battle a battle is coming and that boy out there isnt up to the job all ginger had wanted when she took on this role was a little peace and quiet while she tried to find a way home but the invaders marching up from the coast werent likely to leave anyone in peace or even alive if the rumors theyd been hearing proved to be true the whole point of returning to the dark ages was to find out what happened to fill in the holes left by bede and gildas her simple research project had instead left her stuck in the very dark ages where she didnt know what happened at least on a grand historical scale here and now in this little corner of the world she knew too much she was a boardcertified psychic she knew trouble was coming soon marching here as fast as the old roman roads would allow but her gift only went so far in certain directions and after that she was as on her own as anyone else here her worried musings were interrupted by lord ched what shall we do priestess look into the water and tell us what the gods say so her sight was supposed to save them as she had suspected would be the case she always tried to tell the truth of what she saw in the water but divination was one thing and politics was another what she saw might not be enough to help them ginger sighed but didnt argue about her duty she owed the lord of the manor her life and she understood his concerns his world was threatening to fall apart and the people he was sworn to protect were in danger as one of those people she applauded his takecharge attitude she gestured for the men to stand back they moved fast obviously delighted the decision was in her hands and not theirs if things turned out wrong later they could always claim that the priestess read the signs incorrectly pin the blame on the psychicit was a game that never went out of style she had no doubt that back in the lab shed come from in the distant future they were playing it still somehow theyd undoubtedly decided her teams failure to return from the past was all her fault she knelt by the pool ginger brushed away the bitterness she felt at their willingness to let her be the savior or the scapegoat in fact she put the men out of her mind altogether shed had years of practice honing her abilities learning to ignore every possible kind of distraction she looked into the crystal clear water her awareness going far deeper than the eightinch depth of the pool as always she was amazed at how quickly her perceptions attuned to the energies present at this energy nexus from a long way away she heard herself ask question from even farther away the lords voice came to her in an echoing whisper who shall lead my people to war almost instantly a face appeared on the surface of the pool though ginger was the only one who could see it a pair of piercing green eyes caught hers and she gasped for she was certain that he could see her as clearly as she saw him nothing like this had ever happened to her before i see visions i dont make contact she told the face thats not my fault is it his rough deep voice answered who are you where are you he demanded his gaze enveloped her but all she could do was continue to stare she wanted to fall into the vision into him wanted him to fall into her she wanted him the way a woman wanted a man that had never happened before either she shook off the desire that threatened to swamp her and concentrated on the task at hand he was as handsome as any year king should be but for a small scar on one cheek he couldnt be the man the lord wanted then for a year king must be perfect a crowd of men suddenly appeared in the water behind the strangers wide shoulders they were a rough and dangerouslooking lot with travelstained clothes and heavy packs mercenaries she said understanding at last what they were he had to be their leader the alpha among a pack of hungry wolves wolves mate for life he said clearly keying into her thoughts he shook his head hard it seemed his words made no more sense to him than they did to her what do you see cheds anxious voice came to her the question drew her away from the vision but a sense of urgency drew her to her feet hes here she said now at the gate what did you say sir bern felt the weight of sergeant kayes hand on his shoulder as the world came back into focus i hate when that happens he muttered he frowned and the sergeant stepped back was i just talking to somebody kaye you spoke kaye answered he glanced at the rest of the team who were spread out across the road but you werent talking to any of us i was afraid of that berns rating on the psychic scale was a lowly little three enough to get him transferred into the ttps security force but not high enough to really interfere with his leading a normal sane life exceptsometimes he heard voices or had a flash of intuition hed learned to listen to the voices and trust his gut feelings hed just had one of those flashes though he couldnt remember all the details of course some details demanded he pay attention to them he loosened his belt and adjusted his tunic somethings up he said and in more ways than one he studied the lay of the land while he got his reaction to the woman hed heard in his mind under control it was spring very close to the major seasonal fertility festival and the road they were on led to one of the holy sites scattered all over the southern part of the island this particular temple to the local mother goddess was located on private property and the pilgrims were camping out in cow pastures on either side of the road the manor at the top of the hill had been built by a wealthy roman colonist but the local chieftain had taken over after the romans abandoned all their foreign outposts a generation ago bern didnt care about the festival but it made a good cover for checking out the place the locals were expecting travelers to congregate here his holomap pinpointed this site as one of the nexus locations and despite growing doubts that any of the sites they surveyed were going to provide enough energy to get them all home it was his duty to check it out finding the right door back to the future was only the second half of his assignment his first duty was to find and rescue the science team that had disappeared six months before his unit got the order to go back and look for them in his opinion it had been stupid to send the eggheads back in time without a whole team of sensible people to keep them out of trouble the mission had been fucked from the getgo this was the farthest back anyone had tried to travel the lost team had been sent without proper backup to a time period very little was known about it was no wonder everything had gone wrongtwice he and his men were now stuck here too he gestured toward the crudely built wooden palisade surrounding the estate buildings lets go see if we can get a look at whats inside ginger was used to the world around her going fuzzy and faded but she realized the moment before she fainted that this time it was because shed been holding her breath while standing behind the men waiting at the gate when the gate opened she simply blacked out just as the man from her vision walked in their gazes met for a moment and then everything went dark it was ridiculous and she was so embarrassed that she scrunched her eyes tightly closed when she woke up not wanting the person holding her to know that shed come around those strong arms were his werent they her head rested against a broad hard male chest warmth and the scent of him engulfed her awareness of him pooled deep in her belly her nipples stiffened scraping against the cloth of her dress and her breasts grew heavy oh my she whispered without making any conscious decision to move her hand came up to stroke his strong stubbly jaw she could hear his heart rate pick up when she spoke and the deep sound of his laugh rumbled through his chest for a moment the arms around her tightened pressing her body harder against him bern liked the weight of the woman in his arms the touch of the bare skin of her arms and the feel of the rest of her beneath her dress made him ache made him remember how long it had been since hed had a woman it also made him thankful that women didnt wear underwear in the dark ages and this woman was a perfect fit against him he liked the softness of her curly red hair where it tickled his neck and cheek he wanted to bury his face in her thick hair then follow the line of her throat all the way down to snuggle between bern gave his head a stern shake as stimulating as holding her was he didnt know why hed rushed into the courtyard and scooped her up off the ground when she fell this wasnt an age of chivalry yet in fact in these days they typically saved the cattle before they saved the women calling attention to himself and his men was stupid keeping a low profile was a matter of policy and survival among ttp teams so why was he holding this lady he had no idea who this woman was or what she meant to all the locals who were staring at him though she did look familiar when she woke and spoke he couldnt help but laugh it was good to know that she was as aware of him as he was of her then bern realized that the words hed heard hadnt been filtered through his translator implant shed spoken in english instead of the local lilting celtic dialect he knew exactly who she was her name was virginia white and though hed never met her in the flesh hed studied her holo image hers and all of the others on the missing team he had his hands on one of their primary targets since he already held her he was tempted to call for his men to cover his withdrawal they could run out the gate and make tracks anything to ensure her safety now that hed found her since that wasnt the smart way to play it he put her down her body slid slowly down his until her feet touched the ground she was tall and willowy her height another clue that she wasnt from this time you he began but before he could speak or she could answer a hand landed on his shoulder bern whirled around his hand on his sword over the last six months that had become second nature what he demanded of the potbellied graybeard before him the stranger wore a threadbare silk tunic since silk was a luxury rare in these parts since the roman withdrawal bern guessed he was looking at the local chieftain my lord he continued with a polite nod the chieftains frown turned into an effusive smile youre quick i see good good he glanced toward the hand bern still rested on the pommel of his sword welcome to ched he went on come to worship at the well have you for the festival bern nodded he was aware that virginia white had moved back into the shadow of an arched doorway he wanted nothing more than to follow her but he had to stay in character and deal with the local potentate first bern brought out a small leather pouch heavy with gold and handed it over please accept this small gift in honor of the goddess and your hospitality the chieftain tossed the little purse to feel its weight glanced inside and beamed he looked at berns peoplean obvious unit of soldierswaiting by the gate alert for berns orders those are finelooking lads you lead we come in peace for the festival bern reassured the chieftain then he saw the speculative look in cheds eyes he smiled but afterwards our swords are for hire if you are interested he hoped that made him sound like a friendly and useful fellow to the chieftain just in case his unit needed an excuse to stay on after the festival though he hoped he could find out what virginia white was up to before then lord cheds grin widened he put his arm around bern join me for some wine whats your name lad he asked as he led bern into the main hall ginger considered going back to her duties at the spring but curiosity got the better of her that and an irresistible craving not to let the man who named himself bern out of her sight made her follow the men into the hall for some reason being close to bern made her feel as if she was not alone anymore and she needed that nearness after all these months she knew very well that any attraction to a man was foolish and not even because intimacy with an indigenous resident was against project rules if the gleam in lord cheds eye was any indication this dangerous stranger would soon be the year king sharing the bed of his daughter morga jealousy ripped through ginger at the thought but she knew it would be for the best they needed a warrior hero right now and bern looked to have all the qualifications for the job he was tall dark and handsome with broad shoulders and big hands and the brightest most beautiful eyes shed ever seen there was an aura of steely danger around him that should have scared her to death but instead it sent fireworks shooting through her he wore a kneelength tunic that left his legs bare over it was metalstudded leather body armor buckled and strapped into place and a light woolen cape her fingers itched to pull off all those layers and thoroughly explore what she found underneath but they were in public even by the debased roman standards still observed here it was unseemly for a woman to jump a man in the middle of a meetingunless shed been purchased or hired for that purpose of course ched sent for his daughter and settled down to explain his plan to bern over cups of strong wine unwatered as was the local custom effete romans might drink their spirits diluted but not ched here business was usually conducted once the menfolk were well on the way to being drunk so ginger stayed in the background to listen and watch she took a seat at the side of the public space among a group of women working on spinning and embroidery the men were barely into their second libation to the goddess when morga came flouncing in at least shes dressed ginger thought morga was beautiful knew it and had no qualms about showing it even if she wasnt lying naked on her back on the holy altar i live like a nun ginger thought and she gets to whoop it up anywhere any time until a few minutes ago this hadnt bothered ginger a bit now she very nearly snarled as morga caught sight of bern licked her perfect lips in appreciation and made a beeline to sit beside him daughter lord ched announced once the girl was snuggled up against berns side meet your new husband morga bounded to her feet looking appalled so did bern what morga screamed what bern echoed his voice was firm but anger crackled off him morga gave bern another once over and her lips curled in disdain at the lack of signs of rank or fortune i dont mind giving him a toss but i like the husband ive got she told her father lord ched banged a fist on the table youll take the man i choose the goddess chose for me already your year king has already reigned too long when this warrior challenges the younger man will lose be prepared for itbe prepared to do your duty by your father your goddess and your people he gestured toward bern now be a proper priestess and take this fine bear of a man off to the bath you sound like a roman the girl complained but this land is celt again and ill do no such thing as bathe a stranger she looked around haughtily and pointed to ginger theres a priestess who obeys you let her service this great bear of yours and with that pronouncement she flounced back out again leaving everyone staring at ginger berns initial impulse was to protest all this nonsense about marriage and bathing with buxom young women but he let it go when the girl suggested virginia white as her replacement that situation had possibilities it would be a good way to get white alone perfect he exclaimed and stepped forward to drag the stunned virginia out of the crowd his hand tight around her slender wrist she looked at him with astonishment and he had to fight off laughter as he caught an impression of her thinking about having a barbarian in her bathtub he also noticed that she wasnt completely opposed to the idea warmth spread wherever they touched hmmmmaybe they could turn this ridiculous situation into a bit of mutual fun what are you waiting for priestess the chieftain said show the man the hospitality he deserves come along bern said he pulled white along with him out of the hall once out in the courtyard she got her voice back youre in for a treat warrior for the roman hypocaust is still working and the pool is deep and hot the baths draw as many visitors as the sacred spring increasing the lords prestige and im not interested in a hot bath she sniffed and wrinkled her pretty nose you should be he laughed i guess i am a bit ripe from a few days on the road my tunic could probably use burning besides where i come from that would be breaking a law against polluting the air for a moment hed let attraction get in the way of professionalism this reminder that she was no local priestess brought bern back to his duty lead on to this bathhouse he growled he watched her walk ahead of him to the baths she wasnt a local or even native to this time i could have her he thought then he reminded himself to concentrate on the mission but he feared his body was going to overwhelm his brain at any moment ginger was aware of the rough soldiers gaze shed never been so instantly and dangerously attracted to a man before all the rules about indigenous relations were being overruled by the demands of her body she didnt think shed be able to keep her hands off this guy conveniently to keep up her cover as a priestess intact she didnt have any choice but to scrape his naked body down with scented oil and rinse him off her job description was getting more attractive by the day she grinned with anticipation as they entered the bath but her grin was wiped away and replaced with a surge of fear an instant after they stepped into the room he grabbed her shoulders and spun her to face him at the same time he growled out to the pair of waiting bath attendants she heard the slap of their bare feet on the stone mosaic as they hurried out what the hell do you think youre doing he demanded the moment they were alone only what my lord ordered then she realized why her senses were in shock youre speaking english on a burst of sheer relief she grabbed him and kissed him what was a man to do when a woman flung herself against him and her soft lips pressed against his own then bern didnt care what anyone else might do her hips ground enticingly against his her mouth was delicious and his tongue delved possessively into the sweet warmth her breasts pushed against his chest and he brought a hand up to cup the soft roundness stroked a thumb across the hard nipple he could feel beneath her dress hed never wanted anyone so much or so quickly he picked her up and tossed her into the water took a moment to unfasten his sword belt and toss off his armor then jumped in after her though she was fully clothed the wet dress clung to her body and outlined her breasts and hips in a way bern found irresistible people generally get undressed before bathing she said and before sex too she laughed and reached below the water to grab onto her soaked skirt wet wool she muttered now i smell like a sheep she gave him a onceover does that make me a ram she was holding the dress up around her thighs he caught a glimpse of pale skin through the steaming water dont stop now he urged he wanted her naked she inched up the skirt some more oh lord he groaned he splashed through the waistdeep pool and grabbed her dont tease me woman she threw back her head and laughed and he took the opportunity to kiss the base of her throat help me she said this thing weighs a ton it took him a moment to realize that she was talking about her wet dress but once he caught on he grabbed a double handful of soaking wool and yanked while she pulled and squirmed soon he had her as naked as he wanted her the water gave her skin a translucent sheen you look like milk in moonlight he said then he remembered her name white you look like your name dr virginia white ginger she answered instantly no one calls me virginof course around here no one calls me ginger either what do they call you he asked while his hands got very busy she drew back priestess she answered or the lady of the white bird spring when theyre being formal she ran her hands down his chest admiring the rippling muscle beneath his damp tunic who are you he needed to know how shed gotten separated from her team how shed gotten here and why she was part of the indigenous power structure but he needed something else even more right now later he said we can get to it much later he pressed his hips against her touch me he demanded he circled her nipples with his thumbs she found the hem of his tunic and pulled it above his hips once his cock was free she stroked him slowly from his balls to the throbbing tip ginger loved the heat of him the weight and thickness the velvet over steel feel of him in her hand but she wanted him inside her even more she backed up a few steps to the edge of pool pulling him with her when they reached the side of the bath he cupped her ass and lifted her onto the mosaic edge she leaned backwards on her arms and spread her legs he filled her in one hard thrust then both of them forgot everything else he collapsed on top of her for a long time afterwards unwilling to move away from her warmth he reveled in the feel of her soft breasts and the scent of her skin he didnt know why but the sound of her heartbeat against his ear made him feel like he was home then she laughed and the sound brought bern back into the here and now he lifted his head to look at her what lord ched sent me in here with you to make morga jealous she grinned at him shed really be jealous if she knew what weve been doing whats with the chieftain wanting me to marry his daughter bern asked i suppose thats my fault its a local custom he needs somebody to rally the troops she answered hes looking for a warrior to replace the year king and i saw you in the well when he asked who could lead his army so i think weve both been in the past too long he said because what you just said seems to make sense to you and it almost makes sense to me tears suddenly welled in her big blue eyes youre really from my time the relief in her voice bordered on worship he kissed her cheeks tasting the salt from her tears happy to be of service he said youre not from my team she said i would have remembered you how do you know my name what are you doing here he should have explained all that to her already he should have gotten a debriefing from her duty should have come before sex but he found it difficult to regret the last few moments you couldnt tell what i was doing i guess ill just have to do it again he kissed her again i cant seem to stop wanting you in the vision maybe i communicated my lust through the psychic link with you she explained my gift is for scrying with water energy right he answered he knew that about her hed read it in the file it hadnt been something hed been happy about frankly he wasnt all that comfortable with a scientificmilitary project that used psychics despite the fact that he was a bit of a psychic himself he was a soldier first and the mission certainly needed soldiers but the nature of time travel had required psychics for the project to be successful no matter how much data time travelers collected on jaunts into the past it was only the travelers with psychic gifts who were able to remember their actual experiences from the journey so project teams took back all sorts of recording equipment but they also took along a psychic to serve as a living subjective memory of the events from their voyages into the past psychics also came along to study the energy nexuses the doors as it were where time travelers could enter and leave the eras they were visiting the scientists in charge of the ttp didnt always feel comfortable with all this use of psychic talent it just wasnt scientific enough for them but the people in charge of funding the project insisted on using every available research tool besides as far as anyone could explain the process of time travel it still seemed a hell of a lot more like magic than it did science we ought to put on our game faces and get down to business he said he got up and adjusted his tunic then helped ginger to her feet the woman looked good naked sorry about soaking your dress he reached down grabbed and offered her the mass of wet wool it needed a spring wash anyway she answered she picked up the sodden lump of cloth and began wringing it out into the bath water give me a hand she said and together they managed to wind the dress tight enough to squeeze out most of the water the whole time they worked bern tried to keep his eyes off her he couldnt youve got great tits he told her they were large and round and just as pale as the rest of her but for the lovely dark circles of her nipples nipples that grew peaked and hard when she noticed him looking at her he grinned as a flush spread across her chest and throat it wasnt only a smile that rose as he watched her ginger white you may be the death of me he said she snatched her dress out of his hands i think maybe you better help me on with this pity i like this view so much better he stepped close and ran his hands over her in the pretext of helping her maneuver the wet dress she was cool to the touch but she went warm where he touched you feel like satin he told her back off soldier she said he did when she was finally dressed she seemed to remember what was at stake here she had more questions for him than he could answer is your name really bern when are you from do you know what happened to the rest of my team how did you find me wheres the nexus when can we go home bern held up his hands to halt her rush of words ill answer yours if youll answer mine he spotted a stone bench against the wall and led her over to it they sat together in the warm air of the bath and he tried to sum up what he knew my team was sent out six months after yours our mission was specifically to search for your teamnot a single member made it back when we came in through the tintagel nexus it crashed behind us we couldnt get back so now your team is missing as well he nodded at least my team all came through together it didnt look like your team made it here intact the theory is that some kind of hiccup in the timedimensional energy field scattered your team in transit i noticed so we all came through at different nexus points she asked he nodded im no physicist but i managed to figure that out on my own she gave his hands a sympathetic squeeze so your teams as lost here as we are yeah but we still had our mission along with hunting for you people weve been searching for a working exit point no luck yet with that it hasnt been easy since the energy hiccup shorted out most of your teams id transponders so far youre only the second team member weve found alive who else have you found sergeant kaye thank goodness ive been so worried about him then she blanched youve found othersdead yeah sorry we found dr bohrss grave outside a village near aqua sulus gwayne had been enslaved on a saxon farmstead on the coast we got him out of the place alive but he caught an arrow in the throat when we ran into a raiding party the next day damned saxon invaders she muttered youve been hanging with the indigenous folks too long remember the saxons are supposed to take over the island after the romans left yes but not like this the incursion seems to be happening far quicker than the archeology ive seen would indicate the roman influences that overlaid the celtic base culture should have time to fade if the saxons arent halted soon the world we come from wont get a chance to develop ive been starting to believe that maybe id transported into one of those alternate worlds the theorists worry about i didnt think you were your team historian they brought me along for my visions historys just a hobby im an anglophile me i go where im sent and do what im told to do speaking of that how did you end up as the local priestess she glanced down sheepishly before looking him in the eye again i know direct involvement with the locals is against the rules but i was stuck here and i wanted to survive im lucky that the holy springs point of origin is in the woods behind the shrine and thats the nexus where i came through the romans channeled the spring into the sanctuary pool when they built the villa so it was easier for the inhabitants to believe that i was the only survivor of a band of pilgrims attacked by bandits when i wandered bloody and burned out of the woods than it would have been if id appeared out of a blaze of light in the fountain so you decided to save yourself instead of searching for the rest of your team she pulled her hands from his how would i look for the others i dont have any computer equipment im too high level on the psi chart for any implant but the wrist chip right sorry ive tried scrying to hunt for them but ive never seen them much less their locations makes sense seers dont see things connected with themselves at least not often i thought about striking out on my own to hunt for them after the locals nursed me back to health but it was the dead of winter this isnt the best of times for a woman to play tourist between the bandits and barbarians massing outside lord cheds rather flimsy walls since this was the only safe place i knew about i set about proving my usefulness so i could stay the sanctuary hadnt had a resident seer for a long time i used my scrying abilities and got the job having a real fortune teller at the holy spring increases the prestige and fame of the place which means a larger gathering of pilgrims bringing rich offerings for the goddess and greater wealth for lord ched at this years fertility festival unfortunately hes decided that the fertility part of the festivities needs a bit of rearranging and thats where you come in bern thought about what he knew of the local customs politics and religious practices and concluded the chieftain wants a warrior to challenge the year king at tonights ceremony she nodded he grimaced ah crap he wants me to kill some kid for the right to screw his daughter exactly and become the local war leader he wants you to stop the saxons ginger cleared her throat this is my fault reallyi told him i saw you in the water when he asked who would be the next year king bern shot to his feet oh for crying out loud woman she jumped up to face him hey i just report what the water shows me how was i supposed to know you were a time traveler sent to rescue me you couldnt lie sometimes its not like i knew who you were when i saw you its not my fault the water says youre fated to be king and sleep with morga she added he heard the jealousy in her voice and he liked it he noticed that theyd moved close together while they argued and that arguing with her was arousing him all over again the attraction between them was strong and hot and driving him crazy being crazy was no way to run an op knowing that didnt stop him from putting his hands on her hips there you are lord cheds voice boomed out behind them before he could pull ginger into his arms they turned to face the chieftain and the trio of men that followed him into the bathhouse ched had a smile plastered on his face but there was anger in his eyes his hand was on the pommel of a dagger on his belt bern had been prepared to tell the man he had no interest in his game of kings and priestesses but decided this might not be the right time to assert his opinion whats wrong he asked instead he put his arm protectively around gingers shoulders he was aware of the way she leaned into him all down the length of his body youre a clever one ched said nodding approvingly i know trouble when i see it and its in your eyes right now his impulse was to gather his squad and see what was going on for himself but he waited for an explanation even if the saxons were attacking the gates it wasnt his problem unless the team hed been sent to save was in immediate danger he was not in charge of the indigenous situation here and wasnt going to interfere with the locals despite the chieftains plans or gingers visions ched cleared his throat and bern realized he was embarrassed its something to do with your daughter isnt it morgas run off ched said and the year king ran with her he sighed but shes the mothers priestess ginger gasped and hes youve been spending too much time with the locals bern whispered to her in english a pair of runaways is not your problem butthe ceremony is tonight she too spoke english ched might not have understood what ginger said but he recognized the desperation in her tone you see the problem dont you lady of the spring oh we could go after those foolish children but if we drag them back ill have to execute my own daughter to appease the crowd gathered for the festival and youll have to kill that stripling shes bonded with but what about the ceremony a oneeyed man asked tradition weve changed tradition before ched cut him off he looked at one of the other men a wizened whitebearded fellow in rough brown robes havent we bishop myrdyn the old man was carrying a gnarled staff and reminded bern of gandalf youre not thinking of giving up your heathen fertility festival are you the old man asked of course not ched answered the people would riot for sure if we changed custom that far there you go againyou promise to change your pagan ways but you always find a way out of your promises didnt i say id let you baptize as many folk as you wanted tomorrow morning and in our own sacred pool that you did the christian cleric conceded he tugged thoughtfully on his earlobe once the people are sated and sore from the sex and their heads are splitting from too much drink ill preach a sermon that will lure them to save their souls from the great sins theyre going to commit this night it will be a fine harvest of souls theyll be crying for forgiveness youll make a fine year king he added looking bern over ill give my blessing to that but we need a priestess for the king to mate with the oneeyed man insisted the crops will wither without the spring mating well if im going to turn the pool into a baptismal fount it wont need a priestess anymore will it the bishop said eyeing ginger critically he pointed at her use this priestess instead of the one thats run off thatll work lord ched said clapping myrdyn on the shoulder one priestess is as good as another in the eyes of the goddess butim not a virgin ginger blurted the priestess of the mother must be a virgin when she lies with her first year king dont encourage them bern complained then he realized where she was going with this and spoke loudly we cant offend the goddess im no virgin either ched waved his hand dismissively you were both virgins once after all its virility and fertility that matter most youll both do im glad thats settled he began to turn away but i dont want to be king bern said what man doesnt want to be king ched asked turning back especially when the choice is between becoming year king or going to the goddess with the priestess and all of your men sacrificed inside the burning belly of the wicker man his smile had more than a touch of threat in it sex or death myrdyn said either way the crowd will be entertained they werent making hollow promises bern had seen the piles of kindling and a crudely woven straw statue in a field on his way into the stockade he knew that criminals were often burned alive inside such structures during the spring festival lord ched could probably get the mob angry enough at missing out on the orgy to attack his team the ensuing massacre wouldnt look good on berns record and there was the chance that some of his people could get hurt he wasnt ready to risk any of them especially ginger all he had to do was be the year king it wasnt like he minded having sex with ginger white king it is then bern said good lord ched said and he and his people marched away when they were gone ginger asked now what are we going to do bern was still grinning as he took her in his arms why rehearse for the fertility ceremony of course youll have to wear a pair of stag horns you know he grimaced and what will you be wearing not a damn thing the grimace turned into a grin i can live with that yes but my names andrew he picked her up and carried her toward the narrow bed colonel andrew bern just bern to almost everybody he kissed her before adding under the circumstances i thought we ought to be formally introduced she twined her arms around his neck nice name kiss me again all over he promised night had fallen sacred fires were lit and hundreds of pilgrims were waiting within their glow just outside the front of the estate the ceremony was ready to begin i wasnt this nervous at my wedding bern confided or my divorce hearing ginger rounded on him youre married i do not have sex with married men then youre in luck because im not married oh right divorced sorry she rested her forehead against his bare chest i am so nervous that i dont know what im saying or doing ive never done anything like this my whole life just enjoy the moment dont think about anything but me i promise i wont be thinking about anything but you you look beautiful he told her like the bride of the summer god ought to look they had braided spring flowers into her thick red curls and she was wearing morgas most diaphanous white silk dress he was wearing a doeskin loincloth he had to claim the summer kings sword then be acclaimed by the people after that theyd get naked and down to business they made their way through the watching crowd to where lord ched stood between two widely spaced bonfires ginger was deeply aware of the expectant mood of the hundreds of watching people she told herself that bern was the only thing that was real here that everything else was a dream she concentrated on the feel of him where his skin touched hers being near him truly did make her body ripe with need when they reached the chieftain ched held up a richly decorated sword and shouted behold your priestess and her new summer king while the crowd cheered ched plunged the tip of the sword into the soft spring earth now what bern whispered to ginger you say something about accepting the kingship for the love of the mother and the fertility of the land and pull the sword from the ground okay then he began to step forward hand out to take the hilt of the sacred blade wait a man shouted from the crowd before bern could touch the sword now what bern said turning toward the man who came rushing forward i challenge the man shouted coming up to glare at bern oh crap ginger muttered i forgot about lanc who the hell is lanc bern demanded she pointed at the broadshoulder darkhaired man hes this druid from brittany thats been trying to get me to run off with him bern rounded on her what you werent going to mention that theres this other guy who wants to skewer me tonight youre jealous yes she grinned oh thats so cute dont worry youre more than a match for him i challenge lanc shouted again fight me for your kingship bern gestured at the challenger hold on ill be right with you what is this guy to you he demanded of ginger nothing hes one of a group of druids going around trying to recruit psychics to come back to brittany theyre trying to keep the old religion alive back home so he doesnt want to have sex with you not as far as i yes i do lanc cut her off oh stop it ginger told him fight me for her lanc insisted the crowd was beginning to shout for the battle to begin as well okay bern said without even stopping to take a breath he turned around and hit the man in the jaw lanc went down but was up again almost instantly bern took a step back and smiled glad that the opposition had some fight in him it was strange almost as strange as being in another place and time than the one hed been born to but he was glad to have some competition he wanted ginger wanted to properly claim the woman as his fighting for her hand felt in some atavistic way right deep in his gut deep in his heart he knew ginger was a woman worth fighting for the druid was a big fit guy with some handtohand skills they circled then sparred against each other flesh and muscle straining moving through firelight and shadow while the crowd cheered and shouted sweat stung berns eyes and he tasted blood when lanc got past his guard once to strike him in the face excitement built deep in berns gut and the clarity that only came with combat focused his whole attention on the struggle for a while he almost forgot the purpose of the challenge while he concentrated on the fight then he caught sight of ginger she was flushed and her eyes were bright with excitement that sent a zing of lust straight to berns groin but her arms were tensely crossed and she also looked annoyed enjoying yourself she called sarcastically when she had his attention the momentary distraction almost cost him but he caught lancs sudden kick out of the corner of his eye and quickly countered he ended up with a hard foot grazing his thigh as he turned he returned the favor with a hard kick to lancs solar plexus that brought the man down enough of this toying with his prey when lanc tried to struggle up again bern knocked him unconscious ginger rushed up to him are you all right oh yeah he grinned and kissed her pulling her tightly against him never better the loincloth left nothing to her imagination about how he was feeling the cheering crowd faded away from his attention as he concentrated only on the woman in his arms her hand brushed against the erection straining against the soft leather then she pried herself out of his tight embrace not yet oh come on he complained but he understood when she pointed toward the sword buried in the ground he laughed right well at least i dont have to pull it out of a stone uh what she looked at him strangely and asked doesnt bern mean bear yeah he crossed to the sword bits of earth clung to the blade as he pulled it out and held it up for all to see he waited for the cheering to die down then shouted for britain and the white lady the roar this time was deafening must have sounded good he murmured ched came up to him taking both him and ginger by the hand a trio of young women accompanied him one of the girls held a staghorn headdress the other girls made quick work of stripping off his and gingers clothes after fastening the headdress on bern ched turned to the crowd and proclaimed behold the queen and king of summer this mating will bring fertility to the land let the festival begin you know im beginning to think ginger started dont bern grabbed her and kissed her he swung his naked lover up into his arms and covered her mouth with his while his tongue probed inside that sweet responsive warmth he carried her to the clothcovered mound of grass and flowers that was to serve as both bed and altar for them to mate upon put me down she demanded dont chicken out on me now he pleaded ginger laughed wickedly not a chance she remembered his directions to just look at him but the crowd was the last thing on her mind at the moment she wanted to taste him and that was what she did the crowd cheered a wave of raw sexual energy washed over her the lust channeled by the masses shot through her and she projected it back to the people around them in that moment the goddess filled her and she worshipped the god of summer and king of the land with all the fervor and passion due him bern pushed her gently onto her back on the soft fragrant altar he knelt over her poised at the moist opening of her vagina he waited while her hips rose pleadingly now she demanded but he didnt move until her gaze finally met his the night is just beginning he told her then he entered her and his worship of the goddess began in earnest ahem the embarrassed throatclearing followed by a second voice demanding cover your shame woman was the last thing ginger expected to hear after the night shed enjoyed besides she wasnt sure how shame was supposed to be covered especially when what she felt was marvelous all right she was sore and tender in places and rather hung over though not in the havingdrunktoomuchalcohol way who knew too much great sex could make you groggy could you have too much great sex if it could be done shed done it tonight colonel sir the embarrassed voice whispered excuse me for waking you up but rouse yourself man the other voice boomed ginger giggled please dont she murmured not on my account not just yet anyway wha what bern muttered she felt his breath brush her cheek when he spoke and realized that he was the warm weight lying half on top of her the cool morning breeze skimmed across the rest of her teasing one bare nipple to a hard peak maybe that was the shame the guy was talking about was that any way to talk to the goddesss own that voicethere was something familiar about it is that you dr white gingers eyes flew open and she caught sight of a familiar concerned face sergeant kaye oh good lord she was naked in front of a colleague she didnt recognize the man standing next to him but the stranger was frowning down at her with utter disgust written all over his face his names percy perkins and hes a jerk bern whispered he sat up and said i hope you brought us some clothes kaye the sergeant held out the dress ginger had worn last night and a long tunic for bern of course you realize that i intend to report this infraction percy said infraction of what bern asked theres no rule against team members fraternizing you led an orgy your disgusting behavior roused the indigenous population to he didnt get any sir kaye put in bern scratched his jaw i can see how that might make him cranky not to mention being named percy ginger added that alone probably put the guy into years of therapy could you sue your parents for giving you a name like that she asked bern he shrugged ask percy well she said percy declined to respond but his posture though it seemed impossible became even more tense i could use a shave bern said and a bath he sprang to his feet and helped ginger up how about you sweetheart definitely have the team meet us at the bath kaye but give us a few minutes will you they could hear percy spluttering as they walked away she slipped the white dress over her head and they walked arm in arm across the field toward the villa frequently stepping over and around stillsleeping revelers the spring ceremony had apparently been a great success kaye went off to his assignment and percy followed behind them making the occasional disapproving sound the morning sun shone down the sky was blue the earth was green birds sang and ginger was happier than shed ever been before they had the blessing of the goddess she supposed they passed the old bishop preaching to a small group of revelers who looked thoroughly hangdog and hung over myrdyn gave them a pleasant nod when he saw them pass him by we must be good for business bern said if he baptizes all those people the energy in the pool is going to be whacked out for days ginger said that is hardly a scientific explanation of a temporal malfunction dr white percy complained they both ignored him once they reached the bathhouse ginger led them into the preparation room where oils scented the bathers bodies before they got into the hot water of the bathing pool benches lined the walls and the floor was tiled in a beautiful leafpatterned mosaic this is where i meant to bring you yesterday she told bern he pulled her close they looked into each others eyes it was worth the detour you two are being disgusting percy said bern sighed you know this time i think i agree with him he let her go we do need to make plans we have work to do she said do i detect some professionalism at last percy whined shut up percy ginger and bern said together and thats an order bern added ginger took a seat on a bench against the back wall within a few minutes kaye and the rest of the team joined them bern allowed his people a few minutes of teasing him before the introductions this is gareth and lamorak ginger smiled of course they are he didnt understand what amused her and didnt ask lets get down to business now that we have recovered dr white its time to continue surveying the nexus points percy said immediately percys a douser bern explained to ginger hes working on a new nexus map but he hasnt yet found a spot with enough energy to get us home its hardly my fault that this island is swamped with more energy points than anywhere else on the planet especially in this area it was a mistake to send a team this far back and especially to this geographic location yeah i think were all aware of that gareth said we noticed the problems and thats before you started telling us every five minutes we have one more man to find lamorak said thatll round out our mission finding the exit point is far more important for our own survival percy said we should cut our losses and concentrate on finding a functioning nexus perhaps dr white could conjure up a vision of where we should go he added but not as though he meant it whatd i ever do to you was gingers response to this rudeness see if i tell you if i find it bern liked that she refused to be intimidated by the jerk no one gets left behind he reminded percy were still looking for owens but his transpond percy started what does your gut tell you sir kaye jumped in you found me your transponder was working percy cut him off intermittently it was colonel berns instincts that really found me balderdash percy scoffed does anyone really say balderdash ginger asked just percy bern replied the colonels gut led us here and we found dr white gareth said so what do you think about owens sir bern considered for a moment sensing more than thinking finally he said i think that most of the population in the area is camped out around this stronghold if i was owens id be here too he swept his gaze around his team break up go look for him reconvene here at noon there were nods and people turned to leave before he left percy just had to ask and what will you be doing while were searching bern put his arm around gingers shoulders im going to be standing at the lady of the white bird springs side while she seeks a vision to help us find a way home good bishop myrdyn hasnt used the place yet ginger said as they entered the empty shrine now she didnt have to regret insisting that they get cleaned up before coming to the spring her skin felt fresh and tingly and all the aches from strenuous bouts of sex were soothed her hair hung in a damp braid down her back and bern had shaved if only we had coffee i could face anything she said find us the right nexus and ill buy you your own starbucks he replied he wouldnt be able to do any such thing of course even if she could somehow pull the right vision out of the sacred pool it saddened her to know that she would return to her point of origin and he would return to his which was six months further along the main timeline than hers she would remember what happened and six months later hed read a report filed by her and learn what hed done in the past it wouldnt be proper to record their sexual encounters in the official record even if the dry bureaucratic tone of reports could use spicing up a bit hed probably never even know who she was but shed remember forever what are you smiling about he asked nothing she turned her smile briefly on him and then dropped to her knees i doubt this will work she warned i dont normally see anything dealing with my own future you saw me didnt you i saw you in response to lord ched asking who the next king would be by the way theres something important you should know about that she added not now as soon as we conclude the search for owen im taking you and the rest of my people out of here but youll find me a nexus i know it look into the water calm yourself concentrate i know how to summon the visions andrew he put his hands on her shoulders and gently began to massage them he communicated his faith in her through his touch damn but she was going to hate losing this man she appreciated the moment refused to feel sorry for herself and set about doing her duty at first of course all she saw was a pool of water as still and clear as a looking glass but the calm peaceful water changed quickly bern grew worried when gingers muscles went suddenly tense what he asked what do you see fire she answered her voice distant and dull fire on the hill what hill whats burning theres a battle she said you have to defeat them its your destiny a battle he didnt like the sound of that what does any of that have to do with getting us all safely home lord ched came running into the sanctuary before she could respond theyre coming he shouted the saxons are coming a guard followed him in pushing a woman ahead of him ched looked at the woman tell him he commanded the woman was crying mercy my lord i did come back to warn you yes yes the chieftain said he pointed to bern tell the king what you told me everybody looked at him bern wanted to yell at them to cut out calling him king but even ginger had come out of her trance and was looking at him like he was the hero of the hour and damn it the thought of disappointing her made him feel like a jerk he gritted his teeth and nodded for the woman to go on its true i helped my lady morga and her man escape ive taken care of the girl all her life and i understood how shed been with the last year king long enough to think of him as her husband and not to want to bed a new man she looked bern over though i think she would have gotten the better part of the bargain had she stayed and done her duty get on to the important part the chieftain urged the pair of them were angry and affronted at being forced to run from their home after we made camp last night they talked about how they would betray the secrets of the strongholds defenses to the saxons ched rubbed the back of his neck but that is the secretwe have no defenses but the invaders arent aware of how weak we are the guard said theyll march straight for us now they will be arriving soon the woman said i had to come back to warn my people that their doom approaches bern wished she hadnt put it like that it made him feel sorry for the indigenous population even worse the way they all looked to him to take command made him feel responsible for them these people were going to be easy pickings without some help bern thought of all the defenseless people camped out around the stronghold theyd come here for a religious celebration not to be slaughtered how will you defend us lord ched asked him ginger came forward and put her hand on his arm i was studying the pool for advice on that very subject when you arrived if you would let us continue with the divination the king will meet with you afterwards better prepared to save your people the chieftain and his people left without another word when they were alone ginger grabbed the front of berns tunic held on tight and talked fast you listen to me colonel bern i will not have you quoting rules and regs about noninterference and the possibility of changing history we dont have any solid history from this era to go on but we do have myths and legends and hon i think i know whats going on here you have to fight the invaders you you are the element necessary to slow down the incursions and give the native culture more time to recover from roman rule that way when the saxons do take over itll be overlaying a britishbased culture rather than a roman one in our time well have england the way we know it if you duck this battle we wont its your duty take on the invaders here and now you were meant to do this bern gaped at her what the hell are you talking about you said it yourself last night at least i dont have to pull it out of a stone you pulled the sword from the soil of britain and claimed the kingship you are dont you dare put that on me hed finally figured out where this was going bern means bear she went on one of the translations of no and then theres your mens names theres kaye and youve been drinking that spring water too long as well as looking into it havent you his tone was doubtful but his instincts were shouting at him that she was right he knew hed hurt her feelings but they were interrupted once again before he could apologize this time it was the rest of the team that came into the sanctuary look who we found boss kaye crowed your gut was right again stop looking smug he ordered ginger welcome to your rescue professor owen he said to the newcomer im grateful the project sent a team for us owen gave ginger a nod and smile she smiled back and if rumor is correct youve come to the rescue just in the nick of time weve heard that the saxons are heading this way kaye told him time for us to bug out right bern waited for ginger to protest but she crossed her arms and bit her lower lip instead of nagging him damn it that made it even harder for him to say no to her i took an oath to protect these people last night he told the team the least we can do is give the locals a chance at getting away what precisely to you mean by we percy spoke up at no point do i recall having signed a social contract with these people going native is not one of our options whats wrong with helping people owen demanded the locals have helped me survive for months i owe them so do i ginger said very touching but irrelevant percy responded you are such a wuss gareth said come on fighting a bunch of barbarians will be fun no it wont bern said sternly and dont make the assumption that im asking for a consensus or volunteers this is a military operation and im in command were all going into this fight his soldiers immediately snapped to attention and he nodded to them percy didnt look happy but at least this finally shut him up bern glanced at ginger she was looking at him with enough pride in her eyes to set his heart on fire she made him feel like a hero this wasnt the time to kiss her all over the way he wanted to but he did put his arm around her waist and draw her close as they stood hip to hip he said remember the hillside we crossed on the way here there were nods were going to set up our perimeter there its time to break out the claymores boys ginger gave him a puzzled look but her expression cleared before he could explain oh youre not talking about big scottish swords are you no hon im talking about shaped charges that blow up fire in the sky she said just what the vision showed me this had better work ginger thought she hugged herself tightly please god let it work and dont let anything happen to bernor any of the good guyswhile youre at it please lady she added since she was officially a priestess of the goddess well maybe not officially anymore since soon shed be leaving lord cheds villa forever she was standing in the woods at the source of the spring with a bundle of provisions at her feet waiting for the rest of the team to join her the plan was for her to wait safely out of the way while the men carried out the op bern had insisted she stay out of harms way and she hadnt argued she was no warrior besides securing their nexus was probably the most important part of this op some of the other women had taken up arms to fight alongside their men after bern gave a rousing speech to the gathered pilgrims this was the ancient way of the celts and more proof as far as ginger was concerned that this battle was going to slow the tide of invasion the people were eager to follow bern into battle their willingness to defend their homeland was a good sign too right please horned god and lady of the spring dont let me have started something thats going to get a lot of people killed especially not bern she reminded herself that he was a competent professional soldier he had a good strategy he had trained subordinates he had explosives he was going to win the day the plan for the ttp team was that after the battle was joined and the good guys were winning theyd withdraw and join ginger in the woods with their obligation to help the people fulfilled the team could then continue their search for a working nexus that would take them home home away from bern she dashed away tears it had to be if she went home with a broken heart and a deep ache for the way he made her body sing she still had the memories to appreciate at least theyd spent as much time as they could over the last three days making love while waiting for the saxons and now the saxons were here ginger paced nervously what if it didnt work was there something she could do to help she hated the quiet here in the woods maybe she was safer here but the sudden need to know what was going on got the better of her she cut through the woods rather than take the path that led toward the villa the perfect spring weather of the festival had been replaced by a pewter sky that threatened rain and a wind that blew cooler than it should for this time of year it was a grim day fit for a battle she supposed when she reached the south edge of the woods she got a good view down the valley to the hill beyond half of the british fighters were spread out below the hill waiting there instead of occupying the high ground she caught sight of chainmail and swordblades as gray as the day and the energya mixture of fear and anticipationhit her like a blow she put herself behind a tree and waited and watched the atmosphere grew even more tense thunder rumbled in the distance soon a large band of saxon warriors appeared on the crest of the hill they saw the britons waiting for them and drew to a halt more of the invaders came up behind them and more until there was an army of several hundred fierce barbarians looking down upon the several dozen notquitesofierce barbarians below the saxons formed into a long line that stretched out along the top of the hill but since they held the high ground they didnt seem to be in any hurry to rush the people below which was what bern had counted on a line of claymore mines had been set right where the saxons were now standing when the mines went off there was indeed fire bursting up toward the sky and screaming and blood and flying body parts what was left of the saxon invaders turned to flee but that could not be allowed berns team and the other half of the british force came out of hiding in the woods on the far side of the hill and drove the remainder of the saxons down the hill onto the swords of those waiting for them the reality was so much worse than her vision but she never doubted the necessity of this battle ginger watched the carnage long enough to be assured that everything was going to turn out as planned there would be a victory here today at camlan hill legend would speak of magic making the very soil of britain gape wide to send the enemy to the fires of hell only witnessing it upset her more than she realized because she got lost in the thick woods making her way back to the spring by the time she found her way to the rendezvous point it had started to rain bern and the team were waiting for her theyd brought horses with them you scared me half mad woman bern stopped pacing and pulled her roughly to him by the elbows where have you been she was so happy to see him that she kissed him she began to cry with relief and was glad to have the rain to cover this excess of emotion except she knew it didnt work when he kissed her cheeks and said you taste salty and you smell sweaty she said lets get out of here he kept his arms around her when she would have gone for her pack but where do we go from here he glanced toward percy the subject had been under discussion for days the problem with this area was an overabundance of sites where energy concentrated ginger had stayed out of it because she didnt want to be dismissed out of hand as a total loon now she had to speak up she had the answer they needed we need to go to the isle of apples she told them wheres that bern asked gareth laughed so im not the only one whos seen the parallels kaye nodded thoughtfully maybe she should have spoken up sooner percy pulled a handheld computer out of a leather pouch on his belt he checked a map screen and then frowned at her ive worked out the search grid very carefully theres no reason to deviate from where is this apple island bern asked isle of apples ginger corrected she cleared her throat took a deep breath and made herself publicly say avalon oh for crying out loud percy yelled in disgust she didnt blame him i admit it might seem a little farfetched a little he sneered living among these people has made you as superstitious as they are youve come to accept their mythology as its not one of the local myths gareth spoke not yet anyway it is one of our myths following it might lead us home gambling on what might happen is not a scientific or logical basis for finding the correct nexus percy argued bern rubbed his jaw and chuckled might doesnt always make right i just remembered where that came from but where is avalon hasnt that always been a mystery it doesnt exist youre not going along with this are you colonel percy demanded he pointed accusingly at ginger why because shes good in bed ginger was rather pleased that several team members stepped forward but bern got to percy first and punched him in the jaw percy hit the wet ground and was wise enough to stay down he sat in the mud rubbed his jaw and kept his mouth shut so where do we go bern asked her tradition points to glastonbury she answered theres a nexus on top of that big hill thats there he asked she shook her head and glanced at percy not on top of the tor right he grimaced but nodded theres a sacred spring called chalice well at the foot of glastonbury tor i think thats where we have to go lets do it mount up bern ordered the team we need to get out of here before the locals come looking for us so they can throw a feast in our honor as the men moved to mount their animals he snatched ginger around the waist and put her up on the horse in front of him she snuggled back against him and he wrapped his cape around both of them in this warm intimate position he leaned forward to whisper being like this with you almost makes me like riding a horse she tilted her head against his shoulder determined to draw every bit of nearness to him she could in the time they had left then lets enjoy the ride i dont believe it percy said he doublechecked his equipment as the water of the glastonbury spring bubbled up at his feet then he gave ginger a sour look shes right the energy reading is right kaye asked its off the scale percy answered enough to take all of us home owen asked jump in and find out percy invited he glanced around the green and lovely glade before the priestesses we chased off come back with an angry mob kaye added if at all possible ttp operatives were supposed to appear and vanish without any witnesses around scaring the locals with the sound and light show that accompanied time travel was considered not only impolite but possibly dangerous to the primary timeline ttp visits wove in and out of and the problem with places like sacred springs as nexus points was that they tended to be occupied with priests and pilgrims and such like so bern had had his people approach this one with swords drawn and chase everyone away percy was right about their not having much time for goodbyes form up into teams he said he took gingers hand before she could join the people shed traveled with into the past he drew her away from the spring and tilted her chin up with his fingers you are so beautiful he told her in a pale freckled sort of way she answered she tried to sound light but her voice came out tight and strained ill miss you dr virginia white words couldnt begin to describe what having to separate was doing to him have i thanked you for rescuing me yet she asked she gave him a brief hard embrace its been a pleasure knowing you colonel andrew bern he kissed her then it was fierce and quick and not enough he ran the back of his hand across her cheek hey we made history or something like it he nodded and his throat was too tight for him to manage to say more than go she gave him a sad smile and went over to join kaye and owen who were already standing in the springs shallow pool they each placed their left thumbs over the inside of their right wrists gingers gaze didnt leave his on my mark kaye said activate everyone pressed down hard on the retrieval implant the column of light that sprang from the water blinded him the roar of the shock wave was deafening bern refused to look away the last thing he saw was gingers face as she whispered goodbye ginger looked up from the photo before her on the desk and sighed a copper bowl filled with water sat on the desk but she wasnt interested in looking into it being a psychic wasnt as much fun for her as it used to be it had been six months since shed gotten back to her own time six months and three days to be precise not that she was counting shed done the debriefing and written up her report and been sent back to her regular life until such time as the ttp deemed her special skills necessary again for now her regular life consisted of working with law enforcement on coldcase files and being alone she sighed again and stood up it wasnt that she didnt appreciate being back she loved her house and garden she loved central heating and modern medicine and interactive holographic entertainment and regular meals of anything she wanted she hadnt realized how much shed missed shopping for shoes until shed entered her first mall she loved being home it was just that she missed bern her body ached for him when she was alone in her bed at night but the notion of taking another lover was anathema even trying a holo lover hadnt worked for her she got up and began to pace around her office she was well aware that bern had returned to the present three days before and even more aware that it didnt matter maybe there was some way that she could introduce herself to him but how fair would it be to him when she knew their past and he didnt there was no way for them to pick up where theyd left off there was a good chance he wouldnt even be interested in her under normal circumstances maybe she wouldnt be interested in him she laughed hollowly still conscious of the ecstasy he brought her when his body joined with hers yeah right sure im going to forget that then again she really wanted the man why shouldnt she fight for what she wanted she should find a way to introduce herself and see what there is someone at the door the houses security system announced it was an old house with a very basic system so it wasnt about to be more informative than that so unless the water in the scrying bowl suddenly showed her who it waswhich it wasnt likely to doshe had to answer the door herself entertaining a visitor even someone looking to get their future read without an appointment was better than pacing around feeling sorry for herself the man standing at the door was the last person she expected to be there and the one person in all of space and time she wanted to see bern he kissed her before she could say anything else the fire that had been between them from the first moment sparked to flames she clung to him with all her might her body molded against his if hed taken her there on the front porch she wouldnt have minded instead he swung her around into the house and kicked the door closed behind them they fell together onto the entryway carpet and clothes were quickly shed and pushed aside he was thrusting inside her hard and strong and fast before she managed to breathlessly say you remembered me then she came for the first time and forgot about words for a long time afterwards of course i remembered he said later when they were lying together in a sweaty tangled heap youre unforgettable she stroked his cheek oh thats sweetwait a minutethat means youre psychic he nodded i thought percy was your team psychic he was on the civilian side the military side always tries to have someone wholl remember the op on a ttp team really i didnt know that thats because that information is shared on a needtoknow basis this seems like a good time for you to need to know now i understand why kaye kept talking about your gut feelings i should have guessed he meant your psychic intuition you should have guessed when we went for each other like we were in heat instantly right after we met that kind of lust only comes when like meets like so ive heard hey the lust had me pretty distracted that and starring in orgies and fighting the saxons and that whole matter of britain thing we had going he sighed matter of britain my ass she stroked it its a very nice ass i have a nice big bed it might fit in upstairs she told him he helped her to her feet even though she groaned in protest when he stopped touching her breasts id be delighted to spend as much time as possible in your nice big bed good but first he added i did come here to ask if youd like to go on a date this evening ive got tickets for a revival of an old musical i think youll enjoy curiosity nibbled away some of her lust what would that be he grinned spamalot she hooted and they held each other tight shaking with laughter what other production could possibly be more perfect for their first date life is the teacher carrie vaughn emma slid under the surface of the water and stayed there she lay in the tub on her back and stared up at a world made soft blurred with faint ripples an unreal world viewed through a distorted filter for minutesfour six tenshe stayed under water and didnt drown because she didnt breathe would never breathe again the world looked different through these undead eyes thicker somehow and also strangely clearer survival seemed like such a curious thing once youd already been killed this was her life now she didnt have to stay here she could end it any time she wanted just by opening the curtains at dawn but she didnt sitting up she pushed back her soaking hair and rained water all around her with the noise of a rushing stream outside the bloodwarm bath her skin chilled in the air she felt every little thing every little currentfrom the vent from a draft from the window coolness eddying along the floor striking the walls she shivered put the fingers of one hand on the wrist of the other and felt no pulse after spreading a towel on the floor she stepped from the bath she looked at herself she didnt look any different same slim body smooth skin young breasts the right size to cup in her hands nipples the color of a bruised peach her skin was paler than she remembered so pale it was almost translucent bloodless not for long she dried her brown hair so it hung straight to her shoulders and dressed with more care than she ever had before not that the clothes she put on were by any means fancy or new or anything other than what shed already had in her closet a tailored silk shirt over a black lace camisole jeans black leather pumps and a few choice pieces of jewelry a couple of thin silver chains and dangling silver earrings every piece every seam every fold of fabric produced an effect and she wanted to be sure she produced the right effect young confident alluring without of course looking like she was trying to produce such an effect it must seem casual thrown together effortless she switched the earrings from one ear to the other because they didnt seem to lay right the other way this must be what a prostitute felt like dissatisfied she went upstairs to see alette the older woman was in the parlor waiting in a wingback chair the room was decorated in tasteful antiques persian rugs and velvetupholstered furniture with thick rich curtains hanging over the windows books crammed into shelves and a silver tea service ornamented the mantel for all its opulent decoration the room had a comfortable natural feel to it its owner had come by the decor honestly the victorian atmosphere was genuine alette spoke with a refined british accent you dont have to do this alette was the most regal elegant woman emma knew an apparent thirty years old she was poised dressed in a silk skirt and jacket her brunette hair tied in a bun her face like porcelain she was over four hundred years old emma was part of her clan her family by many ties from many directions by blood alette was emmas ancestor a manygreats grandmother closer alette had made the one who in turn had made emma that had been unplanned emma hadnt wanted it the man in question had been punished he was gone now and alette had taken care of her mother mentor mistress you cant bottle feed me forever emma replied in this existence that meant needles iv tubes and a willing donor it was so clinical i can try alette said her smile wry if emma let her alette would take care of her forever literally forever but that felt wrong somehow if emma was going to live like this then she ought to live not cower like a child thank you for looking after me im not trying to sound ungrateful but but you want to be able to look after yourself emma nodded and again the wry smile touched alettes lips our family has always had the most awful streak of independence emmas laugh startled her she didnt know she still could remember what ive taught you alette said rising from her chair and moving to stand with emma how to choose how to lure him how to leave him remember how ive taught you to see and to feel and remember to only take a little if you take it all youll kill him or risk condemning him to this life i remember the lessons had been difficult shed had to learn to see the world with new eyes alette smoothed emmas hair back from her face and arranged it over her shouldersan uncharacteristic bit of fidgeting i know you do and i know youll be fine but if you need anything please ill call emma finished you wont send anyone to follow me will you no she said i wont thank you alette kissed her cheek and sent her to hunt alone for the first time alette had given her advice go somewhere new in an unfamiliar neighborhood where she wasnt likely to meet someone from her old life therefore making her less likely to encounter complications of emotion or circumstance emma didnt take this advice shed been a student at george washington university officially shed taken a leave of absence but she wasnt sure shed ever be able to continue her studies and finish her degree there were always night classes surebut it was almost a joke and like most anything worth doing easier said than done there was a place a bar where she and her friends used to go sometimes when classes got out theyd arrive just in time for happy hour when they could buy twodollar hamburgers and cheap pitchers of beer theyd eat supper play a few rounds of pool bitch about classes and papers they hadnt written yet on weekends theyd come late and play pool until last call a completely normal life that was what emma found herself missing a few months into this new life laughing with her friends maybe she should have gone someplace else for this found new territory but she wanted to see the familiar she came in through the front and paused blinked a couple of times took a deep breath through her nose to taste the air and the world slowed down noise fell to a low hum the lights seemed to brighten and just by turning her head a little she could see it all thirtyfour people packed into the first floor of this converted townhouse twelve sat at the bar two worked behind the bar splashing their way through the fumes of a dozen different kinds of alcohol their sweat mixed with those fumes two kinds of heat blending with the third ashy odor of cigarette smoke this place was hot with bodies five beating hearts played pool around two tables in the back three more watchedthese were female girlfriends the smell of competing testosterone was ripe all the rest crammed around tables or stood in empty spaces putting alcohol into their bodies their bloodemma could smell it through their pores she caught all this in a glance in a second she could feel the clear paths by the way the air moved incredibly she could feel the whole room all of it pressing gently against her skin as if she looked down on it from above as if she commanded it therethat couple at the table in the corner was fighting the woman stared into her tumbler of gin and tonic while her foot tapped a nervous beat on the floor her boyfriend stared at her frowning hard his arms crossed his scotch forgotten emma could have him if she wanted his blood was singing with need he would be easy to persuade to lure away from his difficulty a chance meeting by the bathrooms an unseen exit out the back no not like that a quartet of boisterous drunken men burst into laughter in front of her raucous businessschool types celebrating some exam or finished project she knew how to get to them too stumble perhaps lean an accidental arm on a shoulder gasp an apologyand the one who met her gaze first would be the one to follow her instead she went to the bar and despite the crowd the press of bodies jostling for space her path there was clear and a space opened for her just as she arrived because she knew it would be there she wanted to miss the taste of alcohol she could remember the taste of wine the tang on the tongue the warmth passing down her throat she remembered great dinners her favorite mexican food overstuffed burritos with sour cream and chile verde with a big salty margarita she wanted to miss it with a deep and painful longing but the memories turned her stomach the thought of consuming anything made her feel sick anything except blood the glass of wine before her remained untouched it was only for show she never would have done this in the old days sitting alone at the bar like this staring into her drinkshe looked like she was trying to get picked up well wasnt she when the door opened and a laughing crowd of friends entered emma turned and smiled in greeting even before the door had opened shed known somehow shed sensed the sound of a voice the tone of a footstep the scent of skin a ripple in the air she couldnt have remembered such fine details from her old life but somehow shed known she knew them emma hey chris finally her smile felt like her old smile her old friends gathered around leaned in for hugs and she obliged them but the one who spoke to her the one she focused on was chris he was six feet tall with wavy blond hair and a cleanshaven handsome face still boyish but filling out nicely he had a shy smile and laughing eyes whereve you been i havent seen you in weeks the registrars office said you took a leave of absence she had her story all figured out it wasnt even a lie really ive been sick she said you couldnt even call really sick she pressed her lips in a thin smile hoping she sounded sad yeah i guess he took the cue not to press the question further he brightened but you look great now really great there it was a spark in his eye a flush in his cheek shed always wondered if he liked her shed never been sure now she had tools she had senses and she looked great it wasnt her a bitter voice sounded inside her it was this thing riding her this creature inside her it was a lure a trap looking great made men like chris blush now she could use it she knew how to respond shed always been uncertain before she lowered her gaze smiled then looked at him warmly searching thanks ii guess you already have a drink the others had moved off to claim one of the pool tables chris remained leaning on the bar beside her nervously tapping his foot compared to him emma had no trouble radiating calm she was in control here let me get you something she said for a momentfor a long lingering blissful momentit felt like old times they only talked but the conversation was long and heartfelt he really listened to her so she kept talkingso much so that she almost got to the truth ive had to reassess everything what am i going to do with my life whats the point of it all she shrugged letting the implications settle you must have been really sick he said his gaze intent i thought i was going to die she said and it wasnt a lie she didnt remember much of itthe man the monsters hand on her face on her arms pinning her to the bed she wanted to scream but the sound caught in her throat and however frightened she was her body responded to his touch flushed shuddered toward him and this made her ashamed she hoped that he would kill her rather than turn her but she awoke again and the world was different you make it sound like youre not coming back hm she murmured startled out of her memory to school you arent coming back are you i dont know she said wanting to be honest knowing she couldnt tell him everything itd be hard after whats happened i just dont know this felt so casual so normal that she almost forgot she had a purpose here that she was supposed to be guiding this conversation she surprised herself by knowing what to say next this is going to sound really cliché but when you think you arent going to make it like that it really does change how you look at things you really do try to live for the moment you dont have time to screw around anymore which was ironic because really she had all the time in the world chris hung on her words no it doesnt sound cliché at all it sounds real i just dont think i have time anymore for school id rather you knowlive this sounded awfulso false and ironic dont listen to me im immortal part of her almost yelled but she didnt because another part of her was hungry when he spoke he sounded uncertain dodo you want to get out of here go to my place maybe her shy smile widened shed wanted him to say that she wanted him to think this was his idea she rounded her shoulders aware of her posture her body language wanting to send a message that she was open willing and ready yeah she said touching his hand as she stood his skin felt like fire chris took her back to his place he lived within walking distance in a gardenlevel unit in a block of apartments a nice place small but functional and very student it felt like a foreign country emma watched chris unlock the door and felt some trepidation nerves that was all anticipation unknown territoryto be expected going home with a new guy for the first time chris fumbled with the key there was more to this than the unknown or the thrill of anticipation she stood on the threshold literally and felt something a force outside of herself nothing solid rather a feeling that made her want to turn away like a voice whispering go you are not welcome this is not your place your blood does not dwell here she couldnt ignore it the voice fogged her senses if she turned away even just a littlestepped back tilted her head awayher mind cleared she didnt notice when chris finally unlocked the door and pushed his way inside she didnt know how long hed been standing on the other side of the threshold looking back at her expectantly she simply couldnt move forward come on in he said giving a reassuring smile the feeling fog and voice disappeared the unseen resistance fell away the barrier was gone shed been invited returning his smile she went in inside was what shed expected from a male college student the front room had a ripe welllived in smell of dirty laundry and pizza boxes mostly though it smelled like him in a moment she took it all in the walls and the carpet despite how many times the former had been repainted and the latter replaced the sense that generations of college students had passed through here lingered the years of life pressed against her skin and she closed her eyes to take it all in to feel it eddy around her it tingled against her like static do you want something to drink chris was sweating just a little yes no im okay seduction wasnt a quick thing though she supposed if she wanted she could just take him she could feel in her bones and muscles that she could he wouldnt know what hit him it would be easy use the currents of the room slow down the world move in the blink of an eye no no speed no fear no mess better to do it cleanly nicer for everyone now that they were alone away from the crowd her purpose became so very clear her need became crystalline she planned it out a brief touch on his arm press her body close and let him do the rest fake it was fake manipulativeshe liked him she really did she wished shed done this months ago she wished shed had the nerve to say something to touch his handbefore shed been attacked and turned then she hadnt had the courage and now she wanted something else from him it felt like deception this was why alette had wanted her to find a stranger she wouldnt be wishing that it had all turned out different maybe she wouldnt care she wanted to like chrisshe didnt want to need him like this didnt want to hurt him and she didnt know if shed have been so happy to go home with anyone else that was why she was here that was why shed gone to that particular bar and waited for him that doesnt matter her instinctsnew instincts like static across her skin like the heat of blood drawing hertold her the emotion is a byproduct of need he is yours because youve won him youve already won him you have only to claim him she reached outshe could feel him without looking by sensing the way the air folded around his bodyand brushed her fingers across the back of his hand he reacted instantly curling his hand around hers squeezing pulling himself toward her and kissing herhalf on cheek half on lip he pulled back waiting for a reaction his breath coming fast and brushing her cheek she didnt breathe at allwould he notice should she gasp to fool him into thinking she breathed so he wouldnt notice that she didnt another deception rather than debating the question she lunged for him her lips seeking his kissing forcefully distract him in a minute he wouldnt notice anything she devoured him and he was off balance lagging behind as she sucked his lips and sought his tongue shed never been this hungry for someone before the taste of his skin his sweat his mouth burst inside her and fired her brain he tasted so good on the outside she couldnt wait to discover what the inside of him tasted like that warm blood flushing just under the surface her nails dug into his arm wanting to pull off the sleeves of his shirt all his clothes to be closer to his living skin she wanted nothing more than to close her teeth bite into him she pulled back almost ripping herself away broke all contact and took a step back so that she was surrounded by cool air and not flesh she could hear the blood rushing in his neck this wasnt her this wasnt her doing this she couldnt do this chris gave a nervous chuckle wow that wasemma whats wrong she closed her eyes took a moment to gather herself drew breath to speak it would look like a deep sigh to him im sorry she said i cant do this she couldnt look at him if he saw her eyes saw the way she looked at him hed know about the thing inside her hed know she only wanted to rip him open how could she explain to him without explaining i had a really nice timebut im sorry holding the collar of her jacket closed she fled before he could say a word in argument alette had had to force her to drink blood the first time emma hadnt wanted to become this thing shed threatened to leave the house at dawn and die in the sunlight but alette persuaded her to stay a haunted need inside her listened to that wanted to survive and stayed inside in the dark still she gagged when the mistress showed her the glass tumbler full of viscous red its only your first night in this life she said youre too new to hunt but you still need this alette had then stood behind her embraced emma and locked her arms tight with one hand while tipping the glass to her mouth with the other emma had struggled fought to pull out of her grasp but alette was deceptively powerful and emma was still sick and weak emma had recognized the scent of the blood even before it reached her lips tangy metallic like a butchers shop even as she rebelled even as her mind quailed part of her reached toward it her mouth salivated this contradiction was what had caused her to break down screaming that she didnt want this that she couldnt do this kicking and thrashing in alettes grip but alette had been ready for it and very calmly held her still forced the glass between her lips and made her drink as much spilled out of her mouth and down her chin as slid down her throat then shed fallen still helpless shed surrendered even as that single sip returned her strength to her eventually she could hold the glass herself and drain it she even realized she should learn to find the blood herself she thought shed been ready alette found her in the parlor sitting curled up on one of the sofas what happened emma hugged her knees and stared into space shed spent hours here almost until dawn watching dust motes watching time move this was fascinatingthe idea that she could see time move almost if she concentrated she could reach out and touch it twist it cross the room in a second she would look like she was flying shed almost done it earlier tonight shed have taken him so quickly he wouldnt have known alette waited patiently for her to answer like she could also spend all night watching time move i dont know even after all that had happened her voice sounded like a little girls she still felt like a child i liked him it wasit felt good i thought she shook her head the memory was a distant thing she didnt want to revisit it i got scared i had him in the palm of my hand he was mine i was strong and this thing rose up in me this amazing poweri could do anything but it wasnt me so i got scared and ran poised and regal alette sat hands crossed in her lap the elegant noblewoman of an old painting nothing shook her nothing shattered her thats the creature thats what you are now how you control it will determine what your life will look like from now on it was a pronouncement a judgment a knell of doom alette continued some of our kind give free rein to it they revel in it it makes them strong but often leaves them vulnerable if you try to ignore it it will consume you youll lose that part of yourself that is yours in her bones in the tracks of her bloodless veins emma knew alette was right and this was what she feared that she wasnt strong that she wouldnt control it that she would lose her self her soul to the thing her eyes ached with tears that didnt fall how did alette control it how did she manage to sit so calm and dignified with the creature writhing inside of her desperate for power emma felt sure she wouldnt last long enough to develop that beautiful selfpossession oh my dear hush there alette moved to her side and gathered her in her arms shed seen emmas anguish and now sought to wrap her in comfort emma clung to her pressing her face against the cool silk of her jacket holding tight to her arms for just a moment she let herself be a child protected within the older womans embrace i cant teach you everything some steps you must take alone i can take care of you if you likekeep you here watch you always hold the creature at bay and bring you cups of blood but i dont think youd be happy i dont know that ill ever be happy i dont think i can do this the power is a tool you use to get what you need it should not control you not much of the night remained emma felt dawn tugging at her nervesanother new sensation to catalog with the rest the promise of sunlight was a weariness that settled over her and drove her underground to a bed in a sealed windowless room at least she didnt need a coffin small comfort come alette said urging her to her feet sleep for now vanquish this beast another night her mind was still her own and she still dreamed the fluttering disjointed scenes took place in daylight already the sunlit world of her dreaming memories had begun to look odd to her unreal and uncertain as if these things could never really have happened at dusk she woke and told herself all kinds of platitudes she had to get back on the horse if at first you dont succeedbut it came down to wanting to see chris again she wanted to apologize she found his phone number and called him half hoping he wouldnt answer so she could leave a message and not have to face him but he picked up hi hi chris emma he sounded surprised and why wouldnt he be hey are you okay her anxiety vanished and she was glad that shed called im okay i just wanted to say im so sorry about last night i got scared i freaked i know youll probably laugh in my face but i want to see you again id like to try again an unspoken desire she couldnt quite give voice to i wouldnt laugh i was just worried about you i thought maybe id done something wrong no no of course you didnt its justi guess since this was my first time out since i was sick my first time being with anyone since theni got scared like i said i dont know it seemed like you were really into it he chuckled nervously you were really hot i was into it she wasnt sure this was going to sound awkwardendearing or just awkward she tried to put that lust that power that shed felt last night into her voice like maybe she could touch him over the phone she held that image in her mind id like to see you again the meaning behind the words said i need you somehow he heard that she could tell by the catch in his breath an added huskiness in his voice okay why dont you come over ill be right there she shut the phone off not giving him a chance to change his mind not letting herself doubt emma could screw this up again there was a gnawing in her belly an anxious thought that kept saying this isnt right im using him and he doesnt deserve that she was starting to think of that voice as the old emma the emma who could walk in daylight and never would again the new emma the voice she had to listen to now felt like she was about to win a race she had the power here and she was buzzed on it almost drunk the new emma didnt miss alcohol because she didnt need it it felt good everything she moved toward felt so physically fundamentally good all she had to do was let go of doubt and revel in it that nearecstasy shone in her eyes when chris opened the door for a moment they only looked at each other he was tentativeexpecting her to flee again she caught his gaze and he saw nothing but her she could see him see through him everything about him he wanted herhad watched her for a long time dreaming of a moment like this not thinking it would happen not brave enough to make it happen assuming she wasnt the kind of girl who would let him in yet here she was she saw all of this play behind his eyes she touched his cheek and gave him a shy smile thanks for letting me come over gazing at him through lowered lids she pushed him over the edge he grabbed her hand and pulled her against him bringing her lips to his hungry and she was ready for him opening her mouth to him letting him devour her with kisses and sending his passion back to him he clutched at her wrinkling the back of her shirt as if he were trying to rip through it to get to her skin kneading moving his hand low to pin her against him these werent the tender careful assured movements he might have used if he were attempting to seduce herif hed had to persuade her if she had shown some hesitation these were the clumsy desperate gropings of a man who couldnt control himself she made him lose control if she could now pick up those reins that he had dropped she pulled back her head to look at him kissed him lightly then slowlystaying slow forcing him to match her pace she controlled his movements now she unbuttoned his shirt drawing out every motion brushing the bare skin underneath with fleeting touches lingering teasing heightening his need feeding his desire driving him mad he was melting in her arms she could feel his muscles tremble taking hold of his handsshe practically had to peel them off her backsideshe guided them to her breasts and pressed them there his eyes widened like hed just won a prize and she smiled letting her head fall back feeling the weight of her hair pull her back rolling her shoulders and putting her chest even more firmly into his grasp quickly he undid the buttons of her shirt tugged aside her bra and bent to kiss her tracing her right breast with his tongue taking her nipple between his teeth for all that had happened for all that shed become her nerves her senses still worked still shuddered at a lovers touch her hands clenched on his shoulders then tightened in his hair she gasped with pleasure she wanted this she wanted this badly she pulled him toward the bedroom didnt stop looking at him held his gaze would not let him break it her own veins were firecontrolled fire in a very strong furnace directed to some great purpose a driving machine she needed him the blood that flushed along his skin his very capillaries opened for her she did not have a heartbeat but something in her breast cried out in triumph he was hers to do with as she pleased she ran her tongue along her top row of teeth scraping it on needlesharp fangs he tugged at her shirt searching for more bare skin she shivered at his touch on the small of her back his hands were hot burning up and for all her desire her skin felt cold bloodless she would revel in his heat instead she pushed his shirt off his shoulders and let it drop to the floor then wrapped herself around him pulling as much of that skin and heat to her as she could youre so warm she murmured not meaning to speak at all but she was amazed at the heat of him she hadnt felt so much heat since beforebefore she became this thing he kept his mouth against her lips working around her neck pressing up to her ear tasting every inch her nerves flared at the touch and suddenly finally she understood it wasnt just the blood that drew her kind to living humans it was the heat the life itself they were bright sunlight to creatures who lived in darkness they held the energy that kept her kind alive and immortalfor there would always be people an endless supply of people to draw that energy from she was a parasite and the host would never die neither then would she with new reverence she eased him to the bed made him lay back and finished stripping him tugging down his jeans and boxers touching him at every opportunity fingertips around his hips along his thighs she paused to regard him stretched out on his back naked before her member erect whole body flush and almost trembling with need she had brought him to this moment with desire burning in his eyes he would do anything she asked now she found herself wanting to be kindto reward him for the role hed played in her education in bringing about the epiphany that so clarified her place in the world this exchange would be fair she would not simply take from him he would have pleasure as well she rubbed her hands down his chest down his belly he moaned shivered under her touch but did not interfere she traced every curve of his body down his ribs his hips stretched out on the bed beside him she took his penis in her hand again their mouths met his kissing was urgent fevered and she kept pace with him he was growing slick with sweat and smelled of musk she laughed the sound just bubbled out of her lips apart eyes gleaming she found joy in this she would live she would not open the curtains on the dawn she had power in this existence and she would learn to use it oh my god chris murmured he froze his eyes wide his blood suddenly cooled in only a second she felt the sweat on his body start to chill as fear struck him he wouldnt even notice it yet he was staring at her her open laughing mouth the pointed canine teeth shed been so careful to disguise until this moment when euphoria overcame her in a moment of panic like this it might all fall apart an impulse to run struck her but shed come too far she was too close to success if she fled now she might never regain the nerve to try again shh shh its all right she whispered stroking his hair nuzzling his cheek breathing comfort against him its fine itll be fine she brought all her nascent power to bear seduction persuasion the creatures allure the ability to fog his mind to erase all else from his thoughts but his desire for her to fill his sight only with her its all right chris ill take care of you ill take good care of you the fear in his eyes ebbed replaced by puzzlementsome part of his mind asking what was happening who was she what was she and why was she doing this to him she willed him to forget those questions all that mattered were her him their joint passion that would feed them both his desire and her life he was still hard against her hand and she used that gently carefully she urged him back to his heat brought him again to that point of need she stroked him first with fingertips then with her whole hand and his groan of pleasure gratified her when he tipped back his head his eyes rolling back a little she knew he had returned to her the next time she kissed him his whole body surged against her she twined her leg around his he moved against her insistent but she held him pinned him and closed her mouth over his neck there she kissed suckedfelt the hot river of his blood so close to his skin just under her tongue she almost lost control in her need to take that river into herself oh so carefully slowly to make sure she did this right and made no mistakes she bit let her needle teeth tear just a little of his skin the flow of blood hit her tongue with a shock and instantly translated to a delicious rush that shuddered through her body blood slipped down her throat like honey burning with richness clenching all her muscles groaning at the flood of it she drank her hand closed tight around his erection moved with him and his body responded his own wave of pleasure bringing him to climax a moment later she held him while he rocked against her and she drank a dozen swallows of his blood no more than that do not kill alettes first lesson but a dozen mouthfuls would barely weaken him he wouldnt even notice she licked the wound shed made to hasten its healing he might notice the marks and believe them to be insect bites he would never know shed been here his body radiated the heat of spent desire she lay close to him gathering as much of it as she could into herself she now felt hotvivid and alive she could feel his blood traveling through her keeping her alive stroking his hair admiring the lazy smile he wore she whispered to him you wont remember me you wont remember what happened tonight you had a nice dream thats all a vivid dream emma he murmured flexing toward her for more almost her resolve broke almost she saw that pulsing artery in his neck and went to drink again but she continued if you see me again you wont know me your life will go on as if you never knew me go to sleep youll sleep very well tonight she brushed his hair with her fingers and a moment later he was snoring gently she pulled a blanket over him kissed his forehead straightening her bra buttoning her blouse she left the room made sure all the lights were off locked the door on her way out she walked home it was the deepest stillest hour of night or early morning streetlights turned colors but no cars waited at intersections no voices drifted from bars and all the storefronts were dark a cold mist hung in the air ghostlike emma felt that she swam through it the stillest part of night and she had never felt more awake more alive every pore felt the touch of air around her warm blood flowed in her veins firing her heart she walked without fear along dark streets secure in the feeling that the world had paused to notice her passage through it she entered alettes town home through the kitchen door in back rather than through the front door because shed always come in through the back in her student days when she studied in alettes library and paid for school by being alettes parttime housekeeper that had all changed those daysnightswere finished but shed never stop using the back door emma alette called from the parlor selfconscious emma followed the voice and found alette in her favorite chair in the corner reading a book emma tried not to feel like a kid sneaking home after a night of mischief alette replaced a bookmark and set the book aside well her unnecessary coat wrapped around her hands folded before her emma stood before the mistress of the house almost she reverted to the teenagers response fine okay whatever monosyllables and a fast exit but she felt herself smile broadly happily it was good and the gentleman he wont remember me good alette said and smiled welcome to the family my dear she went back to the bar once more a week later sitting at the bar she traced condensation on the outside of a glass of gin and tonic on the rocks she hadnt sipped only tasted drawing a lone breath so she could take in the scent of it the door opened bringing with it a cold draft and a crowd of college students chris was among them laughing at someones joke blond hair tousled he walked right by her on his way to the pool tables flashed her a hurried smile when he caught her watching him didnt spare her another glance in the way of two strangers passing in a crowded bar smiling wryly to herself emma left her drink at the bar and went out to walk in the night moonlight becomes you linda winstead jones claire pressed her back to the wall and listened to the footsteps when she was certain her prey was moving away from her not toward her she leaned forward to peek around the corner and watch him walk down the dimly lit hallway watching her neighbor walk away was not exactly a chore not in those jeans too bad he was a vampire when he turned the corner and was out of sight she stepped into the hallway proper and silently followed in his footsteps it sounded crazy she knew that but there were too many coincidences to ignore he never went out in the daytime he was much too pale as if he had never seen the sun he always wore black even those jeans he seemed to favor were a faded shade of black she never saw him bring home groceries of any kind yes he was lean but the man had to eat something he was definitely mysterious and the one time hed caught her eye shed been sure he was hypnotizing her even though the glance had lasted only a few seconds or maybe one full second just last week shed found an inexplicable dusting of dirt in the hallway outside his door dirt this apartment building was surrounded by concrete and the amount of dirt shed seen was small but more than what wouldve been brought in on someones shoe maybe it was some of the dirt that lined his coffin orgrossthe remains of a dusted enemy vamp when shed gone back to check the dirt more closely to see if it looked like potting soil or bone dust it had been gone someone had disposed of the evidence one night not so long ago shed been awakened by an absolutely unearthly howl that had sent chills down her spine she wasnt sure if it had been a victims plea or a monsters cry of victory but the sound had been memorable and unnatural there was yet another telling clue that all was not as it should be marlie james from the second floor had a new cat the feline houdini was tough to contain and very often ended up wandering throughout the building fluffy wouldnt come to the third floor marlie had walked up once with the cat in her arms but before shed reached her destination fluffy had screeched and escaped her owners arms and run down the stairs animals knew animals sensed danger when humans did not and fluffy obviously sensed danger on the third floor claires apartment shared a common wall with the newest resident of the complex here on the third floor of this lessthanmagnificent but relatively trendy apartment building in downtown atlanta he played music often apparently he didnt care for popular tunes but was stuck in the forties claire recognized some of the songs he played as those her grandparents had favored obviously her neighbor had been turned into a vampire in the forties and he was still drawn to the music of the era in which hed been human what other explanation made sense claire didnt jump to conclusions without checking as many facts as possible shed done an extensive search on the internet and found almost nothing about her neighbor simon darrow that was his name had lived in four places in the past three years before that nothingthat she could find at least that in itself was odd the man hadnt popped out of thin air true she wasnt a detective and she didnt have access to every useful internet site but still she shouldve been able to find more it didnt help darrows case that hed moved into the building right before people from the neighborhood started to disappear charlie on the first floor who everyone knew hit his wife when he drank too much the oftenobscene panhandler whod been a regular on the southeast corner for as long as claire could remember that punk whod robbed old mrs bernard and gotten off with a slap on the wrist all of them gone in a mere six weeks just gone the people whod disappeared would not exactly be missed but she couldnt allow that to cloud her judgment add the insignificant detail that claire had been reading quite a few vampire novels lately and it all made perfect sense the common belief was that vampires didnt exist but claire knew to the pit of her soul that there was more to the world than most people realized granny eileen had spoken often of ghosts and werebeasts of vampires and curses there had been a time a span of several years in fact when claire had chosen not to believe the tales her grandmother had spun so effortlessly but in the past few years it seemed that her eyes and ears had been opened legends had to be based in fact and it wasnt her fault that most people had to deny that fact in order to survive from one day to the next her overactive imagination didnt hurt matters at all it was obvious that something was going on with her neighbor and like it or not vampire made sense the dirt the howl fluffy the missing peopleyes it made perfect sense no one would believe her if she didnt collect proof claire walked down the hallway on quick tiptoes hoping that when she glanced around the next corner shed catch a glimpse of her neighbor as he made his way to the stairwell the elevator was out of order once againno surprise thereand to reach the stairs she and everyone else on her end of the floor had to walk two and a half short hallways down the hallway right and then right again before reaching the stairs she wouldnt follow her subject outside she hadnt entirely lost her mind but she had decided to keep a detailed record of his comings and goings as best she could one never knew what small detail might be helpful when she reached the corner she flattened her back to the wall as she had before and she listened she heard nothing but then her neighbor did have an easy step even in those heavy black boots he usually wore another vampire trait she supposed the easy step not the boots maybe he was floating an inch or so above the floor since he didnt know anyone was watching she leaned slowly forward to take a glimpse down the hallway and found herself nose to chest with her vampire neighbor claire caught and held her breath as her heart threatened to break free of her chest there was no way she could outrun him whether he was a vampire or not that meant shed have to wing it first she had to regain the ability to breathe are you stalking me he asked a touch of humor in his deep voice iyouof course not claire managed a tight smile i lost an earring i thought maybe i dropped it earlier this evening on my way in after work too bad i was rather hoping i had a pretty stalker yes there was something unnaturally hypnotic about his eyes which were such a dark brown they were almost black she could feel herself being sucked in by those eyes that had to be a vampire trick he thought she was pretty the man who was taller up close than shed imagined he would be offered his hand simon darrow i live next door to you after a moment of paralyzing fear she put her hand in his and shook claire murphy i know his hand was oddly warm for someone who was possibly undead he released his grip and leaned casually against the wall so what does this earring look like what earring the one you lost he said that hint of good humor remaining in his hypnotic voice oh yes this was the perfect opportunity for her first real test since arriving at her suspicions about her neighbor shed been wearing a small gold cross all the time she slept in it showered in it wore it when she went to the gym on tuesdays and thursdays she grabbed the cross between her fingers and held it up so he could see it matches this a tiny little cross with a teeny diamond chip in the center simonquite an oldfashioned name ehdidnt touch the cross but he didnt recoil either she had to judge that test as inconclusive since she wasnt quite ready to leap forward and press the cross against his forehead to see if he began to smoke or howl in pain he turned away from her and searched the dingy carpeting his eyes scanning the faded fibers claire pretended to do the same though her eyes often flitted to her neighbor oh he really was studly more so up close than from a distance his dark hair was shaggy and a tad too long but was not completely neglected and he had a very finely sculpted masculine jawline the body as she had already noted was not bad at all she took it all in appreciatively and as surreptitiously as possible i dont mean to hold you up she said after watching him bend over to examine what turned out to be a piece of lint i imagine you have somewhere to be im not working tonight you work at night not much call for jazz musicians during the day the clubs closed until the weekend some sort of plumbing issue her head crept up slowly so she could once more check out his face which was much more interesting than the old carpet simon darrow wasnt prettyhis features were too masculine to be called prettybut his face was definitely fine youre a musician piano i have a small electric keyboard at my place but i practice while youre at work so i wont disturb you a considerate vampire im sure i wouldnt mind hearing you practice she said determined to be no less considerate as she took a couple of unnecessary steps and her eyes scanned the floor for a nonexistent earring this was an opportunity she could not let slip by so if youre not playing tonight where are you headed just out to grab a bite he answered interesting choice of words oh really i thought id check out that sandwich shop down the street they close at seven so youve already missed them and to be honest their food is better at lunch ill find someplace else then this was a golden opportunity that might never come again she had her neighbor right where she wanted him and he had no idea that she suspected his secret maybe you can she swallowed hard and gathered her courage have dinner with me i knew it he said in a lowered voice touched with gentle wit you are stalking me i am not she protested youre new to the building im simply adhering to the southern womens code section one paragraph three feed thy neighbor i could make spaghetti she said before he could argue again that she was stalking him and garlic bread he didnt sneer at the garlic bread any more than hed sneered at her cross hmm maybe she was wrong about him even though she was drawn to simon darrow in a way that had to be unnatural and there were a number of unanswered questions about him and his life and claire knew to the pit of her soul that there was more to the night than what made the newspapers and the evening news her neighbor might be exactly what he appeared to be a man with a mysterious past whod had the misfortune to move into the building just when people in the general area started disappearing and someone spilled dirt in the hallway i love spaghetti he said but im meeting some people later so i really should get going her heart sank a little okay maybe another time i dont want to be in violation of the southern womens code heaven forbid he smiled and it was very nice claire decided to take a chance one more time how about tomorrow night about seven normally on tuesdays she went to the gym after work but it would really be no chore to skip a workout wouldnt be the first time she held her breath and waited for another refusal another excuse sure simon glanced down at the carpet one last time im sorry to say i dont think were going to find your earring yeah claire sighed me neither claire didnt expect simon for about an hour her homemade spaghetti sauce was simmering and the garlic bread was ready to be popped into the oven the pasta would go on at the last minute after changing her clothes three times shed settled on an outfit that made her look at least three pounds lighter the slightly snug black shirt showed off her boobsthe advantage of carrying a few extra poundsand the kneelength skirt was flattering and comfortable it was pretty without being an obvious date outfit there were very cute opentoed shoes with high heels that made her legs look better than they really were waiting close by but shed save those for the last minute like the pasta giving in to her curiosity she opened the door to her apartment and slipped into the hallway tiptoeing on bare feet to simon darrows door to press her ear to the wood was he in there she knew he wasnt working and since she was feeding him in less than an hour he couldnt be out looking for supper unless he needed supper of a different sort if he was in there he was being very quiet why didnt she hear him practicing on his portable piano or showering or just moving about in his apartment she held her breath and closed her eyes listening for signs of life maybe he wasnt in at all oh if he stood her up she would never forgive him not that this was a date or anything like it i knew you were a stalker claires head popped up and she found her vampire neighbor standing in the hallway one hand behind his back that smug and yet undeniably appealing smile on his pale face why did he continue to hold his hand behind his back was he carrying a knife or maybe even a short sword not that vampires needed such weapons she had to think fast again i heard an odd noise she said i thought maybe youd fallen andandcouldnt get up his smile faded very quickly do you think someones in there the hidden left hand popped around as he reached into his pocket with the right instead of a knife or a sword he held a very pretty bouquet of mixed flowers these are for you he said absently all but thrusting them at her claire took the flowersnot that she had any choice considering the way they were shoved at her chestand carried them to her nose while simon opened the door to his apartment and stepped inside worried about a burglar he wouldnt find vampires were known to be very romantic at least in the books she read but she wouldve expected the flowers to be blood red or starkly exotic instead they were springy and bright and very much not reminiscent of the undead it had been a very long time since any manor whateverhad given her flowers what kind of sound was it simon called from inside his apartment flowers in hand claire stepped into his apartment through the door hed left wide open when mrs tillman from across the hall opened her door to peek outnosy old womanclaire closed the door to simons apartment she didnt miss the disapproving glare from her stodgy neighbor claires eyes scanned the main room which was laid out much like hers but was decorated very differently simon had a stateoftheart cd player but no television at least not in this room a couple of comfortable chairs but no sofa blinds instead of curtains framed antique album covers instead of family pictures or art the lines were stark and clean and he used little color in his decorating scheme there were no mirrors not that many men would hang mirrors anywhere but the bathroom there was no coffin in sight but of course hed keep that in the bedroom if he had one what kind of noise he asked again claire rose up on her bare toes and dropped down again it was just kind of a thud you know now that i think about it the sound probably came from upstairs or downstairs my mistake sorry simon glanced into the bedroom and the bathroom and then returned to her with a very skeptical expression on his face everything appears to be fine claire shrugged her shoulders and glanced back to the kitchen which like hers was open to the main room it was clean and uncluttered and probably for the most part unused you are so odd he said as he walked toward her im not odd she said defensively youre definitely odd he argued dont get me wrong i like odd girls ordinary girls are boring and predictable i have a feeling youre neither her life was both predictable and boring but she wasnt about to share that information with simon not now thanks for the flowers she said trying desperately to change the subject he took the bouquet from her hand and tossed it onto the closest chair the blooms looked so out of place there so wonderfully bright against the black leather no more games claire what do you really want from me she opened her mouth but did not get a chance to speak no more lies about lost earrings or noise from the apartment no more quotes from the southern womens code what do you really want she could defend herself and swear she had not lied but those eyes of histhey would see somehow he would know honestly please she licked her lips and listened to one thud of her heart before answering i dont know what i want simon moved in closer hovering in her personal space stealing her breath and making her heart pound even harder he leaned toward her his mouth heading directly for her throat something in her wanted to back away and clap her hand over her vulnerable artery but another part a deeper part wanted to lean into him to meet him halfway maybe she was hypnotized and didnt know it maybe she was moments away from calling her studly neighbor master and begging him to bite her deep down claire considered the possibility that simon wasnt a vampire at all shed allowed her imagination to run away from her thats all he was just a man like any other well not like any other but stillhe might be just a man she closed her eyes as he placed his mouth on her throat and kissed he didnt bite he kissed her reaction was immediate and intense it was no wonder she read and fantasized about vampires there was no place on her body as sensitive as her neck well one but other than thatwhen it came to erogenous body parts that were not located between her legs shed prefer a man at her neck over her breasts any day simon knew exactly how to kiss her neck one fine strong hand gripped the back of her head while he kissed her throat gently claire felt that kiss everywhere her knees went weak her insides tightened she grew wetjust like that why had she suspected him of being a vampire it was easy to rely on imagination when reality sucked well usually reality sucked but at this moment it did not not at all simon kissed her throat and her body responded with an unexpected fierceness her body was pressed against his and so she knew she wasnt the only one affected what do you want he whispered against her throat dont you have another question she asked breathlessly men could be so single minded why did he feel the need to talk at all no he said briskly claire could hardly speak at all when she answered i want more simon sighed finally an honest answer his hand slipped beneath her skirt she was shocked at first but thennot so much it was a natural if rather quick progression and she would not pretend to be demure or hesitant when she was neither simons hand large and warm caressed her inner thigh and then moved up with agonizing slowness the higher that slow hand moved the more intensely claire felt the caress she held her breath and waited for contact almost therealmostbingo simon touched her through silk panties and she shuddered all the while he kissed her neck if he was a vampire if he really did drink blood he could have every drop of hers as long as he didnt stop he didnt stop and claire felt herself spiraling out of control control did she have any had she ever her head tilted back and as simon took full advantage of the new position by kissing a portion of her throat he had missed his hand slipped into her panties to touch bare damp flesh he did not hesitate he did not falter it was as if he knew her body well as if he had touched her this way before and knew exactly where and how his hands were warm and large and foreignand yet somehow not so foreign claire wriggled a little her panties slipped and she spread her legs slightly simon took advantage of that new position just as he had when shed offered him a better shot at her throat his touch changed it shifted and then he slipped one finger inside her it had been a long time since any man had touched her and she came hard and fast convulsing gasping holding onto simon so she wouldnt fall to the floor the orgasm itself didnt take her by surprisegood heavens shed been rushing toward orgasm since hed placed his mouth on her throatbut the intensity did she came and she came and she grasped simon hard as the waves washed over her oh my she whispered when she was able simon held her up thank goodness but he took his hand away and he no longer gave his attentions to her throat after a moment he released her and backed away claire straightened her clothes and smoothed her hair she must look a mess and simonsimon looked as calm and collected as he had before hed touched her a quick glance down proved what the press of his body to hers had told her that he had not been unaffected well didnt this change everything shed started out determined to prove that he was a vampire and had ended up here shaking from an unexpected orgasm and shamelessly wondering when there would be more she tried to be logical for once if vampires had no heartbeat then there was no blood flow and without remarkable blood flow what she saw straining his jeans would be impossible ive always had a thing for odd girls simon collected her bouquet from the chair where hed deposited it so indifferently with greater care he handed the flowers to her once again she took them im really notwell maybe i am a little odd surely vampires didnt smile that way this look was definitely not evil then again maybe she was quick to judge simon not a vampire because hed just had his very talented hand in her panties claire twitched and then jumped my sauce you left it on the stove yes claire ran to the door when iwhen i heard that noise i had just put it on to simmer its probably fine simon followed her and while they were in the hallway mrs tillmans door opened a crack once again even though claire couldnt see the old woman she heard a decided scoff from behind that door talk about odd at the doorway to her apartment simon hesitated without thinking claire gave a wave of her free hand and said come on in so much for that test shed invited him in and that was one of the vampire rules that seemed to be unbreakable a vampire could not enter a home unless it was invited and shed invited simon into her apartment without so much as a second thought darn too late to do anything about it now simon studied her apartment as she had studied his as she rushed to the stove and turned down the heat then fetched a vase from beneath the sink and filled it with water as in his apartment there was a low open bar between the kitchen and the living area simon could sit on the couch and watch her and she could keep a close eye on him as well she had a small shaker of garlic salt close at hand just in case he tried to move too close too fast besides he wouldnt be so foolish as to eat his nextdoor neighbor everyone would be looking at him for the crime if that happened mrs tillman had seen them together no she was as safe as she could be given the circumstances if hed intended to do her harm hed had his chance she had to admit there was an inexplicable animal attraction about simon darrow that really got under her skin maybe it was because she hadnt had sex in such a long time maybe it was because she hadnt had really good sex for years she didnt count what had just happened as sex because well shed come alone that wasnt the same and of course the evening was young simon was extremely attractive pale skin aside at the moment he looked more beautiful than ever but of course her vision had been temporarily affected in truth he wasnt horribly pale just untanned it was clear he preferred the night to the daytime moonlight to sunshine maybe it was a musician thing not a vampire thing the same could be true of the black wardrobe and the odd hours he kept he turned his head to look at the stack of books on her end table bite me he read aloud as he perused the titles the return of dracula night of the undead the vampire stan that ones kinda funny she said wondering how he would react to the collection of vampire novels its a spoofy thing intriguing reading material he looked at her again and somehow those almostblack eyes darkened do you have an interest in vampires just as shed been ready to dismiss her suspicions and simply embrace the man he asked that question in a voice that was less than casual do you have an interest in vampires i suppose i do she confessed particularly vampire romance she shivered a little it was the neck thing she imagined her hand rose up and touched her neck there where simon had kissed her and brought her to the edge of paradise with his mouth alone simon sighed claire tried to ignore his reaction as she put on water to boil and preheated the oven for the garlic bread but in truth the fact that he asked the question made her wonderwhy did he care if she read about vampires or not obviously he did care he was actually annoyed by the books shed left sitting out and that put her right back where shed started still he hadnt bitten her when hed had the chance maybe sometimes vampires needed sex toolack of blood flow aside you know simon said after an uncomfortable bout of silence im really not very hungry i should go no claire left her notyetboiling water behind as simon stood unfolding his body with that unexpected grace that seemed only slightly unnatural there was a mirror in her bathroom another in the bedroom if she could just get him to stand in front of one of those mirrorsif she could just be sureyou need to eat something she said softly im not going to starve he responded what do you have at your place if you get hungry later she asked logically frozen dinners soup and crackers i make very good spaghetti i wish you would be honest with me he said a touch of anger coloring his voice there was a pleasant melodiousness to his voice she decided even when he was mad something strange is going on here there was never any earring in the hallway there was no noise from my apartment and ive never heard of any southern womens code i think yesterday you were following me and tonight you were snooping im not he moved in very close and placed one finger over her lips i talk you listen youre much more transparent than you intend to be claire couldnt move somehow he held her in place with that one finger on her mouth and with his eyes his magical mesmerizing unbelievably dark eyes her heart beat too hard he knew that shed discovered his secret and now he was going to kill her this time when he lowered his head he was going to bite down on her neck and feed and that would be the end of everything for her claire murphy was found dead in her apartment the body was discovered by a nosy neighbor mrs iris tillman who was bothered by the gross smell miss murphy has no family and she will not be missed by anyone oh and by the way it seems someone had taken all her blood but who cares maybe i am transparent she whispered angry at the knowledge that she could die here and now and no one would care you didnt seem to mind a few minutes ago no i didnt mind at all ive been dreaming about getting you in that particular position for weeks ive been dreaming about more claire to be honest ive been watching you since i moved in he said in a lowered voice theres no boyfriend and youre in bed every night very early and very alone if you work at night how do you shhh he ordered gently i know ive also known all along that if i touched you just right youd come apart and you did before tonight when was the last time you came claire murphy she swallowed hard before answering halfheartedly does it count if i was alone at the time no that most definitely doesnt count hey wait she said indignantly youve been stalking me just a little claire was frozen in place as simon lowered his head to her neck his lips pressed there at the place where neck became shoulder and a rush of sensation shot through her she shouldnt be so easy what had happened in his apartment aside her insides clenched and her knees went weak and all he had done was lay his mouth on her throat the kiss was gentle and yet it made her feel as if she were melting i know what you want claire murphy he whispered against her flesh and it isnt spaghetti or a fictional earring his hand slipped beneath her shirt and raked against her back until he found her bra clasp and very easily unhooked it i want the same thing you do i have since i first saw you in the hallway more than a month ago does that surprise you it surprises me i dont normally want things i shouldnt have i learned better long ago how long claire wanted to believe that what had driven her to suspect her neighbor of horrible crimes and unnatural abilities was nothing more complicated than her overactive imagination combined with the need to be touched and an undeniable attraction which was apparently reciprocated her reasons for suspecting simon of being an unnatural being were loneliness boredom and the craving for what he was offering her at this very moment as he removed her tangled blouse and bra and tossed them to the floor he lowered her to the sofa this time there would be more than a heated sexual moment that came and went too quickly this time they would be naked and he would be inside her andoh my his mouth was warm on her breasts and vampires were not warm they were dead and cold unless theyd just fed and hed picked up something besides flowers while he was out simon was not at all cold in fact his skin was hot and she was almost certain she could hear the beat of his heart against her belly where his chest rested as he sucked her nipple deep into his mouth she wanted him at her neck again but certainly didnt complain he would return there soon enough she imagined he didnt move back to her neck not right away instead he unfastened her skirt and began to shimmy it down not so fast she whispered not this time trust me this wont be fast she found comfort in those words comfort from this man she had suspected of being a vampire moments earlier what silly thoughts thoughts she easily dismissed as he kissed his way down her body which was naked but for the gold cross shed taken to wearing he didnt seem to mind that tiny piece of gold which was another point in his favor it was not the only point in his favor simon darrow had a fine sensuous mouth that was determined to explore every inch of her body where she was ticklish where she was sensitive where she had never been kissed before he tasted her he even lifted her leg and kissed her behind the knees introducing her to an unexpected burst of joy she felt that surge of joy everywhere and yes if hed touched her where she was wet for him she wouldve come she wouldve screamed again it occurred to her as simon trailed that lovely mouth very slowly up her inner thigh that he was still completely dressed that was so wrong take off your clothes she whispered her voice raspy and demanding he laughed lightly and his breath was warm against her skin not yet he spread her thighs and touched her intimately with his tongue he flicked his tongue he teased her with light strokes and flickers and then he moved in and rasped against her harder fiercer claire came so hard she screamed and her back arched up off the couch she grabbed simons head and pulled him closer and he did not fight her but pressed harder and deeper slipping his tongue inside her as she shook and he hadnt bitten her once you said it would not be fast she said breathlessly delirious and sad shaking and satisfied needy and happy its not over claire he promised as he crept up and over her body and finally once again placed his mouth at her throat and sucked against that sensitive skin women are wondrous creatures who can come again and again and again in a very short period of time ive heard thats true she said as she turned her head more to the side to allow him the greatest possible access he nipped at her skin but just a little naked entirely vulnerable and recently satisfied her mind began to work somewhat properly what if she only imagined that simon was warm and that his heart beat that could be part of the spell he had cast on her why else would she be so well easy not that she was complaining far from it in all the books she read vampires were sensuous creatures who wallowed in intense sexual encounters she certainly felt as if she were wallowing at the moment she no longer thought simon was a vampire not conclusively there was one other test she could try tonight just to be certain the sun had already set so she couldnt study what happened to him in the daylight but there was a mirror in her bedroom and if she could just see his reflection in it shed be satisfied claire took simons head in her hands and drew his wonderful mouth away from her neck you have to be at least six foot two and this sofa isnt more than five feet long i can manage i have a perfectly good bed beds are boring and ordinary everyone has sex in a bed his eyebrows lifted slightly what about the kitchen counter the balcony the elevator he grinned quite wickedly i know you prefer odd but i really am boring and ordinary she said as she reached down to fiddle with and then unfasten his belt buckle he strained the denim with his erection and she could not wait to have him in her hands to touch him to arouse him the way hed aroused her she gently forced him up and back and placed her mouth on his neck yes he was most definitely warm his heart pounded he shuddered and she was glad youre neither boring nor ordinary he said you just havent discovered that for yourself yet i see it even if you dont claire knew the truth about herself she was nothing if not pragmatic she was average looking and her hair was an ordinary dark blond that rarely did what she wanted it to do she was usually between ten and fifteen pounds overweight and there were a variety of clothes in three different sizes in her closet fat clothes ordinary clothes and a handful of very nice i have a dream clothes she was a failure where men were concerned more rightly they had always failed her which was why she now satisfied herself with reading on weekends instead of dating or painting her toenails or shaving her legs for some man who in the end but now was not the time for that old tirade a very handsome man who was hard for her had just promised her again and again and again and maybe another again shed lost count if she could just prove to herself decisively that he wasnt a vampire he might be the perfect man at least for a while no man was perfect forever but you want the bed anyway dont you simon whispered yes fine unsnapped and partially unzipped still more dressed than not simon left the couch he offered her his hand and she took it he pulled her up and headed for the bedroom it wasnt as if he had to search the apartment was laid out just like his own in a mirror image speaking of mirrors she led simon toward the bed and when they were in the center of the small room she stopped and turned to face the mirror above her dresser there he was gorgeous and blackclad and somehow animalistic he definitely had a wild magnetism she was so happy to see him there reflected in all his human glory that she smileduntil she realized that she was there too in all her fifteenpoundsoverweight glory yikes she turned away and headed very quickly for the bed and the safety of a coverlet where she could hide she jumped into the bed and pulled the lilac comforter across the plumpest parts of her exposed body simon followed her at a slower pace laughing not at her at least she didnt think so when he peeled back the comforter that shed grabbed to protect herself from his gaze his smile disappeared and his eyes narrowed dont hide youre gorgeous claire knew she was anything but but she didnt argue at this moment so turned on he was probably not seeing straight simon believed it to be true that was enough for her at this moment she didnt even care if he was a vampire or not hed brought her flowers and thought she was gorgeous and made her come so hard her head was still spinning nothing else mattered he quickly shed his clothes and she was not disappointed by the body he revealed lean and perfectly sculpted he had a runners body and an impressive erection she could not look away from if he was shy at all shed never seen any evidence of that shyness if he had a single second thought or an ounce of hesitation he hid it well even if it was their first time together there would be no awkwardness no uncomfortable moments where she wondered what was expected of her or they bumped foreheads no this was an extraordinary night and claire felt as if she were caught in a wonderful dream as simon joined her on the bed the sensation of his bare body against hers was breathtaking and when he kissed her on the mouth she held his head in her hands and gave that kiss all she had because she could give him no less instinctively she wrapped her legs around him pulling him close pulling him toward what she craved oh she twitched and pulled away slightly im such an idiot do you have protection a condom anything i cant have children and i carry no disease the words were pragmatic simply spoken why should i take your word on that she asked certain that many a woman had been fooled by similar promises i will never lie to you claire she shivered to the bone those were important words and he spoke them as if they were truth of course she wasnt sure any man was capable of never lying still the expression in his eyes was one of honesty as well as passion maybe she was a fool but she believed him yesterday shed been stalking him down the hallway convinced he was a vampire tonight he was in her bed and she didnt care what he was he understood that she liked his attentions at her neck and while he didnt neglect the rest of her body he spent many wonderful minutes there claire touched the hard curves and planes of his body and discovered he was particularly sensitive just below the belly button especially if she touched him there with the tip of her tongue as she had suspected there was no awkwardness no hesitation her curtains were open so moonlight lit simons face as he spread her thighs and guided himself into her making love with him was like dancing with a lifelong partner like waltzing without conscious thoughtand maybe an inch or two above the dance floor she didnt think at all with him inside her not about vampires not about being odd or boring not about mirrors or crosses or garlic there was just his body and hers and the way they came together it did cross her mind once briefly that the water on the stove was probably boiling by now but it was a thought that did not last long simon looked at her face he held her eyes with his as he rocked above and inside her pushing deeper and deeper with each thrust the way he looked at herhe saw her in a way no one else ever had he knew her he wanted her he held himself deep and for a half second it seemed that his dark eyes were touched with streaks of red flashes of fire lit the depths claire came again and with simon inside her it was more powerful than before more important her body convulsed around his and he came too they were so incredibly connected so very much together that she wondered why shed ever been satisfied with anything less and to top it all off like the cherry on top of a hot fudge sundae he drifted down and kissed her neck claires job was undeniably tedious and on wednesday her mind was elsewhere as she mindlessly entered data into her computer she yawned a time or two and fielded the questions from her coworkers who were sequestered in nearby cubicles do you feel ok are you coming down with something you look like you didnt get enough sleep last night what happened youre a little pale someone said she finally decided to tell them that a noisy neighbor had kept her up half the night that was close enough though in truth she was much noisier than simon maybe if shed felt closer to any one of them she mightve said more but while they were friendly coworkers they werent exactly friends most of her good friends were now married and had kids so she didnt see any of them on a regular basis not like in the old days oh they got together and had lunch now and then but the talk always turned to potty training and which kid had learned the alphabet at the earliest age and which schools in the area were the most acceptable there were occasional weekend barbecues or infrequent and horrific blind dates that made conversations about threeyearolds seem scintillating no her friends had changed and so had she claire didnt feel like she could call even them to share what had happened besides what had happened with simon last night had felt so very very personal more intimate than sex more important than the laughing and the touching and the orgasms this morning was still a blur simon had given her a fabulous kiss that had led to more and then hed gone homea conveniently short trip claire had been left with no time to get ready for work shed showered quickly and grabbed clothes from her closet the long blue skirt and blouse were comfortable if the blues didnt exactly match and shed forgotten to put in earrings well if anyone noticed the lack was excused since she hadnt gotten much sleep she never had gotten around to putting on those sexy shoes that made her legs look good maybe tonightif there was a tonight more than once during the day shed remembered that moment when it had seemed she saw fire in simons eyes she hadnt been herself at the time and there was a red neon light across the street maybe his head had been in just the right position at that moment to catch a glare that had to be it there were logical explanations for all the clues that had led her to believe he was a vampire the dirt mightve come from a potted plant even though he didnt have any living plantsor fake ones for that matterin his apartment the howl mightve been an overly excited fluffy orconsidering some of the sounds shed made last nighta very happy woman somewhere on the third floor the hypnotizing eyessimon just had great eyes and that was enough of an explanation to suit her so she didnt tell anyone that shed suspected her neighbor of being a vampire or that shed decided she was wrong and last night theyd eaten spaghetti in her kitchenboth of them starving from marvelously vigorous and unrestrained sexshe wearing nothing but her bathrobe he in nothing but those incredibly sexy black jeans she didnt tell them that for the first time in a very long time she was happy tired but happy happy as she was she tried not to get her hopes too high shed been burned before after all a man who wanted a woman in bed might say or do anything to get her there and thenthen there were phone calls that never came an old girlfriend who just happened to make an appearance or that horrible its not you its me for all she knew shed get home and find out that her neighbor had moved during the day just to get away from her or else he had a wife whod show up out of nowhere or elseworst of allhed ignore her and pretend that nothing had happened claire was thinking about simon so intently her fingers quit moving across the keyboard she simply stared at the screen imagining the worst the worst at this moment had nothing to do with vampires she jumped when the phone on her desk rang and answered it quickly with a toocurt claire murphy hello claire murphy she smiled no one else had a voice like that no one else could make her shudder simply by saying her name hi simon what are you doing working trying to anyway her heart lurched how did you get this number i asked the building manager where you worked and then i used all my detective skills to thumb through a phone book would he go to so much trouble just to inform her over the phone that it wasnt going to work that he was already tired of her that he was married what time do you get off work he asked and when he did the connection faltered a little apparently he was calling from his cell phone fourthirty thats too long ever leave work early sometimes leave now he said his voice low and commanding and sexy as hell right now claires heart fluttered i really shouldnt to hell with shouldnt i need you her mouth went dry while between her legs she was anything but i suppose i can take half a sick day do it with that he ended the call no see you later no bye now no i cant wait just a command and a click and a dial tone claire closed down her computer program and picked up her purse her hands were trembling and she couldnt wait to get home usually on pretty days she walked home but maybe today shed grab a taxi she informed her boss that she was going home and since shed been yawning and droopyeyed all day he didnt give her the third degree in fact he told her that she looked a little flushed and should stay home until she was sure she didnt have anything contagious claire agreed and headed for the elevator with a decidedly unsick spring in her step simon needed her all the way down she had one thought in her mind please dont let him be a vampire or a jerk let him be just a guy maybe even the guy less than a minute later she stepped off the elevator intent on grabbing a taxi and quickly making her way home but she hadnt taken two steps before a hand fell on her shoulder she almost screamed she was so startled but when she spun around she smiled widely and her hearther heart did something odd and unexpected i told you i couldnt wait simon said he took her hand and they headed for the front door i cant get you out of my head he mumbled and he didnt sound entirely happy about the fact i thought about you today a time or two claire said hefting her purse on her shoulder and picking up the pace simons steps were longer than hers i went to bed after you left for work and i woke up thinking about you he said only good thoughts i hope what do you think he looked at her and his step instantly altered for her he took shorter slower steps at that moment claire realized that her life had changed in a matter of hours she realized that she had found the perfect man she realized that if simon was a vampireshe didnt care not that she could tell him any of that not yet they exited through the front doors and into the afternoon sunlight simons eyes narrowed as the suns rays caught him full in the face but he didnt explode or catch on fire or recoil that was good he gripped her hand in his and it felt very right that was even better claire had fallen in love beforemany times if teenage crushes countedbut shed never fallen in so far so fast simon was a wonderful lover an incredible lover and when they werent in bed he introduced her to his musical passion jazz maybe she would never love the music the way he did but she did quickly find a few favorite tunes in his collection simon was passionate about his music almost as passionate as he was about her he made her laugh again and again they danced naked with her head resting on his chest she heard his heartbeat and it always made her smile how could she have ever suspected him of being a vampire mrs tillman kept close watch on their comings and goings as the days passed and her disapproval was obvious once they even heard the whispered words foolish girl drifting from the old ladys slightly opened door claire didnt have time to worry about one sour old woman not when her life was going so wonderfully well she felt incredibly silly when charlie from downstairs one of the three neighborhood lowlifes shed believed had disappeared thanks to a bloodsucking vampire showed up one evening in his usual classless manner screaming at his wife and making loud unintelligible excuses for his long absence if charlie wasnt a vampires victim odds were the other two were either in jail or had simply moved on to harass some other neighborhood simon had removed her collection of vampire books from the end table in the main room and stored them on the bookshelf with other novels she wasnt sure why they bothered him but they did again she didnt care lately she hadnt had any time for reading in any case why escape into fiction when reality was so wonderful he kissed her neck frequently but he didnt bite much on friday night the club where simon played reopened and he insisted on taking her with him he didnt have to insist very hard she was anxious to go shed heard him play on his portable piano and theyd listened to numerous recordings but she wanted to see him on stage with a band lost in the music she knew he loved and he did love it at the small but crowded nightclub claire sat at a small table near the raised stage she sipped wine and watched as simon and the other three musicians made beautiful fast and furious music they all loved what they did not just playing their instruments but creating this music simons face lit up when he performed claire had always known he had remarkable hands but to see them fly over the piano keys and make such music that was magic it was a different kind of magic than that which her grandmother had told her about but still it was magic until tonight she had only seen simon look this happy in bed and yes she was a little jealous but more than that she was happy for him everyone should have something or someone in their life that they loved so much when the evening was over at an hour much later than claire had ever been out even on a friday night they walked from the club heading toward the apartment it was a trip of just a few blocks which was one of the reasons simon had chosen her apartment building the evening was a bit cool but with simon beside her she didnt feel too chilly he was very warm very much alive and she smiled contentedly as she remembered that shed once believed he might be a vampire she was still convinced that such creatures were real she knew in her heart that there was more to the world than most people ever saw but simon simon was just a man the perfect man perhaps but stilla man he was warmblooded his heart beat well he didnt mind going out in the late afternoon sun and he ate her garlic bread they held hands very easily as they walked toward home claire couldnt remember when shed ever felt so close to a person when shed ever felt so much a part of someones life this relationship which had begun so very oddly was important and if she had her way it would only become more important in days and weeks and years to come only one small detail kept her from perfection theres something i should tell you she said as they reached the front entrance to the building she sensed there were possibilities with simon possibilities that went beyond sex and shared laughter such a connection couldnt be built on a lie no matter how small and this lie wasnt particularly small to be honest as they walked up the stairs she gathered the strength to begin do you remember when you accused me of stalking you she asked four days ago he responded lightly yes my memory works well enough to remember that well you werent entirely off the mark they continued to climb you wanted my body he teased no well yes i suppose i did but thats not why i was following you a small line appeared between his eyes a hint of a frown what then claire licked her lips as they entered the third floor hallway where a few days ago she had attempted to gather proof that simon was not what he appeared to be i thought you might be a vampire she expected an outburst of laughter and was prepared to order him to be quiet so he wouldnt wake the neighbors he continued to walk steadily and there was no laughter he didnt so much as smile why would you think such a thing it seemed like a long way to the section of the third floor where their apartments were located maybe this conversation would be best finished in her apartment or his since he wasnt taking the news as well as shed expected he would maybe it was too soon maybe she shouldve kept the truth to herself for a while longer it was a little too late for that particular revelation why he prompted claire ticked off her reasons i never saw you during the daytime for one thing and i never saw you bring in food and you listen to that old musicwhich i understand now really i do but i didnt before i knew youand i could swear that when you looked at me you were looking right through me looking into my soul in a way that was not at all human and ok i googled you and youve moved a lot in the past few years a man who doesnt want his immortality to be discovered might she hesitated after her breathless rush of words realizing how ridiculous it all sounded move frequently she finished in a lowered voice finally they reached her apartment and she grabbed her keys from her purse simon said nothing as she fumbled with unlocking the door and she was terrified that shed ruined the best relationship shed ever had simply by telling the truth what about now he asked as they stepped into her apartment do you still think im a vampire no she insisted here alone the door closed behind them she could take simons face in her hands to look him in the eye yes there was power in those eyes but it was perfectly ordinary power right maybe what she saw what touched her was a power only she could see because i didnt gag on garlic bread or explode in the sun because i love you she insisted once again simon went very quiet and claire cursed herself it was too soon for those words that sent some men running simon was a man just a man and he would run like hell from those words delivered too soon but it was too late to take them back and in truth she didnt want to take them back i love you she said again it happened too fast and it took me by surprise but thats the truth i dont want any kind of lie between us and thats why i wanted to tell you about my ridiculous notions he seemed to relax a little did you tell anyone about your theory no who would i tell my girlfriends would never believe me coworkers im pretty sure that would get me fired or sent to counseling at the very least theres really no one else to tell except granny eileen and shed been gone five years thats good more relaxed than he had been as theyd entered the apartment simon began to undress her as always he took his time caressing skin as it was revealed kissing her mouth and her throat raking his talented hands across her body he played her as well as he played his piano and they did make music simon removed his clothes with her help as they walked into the bedroom once there he did not rush to the bed as he sometimes did but held her so that she was facing the mirror while he stood behind her they were both naked both entirely bare but for the small gold cross that caught a glimmer of light from the other room simons hands covered her breasts his fingers rocked back and forth very gently and she found herself leaning into him reveling in the sensation of her skin against his there had been a time when claire had been embarrassed to look at herself this way but simon thought she was beautiful and hed said so so many times she was beginning to believe him he bent his head and kissed her shoulder do you really love me he whispered yes just for today because you like the way i make you feel or for forever think before you answer he added quickly forever is a very long time she did think but in truth shed known the answer before hed even finished asking the question forever she said for better or for worse she nodded and his hands slipped lower where he aroused her with a deliberate slowness while his eyes held hers in the mirror she saw a flash of fire there and this time she knew the fire was real not a reflection of neon i was bitten in he said claire gasped but did not move it was hard at first adapting to a new way of life i had no one to help me no one to teach me i was bitten and abandoned to find my own way in a new world claires heart pounded as simon spoke calmly and his hands caressed its the immortality thats hardest to take i must admit youd think it would be wonderful a gift instead of a curse but friends always grow old and die and its impossible to stay in any one place for very long before people start asking questions about why i dont grow older immortality is lonely very lonely are you saying im not a killer he interrupted at least not an indiscriminate one since ive killed three people two were trying to kill me the other was a mistake a mistake i did not know my own strength his hands continued to arouse her and his eyes held hers in the mirror the flame there had died but she did not fool herself into thinking it had never existed you have a choice to make if youd like i can pack my bags change my name once again and go somewhere so far away no one will ever find me say the word and im gone i dont want you to go she whispered horrified at the idea that he might disappear from her life whats the other choice simon lowered his head and nipped at her bare shoulder you know claire you know come with me if you dare its your choice i dont want you to go she said again she didnt want to go back to the life shed lived before simon had come into it thats not an answer he protested there must be another way but she knew there was not when i was bitten im not a killer come with me claire slowly tipped her head to one side that was her answer she would not lose simon not now not ever look he whispered his hands now rested against her bare stomach and as she watched they began to change long nails grew in the blink of an eye and hair sprang up on his arms his hands his face what had been lean pale muscle grew larger and was almost instantly covered with dark fur the shape of his face changed from the handsome face she had come to love to one that was caught between man and wolf the teeth that grew long and sharp were fierce but the eyes were simons she knew those eyes he raked his fingers his claws across her belly sharp talons did not break the skin but they did leave fine red marks in their wake she looked so pale so vulnerable with those powerful claws moving against her flesh and yet she was not afraid im no vampire simon said the voice his and yet not his it was throatier deeper colored with the force of an animal even though he touched her with the gentleness of the man she loved whiny bastards he added beneath his breath look at me without flinching without being filled with horror look at me and understand that if you choose me we will never have children we will never make a home that will last more than a few years for an eternity we will only have one another still love me claire still want to come with me because she knew those eyes so well she saw the pain there simon thought she would say no that she would be terrified by what he had becomewhat she would become if she joined him she should be terrified but she was not in fact she remained amazingly calm the face of her lover was no longer beautiful but it was still his face he was a werewolfa shapeshifter a jekyll and hydea monster to the minds of most just as a vampire was a monster but in spite of his current appearance simon was the best man she had ever known she loved him he was hers she reached up and touched his head surprised by the softness of the fur that met her hand she gently but surely drew him down until his mouth touched her neck that was all the answer she had to give it didnt hurt much when he bit her when his sharp teeth broke through the flesh at her neck a heartbeat later she felt the power of the animal that was inside him enter her blood rushing through her veins with a burning sensation that traveled quickly throughout her body changing her feeding her making her stronger simon held her with tenderness though his limbs looked as if they could not offer tenderness there was pain as the burning increased but claire welcomed the pain as she welcomed the rush of energy and strength a new element was added to her body and it shook her to the core she and simon were completely joined much as they had been during sex and she dismissed everything but the way it felt to be held in this way to be joined to be bitten the teeth were withdrawn from her neck and simon became a man once again quickly smoothly and completely again he met her eye in the mirror when she asked when will i change for a moment she felt a tickle of panic but the panic did not take root it did not last some changes will come to you immediately others will arrive with the rise of the next full moon hey wait a minute she blurted you changed and theres no full moon tonight i thought dont believe everything you read love simon said with that touch of humor she adored youll learn all you need to know in time ill teach you ill teach you everything he led her onto the balcony that overlooked downtown atlanta already claire felt stronger more alive in addition she felt something she had not expectedan increased pull to simon who was in a way she had never expected anyone to be hers forever hers he was in her blood now and she was in his i was so sure there was a vampire in the building she laughed lightly and easily there is simon said when you come into your full abilities youll sense when a vampire is near i knew it claire whispered is there like a club or something monthly meetings vamps and weres dont get along but we refrain from fighting openly so we wont bring undue attention to ourselves existing in a world that doesnt believe in us is tough keeping it that way is even tougher who is it she asked searching her mind for the most logical answer the young guy from the first floor charlie the handyman mrs tillman dont let the doddering old lady act fool you she can be a nasty bitch when she feels like it but shes old only because it suits her at this moment in time to be old claire pictured mrs tillmans sour but unthreatening face in her mind and imagined that mouth coming down on her neck she shuddered and simon wrapped his arms around her in response at least now i understand why you were so upset at my teeny obsession with vampires teeny he teased miniscule the moon was not full and still claire drank in its power the moon was a living thing that fed her that called to her like a drug she needed in order to survive in order to be strong the moons rays washed over her much as simons hands did and she knew she had made the right decision in offering him her neck no wonder he was so often out at night to be bathed in the moonlight was magical when did you know she began and then faltered when did you see that i that you were meant to be mine yes the words sounded so right so true to her heart meant to be mine the day i moved in i saw you come in from work and the day you moved in she interrupted why did you wait so long i knew if i was right and you were the one then you would come to me in time you did so in your own unique way you were drawn to me claire thats why you became obsessed from that first glance we were united with his fingertip he touched the gold cross she wore im just glad this isnt silver claire turned and leaned over the balcony railing face lifted to the moon a cool night breeze washed over her bare body and she opened her arms to drink it in even the brush of the wind on her skin felt finer sharper more beautiful simon kissed the wound on her neck a wound she knew would quickly disappear you are remarkably gorgeous tonight he whispered in her ear gorgeous and powerful and mine in a thousand ways his body was molded to hers and she felt as if she not only absorbed power from him but also gave back in some way she could not yet explain the night was at their feet waiting to be claimed and conquered her life had just begun again simon kissed her neck moonlight becomes you love he whispered against the sensitive skin moonlight becomes you dirty magic kim harrison mia walked down the damp raindeserted sidewalk her seventyfivedollar heels clicking faintly from fatigue on the wet cement she was tired but she could still maintain her elegant upright posture if she moved slowly her dresslength overcoat and matching umbrella of midnight blue kept her dry and it was rainy enough that she didnt need to wear her sunglasses to protect her pale nearly albino eyes with a small toss of her head she shifted her black hair cut short as she liked it traffic was light but she didnt want to risk being splashed so she shifted closer to the classy wellmaintained narrow buildings that lined the street the paper sack of groceries on her hip wasnt heavy but her daughters needs were telling it wasnt the usual fatigue brought on by an energetic newborn holly was the first banshee born in cincinnati in over forty years and if mia couldnt keep her in an emotionrich environment the child took what she needed from her mother it wasnt as if holly could draw upon her father for her emotional needs not now anyway frowning mia brushed her hair from her eyes and wondered if having a child at this particular time had been a good idea but when remuspsychopath murderer and gentle loverhad fallen into her lap by way of a bungled rape attempt the chance to use his anger and frustration to engender a child in her had been too great a smile curved mias delicate mouth up remus had quickly learned the difference between his unreasonable rage at the world and her true hunger becoming pliant and gentle respectful the perfect husband the model father and at the thought of holly happy inquisitive holly so pretty and soft looking like a younger mirror image of her mother babbling innocently as she sat on her mothers lap and basked in the love for her mia knew shed have it no other way she would do anything for her daughter as her mother had done for her the soft whoosh of a passing car brought mias head up and she blinked at the rain heavy on her eyelashes despite the umbrella it was cool and damp and she was weary seeing a rainabandoned table outside a cafe she slowed brushing once at the wroughtiron chair before sitting with her groceries on her lap and trusting her coat to keep her dry the awning helped shield the rain and she closed her umbrella she was just a casually sophisticated young woman waiting for a cab that would never come people passed and slowly her pulse eased and her fatigue lessoned as she soaked in the emotions of the pedestrians taking in flashes of feeling like water eddying around a rock in a streambed it was all the law would allow now this passive sipping of emotions if she fed well people noticed mia straightened when a couple arguing over whether they should have taken a cab walked by sensation rolling over her like a sunbeam almost she rose to fall into step behind them to linger and drink it in but she didnt and the warmth faded as the couple continued on one might think that a predator existing on emotions might have an easy life living in a city that measured its population in the hundreds of thousands but since humanity had learned banshees were not the stuff of story but living among them humans had armed themselves with knowledge and their numbers had dwindled the image of a mysterious weeping woman foretelling death had given way to the reality of a sophisticated predator a predator who could feed well upon office arguments started between coworkers with a careful word or two gorge upon the deathenergy a person released when dying but barely survive upon the ambient emotions around her that the law allowed as in most fairy tales there was a kernel of truth in the myth of a banshees tears created to serve as a conduit of emotions they let a banshee feed from a safe distance or simply store the emotion for later consumption for though banshees were predators thriving on death they were also fragile much like a rattlesnake they left their poison then sat back to feed in safety while others fought loved or killed each other psychic vampires was what the psychology texts called them a definition that mia could not find fault with her subconscious had brought her down this street for a reason and as she fingered the tarnished coin draped around her neck on a tattered purple ribbon her gaze traveled to the apartment building across from her rising up through the misty rain all the way to the topmost floor the light was on golden and hazy in the afternoons rain tom was in but tom was always in now he was too tired to go to work not like when she first met him nervous mia spun the wedding ring on her finger tom hadnt given it to her tom hadnt given mia her beautiful daughter either remus had there had been so much raw anger in him that she could have used it to create two children but remus could no longer give holly the emotion she needed glancing at the window hazy with rain mia hesitated she had to be so careful never to permanently harm anyone there were old ways to track her down and new excruciating techniques to punish a species that lived on the emotions of another mia was a good girl and now she had a daughter to think of i shouldnt be doing this mia thought in worry its too soon someone might see her someone might remember shed been here but she was tired and the thought of tom holding her filling her with the strength of his love was too strong a pull he loved her he loved her even knowing that she was why he was ill he loved her knowing she was a banshee and unable to keep from stripping his emotions and strength from him she needed to feel his arms around her for just a moment with a soft quiver of anticipation to set her skin tingling mia stood gathered her grocery bag onto her hip and pushed herself into motion not bothering with the umbrella she crossed the street with a false confidence pacing to the unattended common door with a singleminded intensity looking neither left nor right praying no one would notice her fear a dim substitute for strength she pulled the glass door open and slipped inside in the small space where the mailboxes were she lifted her chin and ran a hand over her wet hair feeling more sure now that she was off the street and out from so many potential eyes the shiny front of the mailboxes threw back a blurry imagecolor mostly dark hair pale skin and an almostblack coat leaving the umbrella in a corner she ascended the stairs so as to keep the cameras in the elevator from getting a good look at her the open stairway taking up the middle of the building wasnt monitored and anyone looking out here would only notice an usually petite woman with a bag of groceries cold from the rain worry someone might actually see her trickled back and her pace quickened gaining strength as she rose instead of fatigue around her was the flow of life slipping under the doors and into the hallway like the scent of baking bread or someones toostrong cologne it eddied about her feet and puddled on the stairs and she waded through it like surf able to see the energy the people living behind the doors sloughed off kicking up anger here and frustration there her pace slowing to take in the softer hardertofind emotions of love a mere whisper lingering outside a door like perfume she paused pretending to be tired outside a door where the soft sounds of music and laughter were a muted hush love and desire carried the headiest amount of energy but they were hard to find not because they were scarce but because people directed the emotions to a specific person holding the feeling close to themselves as if knowing how powerful they were love seldom ventured past a persons aura unless it flowed into another not like the wild bitterness of anger which people threw away from them like the refuse it was mia closed her eyes swallowing up the ambient love the couple had left in the hall as they had fumbled for their keys it had only been a few hours ago and though it bolstered her it caused her pain it had been too long since she had felt the full unshielded warmth of anothers aura she was tired of filling herself on garbage and stolen wisps of love with a sudden resolve she took off her ring slipping it into a pocket she guiltily patted it to see if it made a telltale shape against her coat head high she continued up until she reached the top floor toms door was unadorned and with her pulse fast in tension she tapped softly hoping he heard she didnt want a neighbor remembering a knock in the hall tom had promised her he wouldnt tell anyone he knew a banshee afraid they would see him failing and convince him to never see her again she shouldnt be here this soon but the memory of his love was like the scent of flowers begging to be inhaled and irresistible the door opened with a quickness that sent her back a step and she stared at tom her eyes wide and her breath held he looked good better than the last time shed seen him the lines of fatigue only lightly etching his midthirties face standing tall he had once had a beautifully vigorous if slight body but since meeting her in the grocery store a year ago nearly all the substance had been stripped away to leave him looking as if he was recovering from a long illness his short brown hair was clean but untidy from his shower and he wore jeans and a comfortable flannel top against the damp chill seeing her he smiled pleasure coming over his long somewhat sallow face his skin was pale from a lack of sun and his muscles had lost their tone months ago his fingers long enough to facilitate a high amount of proficiency with his instrument looked thin as he reached to pull her into a hug mia felt his arms go around her and almost walked away breathing in his initial delight she realized it was too soon she should not be here even if she was pining for him someone might have seen her and he hadnt recovered fully from her last visit but she was so tired and even a wisp of his love would renew her i saw you on the sidewalk tom said as he felt her shoulders tense and his hands dropped from her im glad you came up its been lonely here by myself come on in just for a moment her pulse raced and she stepped into his apartment with a guilty quickness i cant stay she said her voice high tom i promised id only stop by to say hi and then i have to go she sounded frantic even to herself and she bit her lower lip wishing things were otherwise the click of the door closing mixed with the soft sound of talk radio the warmth of his apartment soaked into her and she felt herself relax at the emotionrich air his apartment had hed been practicing his music and that always filled his rooms with life it was what had attracted her to him in the first place as he had strolled past the grapes trailing joy like the wisps of the symphony hed been humming slowly her jaw unclenched and the worry and guilt slid into nothing she couldnt help herself this was what she was let me take those he said reaching for her groceries and she let him following him soundlessly down the short hall to the kitchen as she untied her coat the kitchen opened to the living room where tom usually practiced his music now that he was too tired to make the trip to the universitys hall down the corridor at the back was the single bedroom and bath everything was tidy and clean done in soothing tones of brown and taupe the furnishings were simple and clearly masculine and mia loved the contrast from her own home filled with the primarycolored clutter and untidy life of a new baby i wont stay long she said noting his thin trembling hands i was passing by andi missed you oh mia he said his deep voice swirling over her like his aura was as he took her in his arms i know how the rain depresses you depresses her wasnt exactly it it depressed everyone else and in turn lowered the amount of ambient emotion they gave off she was hungry and she lowered her gaze before he saw the rising need in their pale blue depths i missed you too she whispered eyes closing in bliss as his love soaked into her his arms gentling her to him forgiving her for what she did to him knowing she had no choice the scent of his soap was sharp and she drew away when she heard his pulse quicken she was pulling his strength from him as she soaked in his aura rich with emotion that was why he was weak a person could replace a surprising amount of their aura but take too much too fast and the person died when their soul was left bare to the world and unprotected im sorry she said blinking to keep her emotions in check i shouldnt have come im fine he said smiling wearily down at her fine she said bitterly as she pulled away look at you look what i did to you i hardly walked in the door and youre shaking already mia no she exclaimed pushing him away when he tried to hold her i hate who i am i cant love anyone damn it tom this isnt fair shhhh he soothed and this time mia let him take her in his embrace laying her head against his chest as he swayed her gently as if she was a child mia i dont mind giving my strength to you it comes back mia couldnt breathe from the wave of pure love rolling off of him carrying the delicate beauty of wind chimes tinkling forgotten in the sun his love was so heady so sweet but she shouldnt take it she had to resist if she could keep from drinking it in it would eventually flow back into him keeping him strong and untouched but not fast enough she mumbled into his flannel shirt hardening herself to his emotion if not his words i came back too soon youre not well i should go but his arms didnt release her please stay he whispered just a little while i want to see you smile she pulled back gazing into his earnest eyes it was too soon but she would make it be okay she could do this ill make you coffee she said as if in concession and he let her go id like that thank you motions unsure mia took off her overcoat and slipped off her shoes barefoot and in a soft dress of pale blue and gray she busied herself in the kitchen taking a moment to arrange her hair in the reflection in the microwave guilt stared back at her with a rising black of hunger in her pale eyes the pierced coin on the purple ribbon about her neck dangled like a guilty accusation and her pale fingers held it for a moment as she thought she would not take anything more from this man she could do this she had wanted to find love and she had it was worth the risk toms sigh as he sat at the table between the kitchen and the living room was weary but happy past the tasteful furniture and his scattered music was a large plateglass window overlooking the street the drapes were open but the rain was like a sheet gray and soothing to create a soft hidden world her silk dress was a gentle hush as mia sat two empty cups on the table she watched toms long fingers curve about his though the cup was dry and cold concerned she sat beside him and took his hand in her own drawing his attention to her behind them the coffeemaker warmed how are you doing he smiled at the worry in her voice better now that youre here mia smiled back unable to keep from soaking in his love like a sponge overcome by the purity of it she dropped her gaze only to have them fall upon the coin her mood tarnished work going okay she asked hoping he would practice but tom gave her hand an apologetic squeeze in a gentle refusal when he played he expended a huge amount of emotion when he became lost in his music as if tapping into the universe still ringing from its creation if she were here to soak it up it would leave him weak for days if she wasnt the expended emotion would linger in his rooms bathing his soul in what was akin to an extended aura not exactly feng shui but more of a lingering footprint of emotion that could alter moods even days later it was what had attracted her to him from the first works going great he said leaning back and away to look at the coffeepot theres a concert next month and it looks like ill be ready as long as you dont take my strength mia could almost hear him finish in his mind im sorry she breathed starting to lose her upright posture and her eyes beginning to swim as they looked at his instrument propped lovingly in a corner she could feel a puddle of intensity on the couch from earlier this morning and she hardened herself to ignore it if she went to sit in it it would warm her like a sunbeam i dont mean to take so much from you she said a single tear slipped down and tom moved his chair to hers his long arms enfolded her and her pulse raced from the love swirling through her aura seeping into her despite her trying to stop it mia he crooned and she held her breath stiff and resolved to not take it but it was hard so hard dont cry he soothed i know you cant help it it must be hell to be a banshee everyone i love dies she said bitterly into the soft depth of his shirt as the guilt of three hundred years of existence rose anew i cant come back here im making you ill i have to leave and never come back with an abrupt motion she broke from him she stood panic an unusual showing on her usually collected proud face what if he told her to leave tom stood with her and as she reached for her coat he pulled her back mia he said giving her a little shake mia wait head lowered she stopped allowing his fear to coat her in a soothing sheen like fragrant lemon oil and she felt her hunger jealously claim it it was bitter after the exquisite airy lightness of love but she took it stronger in body and resolve she pulled her head up to see him through a haze of unshed tears you are so beautiful he said wiping a tear away with a thumb we will find a way to make this work i recover faster every time he didnt and mia dropped her gaze at the wishful lie there has to be a way he said holding her close head tucked under his chin mia felt a quiver start in the deepest part of her soul again it was going to happen again she had to be strong need would not rule her there is she said her hand creeping up between them to hold the coin about her neck tom pushed her back his long face showing his shock theres a way why didnt you tell me before becausebecause it wont work she said not wanting to deal with a false hope its too cruel its a lie if it doesnt work you might die mia his grip on her upper arms pinched tell me in a quandary she refused to look at him from the living room the talk radio turned to a classical guitar the intensity rising with her tension i have a wish she breathed hand clenched about the pierced coin on its purple ribbon it was how wishes were stored and she had had it for years braver now for having admitted it she looked up feeling his excitement roll off of him in a wave it washed into her and she forced herself to keep from taking it the room grew richer with subtle shades of want and desire purple and green shifting about her feet like silk wherewhere did you get it are you sure its real mia nodded miserably opening her hand and showing him i got it from a vampire i dont know why she gave it to me except perhaps that i shamed her into trying to become who she wanted to be but that was years ago i was so bad that day making her angry so that i could drink in her guilt i shamed her but i shamed myself more for telling her i couldnt love anyone without killing them giving her my pain in return for her strength perhaps she wanted to thank me or perhaps she pitied me and wanted to give me the chanceto find love myself steadying herself mia took a breath refusing to let his hope warm her like the sun she wouldnt take any more she had to be strong ive had it all this time she finished faintly together they looked at it small and innocuous in her palm you waited he said in wonder taking it up and running his fingertips over the detailed relief engraved on it why mia blinked to keep from crying as she gazed up at him i wanted to fall in love first she said almost bewildered he didnt understand toms expression turned to one of pure honest love and mia choked muscles trembling from the effort to keep from taking it in he gathered her to him and she shook in the effort thinking it was tears tom shushed her making things worse it was almost too much and mia forced herself to stay feeling the emotions in the room build and grow like a sheltering fog it was like spreading a feast before a starving man and she held back by her will alone she would take no more from tom use your wish he said and hope leapt in her use it so we can be together im afraid she said trembling wishes dont always come true some things you simply cant have if it doesnt work then i not only lose you but i lose my hope to ever have anyone vision swimming she gazed at him i cant live without hope its all i have when im alone but tom was shaking his head as if she was a child this is love mia he said both their hands holding the coin between them all things are possible its a wish it has to work you have to have faith a single tear slipped from mia to make a cold trail down to her chin make the wish he said drying her cheek wish that i can love you what if it doesnt work she whispered feeling the weight of the emotions in the room pressing on her skin in a deepening tingle his eyes full of his love for her he timorously smiled with a raw hope what if it does tom she protested and he leaned over the space between them and covered her mouth with his fear flashed through her and she tried to pull back it was too much she wouldnt be able to stop herself if he gave so freely she had no way to stop it and he would die but his lips were so soft on hers and her breath caught at the depth of his feeling his love all for her as encompassing and dark as a moonless night i was right she thought as she curved her arms around his neck and stretched to reach him she couldnt stop herself not when he was trying to give his love to her and she soaked in the strength he had put in his kiss almost crying at the sensation filling her it was going to happen again there was nothing that could stop it tom broke their kiss and she stumbled back afraid please he said shaking from the energy he had given to her for us i want to love you he pleaded all of you in every way mia leaned against the cheerful yellow wall of the kitchen her pulse fast and her chin high this was the best she had felt in weeks she could take on the world do anything to have this every day would be the fulfillment of her deepest wish humans were so ignorant taking for granted what they received from each other never knowing the energy they passed between themselves but the only reason she could see it was because it was what she needed to survive she could drain the love from tom like scooping water from a well but it would kill him im afraid she whispered though she stood powerful and strong trembling he stepped forward and took her hands me too i want you to be happy make the wish mias eyes filled but they didnt spill over i wish she said her voice shaking that this man be protected from the pull of a banshee that love will protect him and keep him safe that no harm should come to him through my love for him she held her breath forcing herself to keep from taking even a wisp of emotion as a single tear fell to splash on their fingers joined about the wish for a moment they did nothing waiting the guitar on the radio changed to a full orchestra and tom looked at her wideeyed with his hope radiating to fill the room mia almost swooned at the effort to leave it untouched to keep him strong did it work he asked a lump in her throat mia steadied herself kiss me she tilted her head up as tom leaned in his long hands holding her shoulders dropping the coin to fall between them she tentatively put her hands about his waist unsure at how they felt there she had never kissed him back with a gentle sigh tom met her lips and mia went dizzy from the will needed to keep from soaking him in a wall she thought strengthening her own aura to keep them separate gradually making it opaque and then solid she thickened her aura so that nothing could penetrate nothing would come to her he would fill the room with his love and if she left it there he would remain strong his emotion would wash against her like water on a beach and like a wave it would ebb back to the ocean undiminished and though it left her shaking in hunger it worked hope replaced her aching need in a rush and somehow tom felt it perhaps having been pulled upon so often by a banshee he had become sensitive to the emotions in a room perhaps because of his love for music he could read them easier whatever the reason he knew she was taking nothing from him even as they shared their first passionate kiss breaking from her he stammered breathlessly mia i think it worked she smiled at him a real one and tamped down her excitement lest it break her control do you in answer he pulled her to him and with a tenderness born in the fragile beginnings of love he cupped her face and kissed her again mia felt his lips on hers but walled herself off not allowing any of his emotion to stir her even as his hands left her face and began to search his beautiful long fingers tentatively seeking her skin beneath the shoulder of her dress it had been in his eyes a long time and mia welcomed it even as she struggled to stay passive to withhold her instincts to drive him into a deeper state of vulnerability she wanted this she wanted this so badly be careful she whispered her heart pounding as his one hand found the buttons of the back of her dress and she gasped at the wave of heat that his fingers slipping the buttons free with a soft pop made along her spine i love you he said his voice husky and standing too close to see his face you cant hurt me it worked mia i can feel it it worked he gently slid her dress from her shoulders and the patterned silk fell softly to her waist to leave her shivering in the chill of the kitchen she looked deeply at him seeing her hope reflected in his eyes feeling it pool about them like a heady wine a tremble took her but if it was from the new coolness on her skin or the effort she was exerting to let his love continue to build in the room she didnt know maybe she didnt care he believed and that was enough to soothe her fear she closed her eyes and with that as an invitation tom pulled her to the living room he sat on the edge of the couch amid the pooled emotion of his music bringing her bare middle to his face as she stood before him breathing her scent his hands at her back her hands were among his hair holding him there so he knew his touch was welcome mia he whispered and at the sensation of his words on her skin she threw her head back to the ceiling desire cascaded from him and she caught her breath wiretight as she refused to taste its strength made doubly hard as it was directed to her her hands clenched once and mistaking it for desire he brought her to sit atop one knee he nestled his head between her small breasts holding her to him with one arm as he nuzzled her promising more a wave of sexual heat hit mia and dizzy with her conflicting emotions a slip of his need cracked the barrier she had made of her aura groaning she went limp basking in the depth of it he responded by taking her in his mouth pulling tugging not aware that she was growing tense with a hunger older than his religion tom stop she breathed but he didnt it was too late he was filling the room with his desire it would be up to her to keep from killing him outright to take everything he was giving her she could do this it would end well his breath grew heavy falling into a deliberate pace mouth never leaving her he fumbled with the rest of her dress it slipped to the floor at her feet when she leaned into him pushing him back into the couch shifting his weight he moved her settling her light weight into the cushions and holding himself above her he pulled back strong and dangerous with the heat of his emotions falling from his hands to warm her she gazed at him in a bewildered haze struggling to keep even the smallest bit from getting through to her again she loved seeing him like this strong and alive and she reached up to undo the buttons of his shirt it was a bold move for her for despite her confidence she had little experience with men usually they were dead by this point toms smile grew gentle as he saw her fingers tremble and as she got the last of the buttons free he worked his pants from himself easing down beside her the rain was a hush against the glass insulating them from the world softer more gently now as if knowing how rare this was tom caressed her middle with all the skill of a musician pulling a gentle note into life she sighed feeling his touch crack her aura everywhere his fingers alighted every stroke he made melted through the barrier she had made to give her jolts of his passion and desire filing her with an almost nevertasted depth of feeling she moaned and he lowered his head to take her breast again a flash of need struck through her and blood pounding her hands darted into his hair pressing him into her spurred on he became aggressive the pinch of teeth was like knives in her slicing through her defenses to lay her bare to his lust there was no love anymore this was raw animal hunger and she relished it even as she strove to mend the tears in her aura he was making she had to keep from taking it all she shouldnt take anything even this little bit would show but his weight atop her was delicious and the heat from his body drove everything else out mia shifted under him tracing her hands down his back feeling the muscle and bone running lower as his mouth broke from her to rise and find her lips her need quickened and panting from effort she met his eyes once reading her desperation in her reflection in her gaze and then he kissed her once more he broke through her aura and she moaned clutching him and arching her back as he drove his tongue into her with an animalistic fervor wave after wave of strength flooded her she simply couldnt shield herself from this intimate contact that reached far past her aura and into her soul she was alive alive and scintillating but she was taking too much and she felt it in his faltering heartbeat no she whispered groaning in despair tom stop he wouldnt sending a pulse of heat through her when his hands grew stronger on her demanding fear that she couldnt do this fear she couldnt wall herself from him and it would all be for naught was a sharp goad and with a sudden realization she knew what she had to do desperate to regain control and keep from draining him of his life force she took his face in her hands and turned his mouth to hers panting from a desperate need she held him to her and forced a kiss again his desire broke through her aura flooding her with an almost unbearable emotion but this time she pushed her own desire into himredoubled he gasped his entire body shaking as it rested atop her mia felt the heat of tears under her closed lids it was hard so hard to push what he had given her back into him it went against every instinct she had but clearly he felt it and his kiss and his hands upon her grew rough savage he hadnt several centuries to learn how to control such an influx of power and strength as she had his grip upon her waist hurt and she did nothing as he forced her legs apart she wanted this exalting in the savage response she could invoke she gave him more feeling it leave her in a scintillating sensation of sparkles a guttural sound came from him and mia gasped in an exquisite pain as he entered her pushing to fill all of her in one move she groaned arching into him wanting this wanting it so badly that she gave him even more of herself wave after wave of emotion drenched her running off her to pool in the room as if to drown her in lust he moved against her dominating and aggressive every motion was like knives in her aura breaking it destroying what she had built to protect him but she gave back more than she took and he grew wilder more demanding he forgot all as he sweated above her and she moaned with every breath feeling an end coming the wait an exquisite pain and in a sudden pulse it broke upon them a twisted groan eased from him and he clenched her to him as wave after wave of ecstasy fell on them mias barrier shattered gasping she clutched at him feeling his entire soul empty into her as she reached fulfillment her body wracked with tremors as they hung unmoving in a haze of bliss emotion shook the room in silent thunder only she could feel and she almost passed out taking breath after heaving breath until the sensation gave a final pulse and vanished tom she panted feeling his breath in her hair as he lay atop her too spent to move tom are you okay he didnt answer and she pushed on his shoulder tom i love you mia he whispered and he sighed his full weight coming to rest against her tom she exclaimed shoving him to the back of the couch and wiggling out from under him the air felt thick like sunshine pooled at the bottom of a valley eddying about her feet with the heaviness of honey she hadnt kept any of the emotion from the room it was all here cloying and thick making her dizzy with a repressed need but tom clutching her discarded dress she stared as his aura went wispy and thin an unbearable brightness began to emanate from him and seeing it a single tear trickled from her her hand trembling she reached to touch him shaking at the taste of his aura it was fading spreading out becoming silver and thin to fill the room with unseen sparkles any other banshee would take it gorge on the last life energy and dance in exaltationbut she didnt mia walled herself off and a tear slipped down as she watched his life fill the room in a bright ever so bright light tom she whispered weary even as her body still sang with the ecstasy he had filled her with she had seen this before he was dead he was dead and there was nothing that would bring him back in that single moment of fulfillment his emotionrich aura had washed over her laying his soul bare she hadnt taken it and it lay pooled about her feet to rise like a slow fog shifting from gold to purple but she hadnt given him anything back either not like a human would have protecting his soul until he gathered it back unto himself again mia fell to her knees before him still touching his shoulder warm with the last of his life misery twisted her delicate features and then a sob broke free harsh and painfilled it was followed by another and she knelt beside him her hand trembling as she gripped the wish that had caused his death the tears falling into her lap turned from salt water to black crystal the mark of a banshees pain and they fell soundlessly as she wept the glow from toms soul filled the room and she closed her eyes the light too painful for her pale eyes the doors were shut the windows locked and though his soul was gone the energy of his death lingered and mia cried she had killed him sure as if she had driven a knife into his lungs sob after sob filled the apartment her crystalline tears soaking up the energy of the room until the brightness dimmed to a memory and then even that vanished and the air was pure the love was gone the fear the comfort everything was gone as if no one had loved lived and died sheltered by these walls she kept none of his energy for herself it had been hard but to take it into herself had never been her intention slowly mias tears abated until her breathing steadied and her breath no longer came in racking gasps the tears falling from her had eased from black to gray and were now perfectly clear reflecting the dim sun from the ended rain the emotions of the room were condensed and pooled in them there would be nothing to link her to the death of this man nothing to indicate that he had died in anything other than peaceful sleep toms body lay facedown on the couch an arm trailing to brush the floor not looking at him mia slowly got dressed drained and tired she looked once at the wish about her neck then left it to hang the tears she gathered like photos of lost children love and pain mixed in equal parts if she didnt someone would find them recognize them and she would be pulled in for questioning the law knew what a banshee was capable of and she would not allow herself to be jailed for this fingers slow and clumsy mia felt the back of her dress to be sure the buttons were done up properly the coffeepot was steaming and she carefully put her empty cup away in the cupboard before unplugging the pot and setting his filled cup on the coffee table beside him she turned the music down and guilt prompted her to drape an afghan over him as if he was sleeping his clothes went into the hamper silent she stood above him in her coat goodbye tom she whispered before gathering her groceries and quietly leaving fatigue hit her anew when she found the sidewalk the rain had stopped and the sun was peeking past the heavy clouds fumbling mia put her sunglasses on traffic hissed wetly and she breathed deep when a couple passed her hotly discussing the amount of the tip one of them had left it was a sour taste after toms love and she let it eddy behind her unsipped she glanced at her watch and picked up the pace digging in a pocket she found her wedding ring and put it back on with a shamed slowness her fingers slipped back into the pocket running through toms life force pooled and condensed delicate features pulling into a grimace mia took out a handful of tears slipping the lightest one between her lips and sucking guiltily on it his strength poured into her and her pace quickened heels clicking smartly against the concrete shining with the new sun stupid man she thought as she waved and jogged to catch the bus the wish did work well perhaps it would be more fair to say it had worked it had worked very well when she met remussavage angry remus whose psychotic rage had been strong enough to bring holly into existence the love had come later until now she holly and remus were a real family like any family on the street and mia was proud of it holly was the first banshee child to know her father plying him with innocent love and devotion it had been watching father and daughter that mia learned it was possible to force emotion back into a person lulling them into thinking they were safe while making themselves more vulnerable the child had in her innocence returned to her species all the cunning and power human laws had taken from them and for that alone holly was going to be revered among her own once she learned how to walk and talk that is breathless mia smiled at the bus driver as she just made it to the door fumbling for her bus pass tom dead in his apartment was hardly a glimmer of memory as she settled beside a young man smelling of cologne and shedding lust mia knew to be from a new girlfriend easing back she soaked it in sated her lids fluttered as they rumbled over the railroad tracks and she looked at her watch mildly concerned remus would likely throw a bloodyhell tantrum that she was running late being unable to go to work until she got home to watch holly but they would both enjoy her kissing him into a calm state and hed get over it besides little holly was hungry and it wasnt as if he could do the shopping
