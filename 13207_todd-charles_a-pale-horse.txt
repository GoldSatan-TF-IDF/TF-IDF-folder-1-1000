charles todd a pale horse berkshire early april light i t was nearing the full moon and the night seemed to shimmer with he walked down the lane and turned to look up at the hillside the graceful white horse cut into the chalk by ancient britons galloped across the green slope without stirring from its place he couldnt see it without remembering that was the only reason he had chosen to live in this godforsaken place to torment himself until he couldnt bear it any more the horses had died too in that first gas attack it wasnt just the men the poor beasts couldnt know what the lowlying mist wafting toward them brought in its wake an eyewitness had likened the cloud to a great horse moving across a barren meadow ambling toward the barn for its dinner not hurrying not drifting just moving steadily without apparent purpose without apparent design following the wind as the horse followed the scent of its stall and the fresh hay heaped in the manger but like the pale horse of the apocalypse on his back rode death and hell had truly followed them he smiled grimly at the imagery he hadnt been there when the germans unleashed the chlorine attack against the allies at ypres yet it had changed his life in ways no one could have foreseen he wished hed never heard the name of that medieval belgian town he wished the germans had never reached it or that the british had left well enough alone and let them have the wretched place there was a silver flask of brandy in his pocket and he felt for it uncapped it lifted it to his lips then paused what if he drank it to the dregs and crawled into the ruins of way lands smithy to die like a wounded animal hiding itself away until it either healed or breathed its last would anyone care a shadow was coming up the road toward him it was andrew slater the smith it was impossible not to recognize him even at this distance andrew was built like a church tower tall and broad and solid but the man didnt turn at the lane he passed by without speaking as if sleepwalking moving on toward the smithy like to like it would be crowded inside with the two of them there he told himself with black humor not counting whatever ghosts lingered in that narrow stone age tomb i envy andrew slater he thought there in the darkness he lives only in the present while i have only the past he drank a little of the brandy for courage saluting the pale horse with his flask then he turned and trudged back to his cottage and turned up all the lamps for comfort london late april ian rutledge walked into his flat and sat down in the darkness he was too tired to deal with the lamps it had been a long and trying day the hours hed spent searching for a murderer had ended in the mans attempt to leap through the tenement window on the wild chance he could still elude capture it had taken rutledge and two constables to prevent it and all three of them bore bruises to show for their efforts rutledges shoulder ached and the top of his left thigh felt as if it had been kicked by a horse but then desperation had lent strength to the man in the darkness the voice of hamish macleod answered him a dead mans voice but for nearly four years now it had seemed to rut ledge as real as his own he had never grown used to hearing it and yet with time he had come to terms of a sort with it it was either that or madness and he feared madness more ye nearly went out yon window with him it was true hed been faster than the stunned constables and got there first hed read the flare of intent in the mans eyes and reacted to that just as the mans muscles had tightened to turn his back on them and race for the casement a better death than hanging rutledge said if hed succeeded but hed have gone scotfree if hed been lucky enough to land on that shop roof just below and to the left i couldnt chance it hed have killed again it was in his nature rutledge let the silence wrap him closing his eyes and resting his head on the back of his chair waiting for jangled nerves to find solace if not peace he had nearly let himself drift into a shallow sleep when there was a knock at his door shaking off the torpor of exhaustion he got up reluctantly and crossed the room when he opened the door he found his sister frances standing there ian are you all right her gaze went beyond him to the dark flat and that sixth sense of hers seemed to catch the atmosphere like a sleek cat scenting danger tired thats all come in ive yet to turn up the lamps i havent been home long well im here to dig you out of your cave im meeting friends for dinner and i need an escort frances there must be half a hundred men who would gladly take you anywhere including paris whats happened to them they cant all have decided to throw themselves off westminster bridge in despair laughing she followed him into the flat and waited as he lit the lamps and made the shadows retreat those in the room she found herself thinking as well as those of the spirit her instincts to come here had been right yes well theyre none of them as handsome as you ian and i might as well take the veil its hopeless beneath the humor her voice betrayed her either she was lying or there was something wrong that she wasnt ready to talk about is there truly a dinner party he asked quietly as a matter of fact there is you remember the farnums theyre taking maryanne browning out to dinner invited me and included a friend of yours at least i think you count her among your acquaintances if not your friends maryanne was a widow her husband peter a victim not of the war but of the spanish flu rutledge had spent new years eve at her house at a party that he didnt care to remember you arent matchmaking are you good god no im truly fond of maryanne but im harboring no hopes in that direction weve been trying to keep her busy ian rather than leaving her to mope and so all of us in her circle take it in turns seeing to it that shes not forgotten or left out of things he believed her it was a kindness frances would think of and do im tired i told you do you really need me to make up your numbers he caught something in her expression as she said offhandedly simon cant come tonight hes in scotland and that was the nub of course she was growing quite fond of simon barrington she hadnt shown a preference for any of her suitors not for years not since richard who never was her suitor but possibly the only man shed loved she was clearly disappointed that barrington was out of the city more than usually disappointed he made a mental note of it then answered all right ill come if you give me a quarter of an hour to change help yourself to a drink if you like she gave him a swift embrace i knew i could count on you as he walked into his bedroom he called who is the other person you mentioned that i knew him it isnt a himits a her meredith channing she and maryanne have become friends he stopped on the point of taking off his coat meredith channing an attractive woman who knew far too much for comfort about him about the war about hed almost said hamish but he was nearly certain she hadnt read that nightmare in his mind hed blocked it for so many years now that it was habit to keep the somme and hamish and the firing squad shut firmly away where no one could find it hamish said dont go and rutledge caught himself just in time before he answered aloud ive already promised he said silently i cant go back on it without explaining why and that i shant do yorkshire late that same night hugh tredworth the ringleader possessed a goodly amount of charm it was his stockintrade whispers claimed that his real father had been a scottish tinker but hughs grandfather had had the same red hair and wicked smileand his auntie as well come to that as his mother was fond of pointing out hugh had also been cursed with older brothers the butt of their jokes and malicious tricks for as long as he could remember these had sharpened his wits and taught him cunning which he was careful to conceal at eleven he was the eldest of his four cohorts johnnie and bill cousins were ten as was tad robbie only nine tagged along because he had always been his brother tads shadow they had fallen under hughs spell when hed missed a year of schooling after complications of scarlet fever their scrapes and escapades had never drawn blood and for the most part their parents looked the other way this nightit was well on toward morning in point of factthe five boys had tramped nearly five miles crosscountry to reach their destination robbie tiring lagged a little now and tad threatened to leave him by the wayside hugh hissed them to silence hurry or well be too late ahead lay the grounds of the estate and beyond the ruins of the great abbey one of hughs neighbors had worked as undergardener there for a summer regaling everyone with descriptions of all hed seen only everything appeared larger and harder to find in the dark or else mr pritchert had been a liar and made up half his tales hugh moved his precious book from one hand to the other unfamiliar nerves getting the better of him hed purloined the book from the schoolmasters shelf the subject was alchemy about which he knew nothing but there were spells in these pages and he intended to try them out bill the tallest carried a sack with apples a corner of cheese and a heel of bread in it like napoleons army he traveled on his stomach theyd wanted to bring cider but hadnt discovered a way to steal a stone jar for the night they skirted the grounds of the estatemr pritchert swore it had dogs that bit first and barked laterthen threaded their way through a wood so dark the moon vanished but soon enough they arrived at a point where they could see what lay ahead it was awe inspiring an enormous complex of mellow stone stood before them ranges of monastic buildings jutting across the lawns a square soaring tower great arches running high into the moonlit sky tall haunted windows with no glass doorways that opened into blackness unlike any theyd ever looked into gor johnnie whispered stopping short robbie felt his bowels stir its naught but a ruin hugh scoffed at least naught until we work the spells come on he started forward toward the nave but when they didnt follow he said in disgust i should have brought my sisters they crept at his heels then hoping that whatever struck him down would spare them if they could only appear small enough bill trying for bravado said its stood empty long enough for bones to rot robbie squeaked an owl flew out of the empty west window above their heads gliding on silent wings across the moonlit sward i told you there were owls hugh whispered has to be if theres spirits here and a black cat we could have brought cinders tad offered and have ma down on you like a thunderclap robbie demanded hes her cat not yours not to harm him silly just to borrow i thought people sacrificed to the devil johnnie asked only if you want something do you hugh retorted no johnnie admitted minding his footing as they went through the gaping door now they were in the shadows cast by the massive columns in the long roofless nave with moonlight visible above the moon was past the full but it helped a little with the gloom the high walls seemed to stretch forever pinning them in the eye of god we arent desecrating the altar are we tad was an altar boy vicar wont care for that even hugh was having second thoughts well begin in the cloister there should be a way to it along there nobody can say we didnt show respect with more relief than they cared to admit to the other boys hurried after him in the direction of the doorway leading into the cloister there was brighter moonlight here but the gallery was ominously dark it seemed to be peopled with the unseen dead whispers of sound came to their ears like monks walking to compline and condemning the souls of interlopers on sacred ground the wind hugh told them when his followers stopped to listen see over there we can use that stone in the center itll work a treat he glanced up at the moon then went sprawling scrambling to his feet he looked down but nothing he could see had tripped him up hed have sworn a hand had caught at his ankle the fingers had felt cold on his flesh shaking off his own fears he blamed them on his companions didnt anybody think to bring a candle well break our necks without tad held out three with a fistful of matches hugh lit them with a flourish dripping wax onto the round stone and then setting the candles into each puddle they formed a rough triangle he opened the schoolmasters book at random and found a page where there was a drawing of a great iron kettle on the boil and an oven red hot to one side he scanned the words found them very unlike a spell and turned the page ah much better this was what hed seen a week ago and determined to try out hed only a nodding acquaintance with latin but if god understood it so would the devil he stood up straight his hands above his head palms out in supplication and began to intone the words on the page turning them into gibberish as he struggled with them an echo soft and unintelligible sent a shiver down robbies spine and he clutched his brothers hand the words rolled on and hugh thought his voice had deepened toward the end as his confidence grew but nothing much happened and he was disappointed he tried twice more with other spells and still the devil was afraid to come to him tad said tentatively hes busy elsewhere but hugh wasnt to be deterred its not sacred enough ground here in the middle we need to stand closer to the church wall he told them as if he knew what he was doing see just over there they turned to look then got up from their haunches and followed him into the shadows carefully shielding their candles but the night wind blew out one of them just as robbie tripped plunged headlong into the cold grass he began to scream highpitched and terrifying they turned to clamp a hand over his mouth then saw what he had seen first the devil was already there sitting against the wall his grotesque face staring up at them with wide blank eyes and the long nose of a donkey disappearing into the hood of the cloak he was wearing t hey ran until their lungs were ready to burst and their legs were trembling with the effort away from the ruins through the dark wood as far as the road and on toward the path theyd taken across the fields to reach the abbey when robbie fell behind tad stopped for him and then bill his hands on his knees and his breath still coming in frightened gasps stopped too his cousin pulled up and hugh a little ahead turned back to them what was it tad asked his voice quivering the devil hugh retorted it must have been he had never been so shaken no it was a man bill said he was wearing shoes do you think the devil goes about with that cloven hoof in plain sight hugh demanded regaining a little of his confidence what are we going to do about it tad asked if we tell well be blamed pa will take a strap to me what if vicar wont let us come to service robbie added mama wont like that well swear a blood oath never to tell hugh suggested dramatically ive my pocketknife well cut our thumbs and swear i dont want my thumb cut robbie said and to his great shame began to cry ma will see the cuts tad agreed she wont give us any peace over them until she knows everything why cant we just swear johnnie asked and wed better hurry about it or someone will be up milking before were back in our beds they swore as fierce an oath as hugh could devise on the spot may our tongues blacken and our faces run down our chins like hot pudding if we speak one word about tonight to any soul living or dead good or evil so help us god they turned then to hurry home but johnnie spoke for all of them when he said halfway there what if he follows us what if he wants us to be dead because weve seen him it wasnt until the next morning that a caretaker stumbled across a dead man in the ruins of fountains abbey the owner of studley royal was in london with his family and so the caretaker took it upon himself to summon the police the local man standing over the body took note of three things that there was no immediate indication of cause of death that the man was wearing a cloak like a monks complete with a hood that had fallen away from his face and that over his face there was a respirator one from the war he reached down and pulled the mask away he didnt recognize the face staring back at him no one from around here inspector madsen said aloud to the two constables standing at his back no the older of the two said but whats he doing here if i knew that madsen answered repressively i might know how he died and who has killed him if anyone did he had been called out before hed had time to eat his breakfast and his wife had had a thing or two to say about that she was a great one for cooking and expected those she cooked for to enjoy and appreciate her efforts yes sir the younger constable trailed him as he turned to survey the cloisters and began a slow circle therere three puddles of wax sir on that stone in the center a stub of candle over here and that book youve noticed just by his foot he had been first on the scene madsen examined the wax puddles noted they were in the shape of a triangle and grunted he went next to the stub of candle the kind he told himself his unthrifty wife would throw out she was particular about her candles was this one longer to start with he mused was this the third night of a vigil it would explain the three puddles the caretaker swears no one had been here before last night he says hed have noticed any sign that someone else was with the dead man its hard to say not knowing how active he himself was all right then lets have a look at yon book madsen picked it up and closed it to examine the title on the spine alchemy for gods sake he flipped it open and saw the name of one albert harris crowell on the name plate and under it nether bromley school is this crowell then he asked lifting his gaze to constable hood his voice flat no sir ive seen mr crowell sir he comes sometimes to the dog and cartthats the pub near dilby a quiet man before the war he was schoolmaster in nether bromley and now hes at dilby school well respected from what im told the younger constable stirred he was a conscientious objector in the war sir ive heard my father speak of it madsen turned his gaze to constable pickerel pickerels father had been a policeman as well retiring from the elthorpe force as sergeant just at the end of the war six months before madsen himself arrived how does your father know what crowell did in the war my father also drops in to the dog and cart from time to time its the talk there some evenings madsen was still staring at him and pickerel found himself adding the pub was never on his patch you might say and he likes that nobody to bring up whats past the next village over might as well be in a foreign land in the eyes of most though the war had changed that notion to some extent people clung to their prejudices does he never come to elthorpe crowell madsen asked him pickerel glanced at hood for confirmation he shook his head madsen held up the book then hes made an exception last night maybe he can tell us who it is we have on our hands l ater that morning he found the schoolmaster in a classroom seven or eight boys busy with a project involving as far as madsen could tell catapults and castle walls of small mud bricks crowell came out to speak to the inspector madsen tried not to stare at him like a specimen under glass but this was the first time hed set eyes on the man youngish with that fair slimness that came from long lines of pedigree his manner was composed and his voice well bred glasses perched on the end of his nose and he removed them as if suddenly aware that they were there if he felt any anxiety about confronting an inspector of police he hid it well inspector madsen isnt it crowell extended his hand what brings you to dilby not one of my students i hope he smiled and nodded his head toward the halfclosed door behind him theyre a handful but theres no meanness i can tell you that yes sir madsen took the proffered hand then held out his own to constable hood just behind him hood passed him the book can you tell us sir if this is by any chance your property crowell took it frowning yes heres my name in it but if youd asked me id have told you my copy is in the bookshelf in my office shall we have a look crowell cast a glance into his classroom three of the lads were staring back at him their eyes large with alarm as if the police had come for them he made a mental note to discover what mischief theyd been up to and said repressively young tredworth mind you finish your section of the wall dont be standing about just because im not there that applies to your workmen as well i want to see progress when i return hugh tredworth ducked his head and turned back to his task his cronies followed his example with suitable haste very well then crowell said to the policemen and led the way as madsen followed him down the passage he asked crowell interested in alchemy are you sir not particularly when i teach science i often make more progress with something thats exciting than i do with dull experiments i say how did you come by this its an old book i doubt its still in print well attend to that in a moment sir this your office is it crowell went in and crossed directly to the low bookshelf behind his desk but when he put his finger out to tap his copy the finger stopped in midair it isnt here he turned back to madsen frowning im at a loss to explain how it got away but i thank you for taking the trouble to return it inspector he slid it into its proper slot then straightened and waited as if expecting madsen either to take his leave or explain why it was an inspector and a constable had come to deliver a lost book the problem is madsen began slowly that this bookyour bookwas discovered lying by the foot of a dead man good god crowell was speechless for a moment then recovering said i dont understand inspector but i expect we should discuss this im available at three oclock indeed sir is there anyone who can take over your class sir id like you to come with me what now in heavens name cant it wait until the end of the school day were in the middle of a very important lesson i have no idea why this man or anyone else would be interested in my book on alchemy but surely it isnt a pressing matter this is a harmless enough study it cant do anyone any harm im afraid not sir it could be a case of murder were looking at crowell stood there uncertain quite what was expected of him then he said i shall have to ask my wife to step in at this age boys are inclined to rowdiness if left unsupervised as he went to find his wife accompanied by constable hood madsen walked back to the classroom there was a ripple of wariness as the students turned one by one to look at him he saw boys at the edge of the group hang their heads as if wishing the floor would swallow them up and he smiled to himself he could remember when he was that age and small sins loomed large im having to borrow mr crowell for a bit i dont want to hear youve been rude or rowdy with his missus he said his voice stern youll answer to me if theres any complaint of your behavior is that clear there was a chorus of yes sirs that made the rafters echo he nodded to the class collectively as he heard footsteps approaching a young woman with a scar across her face walked past him into the room taking the chair at her husbands table she ignored madsen but he saw that her hands were trembling as she folded them together and he shoved his own into his pockets as if to still them as well the students went quickly back to work and crowell smiled reassuringly at his wife before following madsen out into the passage it was a long drive back to elthorpe not so much in miles but in the silence that neither madsen nor crowell felt free to break but as they stopped in front of the police station crowell said all right im here as you asked its time you told me what this is all about where were you last evening sir madsen asked as he led the way into the station and back to the office where he kept his files and his pipe if you dont mind telling us i was at the school reading my wife can verify that you neednt have dragged me here and whats this about a dead man and possible murder i was just coming to that sir madsen sat down leaving crowell standing we found a body early this morning in the abbey ruins a man none of us recognizes but hed spent some time there from the looks of things and its likely he wasnt alone my question is this if he died of natural causesand well know the answer to that when the doctor has examined himwhy didnt the person or persons with him come for help as i wasnt there i cant answer you but you were there in a manner of speaking there was candle wax on a stone in the center of the cloisters a stub of candle nearby and at the dead mans foot your book with your name in it a book you admit is kept in your private office and ive explained to you that i have no idea how it came to be there id have sworn it was on my shelf along with the rest of my books i cant even tell you when it went missing or how indeed sir youve told me the book was old out of print there cant be that many other copies floating about and none of them i expect with your book plate inside what were hoping is that you can put a name to our dead man if he had your copy in his possession he very likely knew you if it wasnt in his possession why did you bring it to this meeting no dont interrupt let me finish did the shock of seeing him die put the book out of your mind was that how it got left behind there has to be a simple explanation sir and we would be greatly obliged if you could tell us why he was hanging about in a medieval abbey ruin in the middle of the night it must have been important whatever it was you met to discuss and a private matter at that look ive told youi wasnt in the abbey ruins last night or any night this past year i dont know who the dead man is or why my book should be there i didnt meet him and when you find out who stole my book youll have your other person crowell was angry now and feeling more than a little defensive as the evidence against him was being presented then youll have no objection to coming with us to look at the dead man idont like the dead that is ive seen more than my share and ill live very happily if i never see another one thats as may be madsen said all the same i shall have to ask you to tell us if you can identify him he rose we can walk to the doctors surgery from here im sure i can accept your word that you wont make any trouble for us make anyof course not damn you madsen smiled as he led the way he had his man now he was sure of it but in the back room of the doctors surgery where the body had been taken crowell stared down at the face on the bed and slowly shook his head ive never seen him before in my life can you swear to that of course i can i have never laid eyes on him as far as i know but there was a subtle shift in what hed said before and what he was willing to swear to madsen made a note of it the doctor came in just then and nodded to madsen as far as i can tell on first examination id say he was overcome by gas which means he couldnt have been wearing that respirator when he died nor could he have died in the ruins madsen frowned are you saying he died elsewhere was brought to the abbey and left where he was found i can tell you he didnt walk there himself the doctor retorted dryly someone else was involved make of it what you will crowell standing there between the doctor and the inspector flinched i dont have gas lamps not where i live hed blurted it out nerves getting the better of him his brother had died from chlorine gas at the second battle of ypres he had spent years trying to wipe that memory away it had been a horrid death he had carried the dying too many times not to know what his brother had suffered madsen and the doctor turned to stare at him ive never seen him before crowell repeated can we go now ive no taste for this conscientious objector in the war were you sir madsen asked making no move to leave how did you know but it was obvious that the police had already looked into his background if youve seen my record youve also read that i served in france driving an ambulance i didnt want to kill thats all but i could do something about the suffering he gestured toward the dead man and ive seen far worse than this poor devil so making me stand here isnt going to help you his voice had risen just a little and he tried to get himself under control again but it was hard his temper these days was uncertain at best and his wife had urged him to speak to someone about it he wondered what madsen would make of that if hed learned of it but the inspector had already decided there was nothing to be gained here by trying to push the schoolmaster into betraying himself in the face of his victim he nodded to the doctor and led the way out to the street crowell felt himself sweating a cold sweat that seemed to bathe him am i free to return to my classroom inspector i dont care to leave my wife alone with the older boys any longer than need be they tend to rowdiness after a while we shall have to speak to mrs crowell ill take you back myself and so it was that inspector madsen found himself alone and face toface with alice crowell in the schools small office how did you come by that scar he asked before he could stop the words you didnt have it when i knew you its not your concern her voice was husky but he couldnt be sure whether it was fear or nerves there was a silence fraught with what was not said did he do that to you madsen pressed you may as well tell me ill find out in the end what did you wish to see me about she asked are you going to take my husband into custody should i madsen countered she made an impatient gesture dont play with me harry i saw your face when you took albert away whatever has happened it isnt just a matter of a truant student is there one a truant student you know there isnt i meantnever mind what did you wish to see me about she repeated she had a very mobile face her feelings clearly expressed the scar seemed to alter with her emotions emphasizing them in some fashion he couldnt understand he wanted to run his finger along it and tell her she was still beautiful but he knew she could lie too she had lied to him about her parents and how they had felt about a policeman in the family that he tried to tell himself in the face of his bitterness was a kind lie and she had told him another that she hadnt loved him he believed it then but later convinced himself that it was to cover the first lie madsen took a deep breath this wasnt the place to open up the past where was your husband last evening her expression changed here at the school he was finishing going over papers that hes submitting for an award mrs scotts prize for the best essay on richard iii mrs scott was the widow of the former rector of st stephens in elthorpe she was something of a local historian having written a small pamphlet on the architecture of the village church and another on the abbey both were available for sale on the table in the church porch madsen had seen them it was typical of her that shed asked crowell to read the essays like to like the schoolmaster in elthorpe was an upstart from liverpool well enough at what he did but not the sort one invites to present prizes in a social setting and you were here with him sitting in his office it brought such a cozy domestic scene to his mind that madsen clenched his fists no i was at home sewing the fringe on a shawl i was making for my mothers birthday then no one can actually prove he was here of course he was here why would he lie to me about where he was where else would he go to meet a man he planned to kill and whose body he intended to leave in the ruins of fountains abbey to throw off the police madsen hadnt explained the presence of that book yet but in time he would he found he was staring at her im married now myself he said did you ever love me truly love me she stood up i take it you have no more professional questions to ask me inspector and i shant answer personal ones but he stayed where he was between her and the door theres a man dead didnt your husband tell you that this morning when he asked you to carry on in the schoolroom for him a man dead with one of your husbands books lying at his feet she drew in a breath who was it she asked who is dead as if that were more important than the book we dont know your husband cant identify him there is nothing in the mans pockets to tell us who he is and all we can be certain of is that he didnt live in this part of yorkshire else one of my men would have known him and more to the point no one has been reported missing well then if you dont know who the dead man is she said tartly theres no reason to keep me penned up in here or to take my husband away meanwhile theres the school to be seen to her words stung him i havent kept you penned up alicemrs crowell i was doing my duty he stepped aside and she swept out of the door as if he were invisible he watched her walk down the corridor and he felt an urge to clap her husband up and throw away the key at the door of a classroom a boy stood watching him wary and uncertain what are you staring at then madsen snapped and the child disappeared as if by magic shutting the door softly behind him ugh tredworth was waiting for his friends at the end of the school day one glance at his face made bill distinctly uneasy as he came up to join hugh and johnnie trailing him stopped to study his boots at a little distance as if uncomfortable in hughs presence then tad came through the door starting at the sight of them standing together in silence whats happened he asked anxiously wheres robbie hugh demanded accusingly he wasnt at school today sick tad answered shortly couldnt keep his breakfast down this morning hes not telling is he bill wanted to know we swore an oath of course hes not telling tad replied with more force than hed intended but he couldnt hold their eyes remind him hugh urged remind him his tongue will turn black if hes not in school tomorrow leave him alone johnnie spoke up and they all wheeled to stare at him youll only make it worse he said trying to frighten him why were the police here what did they want i couldnt hear but hugh had seen the book in the constables hands if no one else had and he had had to swallow hard to keep his own breakfast down the shock was so great it was mr crowell they wanted wasnt it nothing to do with us why did they come for him bill persisted all the way from elthorpe and then take him away they brought him back didnt they hugh pointed out someone found the candle we dropped tad said its a matter of trespass none of us missed school so theres nothing to point at us not counting robbie but theyre not to know that are they the four of them had been walking down the road as they argued earnestly trying to assure themselves that there was nothing to show theyd summoned the devil and succeeded in raising him then bill shattered their illusions did he leave scorched grass where he lay the devil is that why theyre questioning schoolmasters theyve found the grass and want to know if anyones different how different tad asked anxiously nobody else has been sick just robbie hes possessed bill said thats why hes sick hes possessed tad shouted at him theres nothing wrong with him theres nothing wrong with my brother and he marched off down the road leaving them to look after him their faces tight with sudden worry t he doctors report was brought in to madsen the man hadnt died where he was found it was impossible that he could have considering the cause of death in fact hed been dead at least four andtwenty hours before he was discovered furthermore there were no scars or other marks to make it a simple matter to identify him he could be anyone from anywhere and madsen though he didnt care for unfinished business on his watch reviewed the evidence and decided that his next step would have to be identifying the corpse before he could make any connection with albert crowell stick if he could prove that crowell knew the man it would go a long way toward building his case if there was anything between them he could take the schoolmaster into custody but that was easier said than done where for instance should he begin he considered bringing alice crowell in to elthorpe to look at the dead man he even toyed with going back to the school to ask crowell where he had been every minute of the past three days but he already knew what alice crowell would say her husband had been with herbusy at the schoollistening to her read standing by him even with a possible charge of murder hanging over the mans head madsen kept the file open on his desk where it could nag him every time he looked at it and it became an obsession even when he was not there why had crowells book been found by the corpses feet an old book on alchemy of all things he pondered that as he dealt with a quarrel between two farmers over the death of a prize ram what did the book have to do with the dead man except to betray the name of his murderer why had crowell been carrying this book with him was it concealing something had it been the excuse that allowed crowell to approach the victim over his tea madsen was beginning to believe the two men must have met at the ruins gone somewhere else and the body had been carried back there to throw the police off the caretaker could have been wrong he might have simply glanced into the cloisters the day before and missed the corpse up against the wall in a hurry as he made his rounds and not wanting his employers to know hed been slack madsen went back to the doctors surgery and stood looking down at the corpse why the respirator that hadnt saved the victims life and why the cloak that at first glance looked like a monks habit to lay a false trail for the police he tried to put it all together but there was no making sense of it walking back to his office he considered the fact that neither crowells house nor the village school was served by gas so where had he taken the dead man to kill him why did the man have to die he shut himself in his office to think debts owed some scandalous connection between the two men that didnt bear looking at then why leave the body here if the man hadnt died here it only made the killing more blatant what was it in aid of that respirator and the cloak a warning to someone else what was the schoolmaster involved in and how would it affect alice crowell when the truth came out it all came down to that bloody book he told himself for the hundredth time as he walked home for his dinner if the book hadnt been there the police would have been mystified an oversight a mistake the kind that got murderers hanged what was there in albert crowells life that he was desperate to hide by morning madsen was unable to stay away from the crowells three more visits to the school three more frustrating interviews with the schoolmaster three more missed encounters with alice who seemed to have an uncanny ability to be other than where he wanted her to be and yet he couldnt bring himself to ask for her outright not while he badgered her husband in the dark hours of the night hed even considered the possibility that she had killed her lover and left the book to muddle the case but he knew it wasnt true the man according to the doctor was pushing fifty and not the sort who could sweep any woman off her feet twice on his excursions to the dilby school he found himself faced with staring boys nosy little bastards more eyes than face he never remembered being so fond of his own schoolmasters that he wouldnt have cheered to see them taken away for a week he had spoken to one of them the tredworth boy what are you hanging about for know anything about this business do you hugh had shaken his head vigorously no sir iits just he took a deep breath and blurted thought i might be a policeman when i grow up thats all and nobody will tell me whats happened they change the subject when i come into the room its not a matter for childrens ears madsen had said annoyance creeping in stay clear of it or ill have you in for questioning myself after that he saw no more of hugh or his friends the dinner had in many ways been trying rutledge had sat opposite meredith channing and he had spent the evening trying to keep his mind closed to her it was difficult with hamish restless and more intrusive as the hour stretched into two and then into three the soft scottish voice railed at him warning him no to lower his guard as if they stood in the darkness of france waiting for an attack they couldnt see but knew would surely come for a moment he could smell the war again and it shook him it was so real frances beside him had been brittle her laughter forced her smile too bright rutledge began to wonder if there had been more to simon barringtons departure for scotland than met the eyeor that frances had been prepared to confide the farnums thank god had been their usual cheerful selves and maryanne browning seemed to revive in the warmth of conviviality widowhood had been a blow like most women of her upbringing shed relied on peter for everything and suddenly faced with taking charge of her own life and fortunes when peter dropped dead in the second influenza epidemic she had been at a loss to know how to begin there had been no time to prepare to learn how certain things were done how to cope with lawyers and bankers and men of business peter had done all that he should by rights still be here to lift the burden from her the struggle had taken its toll though to her credit maryanne had never shirked her duty that too had been part of her upbringingto accept duty and responsibility however difficult or distasteful they might be frances had been right about this evening a muchneeded palliative for her he recalled his question to franceswas this a matchmaking attempt including him in the gathering but it seemed to be the farthest thing from maryannes mind she treated rutledge like the friend he was peters friend and therefore someone to trust and turn to but not to consider romantically a brother that peter had never had consequently he returned the compliment and treated her in much the same way he treated frances although without the worry that she would see through him as his sister did maryanne was not in francess league when it came to reading people without a conscious shift in thought he found himself recalling that meredith channing never spoke of her late husband he had no idea how she had mourned him or what gaps he had left in her life that innate composure seldom cracked far enough to show the woman inside images of meredith channing as hed first met her on the eve of the new year when shed conducted an amusing seance for maryanne browning and her guests had stayed with him she had known more about him than hed felt comfortable with and her voice was mesmerizing soft and melodious and warm her eyes held secrets that he with all his experience couldnt fathom but she had stood by him when they met again in northamptonshire and he had been forced to trust her then she made no reference to that during the dinner greeting him as a friend of friends and giving no indication she had seen him deal with murderers at one point under cover of the laughter surrounding them she had said quietly i hope you are well it was a statement not a question as if she already knew the answer well enough it was a long day he couldnt for the life of him understand why he had added that and swore silently she nodded as if she could see he was speaking the truth then joined in the general conversation he began to relax a little unaware until the meal was nearly over that somewhere in the course of the evening his fatigue had dropped away the shocks of the day no longer weighing heavily on his mind mrs channing had not singled him out for attention indeed he could hardly recall a word spoken directly to him save for her brief i hope you are well and yet the warmth of her voice something in her manner that was inexplicably soothing and the stillness that was her nature seemed to touch him in some fashion he told himself that that was nonsense it was the wine and the good conversation and the laughter that had done the trick but hamish was there warning him to mind he didnt betray himself to keep a tight grip on his selfcontrol to rutledge fell the task of holding mrs channings coat for her when they were leaving and a faint fragrance like jasmine on a warm summer nights breeze wafted toward him as she settled her scarf around her throat he was used to the perfumes of englandlily of the valley attar of roses forgetmenotsfloral scents that most women wore sometimes with the spicy touch of carnations or the richness of heliotrope he found himself remembering the scent that olivia marlowe had used even after her death still surrounding the desk where she had worked a line of olivias poetry from the volume wings of fireo a mannings poetryfilled his mind unbidden i have not forgotten you the pleasure of your touch the depth of your voice its as if you never left me and my heart is full he nearly dropped the coat but meredith channing appeared not to notice hamish had rutledge had envied nicholas cheney olivias half brother he still did and hamish knew that all too well there were general farewells giving rutledge time to collect his wits and shake hands say the right thing and turn away as the next cab drew to the curb frances was adding mrs channing is going my way ian you neednt worry about seeing me home did you enjoy the evening i hope you did very much so he answered kissing her cheek and then he was alone traveling toward his flat damn barrington if he broke francess heart three nights later rutledge met friends for dinner this one masculine and taken in a club off st jamess street their conversation avoided the war but even so the toast to absent friends had brought it back like a specter at the feast one man had just returned from a tour of duty in south africa his face burnt brick red by the sun and they spoke of his journey home then moved on to where the government was heading with its policies the state of the economy and most depressing of all a rise in the crime rate as ordinary people struggled to make ends meet as the dinner broke up freddy masters informed them that he was thinking of immigrating to canada my uncle has business interests there and he lost his sonmy cousin jackin the war im whats left of the family and while im not particularly enthralled with providing electricity to millions there you are i dont have much choice there was general agreement and mark hadley said my neighbor has much the same idea hed considered argentina and even australia but canada seems less of a change talk of canada reminded rutledge of jean married and living there now with her diplomat if it hadnt been for the war hed have married her himself when he came home from france shellshocked a broken man she had been horrified unable even to look at him hed released her from the engagement there and then but it had taken him a very long time to come to terms with the anguish of her desertion it had seemed to underline the bleakness of his future he was wondering if she missed england just as freddy continued my wifes not best pleased leaving schools and friends behind ill let you know what we decide i can tell you my wife wasnt best pleased with cape town edward throckmorton commented but we managed you find a way mark smiled at rutledge lucky man you have no wife to make your decisions for you and then he too remembered jean and looked away rutledge said only i dont know if its luck or a curse my sister keeps me in line freddy said thoughtfully i saw frances some ten days back walking along bond street with simon barrington good man simon as if to say hed seen which way the wind blew there and as if to reassure rutledge that she might make a worse choice hes in scotland at the moment rutledge answered scotland mark was surprised he dined with the douglases last night im sure of it rutledge heard him but managed to say i must be wrong then i may not have a wife but i know how to listen with half an ear that brought a round of laughter and they said their good nights driving to his flat rutledge tried to recall some of the evenings conversation but it was a blur already fading all he could hear was hadleys voice he dined with the douglases last night im sure of it tomorrow he would make it his business to find out what had happened between frances and simon barrington it had been a long day and a good nights sleep would show him how best to go about it a nights sleep he was not to have there was a constable on his doorstep standing there with the stoic air of a man prepared to remain at his post until doomsday if that was required of him when he saw rutledge step out of his motorcar he waited until his quarry turned toward him to say evening sir chief superintendent bowless compliments sir and will you come to the yard at once rutledge doubted that the chief superintendent had said anything about compliments but he nodded and replied come in while i change im to bring you as soon as i find you begging your pardon sir constable burns isnt it well constable i am not appearing at the yard in evening dress and theres an end of it another five minutes wont matter he unlocked the door to his flat and added with more humor than he felt i wont tell him if you dont no sir yes sir burns replied woodenly and followed him into the flat as if expecting him to escape through a back window it was in fact seven minutes before rutledge was ready to leave he felt as if he were moving in treacle every task seeming to require more effort than he could muster rutledge drove and burns sat silently beside him like a waxwork figure rutledge found himself thinking that he would be asleep before he reached the yard in an effort to keep himself alert he said how long have you been waiting constable two hours sir a little over at least it was a pleasant night yes sir was i ever that green rutledge found himself wondering it seemed a long time ago that hed been a constable centuries eons but it hadnt been ten years they arrived at the yard and burns waited while rutledge saw to the motorcar then accompanied him inside and to the door of the chief superintendents office as if half afraid his quarry would bolt if left alone rutledge knocked and then entered at bowless curt command burns disappeared down the shadowy passage duty done rutledge shut the door and faced his superior bowles was in a subdued mood instead of what rutledge expected to hear from himit took you long enough to get herethe chief superintendent said i want you to leave tonight for berkshire if you will your destination is half a dozen houses not far from uffing ton theyre called the tomlin cottages hardly enough of them to dignify the name hamlet but there you are youve a watching brief nothing more why not use a local man rutledge asked its not something for the local people to worry themselves about the war office has misplaced one of its own and they dont want him to get the wind up thinking theyre watching him but the fact is they are rather an odd sort im told tends to do things his way disappears sometimes and for all i know gets roaring drunk and alarms the neighbors a routine lookin was unsatisfactory and in the event hes got himself into trouble they want it dealt with quickly and efficiently to avoid gossip but the yard isnt in the business of minding fools my view as well but when youve been asked nicely you do as youre told he turned to look out the window they were impressed they said with the way you handled matters in warwickshire last june see that you dont disappoint them now it was grudging as if the words were forced out of him or required of him what excuse do i have for being there theres that damned great white horse on the hillside bowles turned back to the room done in chalk people come to stare at it and strangers are taken for granted not liked mind you but for the most part ignored the damned great white horse was a chalk figure from the prehistoric past and of all the chalk figures possibly rutledges favorite hed been taken to see it as a child and allowed to walk the bounds who is the man im to watch how will i know him its partridge of all the bloody names gaylord partridge the cottage with the white gate he matters to the war office and thats what youre to keep in mind at all times he passed a sheet of paper to rutledge not even on official stationery he thought scanning it a name a direction nothing more spoken rather than written instructions sydney riley the infamous spy could have done no better in the cloakanddagger world rutledge left soon afterward not happy about the long drive that lay ahead but in other ways glad to be out of london the daffodils would be rioting among the hedgerows and the air was sweet in the countryside hamish reminded him theres yon simon barrington as rut ledge put the kettle on and then went to pack his valise hell still be in london when i return it can wait but francess face when shed come to ask him to take her to dinner with maryanne browning was before him even as he answered hamish aloud he could hardly pound barrington into admitting hed lied to frances or arrest him for cruelty to his sister and there was always the possibility that perhaps it was frances who lied about scotland to keep herself from blurting out the truththat something had gone wrong between the two of them it can wait he said again to hamish as much as to himself it might work out better without my meddling hamish said derisively aye thats a comfort rutledge filled his thermos with tea then turned out the lamps he paused there in the darkness wondering again if he should leave a message for his sister then thought better of it a letter was no way to deliver bad news if she truly didnt know where simon was and it was always possible that he had dined with the douglases and then traveled north with them cutting across london rutledge set out in the direction of uff ington and drove through the darkness stopping only to stretch his legs when he felt himself drowsing at the wheel and to drink from the thermos it was a remarkably soft night one of those april evenings when the world seemed pleased with itself when hed left the busy towns ringing london behind he could sometimes smell plowed earth and once or twice the wafting fragrance of fruit trees in bloom the road emptied as the night moved on toward the early hours of morning a handful of lorries making their way to the east and the occasional motorcar passing him at one point he smelled wood smoke and wondered if gypsies were camping in a copse of trees in the middle of nowhere the policemans instinct was to stop and investigate but he drove on ignoring it around two in the morning he pulled into a small clearing and slept awaking to the dampness of an early dew for several seconds he was disoriented not sure where he was in france or in england but then his mind cleared and he got out to walk again and to finish his tea it was just getting light when he drove past his destination a cluster of nine cottages that seemed to stand in the middle of nowhere much of a sameness in design as if they were built to match stone and thatch they seemed out of place here he saw that one a little to itself boasted a white gate in a low stone wall on the hillside above him was the white horse pale in the morning light an early mist hiding its feet giving it the appearance of floating across the ground silent and mysterious he stopped the motorcar in the middle of the road swept by such an intense emotion that he could feel his heart thudding heavily in his chest the mist moving gently blotted out everything else until it was all he could see gas floating across the battlefield and the shout going up masks he was back in france the tension and fear spreading around him as he and his men watched the slowmoving cloud fumbling to put on their gas masks hastily making sure not an inch of skin showed he thrust his hands in his pockets unable to find his gloves digging them deep until he could feel his knuckles hard against the fabric and hamish saying in his ear are you lost then he came back to the present with a jolt staring at what appeared to be a giant of a man standing at his elbow for the life of him he couldnt have told how long the man had been there or what hed been saying i admiring the horse he managed trying to bring it into focus against the backdrop of his slip into the past the young man turned to look at it impressive right enough i like it best at moonrise but youre blocking the road rutledge glanced in his mirror and saw a large wagon behind him and a patient horse between the shafts on the wagon was a harrow sorry he let in the clutch and drove on still lost in that nightmare world that all too often shared his real one the cottages were behind him and ahead lay waylands smithy in a copse of beech trees he could make it out clearly an arrangement of great stones that encompassed a small space with a narrow opening it had probably been a stone age tomb not a blacksmiths shop still legend maintained that if a man left his horse there overnight to be shod and a coin to pay for the work the animal would be waiting for him in the morning more likely local smiths had discovered a way to expand their trade for centuries fire and those who used it to work metal were held in high regard and sometimes feared as well a few miles along he found a small inn by the road lorries in the yard and a motorcar or two as well he stopped to ask if they were serving at this hour and inside saw a pot of tea standing on a small table near the door a stack of mugs beside it sugar and a pitcher of lukewarm milk just behind it he poured himself a cup wandered into the tiny reception area and sat down by the window overlooking the road it was two hours later that he opened his eyes again a woman was clearing away the tea things and she smiled as he stirred and then straightened up in his chair youre not the first to nod off in that chair she said her eyes merry nor the last that your motorcar by the lilacs im afraid so when do you begin serving breakfast lord love you we closed the kitchen more than an hour ago most of the lorry drivers have moved on id have thought their racket wouldve wakened the dead not this dead he said standing and stretching his shoulders do you by any chance have rooms here we keep a halfdozen beds for travelers clean sheets and good food as well as good cheer thats what we offer and all we offer she considered him its not very posh rutledge smiled still id like a room for tonight if you have one im here to see the horse oh yes its early for the daytrippers but i expect you arent the usual visitor what are you then her face was red with the mornings rush her hair pinned back out of her way and her clothing sober as if she worked hard and had no time to worry about how she looked he hadnt been prepared to deal with questions of this sort i was tired of london and i drove all night following her into the dining room he added i needed to see something besides walls and pavement and people disappointed in love are you he was on the point of vigorously denying it when he realized that she was teasing him and he must have looked the picture of the rejected lover unshaven his clothes unpressed his face marked with fatigue no foolish in the extreme she laughed sit down over there in the cornerthat cloths cleanand ill bring you whatevers left from breakfast theres usually cold bacon bread and hardboiled eggs in the cupboard theres coffee as well as tea some of the lorry drivers prefer it to keep them awake ill stay with tea when she brought his plate it was large as a charger and as promised there were rashers of bacon eggs toasted bread and pots of butter and jam rutledge thanked her and added ive just come past those cottages not far from the spot where you can look up and see the white horse odd place to put them i should think unless theyre intended for viewers to stop in he couldnt remember seeing them there when hed come to uffington as a boy but then the horse had been all that mattered firing his imagination well i hope youre not thinking of wanting one theyre taken the lot of them they were put up near the beginning of the late queens reign leper houses they were but no lepers came and then they were let to anyone who was willing to live there the local people dont much care for them but theres no dearth of people who do why leper houses was leprosy a problem here she paused on her way back to the kitchen it was a miss tomlin they say who was set on them having been a missionary and seen her share of suffering and theres a leper in the bible you know i expect that was what put her in mind of doing something for them she sold off another parcel of land her grandfather had left her and sent for a builder to make cottages where the poor things could live without being tormented but she never found any children of god as she called them and she died not long after at least she cared enough to try well theres that i expect or a guilty conscience the fact is she could have done more good with her money in other directions in my opinion a touch of the sun its what my granddad always said too much sun and too long in heathen lands shed lost sight of what truly needed doing in england and ive dishes to see to my husbands gone to market and the girl who dries for me has a bad thumb so im on my own give me half an hour and therell be a room for you she was gone leaving him to the hearty breakfast afterward she showed him to a small room that seemed lilliputian and he remembered the young man on the road hed have played the very devil getting himself into this box he thought and the cramped space sent his claustrophobia reeling the first order of business was to open the only window which looked out on the road he stood there breathing in the morning air and fighting an urge to run back down the stairs after mrs smith begging for something larger but there werent any larger rooms given the size of the building fatigue overtook him after a few minutes and he lay down on the narrow bed asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow the fragrance of sundried sheets folded with lavender was the last thing he remembered it was late morning when he drove back to the white horse and climbed the hill his legs were longer than they had been at age nine and he made short work of it now as a child hed huffed and puffed in his fathers wake trying to keep pace but stumbling as he tried to see everything at once hamish unhappy with this heathen horse kept him company with a vigorous objection to having any part of it when one stood on the crest of the hill looking down at the figure it was difficult to pick out what the expanse of white chalk represented aware of what the design was it was possible to identify the flowing tail the legs stretched in a gallop the reared head but the ancient people who had cut the turf here to create the figure must have had someone standing on the ground below guiding them as he realized someone was standing now looking up at him he began to walk back the way hed come and the man stayed where he was it wasnt the young giant from early this morning but an older man with gray in his hair and a lined face his eyes when rutledge was near enough to see them were brown but the whites were yellow malaria rutledge had seen troops from the commonwealth especially india with just such yellowing good morning he said to the man for all the world a traveler taken with the local sight its quite a piece of work isnt it i expect it was dug with wooden mattocks or antler horn i wonder how long it took to create the full figure dont ask me i dont know a damned thing about it and care less is that what brought you here the horse warily rutledge said should there be another reason well partridge has gone missing again theres generally someone from london looking in on him or waiting for him to come back when hes on one of his walkabouts it was an australian term and the man seemed to use it as if from habit how do you know hesergone missing i feed his cat dont i when hes not to home she comes to my door thats the arrangement we have and i dont mind shes a good mouser rutledge held out his hand and introduced himself quincy the other man said briefly well since youre down youll want to come for a spot of tea thank you mr quincy no just quincy he retorted turning on his heel to lead the way to the cottage across from the one with the white gate rutledge bent his head to follow his host inside the rooms were small but of a size for one man to manage well enough or one woman hed glimpsed a womans face peering out at him from her windows as he had turned from the road into the lane that linked the cottages that chairs got better springs quincy said pointing it out rutledge sat down and looked around from the sitting room parlor he could see a kitchen in the back where quincy was busy a second room across the entry from this one its door shut and in the middle of the house stairs up to a loft quite comfortable here are you rutledge asked if you like small places quincy answered putting on the kettle ive had to store some of my belongings under the bed upstairs where did you drive from london rutledge answered and they talked until the kettle whistled about the city which quincy seemed to know although his information was often more than a little out of date as if he hadnt been there for some time the closed door creaked a paw came out and around it followed by a long gray cat with orange eyes behind her rutledge could see a burst of color in the room as if tins of paint had been splattered everywhere dublin quincy catching sight of the cat swore and came to scoop her up to put her outside but first hed shut the inner door quickly as if not wishing rutledge to know what was in the room beyond but rutledge had already guessed birds in every hue every size all naturally posed and all quite dead he said nothing accepting the cup of tea he was offered these cottages are interesting whats their history not much quincy told him bluntly built at a guess some fifty years ago by a woman who had more money than sense comfortable enough but i need a bicycle to go anywhere its out back and how did partridge get around he had a motorcar its in the shed behind his house i expect he wasnt going far and left it in favor of his own bicycle does he usually wander off like this hes mad as a hatter quincy responded sourly goes where the wind blows and who comes here looking for him business associates so they tell me it seems he worked for a firm in london before he was put to pasture and apparently someone there still cares what becomes of him thats thoughtful rutledge answered not thoughtful careful i expect he was someone important enough that they didnt want the world and its brother knowing hes gone balmy when was the last time he left february it was the man here when partridge came back told me hed been spotted on a street corner in birmingham preaching peace and harmony to the world thats cold work in february yes well i dont think he cares i dont think he cares for anything except dublin the cat a young woman came here once and he wouldnt let her in i expect it was his daughter there was a resemblance at least his wandering off must worry her most of the time its only a day a day and a half that hes away occasionally its a longer period of time someone told me i forget who it was that he must have another house elsewhere that thats where he goes but hes never spoken of it so my guess is that it isnt true gossip is not always reliable and in his case not always helpful and his daughter never came back not that im aware of a pity it sounds as if partridge needs her he doesnt need anyone when hes right in his head which is most of the time youre very interested in him for a passerby yes well ive time on my hands and people intrigue me partridges walkabouts as you call them your birds as a diversion it worked beautifully seen them did you well theres no law broken in having them none that i know of rutledge had finished his tea and stood up thank you for your hospitality if youre needful of seeing in the cottage partridge never locked it surprised rutledge said i have no right to trespass on his privacy the other watchers werent so particular about that yes well as it happens im not one of the other watchers thank you again quincy ill see you about watcher or not rutledge left the woman who had been peering out her window at him was in her back garden hanging a mornings wash on the line he wondered if it was to see who he was and what he did next a better vantage point than the window he walked back to his motorcar to find the young man hed met earlier with his head deep in the bonnet he jerked it out as he heard rutledge approaching and said i like mechanical things engines whatever do you mind not at all the names rutledge the other man held out his hand saw that it was filthy and drew it back again andrew andrew slater ive been admiring the white horse rutledge said as slater dove back into the inner workings of the engine i saw you this morning asleep on the road yes he let it go at that we dont get many visitors this time of year slater went on voice muffled the horse is most popular in the summer people bring baskets and spread out a cloth and have their lunch or their tea there i dont think the horse much cares for that i needed to get away from london rutledge said this was as good a place as any why should the horse care someone put him there a long time ago he was a god then but weve forgotten why today and so to most hes only a chalk figure slater withdrew his head and folded the bonnet back in its place she runs sweetly your motorcar thank you rutledge looked at the filthy hands the black ground into the creases and whorls of the skin a smith are you slater grinned widely yes or to say it another way i was until the war came and took away the horses i work with motors now and mend things my dad didnt have the knack of that but i do do you want to see without waiting for an answer he led rutledge to one of the cottages the outer one in the half circle they formed slater dwarfed it just walking through the door and rutledge felt a spasm of claustrophobia when he went in and was asked to shut the door behind him the house was surprisingly tidy on a table under the back window an array of work was set out i dont keep such things at the forge slater was saying as he gestured shyly to the table dont want anyone walking off with them they do thinking i wont notice rutledge saw a set of hinges in wrought iron with matching knobs in the shape of a beaver and the cabinet for them on the floor next to a table leg they were beautifully done as was the butterfly hook for hanging a plant by a door and a set of fire irons shaped like deer with the basket made to look like entwined antlers it was remarkable workmanship to one side stood a lovely georgian teapot where slater was in the process of setting the handle back in place he saw rutledges glance and said proudly thats from st margarets part of the tea service and the handle had worn right off theyll never know its been repaired when i finish with it youre very good with your hands rutledge told him its fine work slater seemed to expand with the praise its a gift i was given it do you know those great stones in the beech grove farther along this road the ones they call waylands smithy it was the prehistoric tomb yes i do i slept there one night as a boy and i was given the gift even my father had to admit to it he could shoe horses and mend wagon tongues and put a latch on a barn whatever needed doing but this work slater swept his hand above the table he couldnt do it even he said as much he must have been very proud of you a rueful smile dimmed the brightness in his face he told me i was dreaming thinking the smithy had anything to do with gifts foolishness he called it what do your neighbors think of your work i dont show most people i dont know why i showed you he seemed to consider that for a moment you have a way of listening most people dont hear what i say to them its always been like that how well do you know your neighbors rutledge persisted slater shrugged i see them from time to time mr partridge stands in the dark and looks up at the white horse ive lost count of the evenings i walk by him and he never speaks im one to like walking in the dark i go to the smithy if theres moonlight but he just stands there and the ladyshes quite strange you know i think shes afraid of the dark house is shut up tight long before sunset and stays that way until full light in the morning he frowned were outcasts if you ask me thats why we live here nobody else would have us i was always the biggest in my school bigger than many of the older boys and the parents they was always protecting their little ones from me thinking id do them a harm he looked down at his hands huge and strong ive never hurt a thing not so much as a butterfly but i wasnt allowed to play with the other children and they laughed at me sometimes gullible they called me after a giant in a book i learned soon enough to stay away from them rutledge could see the hurt in the big mans face i expect they didnt understand that giants could begentle they never tried to know slater took a deep breath i didnt mean to trouble you with my life people are people rutledge said each one interesting in his or her own way good or bad mean or generous helpful or not they make up the human race you must take them as you find them because few of them ever really change ive been happy here going in to the forge when i have heavy work to do staying clear of them all when i can but its lonely all the same he studied rutledges face did you fight in france yes i did he answered the question simply wondering where it was going aye i thought as much you brought it home with you and you arent the first ive met with such a look no offense meant its there for anyone to see the army wouldnt take me i told them i was strong but they told me i wasnt up to the work i told them i could shoe the horses and keep the wagons and caissons moving but they didnt believe me he shook his head the disappointment still raw i dont read very well but whats that got to say to what i can do with my hands very little rutledge answered and turned toward the door all the same you were lucky it was not a war youd have liked what does liking have to do with it he followed rutledge out into the sunshine again and noticed when rutledge took a deep breath almost unwittingly you dont like small spaces id not sleep in the smithy if i were you he stood there on his threshold looking up at the sky ever think about the old gods slater asked the ones before we was all christians rutledge remembered a woman named maggie in westmorland who knew the viking gods in her own fashion sometimes he answered theyre still out there arent they displaced but still there waiting to come back and they will one day and catch us all off our guard that will be a day of reckoning when it comes he nodded to rutledge and went back inside shutting the door quietly walking back to his motorcar rutledge tried to see if partridges own motor was still in the shed by the house but it was impossible given the direction of the sun to judge if the light struck metal hamish said if yere here to see yon horse yeve done precious little to show an interest i thought you didnt like the horse oh aye its a wicked beast but it wasna me who told the world and his brother its the thing that brought ye here i could hardly explain that i was looking for partridge they ken you arena a daytripper wi a taste for whats cut into the chalk if ye stay anither day theyll no need to be told the truth then lets hope partridge comes home before that hamish said i dona think he will why ye ken this time they sent a policeman rutledge climbed the hill again and walked to the head of the great horse there he stood and looked across the valley there was another hill here where saint george slew the dragondragon hill as he remembered it was called one of many places where the militant saint was said to have encountered dragons rutledge recalled a page in one of his mothers books where saint george on his white horsethis onequelled the dozenheaded firebreathing beast with a single spear gilt edged and delicately painted the scene was taken from a plate in an ancient manuscript and the artist had captured the quality of the original work saint george was handsomely robed in crimson and sapphire velvet no workaday dented armor for him he turned to study the cottages nine of them it would have been more efficient if the war office had given him the names of the other residents here he had met two of them seen a third and partridge made a fourth where had the other five inhabitants been as he wandered about walking into quincys house like a welcomed guest and then into slaters he drew himself a mental map of the cottages they were set out like a horseshoe appropriate enough here four to a side and one at the top of the bend a lane ran between them cutting the horseshoe in half and from the lane paths led to each door slater lived in number on the left then partridge at number his white gate distinctive as if shutting out his neighbors quincy was the first cottage on the righthand side number on the map and the woman with the wash hanging on the line lived in number someone opened the door of number and stepped out into the sunshine shading his hand to see better as he scanned the cottages and then turned slightly to stare up at the horse even at that distance his eyes seemed to meet rutledges and he stood there not moving for a dozen seconds more then he turned his back and stepped inside shutting his door firmly behind him that accounted for five of the residents and this hadnt been a casual interest shown by a curious resident there was more to it not a challenge precisely but an acknowledgment anither watcher hamish said rutledge wouldnt have been surprised someone who knew that rutledge would be coming and while having no intention of working with him at least wanted it to be known that he was present as well the government kept an eye on certain people quietly and unobtrusively as a rule what had partridge done to excite interest knowing that might make a difference in deciding where to look for him his only choice now was to wait for dark and then search partridges cottage he could come to it by a roundabout way passing unseen hed been told this was merely a watching brief but if hamish was right and partridge wasnt coming back there could be an advantage in knowing what the man was up to rutledge left the hill of the white horse half an hour later and went back to the smiths arms where he had taken a room he found he was in time for luncheon served both in the dining room and at a handful of tables that had been set up outside with benches round them for the lorry drivers it was a rough crowd men who drove long distances for a living were often footloose by nature and had more in common with one another than with families left behind theyd cast glances in rutledges direction when he drove up and walked into the inn curious and suspicious then conversation had picked up again when he disappeared from view the innkeepers wifemrs smithgreeted him with a harried nod and went on serving tables with quick efficiency and a laugh that kept the men jolly and at arms length rutledge glimpsed mr smith the swinging doors into the nether regions showed him briefly he was the cook here not his wife rutledge wondered if their name was smith or if they enjoyed the play on words as well as their anonymity it would explain why they kept their inn for transient custom and showed no ambition to cater to a different clientele mrs smith reappeared from the kitchen with a tray for rutledge if you wont mind eating it upstairs she said apologetically theres not a table to spare for a single he took the tray and thanked her in his room he looked under the serviette that covered it and found generous sandwiches of beef and pork a pickle a small dish of tinned fruit and a glass of beer sitting by the window he ate with an appetite listening to the voices rising from the tables below someone had started a political argument and found himself shouted down by his comrades goodnaturedly calling him a fool but he stuck to his guns clearly possessed of a grievance against a proposed tax on goods shipped to france or the low countries itul put me out of business i tell you and you as well he said gruffly wait and see rumor another voice replied itul never happen see if im not right they moved away still talking and then it was quiet for a moment before lorry engines roared into life and began to roll out of the yard a bird was singing now a chat the song filling the air with brightness then a male voice called betty and mrs smith answered from the doorway almost at rutledges feet her voice was so clear if youre hungry youre out of luck that lot ate everything but the rats in the barn and the straw in the mangers that manthe one who owns the motorcar in the yard is he staying here what do you know about him only that hes from london and unlucky in love her voice was light deflecting his questions rutledge set his plate aside and stood up hoping to see who had come to the inn but the man was just out of sight i need to know betty he went on urgently are you sure hes from london i dont think he said she answered him i just assumed i dont like it is he staying hes taken a room for tonight it was a reluctant admission youre building castles in quicksand she added what would he want with the likes ofyou the mans answer was lost in the clatter of feet on the stairs and someone calling goodbye love im off to make my fortuneoh there you are thought you were in the kitchen well then the voice went on ive left what i owe on the table and you can count on me again in a fortnight anything youd like from wales wales is it ill take one of those wool shawls in a paisley pattern like the red one you brought ma right you are and a young man who looked enough like mrs smith to be her brother dashed into sight heading for the last lorry standing by a plane tree when hed gone there was no further conversation rutledge could hear mrs smith moving about below humming to herself the man who had questioned her had gone hamish said startling rutledge ye canna ask her who it was no but it wasnt quincy or slater someone else i didnt recognize the voice and theres no certainty he came from the cottages he sat down again finished his meal and then carried the tray back to the dining room it was interesting rutledge thought walking out the inn door that mrs smith asked no questions of him her pleasant nod as he passed indicated no curiosity about where he might be going or why and she had answered the man at her door with circumspection as if she were accustomed to keeping secrets he drove back toward the tomlin cottages but passed no one walking in that direction the remainder of the afternoon he spent prowling about the chalk horse while keeping a surreptitious eye on the cottages below him rutledge had the strongest feeling supported by the uneasiness of hamish that he was being watched in his turn but if partridge had come home learned of rutledges presence and then questioned mrs smith at the inn there was no sign of him here at the cottages rutledge drove some twenty miles for his dinner lingering over the meal far longer than its quality justified and it was nearly dark by the time he drove back to the inn he left the motorcar in the yard went up to his room and stretched himself on the bed when he heard the clock in the downstairs dining room strike one he got up dressed in dark clothing and quietly left the inn in his pocket he carried his torch from the companionable snores coming from the room where the smiths slept as he went down the stairs rut ledge was certain they hadnt heard him go as far as he could tell he was the only guest this night rutledge walked back to the cottages standing under a tree for some time to let his eyes adjust to the ambient light and listening to the sounds around him there were steps coming his way and he faded into the shadows where he was fairly certain he couldnt be seen andrew slater appeared farther up the road heading for his own cottage he carried something in his hands rutledge couldnt see what and disappeared through his door without any indication that he knew someone was about but as hamish was busy pointing out a man like slater often knew more than ordinary people as if to make up for his simplicity not so much a sixth sense but a knowledge that often came to such people not animal either that wariness of a fox or even a deer but something generated by the need to protect himself from those who would trick him take advantage of him or cheat him rutledge gave the smith another hour to fall asleep and then walked softly across the dewwet grass to the house with the white gate he didnt pass through it but went over the wall on the side that couldnt be seen from the other cottages the door was unlocked as quincy had told him it would be he opened it cautiously listening for sounds inside that indicated someone was there silence came back to him he went inside and began his search but there was nothing of interest in the cottage shielding his torch he looked around at the furnishingsmainly castoffs he thought though there was a chest under a window that appeared to have come from a different life it was locked he glanced at the books on the low shelf by the hearth and found that most of them were scientific although there was an odd mixture of historical materials as well renaissance italian history african exploration south american botany and a chinese herbal heavy reading for ones spare time sections marked were often macabre descriptions of the way everyone from socrates to victims of curses died the bedroom was tidy the kitchen cleared and dishes set as if by habit to drain by the sink nothing out of place an empty valise under the bed clothes still hanging in the armoire wherever partridge had taken himself he clearly intended to come back rutledge returned to the sitting room and looked at the desk there he found nothing of interest as if it were seldom used there was a single framed photograph on the desktop grainy and yellowed showing a man and a small boy standing together in what appeared to be the marketplace of a georgian town there was nothing in the shop windows to indicate which town or where in england it might be rutledge lifted the frame slid open the back and looked to see if there was any inscription on the other side of the photograph and indeed there was a schoolboy hand had scribbled the day we climbed the white horse had partridge come here as a boy was that what brought him back as a man rutledge reassembled the glass and the frame and set it where hed found it in the basket to one side of the desk however was a crumpled sheet of paper he reached for it spread it out and in the shaded light of his torch found that there was only one line on it my dear the start of a letter to a friend a lover a relative there was no way of knowing he crumpled it again and dropped it back into the basket nothing here to tell him who partridge was where he might have gone or when he intended to return certainly nothing mysterious enough to make london worry about where he was when rutledge stepped out of the cottage he nearly leapt out of his skin as something warm and sinuous wrapped itself around his legs ware hamish warned in the same instant it was all he could do to stifle a yelp even as his brain absorbed the sound of a soft purr dublin the cat he bent down to pet her and she accepted the salute but was more intent on finding her way into the house he managed to get the door shut first and as if displeased the cat stopped purring and trotted off rutledge stood there for a moment as his heart rate steadied and then made his way to the shed where partridge kept his motorcar it was still there and a bicycle stood in the deeper shadows beyond the bonnet the only unusual thing was a small length of carpet that lay crumpled by the boot a trap for unwary feet the oil stains down its length dark as blood in the little light there was explained its use wherever gaylord partridge had gone he had left on shanks mare not his bicycle or his motorcar but then he neednt have gone far to find someone to take him away for a price the lorry drivers at the smiths arms would have been willing to let him ride with them as far as he liked from there he might have gone anywhere by train or bus and come back just as inconspicuously gaylord partridges walkabouts as quincy had called them rutledge slipped out of the shed and made his way through the darkness in the deepest shadow he could find until he was well past waylands smithy where did partridge go and why he asked himself as he walked without haste listening to the night around him hamish said if he was in the war its possible he doesna remember where he goes or why at the clinic where frances had taken rutledge to learn how to deal with his own shell shock there was an officer who went away for days at a time physically present but his mind lost in some other world where his body couldnt follow lieutenant albany would sit by his window staring inward and simply not hear or see or feel anything as if the empty shell of himself waited for him there knowing that in the end he would come back to it and then quietly he did just that moving and speaking and acting as if nothing had happened incurious about the hours or days that had passed meanwhile rutledge had no way of knowing if partridge was a victim of the war nothing in his cottage indicated military service not the way hed made his bed or the clothing in his armoire but then that might have been deliberate the letter beginning my dear could mean there was someone he regularly went to see and if the government had no knowledge of that someone it could well be a woman he preferred to keep secret a rendezvous far from the war offices prying eyes a brief escape from whatever it was hed done to have people watching his every move it was distasteful to spy on a man entering his house without his knowledge looking at his personal correspondence the fact that the search hadnt yielded any useful information made matters worse no body in the bedroom to explain away partridges absence no souvenirs of brighton to point to his whereabouts no letters giving rutledge the direction of the mans family was the young woman whod knocked on partridges door a daughteror a lover which brought him back to the unseen man who had been questioning betty smith at the inn door if that was partridge himself back again and worried about the stranger hanging about in his absence hed taken off rutledge reached the inn and removing his shoes went up the stairs as silently as he could the snores from the smith bedroom rumbled in counterpoint rutledge woke to the early arrival of three more lorries and as he shaved he considered his instructions from london a watching brief waiting for partridge to come home and then reporting to the mans masters whoever they were through chief superintendent bowles how long had the man been gone three days a week it was time to find that out at breakfast he asked mrs smith who it was shed been talking with just after lunch the day before just as your brother was leaving i happened to hear the man mention my motorcar rutledge added when she frowned he seemed to know you well he called you by your first name lord have mercy half the people in and out this door know me by my christian name it was a busy day from the time i opened my eyes until i shut them again and with larry underfoot as well i was behind most of it it wasnt a man named partridge by any chance id been hoping to see him partridge no thats not likely and if it was your motorcar whoever it was had an interest in hes not the first nor will he be the last most of my regulars want to know if the king is staying here she laughed and bustled back into the kitchen leaving rutledge to his meal he drove back to the white horse and when quincy appeared to feed dublin the cat rutledge walked down to speak to him quincy saw him coming he straightened and waited while the cat ate its food without haste unconcerned by the man from london coming to stand close by its dish you do your duty by your neighbor rutledge began looking down at the scraps minced for the cat its a dumb animal it doesnt know when to expect its owner when theres no one about to feed it at least it knows it wont starve which is far from being a dumb animal rutledge observed how long has dublins owner been away this time how should i know im not his keeper would any of his other neighbors be able to tell me i feed the cat not them what happens if you arent here by the time your neighbor returns from his walkabout surely the woman up the way would take pity on dublin why quincy shrugged im not likely to be going anywhere i leave the walkabouts to partridge partridge an odd name what part of the country did he say he came from he didnt and its no odder than quincy he retorted why is it youre really here not the horse yonder does it matter it does because every one of us in these cottages is afraid of something and partridge was always afraid of strangers what frightens you rutledge asked curious my dreams quincy retorted and went back inside his cottage later in the day rutledge drove to london his mood was mixed frustration warring with duty hamish said have ye no thought yere a red herring rutledge was beginning to believe that might be true he found chief superintendent bowles in his office finishing a report bowles looked up as he entered frowned and said what brings you back so soon theres nothing to be gained by staying where i was i was beginning to arouse suspicion and if im not mistaken theres a watcher there already partridges motor is in the shed his bicycle as well hes not in the house ill or dead and with lorries passing through at all hours of the day and night he has ample opportunity to disappear wherever he pleases unless im given more resources theres nothing more to be done hat same morning as rutledge was questioning mrs smith they wont like it at the war office bowless voice was thoughtful but ill tell them all the same about the man hed heard from his window alice crowell sat down to write a letter to her father he hadnt approved of her husbands declining to fight in the war but felt that albert crowells duty driving an ambulance had in some measure made up for it it took considerable courage to pull men out of shell holes under fire and dress the wounds of men lying helpless in no mans land the germans had no compunction about shooting ambulance men and crowell had distinguished himself several times even shooting at a diving plane with a borrowed rifle and hitting it before it could fire on his vehicle and so she began her letter with dearest papa she went on to tell him that her husband was being persecuted by the police inspector in elthorpe and unfairly so since he had had nothing to do with the dead man in the fountains abbey ruins but she wisely omitted any reference to the book found at the mans feet ending the letter with a plea for her fathers help she added what disturbs me is that the intense scrutiny hes given albert may have its roots in inspector madsens previous relationship with me and i darent remind him of that for fear it will only make matters worse she sealed the letter posted it and told no one her father colonel of an east anglian regiment went directly to london and presented the letter to a friend at the war office he didnt know the chief constable of yorkshire well enough to approach him but he rather thought that martin deloran might the matter might have languished in limbo but for the fact that colonel ingle and the man he met with had both been at sandhurst he had come prepared to argue it wasnt necessary for one sentence in the letter seemed to leap off the page startling deloran the poor man was wearing a respirator which causes the police to think his death might have something to do with the war but if albert couldnt shoot the hun how could he kill a man he swears he has never seen before the man behind the desk fingered the sheet of paper for a moment and then choosing his words with care said interesting story yes well consider it done but id rather you didnt tell your daughter that youve brought the letter to me better to let her believe help arrived before you could act in the matter sensibilities of the local police and all that this needs to be sorted quietlyif shes to continue living in yorkshire that is and i know just the man to look into matters colonel ingle was no fool thanks very much martin he waited to see if more information might be forthcoming ill be on my way then anything for an old friend deloran assured him but colonel ingle knew that friendship had nothing to do with martin deloran taking on this matter with such speed he was jumping in for reasons of his own deloran got to his feet what do you say to a spot of lunch while youre in london sometime later rutledge was summoned to bowless office and he found his superintendent in a dark mood bloody army they think we have nothing better to do than run their errands for them youre wanted in yorkshire now i asked if it was the same business and they declined to tell me bloody cooks tour if you want my view of the matter give me whats on your desk and ill see that its dealt with what is it in yorkshire that im supposed to be investigating theres a dead man found in fountains abbey of all places the police are harassing a local schoolmaster over it youre to deal with it the chief constable has requested you by name but he let it be known the request came from higherups little enough to go ona dead man in an abbey bowles considered him getting a reputation for yourself are you rutledge laughed without humor my sergeant used to tell me that once the army gets you in its clutches youre never free again thats as may be bowles answered but see that you do better with this matter than you did in berkshire it was tricky telling the war office youd failed to find their precious lost sheep walking out of the building rutledge found himself already tying the two cases together he wasnt sure why except that each request had come from the army and if gaylord partridge was still missing someone was scouring the countryside for bodies it was a long drive to yorkshire and rutledge broke the journey in lincoln staying in the shadow of the great cathedral there after a late dinner at the hotel he walked through the gate into the precincts to view the magnificent west front it was quiet shadows giving the carvings depth and reality and he stayed for some time letting the peace wash over him it was rare that he had time to dwell on something other than murder just as in the war death pursued him as a policeman as well it was his chosen profession but he found himself thinking that the men who had built such splendor had left a greater legacy than most names long since forgotten they lived on in what their hands had wrought not guns or tanks or deadly gas but in stone defining the human spirits capacity to create rather than destroy hamish good covenanter that he was preferred unadorned simplicity rutledge said to him his voice echoing against the towering west front ah but is man better off without something to stir him and lift him and carry him through the darkness hamish responded the deep scots voice trapped in the narrow space between rutledge and the massive gate it didna serve you well in the trenches no more than plainness served me where was your god or mine then it was unanswerable rutledge turned and walked back to his hotel the moment broken the next morning he drove on to elthorpe his mind already busy with what he could expect to find no one had given him either a description or a photograph of gay lord partridge and he wasnt certain what it was he was supposed to achieve when he arrived but accustomed to the mysterious workings of the army he wasnt surprised he came into elthorpe after lunch when the streets were relatively quiet and the april sun had vanished behind clouds yorkshires landscape was variedthe rolling dales of the north riding a long shoreline to the east and very fertile land along the rivers that flowed through the west riding it was small wonder that medieval monks established so many houses here building abbeys by the handful their ruins dramatic and quite beautiful were reminders of a distant past for someone who loved architecture it was a feast for the mind and the eye fountains stood on the plateau west of the city of york and it was still sheep country though on a smaller scale feeding the looms and the mills nearer the coal deposits elthorpe small and tidy stood upright in the sun as if absorbing as much of its warmth into stone walls as the waning afternoon permitted a wind had come up promising a cool night but the few people on the streets still wore only sweaters or coats against the chill rutledge found a hotel close by the church though its name the castle arms was far too elegant for what was on offera comfortable lobby a lounge beyond an arch and a desk manned by a very attractive woman about his own age she smiled at him in a way that offered no familiarity merely an acknowledgment that he was custom newly arrived im looking for a room for several nights he said and she nodded her eyes flicking to the book in front of her theres number ten which should suit you would you care to see it mr she paused waiting for him to give her his name rutledge he replied pleasantly from london thank you number ten will be fine she nodded and wrote his name in the hotel register then handed him an ornate key on a knob that wouldnt fit comfortably into a pocket embossed on the end of the knob was a brass inlay of the great tower at richmond castle behind her on a board were similar keys and a quick glance showed him that there were three other guests at present shall i help you carry your luggage up the stairs she asked but it was perfunctory and she made no move to come round the desk i should manage very well thank you he went back to his motorcar smiling to himself the people of yorkshire were not unfriendly but their reserve was legendary a man he thought might live here forty years before he was accepted in the inner circle and perhaps not then if there was any suspicion that he might not be deserving of it two men some twenty yards from him were talking together and rutledge found himself listening to the local dialect the english had such a variety of voices and his in this place stood out as foreign a stranger he wondered how he would be received by inspector madsen oddly enough it was with relief madsen rose from behind his desk to shake hands his face tired and his eyes troubled he launched into a brief report on the murder as if he had rehearsed it a dozen times that morning weve got nowhere in this business the schoolmaster is involved but we dont know howor why its his book there at the dead mans feet he said the book was dew damp but hadnt been there any longer than the body judging by its condition he reached behind him for a book lying on a shelf and passed it to rutledge alchemy madsen went on nonsense if there ever was one but weve looked through the book with care and theres nothing to say it isnt what it appears to bea book wildly out of place but if the schoolmaster crowell brought it to the meeting why and why leave it where it was found does it say something about the dead man that we dont understand whats in the blasted book that took it to a scene of violence rutledge opened the book and thumbed through it a history of alchemy the philosophers stone the centuriesold search for a way to turn lead or other base metals into gold a good many famous men had dabbled in alchemy a good many more had used it to cheat unsuspecting people out of their money hed heard a professor say that it was merely a forerunner early attempts to explain chemistry but there had been an overtone of other interests in the study of this quasisciencea search for the elixir of life and for spells that forced the spirits of evil to obey commands and serve the alchemist it had sometimes been called heresy and commerce with the devil and even witchcraft he scanned several of the purported incantations that had come down through the years and they were laughable the garish illustrations next to several of them showed someone very like roger bacon standing in a cavelike room smoke circling his head the fire at his back roaring up the chimney and an array of vessels spread out on the table before him hamish who had been silent for some time startled him by speaking so normally that he was sure the man across the desk heard the words yon man in the drawing is wearing a robe roger bacon had been a monk and his robe was very much like the description madsen had just given rutledge of the cloak the dead man had been wrapped in so perhaps there was a connection though not the most obvious one not meddling with spirits but with something else and still no word on the identity of the dead man none if hed dropped out of the sky wed have been no wiser rutledge said id like to see the victim for myself madsen considered him for a moment and then said hes at the doctors surgery and the cloak the respirator there as well they walked down the street to the doctors surgery and were admitted by a nurse who looked to be close to forty trim and dark haired madsen asked to see the murder victim and was shown into the room where the body was being kept until the police were finished with it madsen nodded to the woman and she left them rutledge raised the sheet over the body the man looked to be of good height his shoulders broad and well muscled rutledge took a moment to look at his hands not those of a laborerno calluses in the palms the nails clean and well shaped the face was not one that would stand out the man could walk down any london street or one in manchester and never attract attention his hair was a light brown showing gray strands throughout fortyfive fifty it was hard to tell there were lines in his face that death hadnt smoothed away as if he had been ill or aged before his time what about his clothing good quality theyre in the box there that matched the condition of the mans hands london labels see for yourself rutledge squatted to examine the contents of the box madsen was right the clothes were of good quality but had seen a great deal of use as if the dead man had fallen on hard times or lost interest in what he wore even the shoes had seen hard use anything in the pockets nothing not so much as a handkerchief rutledge stood up id like to see the cloak and the respirator the cloak was of fine wool well made with a hood rutledge fingered it felt the weight of it and the thickness unlike the clothes it appeared to be almost new because it wasnt something that might be worn every day hamish said an actor then but no smudges of grease paint or powder marked the neckline or the edges of the hood the gas mask was a small box respirator standard equipment during the war no one had felt safe once the germans had used poison gas in the field but the tab underneath the chin was missing leaving a small tear and making the mask useless it wasnt uncommon for the tab to come off and there was no way to tell how long ago or how recently it had happened the question was why had anyone gone to the trouble of putting the respirator over the face a mockery of the manner of death or to make the death seem more macabre there were no scars no indication of a surgery no identifying marks on the body no irregularities in the teeth the doctor says not once this man was buried there would be nothing to show he had lived nothing to identify him in a report nothing to hand in evidence to witnesses or suspects nothing to set him apart if someday someone came looking for him anonymous which explained why the man wasnt known in this part of yorkshire he wasnt meant to be identified a mystery an unclaimed body a nine days wonder buried and soon forgotten rutledge said is there someone herein elthorpewho could make a drawing of his face a drawing madsen was caught off guard busy with his own thoughts as rutledge went through the box if were to locate someone who knows the victim we need something to be going on with why not a photograph because it will show that hes dead people might be more willing to talk to us about a missing person no one wanted to be drawn into a murder inquiry it was a stigma something that happened to other less savory classes and rutledge had a feeling that this man had had secrets otherwise why should he wind up dead like a buffoon wearing a respirator and a monks cloak a long way from home why not simply leave the body in a ditch or throw it into a lake or shove it off a cliff madsen was saying benson hes one of the employees at the castle arms he did a penandink sketch of my house for my wifes birthday mrs madsen was quite taken with it thats where im staying well speak to him now madsen went with rutledge back to the hotel where miss norton at reception told them they would find mr benson in the kitchen discussing menus with the cook rutledge waited in the small sitting room while inspector madsen went in search of the artist he was a short thin man with the carriage of a soldier sketch the face of a dead man he stared from one policeman to the other iveim not really good with faces why not take a photograph yes id considered that rutledge told him but i think a sketch might serve us better it doesnt make an issue of the fact that were trying to identify a corpse benson wiped a hand across his mouth im not sure i can do this ive seen enough dead men to last a lifetime yes i can sympathize rutledge responded all we ask is that you give it a try madsen added hes not unpleasant to view dead yes but not ermarked in any way in the end benson collected a pad and his box of charcoal sticks and went with them across to the doctors surgery rutledge was already regretting his request bensons face was pale and strained as they waited for the doctor he said im sorry but the doctor was coming out of his consultation room nodding to madsen and shaking hands with rutledge five minutes later benson was sitting on a high stool looking down at the body of the man no one knew he sketched quickly using the charcoal with deft strokes creating the shape of the head the placement of the ears the dark hair springing from a high forehead and then he began to put in the features the eyes first getting them right before tackling the straight nose and a surprisingly mobile mouth at one point he looked up at rutledge his face set as if his mind had withdrawn to somewhere safe ii cant see the color of his eyes blue the doctor told him from where he stood by the wall watching theyre a pale blue benson nodded and kept working he took his time and when hed finished the likeness was so fine that he forgot where he was for a moment and studied the dead face on the pillow its firstrate isnt it he asked ive got it right there was surprise and satisfaction in the words rutledge thought hes captured something i hadnt seena subtle sense of the person whose face it was a man with such talent oughtnt be running a hotel dining room and an instant later benson came back to the present where he was and what hed been doing he looked as if he might be sick on the spot he hastily passed the sheet of drawing paper to rutledge before hurrying out of the room his footsteps beating a rapid tattoo as he ran down the passage rutledge caught up with benson just outside the surgery door where he was standing in the cool air his face lifted to the watery sun rutledge said briskly thanks sounds insufficient ill make your excuses to miss norton while you take your time getting back to work madsen was behind him holding out the pencil box and pad of artists paper but benson said his voice rough im all right dont fuss he took his things and walked away toward the hotel halfway there he turned to ask hes the man from the abbey yes pity and he walked on madsen said quietly he went through a rough patch on the somme hamish said he wasna one of your men and rutledge answered silently he could have been he nodded to madsen and followed benson back to the hotel he was nowhere in sight when rutledge stepped through the door miss norton stopped him would you care for some tea mr rut ledge you look tiredi dont know worried perhaps he said not knowing how to answer it was a long drive from london thats not the kind of tired i meant were you in the war yes yes she repeated i thought perhaps that was it ifjulian had come home i think he would have looked the same haunted by what hed done and seen he sometimes wrote about his life in the trenches not the whole truth im certain of that but enough i think to warn me not to expect him to be quite the same when i look at mark benson i wonder your brother he hazarded in an effort to redirect the conversation my fiance he died at ypres lingered in hospital for a week and died gassed he was albert crowells brother they were so close the schoolmaster yes poor man inspector madsen is certain hes done murder thats what alice wrote to me yesterday the gossips havent picked up the news yet but they will and you what do you think she sighed i dont think he could kill i mean julian once said that albert is not made up like most men he should be a quaker theyre an odd lot quakers theres an iron strength to them a coldness i think sometimes they must be hard people to stand aside and watch is that how you see albert crowell rutledge asked with interest she shook her head confused i dont know he forgave the man who scarred his wifes face it was a terrible ordeal for her i dont think i could have done that my own suffering yes but not someone elses i hadnt heard the story how did it happen they were at whitby on holiday she went out alone a little while after tea to shop for alberts birthday gift there was a man near the corner hed been drinking and was flinging his arms about shouting he was angry or upset i dont know and he shoved her out of his path she fell against a wroughtiron railing cutting her face badly passersby rushed to help her and two men held on to her assailant the police came and took him up for public drunkenness he was quite sober by that time crying and apologizing but it was too late wasnt it the damage had been done she was taken to hospital bleeding profusely and the doctors feared for her eye they took her directly to surgery and sent someone to find her husband albert called it an accident of course it was but if the man hadnt been drinkingif hed been in his right senses rather than looking for troublenothing would have happened to alice and albert forgave him you say in public or private both he was she stopped horrified you arent thinking this man they found deadit couldnt have been the one in whitby could it is that why inspector madsen has gone back to dilby so many times rutledge answered early days yet but ill take the sketch to mrs crowell and ask her she wont have forgotten what he looked like but that will just bring it all back again did you see the man could you identify him instead i wasnt engaged to julian then i knew about the incident of course it happened just before the war early july i think julian and i werent engaged until august it wasnti wasnt involved ask albert hell be able to tell you hes already told the police that he cant identify the dead man i have no choice you see but to speak to mrs crowell she came out from behind the desk her face set im going with you inspector let me find someone to mind the desk while im gone no i think it best it isnt a question of what you think inspector i wont have alice upset about this business im coming to be certain she isnt a woman ought to be there with her ten minutes later miss norton climbed into rutledges motorcar and settled herself the quickest way is as the crow flies of course but as we arent crows she began to direct him out of elthorpe then around the skirts of the estate on whose grounds the great abbey ruins took pride of place and down an unmade road that wandered for several miles before dividing the right branch continued to the west while the left turned more to the south to your right miss norton said its only another mile or two they soon came into a small village clinging to the road theres the school she said alice should be upstairs alone i hope he passed the row of shops a tiny lending library a church more the size of a chapel and came to a house a little larger than the others hed passed the front faade softened by stonework around the windows and above the door it was a prosperous merchants home miss norton was saying her nervousness showing in the tenseness of her voice and left to the village some sixty years ago to be used as a school i wish id never mentioned alice she went on how did you trick me into saying anything about her it wasnt a trick he replied drawing up in front of the school you were telling me about your fiance julian yes and somehow he got down and went around to her door as she added you wont tell inspector madsen about this foolishness will you hes already brought albert in for questioning four times now it will only make him more anxious to prove something if mrs crowell identifies this man from the sketch then ive no choice oh blast the sketch she said furiously slamming her door behind her i wish id never seen you she marched ahead of him back ramrod straight her face closed she went directly into the school leaving him to follow or not as he pleased there was a central hall with stairs leading up to the first floor the building was quiet the students gone home at the end of the day the sign over the nearest door read school office miss norton passed it by and was already halfway up the stairs an echo of voices a childs and a womans reached them disappearing down the passage ahead of them alice miss norton called yes mary is that you mrs crowell turned to stare what on earth brings you here at this time of day whos minding the hotel i asked velma to step in for me as they came closer mary norton indicated the man behind her alicethis is inspector rutledge from london scotland yard her words seemed to fill the passage floating ahead of her echoing behind her to his surprise as he caught up with the two women mrs crowell turned warmly to him extending her hand he took it as she said how nice of you to come as if shed been expecting him a classroom door opened farther down the passage and a head popped out vanishing again just as quickly rutledge glimpsed a pale startled boys face then it was gone he followed the two women into a tidy office and mrs crowell shut her door im so glad you came to see me first she went on speaking directly to rutledge because its important to know the facts behind my concerns there is a history of sorts between my husband and inspector madsen she was intense earnest as if she had rehearsed the manner of her presentation many times over this may well explain why hes so anxious to prove that my husband is guilty of murder but he isnttruly he isnt i can think of no reason in this world why he should kill a stranger i cant explain how my husbands book got to the ruins either but if you think about it is it likely that hed take such a silly thing with him if he were intent on murder rutledge could see the scar clearly now running across her face from the corner of her left eye to the line of her jaw on the right near her ear it had healed smoothly without pulling at the flesh around it but it was still ugly marring the rather classical features of straight nose square jaw and wellset gray eyes she had not been strictly beautiful but was certainly a very attractive woman before the wound he couldnt tell if she was still selfconscious about it or had grown used to it hamish said she doesna look in the mirror verra often before rutledge could answer mrs crowell mary norton said quickly hes brought a sketch to show you my dear will you look at it and tell me if you recognize this man the dead man alice crowell paused as she was about to take her chair behind the desk but she faltered whyi mean why should i wish to see it becausewell to assure the police that albert is telling the truth when he says he never saw this person before marys words were hurried as if to break the worst news quickly and avoid any mention of the man who had scarred mrs crowells face oh very well alice reluctantly held out her hand for the folder that rutledge was carrying he isnti shant have nightmares shall i she asked as he passed the folder to her its merely a mans face nothing more frightening than that as the two bent over the sketch hed brought marys dark head close to alices fair one rutledge wondered how he would have felt about someone who did such injury to jean or to frances for that matter if he could have forgiven the drunken man with such apparent grace or perhaps crowell had seen the change in his wifes appearance as a way of keeping her here in this small dingy school when it was clear that she wasnt from this part of the country her accent like rutledges own spoke of good schooling and a wider circle righteous men he thought often feel the need to serve in the most forbidding places he watched mrs crowells expression as she examined the sketch but all he could read there was puzzlement i dont think hes anyone i know she said doubtfully still bending over the drawing should i recognize him it was important to ask on the off chance you did rutledge told her mary norton bit her lip he could almost read the thought in her eyes better with you here than with inspector madsen finish it now before he could stop her she said think back alice to whitby could this be the man who knocked you down and hurt you you told me once youd never forget his face mary spoke urgently trying to protect and going the wrong way about it could it be he oh my god alice crowell said softly her shock apparent even to rutledge do you think but no it couldnt have been this man i know his name henry shoreham that was the mans name mary norton said triumphantly to rutledge its not the man and then to alice she went on be quite sure and we neednt speak of it again to inspector madsen or albert or anyone else ever it was almost as if mary nortons anxiety sent the wrong message to mrs crowell twisting her promise into a warning rutledge leaned forward and took miss norton by the arm let mrs crowell take her time and look at the drawing in her own fashion he said gently drawing her out from behind the desk to one of the chairs in front of it dont put words into her mouth but im not mary norton protested he cut off her indignation please give her time to think mary norton sat down body stiff and still resisting alice crowell looked from one of them to the other are you saying you believe this was henry shoreham i cant believe it is it just doesnt look there was a tap at the door and one of the schoolboys stuck his head in mrs crowell she straightened up yes hugh what do you want i have visitors oh sorry mrs crowell its johnnie hes been sick mrs crowell all over the floor his face was tight with worry can i take him home then weve almost finished cleaning the desksplease can i go ill be there shortly hugh hell not make it its all i could do to keep him from being sick in the passage hes at the door now waiting for me yes very well alice crowell said impatiently but ill speak with you both tomorrow is that understood yes mrs crowell thank you mrs crowell and he was gone shutting the door quickly behind him mary norton had risen again to look out the window should you see to them alice theres a boy out there doubled up he doesnt look as if hell make it home but alice crowell was saying theres been a rash of suspicious sickness among that lot one of the younger boys is at home and hasnt come to school this week his mother thinks hes malingering but hes in bed crying and begging her to look at his tongue his brother was sick two days ago and now johnnie she turned back to the sketch but the uncertainty of a moment ago was gone this isnt the man he was larger for one thing and i remember his chin it had a cleft in it i remember that very well she shivered and turned away from the desk he bent over me and that was all i could see and his breath theres no cleft here mary norton began looking across at rut ledge are you satisfied now rutledge ignored her please take your time mrs crowell we need to be certain she shook her head no i will swear to it thank god mary norton said her breath catching you dont know how worried mrs crowell was considering rutledge youve only come because of the sketch to see if id remember the face because of henry shoreham but i thoughti thought mary said youd come from london she seemed to be waiting for him to say something to confirm that something else had brought him here i was sent from london to look into the matter here rutledge replied choosing his words it was only after id spoken to miss norton that i felt it was important to ask you if you knew this man i see her gaze went back to mary norton why on earth were you telling him about that mary how could it have come up i dont remember she said her face flushing mr rutledge spoke to me after mark benson sketched the man and i was saying something about the war somehow and then julian and somehow the conversation came round to you rutledge stepped in im sorry mrs crowell but its essential to look at all the possibilities even the farfetched ones do you know by chance what this man shoreham did for a living he was a clerk in a bank as i remember hed been passed over for a promotion he claimed the door opened and a young man stepped in his eyes going straight to his wife am i missing something she quickly got herself in hand and said this is mr rutledge from scotland yard hes come to look into what happened in the abbey he asked me to look at a sketch of the dead man that a mr benson made for him but i dont know himthe victim that wasnt very pleasant for you my dear crowell said then turned to rutledge offering his hand you should have spoken to me first before disturbing my wife would you have preferred that i take her into elthorpe to see this man for herself doubting my word it was a challenge no verifying it so that the police can get on with this case weve lost enough time chasing wild geese in the wrong direction i see he moved around the desk to look at the sketch mrs crow ell was still holding this is well done a good likeness but no more familiar than the man himself was when i first saw him then i neednt trouble you further rutledge replied taking the measure of crowell irritated and sensitive from his previous encounters with madsen if he was any judge and this wasnt the time to press thank you mrs crowell i am grateful for your help he turned to go mary looked at him something in her expression that warned him what to do next miss norton ive kept you long enough ill be happy to take you back to the hotel she appeared reluctant saying at first i really should stay but alice crowell broke in nonsense mr dunn wont care to have you away too long go with mr rutledge mary ill see you at the weekend mary went to the door with rutledge albert he said dont worry ill sit with her for a bit and then she was in the corridor with rutledge casting him a grateful glance outside rutledge looked up and down the street but there was no sign of hugh and his classmate when they were back in the motorcar rutledge asked what were you afraid of does crowell have a temper no not a temper hesometimes i just feel as if it would be better if he did explode into anger hes soso controlled i dont know why alice fell in love with him and not julian its not a matter for the head but for the heart he replied turning the motorcar to go back the way hed come out of the corner of his eye he saw something among the trees in the churchyard the boys who had asked permission to leave while he was interviewing mrs crowell he pulled the motorcar to the verge and said to miss norton ill just be a moment he walked briskly across the churchyard and the two boys who had ducked behind the apse of the chapel turned wideeyed as he came round the corner there was no time to run and nowhere to run to they stood their ground of necessity the other boy the one hugh claimed was sick looked it his face pale and his eyes red even hugh was drawn and wretched his gaze dropping to his shoes after that one wild glance at rutledge we couldnt make it home hugh said finally you can see hes been sick all down his front i was worried rutledge said can i offer you a lift oh no the other boyjohnnie was itbegan hugh said quickly if hes quiet a bit hell be all right rutledge considered them if youre sure yes sir it was a fervent chorus he turned to leave then stopped what do you know of this business the police have been speaking to your schoolmaster about children heard their elders talk and were sometimes better at putting two and two together than adults but hughs reaction was unexpected like a cornered animal he backed against the stone wall of the chapel and seemed to have lost his tongue johnnie was sick again dry heaves jerking his body rutledge waited until the worst had passed then handed him a handkerchief hamish said ye can see hes in no case to answer ye johnnie looking as if he wanted nothing more than his bed at home leaned against the nearest tombstone rutledge persisted speaking mainly to hugh but keeping his eye on johnnie did you see something the night when someone was killed near elthorpe did you see mr crowell leave the school where he was working that evening and go to meet someone hugh took a deep breath we were home in bed werent we johnnie there was nothing for us to see it was the truth even hamish could read that in the boys fervent manner and yet it wasnt the whole truth who did you see leave the village rutledge persisted nobody they exclaimed loudly in unison you neednt be afraid if theres something you want to tell me ill see that no harm comes to you the boys stood there hangdog but refusing to budge hamish said ye havena found the key rutledge changed direction do you like mr crowell is he a good master they nodded vigorously reassuring him proving that they had no reason to step forward no reason to be afraid is there anyone else at the school other than the crowells hed seen no one but that might be the rub if not mr crowell theres old fred he cleans hugh said as if offering up a sacrifice to hungry gods we had two other masters but they were killed in the war mr crowell has had to manage on his own since he came back and mrs crowell does she walk at night without her husband i never saw her hugh maintained and the ring of truth this time was clear unequivocal what would she be going about at night alone for johnnie no sir never you can ask anybody rutledge gave it up youre sure i cant see you home johnnie do you have far to walk not far he gripped his stomach with both arms wrapped around his body please can we go now yes be on your way rutledge watched them scurry away like mice frantic to escape the claws of a cat mary norton was looking after them also as he reached the motorcar and stopped to turn the crank i think youve put the fear of god into those two was it really necessary i think theyve put the fear of god into themselves and id like to know why then youre still harassing albert crowell she said making it a statement and not a question im trying to get at the truth he answered her as he closed the door on his side of the motorcar and let in the gear im not here to badger anyone thats what people always say but the police have made a good job of upsetting albert and his wife he wanted to tell her that she herself had caused alice crowell anxiety in her earnest and misguided effort to prove that the dead man wasnt shoreham the problem is that the only piece of evidence we have points to crowell and once i find out why it does it may serve instead to clear his name the sooner the better then before hes lost his job and his reputation have you policemen thought of that no i expect not hes the fox and youre the hounds and there wont be any peace for him until you lot have caught him she sighed and said nothing more for the rest of the journey after dropping mary norton at the hotel rutledge went back to the police station intending to report to madsen but the inspector had left he was told by an elderly constable hed missed his luncheon not knowing when youd return rutledge thanked the constable and walked back to the hotel hamish said as rutledge closed the door to his room was it a lie that the man in the sketch wasna the one who scarred the schoolmasters wife i dont think she lied but i think shes tried to forget his face and has partly succeeded ill ask gibson at the yard to track down shore ham but if thats who the dead man is why meet him at the ruins take him away and kill him then bring him back and what does a book of alchemy have to do with revenge a lure rutledge put the sketch in his valise and then on second thought pulled it out again to keep with him after a brief half hour given over to his lunch he left almost at once intending to visit the abbey he approached the abbey through a quiet parkland that led him to a stream crossed by stepping stones and soon he was there in front of the great arched ruin soaring into the gray sky hamish said there are abbey ruins in scotland burned by the borderers who came for revenge im not sure these werent destroyed for revenge rutledge said looking up at the elegance of simplicity in design the abbeys were wealthy and wealth henry viii envied the monks had built well here something of what theyd done had survived henry viii by three centuries and more the king had destroyed the abbey and what it stood for but not the memory of its beauty or its greatness a strange place rutledge thought to leave a dead man why here he went through into the nave his footsteps alternately echoing on stone and whispering on the grass the cloister was open to the sky constructed for contemplation and peace where monks could walk or sit in the noonday sun or pray in private he found the wax drippings from a candle then the crushed grass where the victim had lain but too many other feet had come and gone here there was nothing to tell him about the dead man or who had been here with him he turned to look at the stone surrounding him at the curve of an arch and the delicacy of a wall why here why meet here this was private property the chance of being discovered at any moment was a risk that had had to be considered or did it appear safe because it was private and therefore there was nothing to fear he heard a dog bark outside the church and a voice call is anyone there rutledge turned to walk back the way hed come stepping out of the nave to be greeted by a sleek irish setter sniffing suspiciously at his heels the man standing some fifty feet away stared at him inspector rutledge scotland yard he said easily ignoring the dog were you the man who found the body i was and you are the undergardener hadley did you notice anything the police might have missed mr hadley no did you look at the mans face under the respirator i could see he was dead there were flies about i went directly for the police you didnt look at the book lying beside the body it wasnt beside it it lay at his feet open or closed open like a tent not where the man might have been holding it no could you or your dog tell how the man had come this far or how the killer might have left by the time id thought of that the police had come and gone there was a muddle of scents if you think of anything that might be useful however insignificant it might seem to you will you contact inspector madsen at once im not likely to remember anything more the dog stood here barking as he did at you and when no one came out of the ruin i went to see what he was on about i wondered just now if there might be another dead man in there it was a grudging admission theres a sketch of the dead man in my motorcar will you come and look at it i neednt see it i was here when they first took off the mask did you recognize him or had you seen him before he was a stranger but the family might have known him its not likely theyd know a murdered man murder didnt happen in nice circles hamish said hes no concerned with the dead now its no a part of his duties it was true rutledge thanked the man waited until hed called off the still sniffing dog and then walked back the way hed come rutledge realized driving back to elthorpe that what hed been sent north to do was to put a name to the victim and that didnt appear to be a simple matter but he could see he thought what the army was aboutsearching out unidentified bodies in the expectation that one of them might be gaylord partridge because the man still hadnt returned to the cottages in berkshire or london would have recalled the yards emissary by now why did they think partridge might be dead did he have other enemies or was it that the army didnt want to step forward and publicly claim the mans body if rutledge identified him in the course of a murder investigation there would be no connection with officialdom it was possible that partridges earlier forays had been made to prepare an escape route so to speak away from his watchers and this time unlike before he had no intention of coming back and instead of going missing and causing an uproar hed died and inconvenienced everyone rutledge was tempted to take the sketch to show at the tomlin cottages to see what quincy and slater and the others might say about it but early days for that now he found hed driven back to dilby where the schoolmaster lived hamish said it willna be useful and yet rutledge left his car by the church and walked through the village getting a sense of it hed seen much of england over the years both as a policeman and as an ordinary visitor wherever he had traveled hed found a sense of placea shared history a shared background but this little spot on the map seemed to have none of that no sense of the past in the square buildings with their slate roofs gray in the cloudy light no sense of history no armies marching through the churchyard no roman ruin under the bakers shop no medieval tithe barn on the fringe of the village the abbey must have wielded some influence hereif not fountains then one of the others ripon perhaps what had the monks run here sheep or even cattle or was this tilled land beyond the village where he could see green and heavily grassed pastures there must have been good grazing from the earliest days surely the inhabitants of dilby had been tenants of the abbeys not monks laymen or even lay brothers earning their keep and owning nothing until the dissolution of the monasteries by henry viii had left them masterless and destitute scraping out a living where they could or falling under the sway of whatever lordling had coveted these acres he had come to the end of the village now and turned to walk back hamish said its no a place of comfort rutledge was about to answer him when he saw a face in an upper story window staring down at him a young boys face so terrified that he seemed to be on the verge of crying glimpsed for only a moment then gone as if rutledge had imagined it it wasnt hugh or his friend johnnie he was certain of that what did these children know what were they so frightened of rutledge walked on an unhurried pace that took him back to his motorcar nodding to men he passed on the street touching his hat to the women no one stopped him to ask his business they already knew the blankness in their eyes as they acknowledged his greeting covered something else an unwillingness to be a part of what was happening how long could the schoolmaster go on living here if the cloud of suspicion wasnt lifted and soon he would be sent packing no longer the proper person to form young minds miss norton was right about that rutledge drove back to elthorpe in a bleak mood as if the village had left its mark on him on the outskirts lines from the poetry of o a manning seemed to express what he felt about dilby it had been written about a shell gutted village in france empty of people empty of beauty empty of hope there is something cold and lost here as if the people died long ago no one left to mourn them or tell me why my footsteps echo on what was the street a rose blooms in a corner where no one sees the beauty that it offers to the dead i thought to pluck it and take it away but it belongs here a memorial to them no birds sing in the ruined trees no fowl scratch in unweeded kitchen gardens no childs laughter answers a mothers voice theres only the wind searching for something to touch and passing through unhindered a fleeting memory came to himalice crowells welcome as if she had been expecting him and yet as far as he knew there was no reason why she should the next morning found rutledge back at the dilby school encountering a surprised albert crowell in the passage just as he came out of a classroom rutledge had brought the sketch of the dead man back with him inspector what can i do for you crowell asked id like a word with your wife if shes here there was a wary expression in his eyes now in regard to what crowell asked bluntly im afraid thats police business at the moment crowell gave some thought to the request and then said shes in the small room we call the library four doors down and to your left thanks rutledge walked on feeling the mans gaze following him as he counted doors and stopped to knock lightly on the fourth a womans voice called come in but whoever it was alice crowell was expecting it wasnt rutledge this time surprise crossed her face and she bit her lip before saying you havent come to arrest my husband have you please tell me you havent not at all i didnt intend to alarm you he said easily coming into the room and shutting the door as if hamish knew now what he was about to do the voice in his head seemed to swell into angry remonstrance no here it isna wise what if yon schoolmaster is guilty he ignored it as best he could there were handmade bookshelves around the walls most of them half full the titles ranged from simple childrens works to more serious books on history and geography and biography he recognized a tattered copy of wordsworth and another of browning among the poetry selections a meager library but for this small place it must seem handsome mrs crowell gestured to a chair across from the one where she was sitting it was an intimate arrangement in the center of the room two chairs and a scattering of benches for the children a woven carpet covered the floor and there was a fireplace in one wall its here we read to the children at the end of the day she said they may never have access to such books after theyve left us sadly most of them are destined to work on the farms for their fathers or their uncles but on the other hand theyve known that since they were old enough to understand anything and they take it as a natural course of events it must seem to you a waste at times with a particularly bright student education is never wasted but yes weve taught a few who might have gone on to university we encourage them of course we do but who will work the farm while theyre away and what will happen to that farm if the son of the house comes to prefer london or ipswich or canterbury to dilby do you have children inspector do you expect them to be policemen he could see that she was avoiding asking him what had brought him to her sadly im not married he told her but if i had a son id hope he chose the career most suited to him he found himself remembering a small boy in scotland named for him but not his son did the war reach as far as dilby he went on quickly before the memory took hold oh yes she replied with sadness in her voice we paid a high price here considering our numbers most of our men wanted to serve together and so they were killed together as well a good many of our children were orphaned its been very hard for them and albert lost his brother julian but mary has told you about him hasnt she im sure she has your husband was in the war i understand the wariness crept back into her eyes yes we didnt disparage the men who drove ambulances he said they were very brave to go where they were needed most and they were caring in the worst of the fighting they were often the last touch of england that many dying men knew a smile brightened her face thank you she said softly as if she too had wondered about her husbands bravery under fire and had had no one to ask he went on ive come to make a request id like to speak to several of your students alone if possible why and which of them do you have in mind i didnt think you knew any of them the one called hugh and his friend johnnie the one who went home because hed been sick why on earth should you be interested in those two theyre troublesome but nothing beyond the usual mischief one expects of boys who are not good students and find school boring something appears to have frightened them she frowned how do you mean are you saying that someone has frightened them not necessarily someone perhaps something but what has this to do with my husband nothing at all for all i know but until i speak with them i cant tell you how they fit into this business and it might be best to do that here rather than in their homes less intimidating perhaps all the while hamish was reminding him that crowell was the chief suspect ye could verra well be putting yon lads in harms way mrs crowell was intelligent her mind working quickly as she sorted through several thoughts pressing for her attention and if i say no mrs crowell i would prefer your cooperation but if you refuse to give it i shall have to approach the families directly you dont seem to understand john standing isnt here today hes not well enough to return and for several days another boy robbie medway has been ill his mother was saying to me only last evening that she was at a loss to know what was wrong his brother tad and johns cousin bill have been very distracted in class and thats not like them it isnt boredom i expect theyre worried about their friends the four of them are also friends with hugh tredworth hes not been himself either very subdued it would be best not to add the distress of speaking to a policeman to the problems in their home situation just now you see one of our brightest boys died a few months ago of complications from measles and any illness is disturbing to the children now one of the younger students asked me only this morning if robbie was going to die too theres your frightening something hamish chided rutledge you wouldna heed me theyre afraid of yon schoolmaster i appreciate your concern for them mrs crowell its admirable all the more reason to interview the boys here if you would bring them to me now he left the words hanging in the air between them leaving her no way out i believe as a teacher im in a better position to judge she tried another tactic inspector these are children its cruel to drag them into something as horrid as a suspicious death i dont understand how schoolboys here in dilby could possibly know anything about your dead man at the abbey i expect theyve never set foot in the ruins he cut her short it will be done mrs crowell here at their homes or in the police station at elthorpe the decision must be yours mrs crowell capitulated with what grace she could muster hugh is here ill find him and bring him to you he could almost read what was running through her mind better to know what was happening than be in the dark before you go id rather you didnt tell hugh or your husband why hes being taken out of class she couldnt contain her fear any longer i know what it is youre intent on asking if theyve seen my husband out walking late at night after all their house windows overlook the street but he does walk sometimes albert suffers from headaches he has since the war and the cool air helps at the end of the day inspector madsen will use that against him and it isnt fair a slow flush rose to her cheeks i thought she added accusingly that you had been sent here to put an end to this harassment of my husband i shant know that until ive spoken to hugh if you please ten minutes later she returned with a very flushed hugh tredworth he edged into the room staring at rutledge as if the devil himself were awaiting him rutledge smiled at mrs crowell thank you ill let you know when were finished that alarmed hugh who was clearly not happy with being left alone with the tall man standing there by the window i think i should stay in lieu of his parents but rutledge cut her off again this is not a police interview mrs crowell merely a conversation she left reluctantly casting a last glance at hugh as she closed the door behind her it could have been interpreted as a warning or as encouragement rutledge rather thought that hugh took it as the former he seemed to shrink as if his last protector had betrayed him he stood there waiting for martyrdom staring at his executioner with a complex mixture of bravura fright and a deepseated worry and it was the worry that intrigued rutledge hugh my name is rutledge ive come from london to help the local police in a matter that perplexes them you had nothing directly to do with this problem but i have a feeling that you might know some small piece of the puzzle that will help us sort out what really happened at fountains abbey i dont know anything i told you that yesterday didnt i is that true your friend johnnie was very upset yesterday is he the one i ought to be speaking with this morning no it was explosive as if hugh were afraid that johnnie could be persuaded to tell more than he should rutledge gestured to the chairs in the center of the room sit down hugh im not here to persecute you or your friend no not on the bench on the other chair this is man to man hugh sat gingerly on the chair as if suspecting a trick his face was set now his mind racing but his stomach was about to betray him his nerve close to breaking who are your friends hugh rutledge asked trying to put him at ease but it was the wrong question dont have any he said gruffly nobody likes me thats not true you were very concerned about johnnie yesterday hes not my mate hugh said stubbornly he doesnt like me are you protecting someone is that why youre so afraid im not afraid of anything it was almost a shout but one that rang of pain rather than anger who left the village on monday night the evening that someone was killed in the fountains abbey church no one i didnt see anyone it was a plea now and rutledge heard more than hugh intended hugh and at least one of his friends had been out that night bent on some adventure of their own one that their parents knew nothing about and that was keeping them tonguetied the knowledge that any confession would get them into serious difficulty with their fathers never mind the law rutledge wondered if hugh had made a habit of latenight forays i didnt see anyone no i was in my bed that night he said while hamish thundered in his head hugh youll be safer if you tell me whats been happening you know dont you you and john standing his cousin william tad and his brother robert rutledge had no way of guessing that in hughs mind not even a london policeman was a match for the devil probing listening he was trying to build a picture of what had so disturbed this distraught tense child but he was going about it from an adults perspective knowing the truth and trying to work backward from it that these boys had actually been in the abbey ruins was the last thing to cross his mind hugh was living in a different reality one in his mind that was so unforgivable he could find no way back to the safety of his old life what had begun as a daring escapade had turned into a nightmare his knowledge of history scant as it was included burning witches at the stake for summoning the devil it hadnt even occurred to him on his way to fountains abbey that he was going down that path but it had struck him forcibly later his concept of the devil had been a simple one more like the spirit in a magic lamp than the fiend theyd met something to brag about not something that could destroy him hughs brows flicked together and rutledge could almost hear the thoughts rushing through his head who told who spoke out of turn if you wont tell me i must ask the other boys robert is younger he might not be as stubborn as you are or as determined to protect his friends robbie has nothing to do with us the words were angry and full of fear as well leave robbie out of this im afraid i cant there are suspicious circumstances surrounding a mans death you see and ive come north to find out why he died if he was killed it was all hugh could do to stop himself from blurting out none of us killed himit was the devil rutledge tried another direction do you know the book on alchemy that belongs to mr crowell ive seen it hugh said warily he had nearly forgotten the book by the time the elthorpe inspector brought it back to the school that had shaken him but with a childs sense of what was important he could now safely deny all knowledge of it it was where it ought to be wasnt it and no one knew hed borrowed it now he dredged up his first acquaintance with it he shows it when hes trying to explain how people get things wrong but in the end each bit of knowledge helps the next person looking for the truth even to his own ears that sounded very much like a memorized lesson he was parroting police work is much the same rutledge told him seizing his opportunity we try this bit of knowledge and that bit and in the end we learn the truth wethe policefound that book in fountains abbey the night a man died and so we came to speak to mr crowell his name was in it you see and the police believe he might have been in the ruins of the cloister talking with the man who was later killed mr crowell wouldnt kill anybody not even in the war he couldnt then how did his book come to be in the ruins beside a dead man who else could possibly have left it there thats our dilemma thats why we must know who might have met the man that night someone did we found candle wax in the cloister as well they must have stood there and talked at some point hugh was silent confused his face working with his thoughts his body tense as a cornered animals we have a body we have a book with another mans name in it mr crowells name and no answers to the puzzle rutledge persisted you can see surely that we must get to the truth if were to show whether mr crowell is to blame for what happened otherwise hell be held responsible hugh said as if he thought it was all a trick theres no one dead i heard of who is it then and what was he doing in the abbey late at night rutledge answered him with honesty we dont know his name hes a stranger he reached for the file on mrs crowells desk and opened it to show the sketched face to hugh the boy hesitated then curiosity got the better of him thats him then hugh stared at the face he doesnt look dead i assure you he is we dont know where to find his family after a moment hugh looked away what killed him he waserovercome by gas rutledge had debated what to say knowing that the question would surely come up it was important to be honest with the boy now that took hugh aback like in the war no not like in the war i never saw him before there was a wealth of relief behind the words never he hasnt come to call on someone in dilby perhaps met him by the church or at the edge of the village on the road or even out in a field hugh shook his head vigorously perhaps you didnt see his face only his back or a silhouette the problem is who did he come here to see he never came to dilby that i know of its gods truth and so were back to the book of alchemy and why it was left at this mans feet in an ancient abbey cloister of all places another thought had struck hugh he frowned fiercely as if concentrating on something what was running through his head was the fear that the devil theyd raised had found another victim after they had fled the ruins if this were true he was as good as a murderer he felt sick again his stomach clenching and twisting rutledge was saying he was lying on his back this man he wore a respirator on his face and was wrapped in a dark cloak drawn out of himself hugh was staring his face so pale rutledge realized hed touched on something that was shocking to the boy say again it was a croak coming out of a tight dry throat i didnt mean to frighten you hugh no sir tell me that bit again there was urgency in the boys posture and his voice the dead man was wearing a respirator youve seen them during the war we dont know why this was on his face and it was broken but there you are and the cloak was heavy black what is it hugh whats wrong rutledge was on his feet as the boy slumped in his chair starting to shake as if he were running a fever his eyes stared at rutledge accusingly begging for gods sake young man whats wrong youre lying to me it was a whisper i dont lie hugh i can take you to elthorpe and show you these things hugh nodded i want to see them but he sat there as if he couldnt manage to stand on his own two feet rutledge was watching him what is it hugh tell me what youre afraid of hugh struggled with himself then got up and said can i go now rutledge thought he meant was he free to leave then realized he was actually asking to be taken to elthorpe yes now hugh nodded followed rutledge from the room and in the passage outside he ran into another boy rutledge hadnt seen before the boy was staring at hugh and he said shortly theres nothing wrong tad theres nothing wrong rutledge said do you want tad to come with you hugh shook his head forcefully and tad seemed to melt back into the wall making room for the policeman and hugh to pass it was a silent ride to elthorpe though hamish was still vocal just behind rutledges right ear at one point rutledge retorted sharply it was the right thing to do hugh looked across at him startled rutledge tempered his voice and repeated it was the right thing to do hugh youre a brave lad when they reached the doctors surgery rutledge explained that hed come to show hugh tredworth the clothing that the dead man had been wearing the doctors nurse took them back to a door at the end of the passage and hugh began to drag his heels i dont have to see him do i you didnt say i had to see him just his things thats right ill bring them out to you the nurse opened the door into a room lined with shelving storage for blankets medical instruments an array of bottles and other paraphernalia on a lower one tidily boxed was the folded cloak and on top of it was the respirator on a bench outside the closet rutledge spread the cloak out for hugh to see and set the mask in at the head the way it had covered the dead mans face hugh stood there absorbing the image rutledge had created his eyes squinted as if he were comparing a memory with what lay before him then he looked up at the man from london there was a mixture of emotions in his expression understanding alarm confusion distress rutledge could have sworn that among them was disappointment it wasnt the devil then the boys voice was flat without feeling the devil hugh turned and marched out of the surgery rutledge hastily thanking the nurse and following him out to the motorcar hugh was leaning against the wing his face hidden rutledge gave him time to recover and then said quietly so that passersby couldnt hear will you tell me what you know hugh i want to go home now hugh turned and scrambled into the passengers side waited for rutledge to crank the motorcar then join him they were nearly out of elthorpe before hugh spoke we thought it was the devil lying there he said beginning at the end of the tale tears suddenly welling in his eyes he looked away thats when i dropped the book we were all so afraid you were there rutledge tried to absorb that what took you there hugh why should you think it was the devil because wed been trying to raise him werent we with that book of mr crowells thats a book of alchemy theres spells in it thats why i tookborrowedit the story came tumbling out relief so great that there was no stopping the pentup words backward leaping ahead sometimes garbled but clear enough the boy ended it wasnt mr crowell who carried the book there it was me i went to his office when i was running an errand for mrs crowell and i took it must you tell him must you tell my father therell be the strap for the lot of useven robbie rutledge said have you told the whole truth hugh nothing left out nothing made up but he was sure nothing had been held back the boy had needed the release of telling the whole story to someone even a policeman its the truth hugh said fervently i swear it is this why you and your friends were so afraid because you believed youd raised the devil we swore an oath not to tell but robbie wanted to tell he was so afraid i warned him his tongue would turn black he brushed his lips with his own tongue and look who it was broke first there was disgust in his voice you swore not to tell about raising the devil but you didnt raise him what you saw was a human being lying there in the shadows it doesnt matter does it an oath is an oath it matters a great deal what youve done today is help with a police inquiry you can rightly be proud of that should i speak to your friends tell them youve done your proper duty they may remember details that you havent id rather you didnt ive told you the lot what about mr crow ell then leave this to me once the book has been explained away theres nothing to link him to this other man is there hugh still seemed uncertain rutledge asked was there anyone else in the ruins that night did you see anyone on the road or hear anything men arguing someone walking fast to make sure he wasnt seen there was no one on the road or in the woods but us and no one in the ruins id swear to it if you remember anything however small the detail might be will you ask mrs crowell to find me this is true of your friends as well any small detail hugh he said again no there was no one wed have run for home if thered been any such thing which rutledge thought was more true than any spoken denials he returned the boy to the school spoke briefly to mrs crowell and then went looking for her husband youre in the clear crowell as far as i can see ill tell inspector madsen that you werent in the abbey ruins that night why are you so certain and why did you take hugh tredworth away from the school without my permission he was out that night and youd best leave it at that what do you mean out that night its police business crowell and if i were you id let sleeping dogs lie its in your best interest after all crowells face had taken on a stubborn tightness hes one of my pupils but not your son is he and he wasnt in school at the time if he requires discipline leave it to his father i dont understand how that boy could clear me of a charge of murder my book was there beside the dead man how does a child explain that away if you wish ill take you to speak to mr madsen hed like very much to see you charged we can try to persuade him otherwise but im not sure youll be successful he has a grudge against you as far as i can tell and if he pursues this matter its very likely to cost you your position here at dilby crowell considered that its true hes not counted amongst my friends then leave me to deal with him i havent much time make your decision very well but i can tell you its against my better judgment and leave hugh tredworth alone dont question him yourself if you do its likely that he wont be able to testify on your behalf at any trial should it come to that did hugh take my book without my knowledge but he couldnt have carried it to the abbey not that far in the middle of the night who did rutledge could follow his line of thoughtthat somehow the pointing finger of accusation was swinging toward his wife it has nothing to do with mrs crowell stop secondguessing me youll do more harm than good he could see that crowell had a tenacious mind and it would worry at the problem until it came up with a satisfactory conclusion it was also the kind of mind that might harbor a wrong until it grew into a monstrous weight that had to be addressed or avenged hugh tredworth had explained away the alchemy book albert crowell might still bring down on himself a charge of murder because he couldnt let well enough alone driving alone back to elthorpe rutledge listened to hamish in his mind yeve cleared the schoolmaster aye but theres still a dead man with no name and no suspects to take the schoolmasters place there was also one henry shoreham who had to be found and discounted for the record are you saying you dont believe hugh tredworth he told the youngest lad his tongue would turn black and drop oot if he spoke he told all four of them that but it was the youngest lad who believed it i think because robbie needed so badly to confide in someone yon inspector willna be happy youve spoiled his chances inspector madsen in fact was livid he paced the small office and asked rutledge what he was about to make an arbitrary decision about a case that was his only by courtesy rutledge said you cant hang a man for murder because you dislike him madsen and theres no other proof crowell was involved in any fashion now that the book is explained away too conveniently explained away if you ask me i should have been present when you interviewed hugh tredworth why wasnt i sent for you dont know this part of the country the way i do how can i be sure he was telling the truth damn it you dont know these people rutledge said only i know when im being lied to your case is wide open man its time to get on with it if london can place the victim from the sketch then youll be the first to know meanwhile youre letting what evidence there is grow cold id speak to the under gardener on the estate for one and talk to the nearest stationmaster he may remember a stranger arriving by train hold the inquest and ask the coroner to bring in the verdict of murder by person or persons unknown to give you more time dont teach me how to run an inquiry madsen went on fuming and why are you here in the first place because alice crowells father has friends in high places looking after his daughter i tell you the schoolmaster thought he was killing the man whod scarred his wife and youll not convince me otherwise oh yes i got that story out of mary norton its a dead end madsen ill have to return to london tomorrow i need to look into several other possibilities or to put it another way reporting to the colonel madsen told himself in disgust good luck to you then it was bitter far from wishing him well as rutledge walked out of the station madsen watched him go the man from london hadnt come to discover who the dead man was whatever he said madsen told himself hed been sent by alices bloody family to keep her precious husband safe once that was done it was goodbye to yorkshire leaving the local man with an unidentified corpse and no murder suspect he let the legs of his chair slam back to the floor relishing the sound hed have liked to throw the chair after the departing londoner but that would be the end of his own career and he was having none of that there was one thing to be done to spike the londoners guns find henry shoreham or failing that someone who knew him well enough to say if the dead man was shoreham or not and if it was then crowell could damned well take his chances in a courtroom colonel ingle be damned d uring the long drive back to london hamish was insistent railing at rutledge for his handling of madsen and crowell alike ye didna gie yon inspector the whole truth its not mine to give is it it would ha gone a long way toward placating him the war office can look at this sketch and tell me if weve found our man if we have then ill be back in yorkshire before the week is out to discover what happened to him and why and if it isna partridge then very likely ill be sent back by the yard the chief constable will be involved by that time madsen will complain to him before weve reached cambridge ye should ha told him as much that youd be back im not at liberty to explain why i think theres more to this case than he realizes if those boys hadnt confessed crowell could well be facing the hangman and if the victim turns out to be shoreham after all hes still the chief suspect then why the robe why the mask to throw us off as it did although if it was crowell he should have been clever enough to rid himself of the body altogether he couldna leave his wife long enough to take the body verra far im still not convinced that dying so easily would provide a satisfying retribution a shotgun in the face perhaps or throttling with ones bare hands would be a more convincing vengeance aye but theres nae weapon in a gassing which was an excellent point rutledge arrived in london too late to return to the yard but the next morning he was there before chief superintendent bowles had arrived sergeant gibson passing rutledge in the corridor said walk softly which meant that the chief superintendent was not in a good humor rutledge stopped him and said can you find me information on one henry shoreham of whitby yorkshire taken up for public drunkenness after accidentally knocking a young woman into an iron fence and scarring her badly ill speak to a constable i know in whitby police station if you like whats he done nothing that im aware of but he could well be a murder victim in yorkshire im particularly interested in his appearancewhether he has a cleft in his chin gibson nodded ill do my best gossip had it right superintendent bowles had just had a dressing down by his superiors and he was nursing his wounds no one was safe there had been a very careful watch set up for a killer cornered in the east end and somehow the man had slipped quietly through the net and escaped bowles had borne the brunt of official displeasure as rutledge came through the door bowles looked at him with narrowed eyes and what are you doing here i thought id sent you north to yorkshire you had i brought back a sketch of the dead man i think someone in the war office ought to have a look at it very clever of you bowles declared in a growl what makes you think they want to meet with you pray sketch or no sketch because i dont think theyre very keen on traveling to yorkshire themselves to see the body there are no distinguishing marks and any description would fit half the men walking past our door if they want partridge badly enough theyll agree bowles grunted but picked up the telephone and put in a call it took nearly a quarter of an hour for someone to get back to him he sent for rutledge and told him shortly martin deloran someone at the war office will take you to meet him theyre waiting bloody army rutledge retrieved the sketch from his office and left when he was finally admitted into delorans presence rutledge had had enough of secrecy and chains of command he sat down in the chair pointed out to him and said without preamble its possible ive found partridge its for you to decide deloran took the folder that rutledge passed across the desk and said im told by chief superintendent bowles that this body was found in the ruins of fountains abbey wrapped in some sort of cloak with a respirator on his face hardly sounds like the man weve somehow mislaid the respirator was torn the cloak i think is theatrical he had a sudden image of his parents leaving for a party his mother in an elizabethan costume the ruff around her face framing it becomingly the scent of her perfume mixing with the heavier one of cedar shavings and his father looking like charles ii in a wig that reached below his shoulders deloran said well thats not partridge i can tell you i doubt he ever went to the theatre in his life a masquerade rutledge said not theatrical it fitthe fineness of the weave and the quality of the robe nothing changed in delorans face but the fingers holding a pen tightened he said i doubt partridge would have been caught dead in a masquerade then he realized what hed just said and smiled sorry but you take the point im sure he picked up the folder almost as if to satisfy rutledge rather than from any curiosity on his part looking at the sketch he said thoughtfully its hard to say given the inferior quality of the drawing but i can tell you that this looks nothing like our man he closed the folder and passed it back to rutledge it appears we were wrong about yorkshire i expect partridge will show up in his own good time whether we look for him or not this man was very likely murdered rutledge told him bluntly he didnt die there in the ruins he was carried there after he was dead yes very sad deloran prepared to stand ready to dismiss rut ledge thank you so much for your help in this matter we are more grateful than you know he was standing now and he gestured to the sketch i hope theres a successful conclusion to this case are you returning to yorkshire at the moment no rutledge stood also just as well let them sort out this inquiry im sure theyll manage very well local people know best oftentimes deep roots in their patch and all that sorry to have muddied the waters are you quite certain this couldnt be your man partridge absolutely deloran offered his hand and rutledge took it innis will see you out as they walked out of the room hamish said referring to deloran i wouldna care to play cards wi him innis was waiting to escort him out of the building rutledge considering the grayhaired man would have placed him as a retired sergeantmajor ramrod back calm face an air of unquestioned authority that had nothing to do with a uniform on the street once more rutledge answered hamish ill give you any odds you like that our dead man is partridge the question is why wouldnt deloran admit to it hes deid hamish said and that pleases someone yes rutledge answered slowly his dismissal rankled the bland lies the willingness to abandon a man who was inconvenient even though someone had murdered him the arrogance of the assumption that rutledge would walk away as well case closed not even warning him off so much as believing that a policeman could be so easily gulled left a bad taste and in the meantime inspector madsen with a corpse on his hands and his main suspect cleared was to be left in the dark back at the yard gibson was waiting for him outside his office ive been on the horn to whitby they remember your man shoreham he was never tried for the injury to mrs crowell the family refused to take the matter further shoreham left town shortly after that and whitby has quite lost track of him shame i should imagine very likely gibson responded after losing his position he found there was no use staying on where he wasnt wanted another town another life quite rutledge answered no one remembers his chin im not surprised and so far as whitby knows he never came to the attention of the police again no inquiries in regard to a troubled past a lesson learned yes thank you sergeant well done he was about to walk on when gibson added no inquiries that is until this morning from an inspector in elthorpe or so i was told rutledge stopped in his tracks indeed seems they have a dead man they cant identify and theyre coming round to thinking it could be shoreham rutledge swore keep searching for shoreham then i need to be sure hes alive more important i need to know where hes currently living thats a tall order gibson said doubtfully yes well if we dont find him someone is going to hang for his murder rutledge walked on down the passage to chief superintendent bowless office as he went he made up his mind about what he was going to say bowles looked up as he entered the cluttered room well the case is closed at least as far as mr deloran is concerned im not so sure you dont want to run afoul of that lot no on the other hand i have a feeling that theyd rather sweep a murder under their carpet than tell us the truth theres a man dead in yorkshire and they would just as soon ignore him id like to clear up a few loose ends before i accept their verdict frankly i wouldnt put it past them to have got rid of this man partridge themselves we cant go meddling into matters that are none of our business there was alarm on bowless face now hed already run afoul of his superiors this week the dead man could be anyone from anywhere in england but if inspector madsen has his way hell call him henry shoreham and take one albert crowell the schoolmaster into custody on a charge of murder we cant seem to lay hands on shoreham before we can say with any certainty that hes the victim we must make certain to eliminate the choice that sent me to yorkshire in the first place id like to ask someone who knowsknewpartridge well to tell me the man in the sketch i had made is not partridge it will clear the field to pursue the issue of shorehams whereabouts if it is partridge we can save a good many man hours searching for shoreham bowles considered his options in the end it would be his duty to report to his own superiors how and why rutledge came to be meddling in affairs that were none of his business on the other hand the chief constable of yorkshire was not to be trifled with he was vocal and did not suffer fools lightly if there was any chance that one of bowless men was intent on pursuing a wrong course that could lead to a public embarrassment he wiped a hand across his face damned if we do and equally damned if we dont he said all right look into the business but hear me rutledge i wont have toes stepped on for naught youll go about this quietly whatever you do tying up loose ends is all very well but we neednt bruit it about ask your question without prejudice and come back to london with your answer understood understood sir ill leave in the morning he went back to his flat that evening packed his valise with fresh clothing ready to set out for berkshire he got a late start through no fault of his own his sister was at his door just after breakfast and he could tell from her face that all was not well she toyed with a slice of toast in the rack buttering it and then putting it down untouched the purpose of her visit wasostensiblyto ask his opinion of a new hat shed bought the day before it was quite fetching as her hats generally were on the other hand rutledge thought on her most anything would look fetching you arent here at this ungodly hour because you have doubts about your milliner he said lightly whats happened its simon she said keeping her voice steady with an effort hes been avoiding me i know that for a fact i have it on good authority so dont tell me im imagining things i dont know why hes doing this i thoughtwell i thought we were good friends why should he avoid you he threw up a hand adding no im not saying youre imagining anything i want to know what reason you think he might have something you commented on for instance that you regretted as soon as it was out of your mouth a remark you shouldnt have made about one of his friends something you said that might have led him to believe your feelings for him were stronger than his for you ian im not likely to make stupid remarks and im not likely to criticize him or wear my heart on my sleeve you arent helping he laughed im a policeman not a seer and a very good policeman at that she retorted but youve given me an idea i think ill invite meredith channing to have lunch with me he was immediately on alert frances i think thats a very poor idea mrs channing isnt going to look into a crystal ball and tell you whats in simons mind or heart i dont expect her to look into a crystal ball shes a very astute woman ian she can give me her opinion and it could be what i need to understand how to go on i mean people are asking weve been seen together more than a little these last two months i dont know how to answer them wheres simon my dear i saw him last night at the collinses and you werent with him or whats happening between you and simon has there been a fallingout a quarrel have you lost interest in him her eyes filled with tears but she refused to let them fall and how do you answer these questions i say that ive been terribly busy and so has simon or that i couldnt make the collinses party i had other plans but its growing old she stood up youll be late bowles will be clamoring for you ill go and speak to meredith channing if nothing else shell cheer me up im in need of cheering right now and she was gone despite his protests smiling at him over her shoulder as she went out his door he spent the better part of the morning scouring london for news of simon barrington there was no one he could ask outright and so he had to make time to listen to various friends they held in common hamish was not pleased with his decision it willna help even if ye find him ye ken that as well as i do ye canna speak to him i dont intend to speak to him or try to fix whatever happened between barrington and my sister but if theres something wrong something i ought to know then the sooner the better aye but are ye the brother now or the policeman he couldnt answer that and at the end of the day there was still nothing he could point to as a reason why barrington should avoid his sister without explanation the closest he came to an answer was an offhand remark by tommy aspell that simon had something on his mind and had been damned poor company for a fortnight or more with that he had to be satisfied it was close to nine in the evening when he arrived in berkshire but the smiths arms was well lit the bar noisy with shouts of laughter and the stamping of feet not a drunken crowd from the sound of it but one where men were relaxed and enjoying themselves rutledge went to the tiny desk in reception and signed the register then he walked into the bar there was a sudden silence as patrons looked up at the newcomer and judged him from his clothes half a dozen lorry drivers were busy with a game of darts one man in the process of taking his turn scowled at the interruption two farmers were watching the proceedings from the bar keeping to themselves rutledge nodded to them as the game resumed and found himself a table in a corner by the front windows he smiled as mrs smith came over to him and asked what hed have a room if you please ive signed the register and dinner if theres any left this lot isnt staying over theres the room you had before and a bit of roasted ham and some bread left mustard sauce as well that will do very well hed missed his lunch and could hear the growling of an empty stomach what will you have to drink luv a guinness if you please smith ull bring it shortly she skirted the players and disappeared into the kitchen as another burst of laughter met a wild throw rutledge watched this leg end in a victory for the bald man with a birthmark on his face the man went to the bar to claim his wager another glass of his choice a shorter man broad in the shoulders called out to rutledge as he pulled the darts out of the board this is a worthless lot will you have a turn it was a dare not an invitation rutledge got to his feet shrugging off the long drive and answered ill give it a try they eyed him with interest as he took the three darts and lightly hefted them in his hand judging his skill or lack thereof hamish was saying i won best of three in the canteen suddenly without warning rutledge could feel himself slipping back reliving a night in france he had been invited to the canteen by his men it had been his birthday and he never knew how theyd found that out darts was a workingclass pastime but hed held his own with a good elbow and a better eye hed been grateful not to disgrace his men in front of the other onlookers hamish had stood them all down the quiet young scot already respected by his men his corporals stripes still new on his uniform it had been a brief respite from the front tired men pulled back for a few days of rest after a hard week of fighting and nowhere to go in the rain and the mud and the dark save the popular canteen set up in a small stone barnall that was left of a french farmhousethat had been too rat infested to serve as a field hospital rumor was officers turned a blind eye to the use it was put to by a trio of enterprising welshmen miners at home outside cardiff but sappers now someone had found a great gray and black tomcat and it soon made short work of the earlier residents a broom and some odds and ends of scavenged paint and a rough bar built from whatever wood could be found or stolen and the canteen was in business a large oil painting of a french officer of the napoleonic wars had materialized from somewhere hung at one end of the barn by a length of scorched rope it had become a habit to salute the officer on entering evenings were usually rowdy some of the strain and fatigue draining away as young soldiers old before their time had tried to forget the war he and his men had walked through the door and lifted the blanket behind it lamps had been hung from the rafters the room was smoky from cigarettes and the scent of moldy hay still lingered rusted kettles were whistling on a wood stove that gave off sufficient heat to keep the building just barely comfortable when rutledge took the mug of steaming tea handed to him by one of his men he nearly choked on the first swallow in lieu of sugar someone had added a liberal spoonful of brandy to it but he said nothing aware of anxious eyes on his face they had played darts after that though the numbers on the board were badly worn and the colors had faded to a uniform brown but the sisal still held each throw firmly where it landed at the end of the evening rutledge had returned to his quarters feeling not relaxed but burdened by guilt how many of the men who had shared this wartime birthday tonight would be alive by months end ten had died the first day back in the line and hed heard a year later that the welshmen had died outside ypres when a tunnel theyd been digging had collapsed prematurely burying them alive by the time help reached them it was too late rutledge brought himself back to the present as a lorry driver a man his mates called jimmy said loser buys drinks all round there was general agreement to the terms since the general opinion was that the man from london would pay the accounting rutledge found the rough line drawn on the floor put the outside of his right foot against it and considered the target this one was worn too but from long use not from rain and mud and countless journeys across northern france in haversacks he forced his mind to concentrate on what he must do hamish warned theyll want to see your mettle his fingers closed around the first dart worn like the board and comfortable in his grip he pumped his hand twice gauging his shot then threw firmly toward the board it landed precisely where hed intendedin the wood above the board from the bar smith called here thats my wall sorry rutledge apologized as the lorry drivers and even the farmers slapped their knees and bent over laughing at his expense he waited for the racket to die down and took his second throw this time the dart landed in the number ring between eleven and fourteen there was more laughter and the baldheaded man said to smith set them up man this ull be a short leg nay he hit the board didnt he another driver answered we could go on all night the point of the game was to put his dart somewhere in the pie wedgeshaped section numbered rutledge took aim for his third and final throwand this time his dart landed perfectly in the triple in section there was an intake of breath and someone said youre a damned lucky man hed made his three he walked to the board pulled out his darts and scored his throw amid much joshing it was still his turn this time the section was to the bottom and left his first dart hit the black one man said not bad for a toff he missed his other two throws and went to retrieve his darts his opponent a slim dark man called will came forward to take them from him and showed off his own skill earning a second turn and then a third but he was off on his next throw and that jarred him just enough to make him miss again he wound up losing his turn and went to fetch the darts for rutledge rutledge threw well this time keeping pace with his opponent there was partisanship among the observers now the farmers taking his part and the drivers banding together behind their man rutledge could have hit the outer bull with ease but he chose to put two throws into the inner bull the third one missing its mark still he had finished the leg just behind his opponent there was general celebration and someone slapped him on the back as smith handed him his glass before setting up for the rest of the men they stopped after splitting two more legs sitting down at the bar or the nearest tables instead to talk to rutledge about london and eventually the war four of them had served in france while the other two had been in the navy rutledge let them talk and then led them into stories about their experiences on the road ever give a lift to someone who wanted to go to say liverpool or york they shook their heads id be sacked one of them said if it got out not for any amount of money the bald man added cant say i like company on the road why do you want to go to manchester tonight will the thin man asked finishing his beer ill give you a lift ive been to manchester rutledge answered him once is enough they laughed and someone said nay manchesters not all that bad soon talk shifted to the struggles these men faced making a living wage the hardships of being away more often than they were at home coping with the growing tangles of traffic and the winters toll on the roads although its a damned sight better than being shot at by the huns aircraft i swear one of the men said my mate was blown up by the red baron i saw that albatross coming in and blew the horn but there was no time never is he was carrying shells and my windscreen blew out with the force of the blast they never did find anything of my mate to bury i took his wife a bit of the lorry thats all i could do if anyone had been sitting beside me hed have had his head took off when something slammed into the seat and carried it through into the bed i dont miss france i dont hamish said theyll no tell you if they had taken up yon dead man but rutledge had been watching faces as hed asked his questions and if partridge had got himself out of berkshire with a lorry driver hed have wagered it wasnt one of these men smith was calling time and mrs smith said to rutledge as he looked around for it ill bring up your dinner if you like he hadnt touched it hadnt had the time hungry or not he bought a final round then said good night leaving the drivers to drink in peace the farmers had already left half an hour before mrs smith met him at the stairs as he came out of the bar his plate on a tray were you thinking about mr partridge she asked him when you wanted to know if someone might find a ride with a driver he was caught off guard yes i was as a matter of fact he answered lowering his voice he was here once playing darts and later asking about traveling to liverpool but it was the roads he wanted to hear about what sort of time he could count on making when was this six months ago at a guess longer for all i can remember the state of the roads youre certain it wasnt the prelude for asking for a lift no sir he has his own motorcar i cant think why he would need a lift with the likes of them how well do you know mr partridge he wasnt one to come around in the evening as a rule she smiled ruefully i think its when he cant stand his own company any longer why do you say that well hes a widower isnt he there was pity in her voice did he tell you he was lord no sir we never spoke about his private life no it was young slater who said hed lost his wife and hadnt much use for company mr partridge kept to himself at his cottage and seldom went out we were that glad to see him when he did come and yet this wasnt the sort of pub a man like partridge would frequent granted it was the nearest one to the cottages but he wasnt working class if the army was keeping an eye on him that reminded him of the dead man in yorkshire whose hands were soft and uncallused hamish said why did ye no show her the drawing rutledge wasnt sure himself why he hadnt but he wanted no rumors reaching the tomlin cottages before he himself could go there in the morning he slept poorly that night as if the memory of the dart game on his birthday had stirred up the past too deeply he could hear the guns in france and men calling and screaming and swearing bringing himself up out of the depths to lie awake until the sounds receded and then he would drift into sleep again for another quarter of an hour sometimes longer before the guns started shelling his position muzzle flashes in the distance seemed to light up the sky and the flares were sharp brilliant nearly burning his eyes once when he awoke he could hear hamish talking to someone and then he realized that the someone was himself answering the familiar voice of a dead man even in his sleep im trained to it he said aloud and then lay still listening but from the other rooms came the regular snores of occupants luckier than he was comfortable in their beds like a dog who knows his masters voice hamishs laugh was harsh oh aye more like a man wi blood on his conscience who canna find peace you left me no choice but to execute you you wouldnt heed me when i warned you what would follow if you didnt relent and obey the orders given you i warned you and you didnt listen i couldna watch more of my men die while the colonel who gave the orders sat safe and ignorant miles behind the lines you knew you knew as well as any of us that it was hopeless no more so than the whole bloody campaign we did what we were told because there was no other choice left to us but to obey one man two men a dozen couldnt have stopped the madness we had to carry on to the end and die if we had to i wasna afraid of dying ye ken that well i couldna bear to watch the ithers die there had been too many for too long you refused an order under fire you left me no choice damn you aye and afterward ye couldna let me go you didnt want to go then or now hamish said something in his voice now that was unbearable i didna want to die but i couldna live no even for fiona i couldna stand before my men and break as we went ower the top it was a question of pride id have shot mysel else but you let me do it instead you let me call up the men and order them to shoot you my men your men you put that on their souls and mine if i could ever understand why id find some peace why not let the germans do it for you you wouldnt have been the first nor the last aye its what ye did but no even the hun could touch you you were left wi your shame ye ken its why i willna go no now no yet for gods sake tell me why there was a knock at his door cutting through the darkness in his mind smith called out mr rutledge are you all right he realized that the snoring had stoppedhad been stopped for some time for all he knew and his shouting could be heard all over the inn rutledge cleared his throat im sorry smith it was a bad dream i didnt mean to disturb the house there was a moment of silence on the other side of the door if youre sure then im sure he listened to the mans footsteps receding across the passage and a door shutting rutledge lay back against his pillows his body still tense his fists clenched not certain when hed sat up in bed or for how long the exchange with hamish had been loud enough to be heard hamish said in the darkness but they canna hear me only you can rutledge was awake when at the back of the inn a rooster crowed welcoming the early spring dawn he got up shaved and dressed and went outside to walk off his mood for a mercy hamish was silent he found pansies blooming in the shadow of the small barn and a clutch of hens picking busily at the sparse grass of the yard then he walked on down the road to waylands smithy it was smaller than he remembered from childhood but still an impressive grave for whom a chieftain a warrior or perhaps a high priest the merlin of his age whoever had lain here the power of his name had given him a great stone tomb monoliths that time had barely eroded and whatever grave goods had been buried with him were long since taken away as the power of his name faded in human memory and the bones had they also been scattered rutledge squatted down to look inside and shuddered a narrow room in which to spend eternity claustrophobic and dark he thought about gaylord partridge who was being left to rot in an unmarked unmourned grave because in some fashion he had offended people with a long memory for revenge an outcast like the others who lived in the tomlin cottages lepers without the sores what had partridge done to deserve his fate a spy would have been tried and shot behind walls where no one could see him die how had he offended that was the crux of this business to know why he was better off dead in a back corner of a yorkshire graveyard a fortuitous death surely for those who had hated him or had it been somehow engineered that was something to be considered the army looked after its own but transgressors were beyond the pale abandoned t e lawrence had offended and been snubbed would anyone weep if he died conveniently on a back road where no one knew him hen rutledge had finished his breakfast in the quiet of the it was time to go back to the inn rutledge turned away from the tomb and retraced his steps thinking barempty and well scrubbed by smith before the tea had steepedhe refreshed his memory about the nine people who lived near the foot of the great white horse he had met only two of them these neighbors of one gaylord partridge slater the smith first to the left then partridge with the only gate in the low walls of the cottage gardens the next five in the horseshoe he hadnt met but rutledge had seen number staring up at him as he paced along the mane of the horse although martin deloran in london had never indicated that there was another watcher rut ledges training told him it must be so at the far right of the half circle was quincys cottage with the birds hidden in a back room behind him at number a woman lived rutledge had seen her hanging out her wash as well as peering at him through a window finishing his second cup of tea he left for the tomlin cottages there was one thing he disliked about what he called a cold road coming back into a place where he had got the pulse of the people and the way they lived and then had to walk away for whatever reason he had done that here in berkshire and he had done it as well in yorkshire possibly all because of one mysterious man much would depend on what partridges neighbor quincy had to say he pulled his motorcar to the verge of the road near the path up the hill of the white horse near the muzzle of the great beast he looked down on the cottages and waited for a door to open below him or a window curtain to twitch what were the connections between these nine residents if connections there were englishmen were not by nature gregarious even abroad but surely human curiosity made them draw conclusions about each other from what they had observed from a window or a stroll down the lane the woman he decided from her windows she could see partridge come and go and women were sometimes less reserved than men if approached in a sympathetic way or was it wiser after all to speak to quincy quincy appeared to keep to himself would he admit to recognizing the sketch he would most certainly want to know when it had been made and why driven by curiosity yes but beneath all that was his own reason for considering himself a leper of sorts and choosing to live here he might well prefer to keep his distance from any trouble involving partridge for fear of the impact on his own seclusion the smith then a simple man he wasnt the sort to look below the surface of a question for hidden traps and meanings and he was an honest man as far as rutledge could tell with no secrets his reason for living here was plainhe preferred to be left alone because his experience with people had taught him that they were unkind rutledge sat there on the hillside in the april sun and waited until he saw the smith walk into view from the direction of uffington the man looked tired his gait measured as if there were something on his mind holding him back rutledge waited until hed disappeared into his cottage and then went down the hill by the time he knocked at the door the smith had put the kettle on and rutledge could hear it whistling cheerfully in the background as slater opened to him i saw you on the horse he said what brings you back curiosity rutledge answered he had brought the file with him from the motorcar and put it aside for the moment on a small table near the door curiosity slater repeated it killed a cat you know he added quoting the old saying yes well ill be careful slater said would you like a cup of tea he gestured toward the tiny kitchen where the kettle was still whistling thank you i would while slater was preparing the tea rutledge watched his deft sure movements big hands handling the tea things with the same ease as he handled his tools the cup slater offered him was thin porcelain with cabbage roses around it the man could have crushed it like eggshell and it was lost in the large callused hand how is work on the silver teapot handle faring rutledge asked to open the conversation fancy you remembering that slater answered his face brightening its very well polish it and im finished i hope the church is pleased there was a bitter smile now im told i charge too much who tells you that the sexton he says he could have done it at half the cost could he i doubt it but hes one who opens his mouth and doesnt care much what harm he does with what comes out tell them ive offered to buy the teapot myself for twice the cost of repairs he couldnt stop himself from saying it or cursing the sexton for his callous cruelty slater looked at him what do you want with a teapot its not yours to start with it belongs to the church service yes it does and ill make a gift of it back to them so that it stays where it should youre mocking me he had got off on the wrong foot unintentionally and hamish was already telling him as much but rutledge said im mocking no one you showed me that teapot and i think the sexton is wrong good work deserves good pay and i for one recognize that well its not your problem its mine what have you come for to show you a sketch if you dont mind of work you wish me to do sorry no id like to ask if you recognize the person in the sketch im looking for this man there was instant hostility whats he done then nothing that im aware of but friends are anxious about him id like to put their minds at ease if deloran could be considered any mans friend youre being fair with me actually ive told you the truth why do you think i might know him look at the sketch first and then ill give you the answer to that he lifted the folder from the table and opened it slater looked down at it but his eye went first to the quality of the drawing its well done this sketch who made it a young man in yorkshire he takes as much pride in his work as you do in yours and so its a good likeness we hope it is slater didnt need to study the face on the paper he said at once yes i know him as you know very well i do who is he its mr partridge slater looked up hes dead isnt he the certainty of identification was what rutledge had been expecting but not the conclusion that slater had drawn from the face in his hands yet it was too easy deloran must surely have realized that armed with the sketch sooner or later rutledge would learn who the dead man in yorkshire was he couldna be sure you would come back here hamish answered the thought hes used to being obeyed why do you think mr partridge is dead rutledge asked the smith but he already knew the answer slater worked with his hands he had a feeling for skill and observation and how to translate that to whatever he was creating and it was true the likeness caught something that perhaps the living man had lost because its a good likeness thats why how could it be this good from memory the artist might have used a photograph no i dont think he did he saw the man and mr partridge isnt here is he hasnt been for a bit and you were here earlier looking for him werent you somehow i have a feeling hes dead but how and where slater shrugged ask a policeman to answer that for you i am a policeman rutledge said slowly inspector rutledge scotland yard there was a pause then slater said you have lied to us more than the words his tone of voice and his face conveyed the sense of betrayal and dislike i wasnt here as a policeman i was here to see if there was an explanation for a man leaving his house and not coming back within a reasonable length of time his motorcar and his bicycle are here but he isnt people dont disappear as a rule when they do theres always someone who wants to know why even as he said the words in his minds eye he could see the bland face of martin deloran as he figuratively washed his hands of gaylord partridge no thats a lie as well rutledge went on i dont think in the end they really cared these people whether partridge lived or died what worried them was that he wasnt where he was supposed to be he has a minder why should they send you here a minder he had suspected as much but hadnt expected confirmation im not a fool slater said even though people believe i am he drinks does mr brady the man in number four the first time mr partridge went missing he was beside himself hed got very drunk that night and passed out in his front garden i put him to bed and in the morning he must have thought hed managed it alone i never told him otherwise he took his field glasses up the hill with the horse and searched everywhere even in the smithy but mr partridge came home again and all was well mr brady stayed sober for several weeks afterward then went back to his drinking where do you think partridge went its his own business isnt it if hed wanted me to know hed have told me still if hes dead its no longer his business its a matter for the police he didnt die here how could any of us be responsible how do you know where he died i dont but if the sketch was made in yorkshire then it must be that he died there simple slater might be but stupid he was not a good point but the fact is we dont know where he died his body was found in yorkshire hence the mystery and the concern slater shook his head as rutledge finished his tea ive nothing to do with this im sorry hes dead he wasnt a difficult neighbor though i didnt know him well but i had nothing to do with his death rutledge set his cup aside and stood up i didnt expect you had but youre a man with clear eyes and it was important to ask you thank you for the tea he took up his sketch and walked to the door as he was opening it slater behind him said id not ask the man in number seven about the sketch if i were you rutledge turned why is that slater said whenever i see him i feel the darkness in him i try to stay out of his way ill remember that thank you and with that he closed the door slater had identified the sketch just as rutledge had expected moreover he believed the smith what he needed now was information of a different kind and for that he chose to call on quincy next quincy wasnt at homeor at least failed to answer his doorwhen rutledge knocked and so rutledge moved on to the next cottage where hed seen a womans face at the window on his earlier visit she opened the door only he thought because after he knocked he stood there waiting through the crack she said yes as if he had come to sell brushes or produce from a barrow he couldnt see her face clearly but he could tell from her eyes that she was frightened my name is rutledge id like to speak with you you were here before who sent you sent me was it my husband he only sends someone if theres bad news i cant bring you bad news rutledge answered her quietly i dont even know your name its cathcart she answered him maria cathcart im sorry if i frightened you miss cathcart its mrs was and still is whatever he may tell you mrs cathcart im here to ask if you recognize the man in a sketch id like to show you would you mind if i came in ill only stay for a moment i promise you grudgingly she let him in the cottage was obsessively neat as if she had nothing better to do than keep it that way houseproud and yet she didnt seem to be the sort of woman who would do her own cleaning as if she came from different circumstances than he found her in here tall and slim tired and afraid it was the only way to describe her the circles under her troubled blue eyes indicated sleepless nights she didnt ask him to sit down instead she said with some anxiety show me this mans face he opened the folder and held it out to her she didnt take it just glanced at the sheet of paper inside seemed relieved that it was not the person shed been expecting and said mr partridge i think i dont know him well but i daresay thats him hes been away for some time do you have any idea where he might have gone or why or with whom im not his keeper nor is he mine she answered him rutledge said did he have family friends who came to call you can see his cottage well from your windows you might have noticed who came and went i might have she agreed but i didnt he was of no concern to me i doubt we said good morning more than a dozen times all told you never saw anyone at his door once when i was in my garden i saw a young woman come to his door but if he was in the house he didnt answer her knock and shortly afterward she left what did she look like a welldressed fairhaired young woman i couldnt see her face i made no effort to try it had nothing to do with me was this the same woman quincy had seen and assumed was partridges daughter how long have you lived here mrs cathcart for fifteen years this june which means you were living here when mr partridge first came do you remember when that was of course i remember it was during the war the spring of and he made no effort to be friendly with his neighbors he was polite we all are but we have no desire to befriend one another he wondered why she lived here alone and with no interest in her neighbors and so theres nothing more you can tell me about mr partridge that might help us find him or learn whats become of him i have no idea what he did with his time or where he went when he wasnt here ive told you we have reason to fear he may be dead she heard him but seemed untouched by the news im sorry to hear it she said but it was perfunctory good manners coming to the fore ive answered your questions good day mr rutledge rutledge accepted his dismissal but said on the threshold did you knowor hearwhat mr partridge did for a living he appeared to be unemployed thats all i can tell you rutledge thanked her and left he went back to quincys cottage and knocked again this time the man came to the door and stepped aside to let him in making the rounds of the neighborhood are you in a way rutledge answered him dublin got up from a pillow by the fire and stretched before eyeing rutledge with suspicion i see youre still feeding partridges cat she doesnt bother me nor i her rutledge opened the folder is this partridge quincy looked at the sketch yes yes it is youve found him then if thats what you came for before we think we might have yes hes dead his body was lying in an old ruin left for the caretaker to stumble over theres a possibility that he was murdered good god he seemed genuinely shocked did he have enemies that you knew of i gather you knew him better than most first of all id like to know why youre here asking so many questions quincy said drawing back and letting rutledge close the folder im with the police you see inspector rutledge scotland yard so your interest in the white horse was all a ruse no i am interested in it i always have been but in other things as well i see this is now an official inquiry my neighbors wont care for that i can tell you why not you know very well why not we all have something to hide perhaps not murder but something that to us is just as powerful lepers all indeed perhaps youd like to tell me what it is you must hide quincy laughed i didnt kill partridge thats what i can tell you the rest is none of your business besides the care of the cat what did you talk to partridge about my birds if you must know oh youve seen them in the other room im no fool but he was curious about them and wanted to know where they had come from id like to see them oh yes he crossed to the inner door and flung it open rutledge stood there stunned hamish in the back of his mind was speechless rutledge had never seen such an array of birdsall of them dead yet perched on twigs or railings or stones like so many toys that with a turn of the key would dance and twitter and sing to please a child every shape and size blazing with color and their eyes sparkling like shoe buttons in the light from the windows they seemed to watch rutledge i have every right to them you know i brought them back to england under a license were they alive then no of course not i spent years collecting them i think i was slightly mad at the time certainly i wasnt fully in my right mind it had become an obsession you see to find them and capture them and mount them it gave me something to do a reason for living thats a keelbilled toucan over there next to him is a fierybilled tro gon you should see them flying about the trees and thats a rufous motmot the chestnut one just there with yellow in his tail is a mont ezuma oropendola the little green one is a redheaded barbet thats a resplendent quetzal with the long tail and the bigger blue one is a whitethroated magpiejay the jabiru stork is just behind it and the very small ones are hummingbirds marvelous little creatures my favorite is the little snowcap the purple one with the white head we dont have them in this hemisphere a shame you see them dart about flowers like tiny fairies wings beating so quickly you glimpse only a blur and when the sun catches them theyre like tiny jewels im told that the inca kings wore cloaks made from their feathers where do they come from south america i should think most of these are from central america the one with what looks like a worm in his beak is a threewattled bellbird over there is the crimsoncollared tanager he was one of my first successes the odd one with the large eyes isnt an owl its the common potoo he seemed to enjoy naming his prizes dublin had slipped in behind the two men and was staring at the array of color indeed it reminded rutledge himself of a feathered rainbow hamish said my granny would say hes bewitched what took you there an interest in these birds good god no i hardly knew one species from another i went there to hire myself out as an engineer on the construction of the panama canal the first try the one that didnt succeed in the end most of us came down with malaria or yellow fever and we hardly knew what we were about but you stayed i stayed because there was nowhere else to go i trekked through jungle looking for ruins and gold i climbed volcanoes and dragged myself through caves i reasoned that the spanish couldnt have found it all but they must have done all the gold i saw was on the high altars of churches great mountains of it ceiling to floor nothing like it in england i just stood and stared at the first one i came across i worked for a time translating invoices and bills of lading for a coffee plantation outside a place called antigua then moved on to manage a banana companys plantation on the caribbean coast it wasnt a life id recommend rutledge said as quincy reached out to smooth the wing of one of his specimens with that background you must have been in demand oh it wasnt as exciting as it may sound he went on dryly sometimes i guided people coming out to look at land i learned to use a foot loom in a village on the side of a volcanic lake atitlan it was whatever came to hand by that time i was drunk most of the day and all of the night and finally i went to see a shaman to find a way to sober up saint maximon they called him only it wasnt a man it was a lump of wood draped in shawls and wearing a black hat theyd told me he was wise i brought cigars and wine and a watch id stolen as gifts the room was dark filled with incense and smoke and i thought id suffocate before my turn came the man who interpreted for himittold me that my salvation was in the colors of the rainbow i thought him as mad as i was satisfied that all was well with the bird he added then i remembered the birds and the more i thought about them the more the obsession grew i went back into the jungle for them and up and down the coast and climbed into rain forests and sailed down rivers looking for them what did you intend to do with them bring them back to a museum quincy laughed hardly that no i tell you it was an obsession i just wanted them and then one day i realized that they were all dead not flying about not mating not bringing up their young or foraging for food they were dead and i never touched another drop of whisky i was stonecold sober and i had this enormous collection of dead things in my house and i realized i wanted to go home i sold most of them kept these to remind me and came back to england against all the odds and so the wise mans prediction that your salvation lay in a rainbow was right after a fashion i dont know if it was his prediction or my liver but i kept these to remember where id come from and ive never killed anything since it was a remarkable story how much of it had actually happened did you know partridge before you came here to live never clapped eyes on him it rang true but rutledge wasnt sure whether he believed quincy or not he thought hes very likely a remittance man someone the family pays well to stay out of the country where his behavior wont embarrass them it would behoove him to lie if it meant trouble for the family and therefore the question might be what had quincy done before he left england that had to be hushed up but rutledge said nothing of this listening as quincy rattled off the names of his precious birds interspersing that with the story of his years in central america it was as if the man had dammed up the past for so long that the pressure had been building behind it the need to talk that sometimes made lonely people garrulous and quincy seemed to realize this in almost the same instant ushering rutledge out of the room picking up dublin and taking her with him as he shut the door on his collection pay no heed to me he said trying to cover his lapse they were my salvation those birds and im fond of them back to partridge rutledge said and thought how appropriate the name was in this house i think its time i spoke to someone in his family there was a young woman and you suggested she might be his daughter she favored him although she was fair instead of dark i have no idea where she lives he didnt open the door to her when she came from that you might reach the conclusion that there is no warmth between them does she live in uffington do you think it was the nearest town ive never seen her there but of course thats not proof of anything ive also been told that hed lost his wife quincys brows rose indeed well that could well explain why hes reclusive and for all we know when he disappears hes visiting her grave i appreciate the help youve given me quincy walked with him to the door what had friend partridge done to get himself murdered hed gone missing before if i knew the answer to that i wouldnt be here questioning his neighbors hes an enigma we know very little about the man you might speak to mr brady then hes shown an inordinate interest in partridge and his whereabouts on previous absences most of us here try to keep our private life private but when brady came he asked questions it wasnt well received i can tell you and hes a nosy sod sitting by his window day and night as if theres nothing better to do not so much a helpful suggestion as a touch of revenge on quincys part ill bear that in mind rutledge was on the threshold when another thought struck him when is the post delivered here at the cottages he had seen no letters in partridges house but that was not proof that none had come in theory around nine but we seldom receive any mail you see lepers dont nor do we write to anyone or if we do its posted in uffington his voice was suddenly bitter as if this were a reminder of how completely hed been cut off from his family he shut his door almost on rutledges heels rutledge looked at the neat half circle of cottages and thought to himself that murder could be done here and no one would know except the other residents and they would refrain from summoning the police until the smell of decay overwhelmed them he considered calling on brady but decided that this was not the time as quincy had pointed out hed already spoken to slater and mrs cathcart everyone was prepared for a visitor now better to let the matter appear to drop but there was a man standing in his front garden watching rutledge leave quincys cottage if rutledge had kept to his original itinerary number between partridge and brady would be the next cottage to be visited and it seemed that the owner was outside prepared to confront the interloper in their midst his expression was hostile rutledge was of two minds about the best approach but the matter was taken out of his hands what is it you want the man called to him his voice was tense as if his concern outweighed his caution who are you you were hanging about before ive seen you rutledge walked toward him covering the distance in unhurried strides an elderly man tall and slightly stooped rutledge guessed his age to be seventy still vigorous but already beginning to feel the tug of time my name is rutledge he said the folder ready as he chose his opening im looking for mr partridge perhaps you can tell me where i might find him partridge is it i dont believe you you never stopped at his door first slater then mrs cathcart after that mr quincy but not partridge not at all yes im afraid hes not there thats why i didnt go to his door do you know him well mr he paused waiting for a name willingham grudgingly mr willingham do you know how i can find mr partridges solicitor or failing that any of his family what are you selling willingham eyed the folder im not selling anything this is a drawing then why dont you go away and leave the rest of us alone we dont trouble mr partridge and we dont expect mr partridges visitors to trouble us does he have visitors if he does i dont stare out my window looking to see who they are now be off with you rutledge or whatever your name is we dont care for the likes of you here im afraid youll have to put up with my presence unpleasant as it may be until youve answered my questions then ill summon the police and have you removed i am the police mr willingham from scotland yard willingham stared at him then without another word he turned on his heel and went inside his cottage slamming the door in rut ledges face for a man eager to summon the police hamish was pointing out he was no very happy to find one on his doorstep interesting rutledge turned and walked back the way hed come climbing the hill of the white horse and looking down on the cottages from the heights he wondered what miss tomlin would think of what had become of her charitable gift she had considered it a sanctuary and perhaps in a way it had turned out to be one after all but the question now was how to go about tracking down partridges daughter without going back to martin deloran and asking him for the information he willna tell you that hamish warned him it wouldna be wise to ask in that quarter where had partridge lived before coming here in the spring of what sort of work had he done and where was his family there was the off chance his daughter might pay another call but rutledge thought it was unlikely after being turned away and so where to start if sergeant gibson at the yard began making inquiries it would attract attention in the wrong quarters had partridge been in the army was that delorans interest he could have been drummed out for reasons even the army preferred to keep quiet and that might explain the watcher brady whatever toes partridge had trod upon they were still very sensitive about what had happened better to let him die and be buried in yorkshire as an unidentified victim of murder than bring the whole matter up again did partridge know about the watcher had he cared was gaylord partridge for that matter his real name it was the first time rutledge had considered that although looking at quincys birds he had been amused by the coincidence of partridge and an aviary perhaps this man had thought so as well and on the spur of the moment rechristened himself it wouldnt be long before brady reported the new name to london it would also explain why deloran had felt so certain that it was safe to send rutledge to berkshireit wasnt likely hed learn more than he should know while he was searching for partridge and now even if the other residents identified the face in the sketch as partridge that was as far as rutledge could take the matter meanwhile yorkshire would soon see the missing man into a paupers grave and there would be the end of it gaylord partridge would no longer be a problem for the war office but he was still very much a problem for the police if deloran had his way the daughter would never be told what had become of her father that might not matter to her now but if there was a will to be sorted in time her fathers fate would become important legally martin deloran be damnedpartridge hadnt walked back to that cloister on his own there was someone else involved and whether the man died by accident or was killed rutledge was determined to get to the bottom of what had happened if there was a murderer somewhere who could say if hed killed before this or if he would kill again where to begin a search the only information rutledge had at his disposal was the small photograph on the dead mans desk he had no way of judging who the man and boy were or even if one of them was partridge the photograph was not clear enough to tell for all he knew the two people in it were close friends or even cousins the possibilities were endless and yetout of everything he might have owned before coming to this placepartridge had chosen to bring only one personal possession with him a framed photograph it had mattered to him in some fashion to have it there where then was the square in which the photograph was taken not in uffington rutledge thought ruling it out immediately none of the houses there resembled that background anywhere in england hamish pointed out gloomily no sae verra easy to find fra what could be seen in yon photograph true there were georgian houses in kent to start with the day we climbed the white horse but not every market square in england possessed georgian houses and a white horse cut into chalk that could be climbed on the same day as the photograph was taken in the town all right then the second bit of evidence in hand if the inscription was to be trusted what else was unique about this white horse where he was standing for one thing it was the only one galloping with such elegant strides across its hill most of the others he knew about looked more like cart horses what else then legend claimed that in the ninth century king alfred had ordered this horse carved out of the hillside it was in fact iron age workmanship but the legend persisted there were any number of white horses in wiltshireit was famous for them rutledge went down to his motorcar and dug maps out of the pouch on the door hed bought the set to serve him on walking holidays later hed found it helpful driving he spread out the sheets for south england found salisbury plain and began running a finger up and down the adjacent squares in an orderly search starting from the right when he came to the eastern boundaries of salisbury plain he found a place to begin westbury the bratton white horse whichlegend saidking alfred ordered to mark a victory over the danes he had never been to westbury did it have georgian houses in its market square it had been a wool town in its day and made gloves as well which meant there was money enough for handsome buildings to mark its success he shoved the maps back in the pouch got out to crank the motorcar and set off to the west bearing south stopping only for petrol along the way he scanned other town squares but he saw nothing that would fit what he was searching for but when he drove into the center of westbury he had no doubt that hed made the right guess he not only found the marketplace but the exact building facing him in the late afternoon sun he had had no lunch and missed his tea as well but he pressed on the main problem to solve now was how to go about proving he was right if he went to the police station there would be questions he wasnt ready for them for that matter what could he say that he was giving his imagination free rein in a case that didnt exist at least not officially if he began asking about a man called partridge in the shops gossip would spread like wildfire perhaps to the wrong ears and the post office had rules that was still the best place to begin he arrived just in time to see the elderly man behind the grill putting up a sign closed rutledge called to him and he reluctantly set the sign aside mouth turned down eager to be off to his late tea and comfortable chair behind him on the floor lay a large nondescript dog clearly both companion and bodyguard because he lifted his head to stare up at rutledge sniffing the strangers scent satisfied that all was well he lowered his head to his paws once more and sighed for all the world commenting on the delay in departure the names rutledge ive come down from london to find a mr partridge we havent been able to reach him and i wonder if you can tell me whether or not hes moved the postmaster regarded him sourly moved you say yes its the only explanation we can come up with i dont know of a mr partridge hereabouts he reached for his sign again but rutledge said quickly i think we have the name right i have a sketch here perhaps youd be willing to look at it what do you have that for the mans tone was suspicious rutledge brought up the file without answering the postmaster and opened it thats not mr partridge i thought you said mr partridge didnt live in westbury i never said that i told you i didnt know of a partridge hereabouts then how can you be so certain this isnt partridges likeness because it isnt i just told you rutledge was losing patience quite he said then perhaps you know the name of the man in this sketch i do will you kindly direct me to his house you never told me why you have a drawing of him rutledge had never been so tempted to take out his identification and tell the postmaster that this was police business and none of his i expect thats a family matter no one could find a recent photograph then you should have said so i should like to find mr partridge this afternoon if thats possible i told you he wasnt mr partridge the postmasters expression was smug he was quite enjoying being bloodyminded who pray is he thats mr gerald parkinson and he doesnt live in westbury parkinson where does he live between here and dilton get to the point if you will where shall i find him rutledges mounting anger must have shown in his face or his voice the dog lifted his head again and stared the postmaster said here now theres no call to be rude follow the main road south and halfway to dilton theres a turning to the left take that for three miles and youll see the gates of the house thank you rutledge turned on his heel and left he took ten minutes to find himself a sandwich and a cup of tea and then blessing aprils longer evenings drove south out of town he found the turning no more than a lane and not clearly marked as if it led nowhere in particular but it was reasonably well made indicating traffic and he passed first one and then another houseneither with gateswhose windows were golden in the early evening sunlight the next house was surrounded by a low wall with a pair of white posts and a graceful white gate where the drive came down to the road the gate was firmly shut there was a placard set into the right post bronze he thought it said part ridgefields in elegant script rutledge stopped the motorcar and hamish startled him as he spoke you will no trespass it was the british outrage at a strangers encroachment the gate is closed but apparently not locked ill walk up to the house and knock at the door as any guest would all very civilized hamish was silent rutledge opened the gate and started up the drive as in the other houses on this lane tall shrubs lined the way cutting off a view of the house but when he reached the end of the plantings he found himself in a circular drive before a georgian brick house there was a semicircular portico held up by slender fluted columns and a black paneled door reached by three shallow steps he went up them lifted the brass knocker and let it fall it seemed as he stood there that it echoed through an empty house beyond and no one answered the summons though he stood there for a good five minutes waiting he went down the steps and looked up at the shining windows wondering if someone was there looking down at him then he turned to his right and started around the house there was a terrace on this side french doors leading down to a frenchstyle garden of roses and perennials beyond the garden was a square shrubbery of boxwoods and he could see wroughtiron benches and a stone fountain inside the small sheltered garden they created inside the bowl of the fountain was a horse head to one side tail and mane flying it was a lovely thing but no water splashed over it the fountain was dry he went on to the back of the house and saw that the kitchen door was shut no signs of servants going about their duties the kitchen garden more than a little overgrown compared to the formal plantings and the outbuilding doors were barred the house for all intents and purposes was closed up rutledge came back to the french doors and stood with his hand shielding his forehead trying to look inside dust sheets covered the furnishings and even the small chandelier was swathed in what looked to be a pillowcase why had partridgeparkinsonleft behind this jewel of a house to live in a tiny cottage in the middle of nowhere hamish had had enough of trespassing rutledge turned to go with one last look over the gardens someone kept them up though not the kitchen garden and came here often enough to see that no weeds marred the symmetry of the beds or weather damaged the plants there wasnt so much as a twig underfoot on the small well mown lawns at the far side of the house ringed by flowering trees a croquet lawn it was smooth enough for that and a long pair of windows from what appeared to be a study looked out over the green carpet there the draperies had been drawn and he could see nothing he took one last look at the house it seemed to be standing there waiting for its owner and if he was right that the dead man in yorkshire was parkinson then its owner could never come again hamish said he lost his wife and that might have explained the mans exiletoo many memories here to let him heal but it didnt explain his death rutledge drove back to the smiths arms too late again for his dinner mrs smith was waiting up for him as if half afraid that he wasnt coming back his account unsettled she said there youre in i was just tidying up a little ill be off to bed then saying good night she mounted the stairs and he looked into the bar before following her it was already shut and dark he went up to his bed and stretched out fully clothed too weary for more than that why had partridgeparkinsonchanged his name to fit into his surroundings without attracting attention but then that was the name that deloran had given him too either deloran was content to go along with partridges need for anonymity or it suited the war office very well who was he what sort of man had he been before the spring of and what was it that had triggered this abrupt change in his life losing his wife yes that would account for much how had he made his living to be able to afford a house of that size with wellkept gardens even if he was independently wealthy he must have held some position during the war years in industry perhaps or in some capacity with the military men with certain skills worked at codebreaking others at perfecting aircraft and weaponry or translating documents there was always a need for clever minds stage designers had turned their talents to creating camouflage patterns for ships and gun emplacements and even trenches as spotter planes flew longer sorties over enemy lines the list was endless was that why the army was concerned about his whereabouts had he worked in something that was still under wraps and therefore his erratic behavior had drawn attention to the need to keep an eye on him it seemed farfetched this was april the war had ended in november of according to mrs cathcart parkinsonpartridge had moved into his cottage in the spring of what might have seemed important in the waning months of the war when the outcome was still in doubt wouldnt explain delorans secretiveness now rutledge gave it up and lay there staring at the ceiling listening to the night sounds an occasional vehicle passing on the road a dog barking in the distance and then the sudden patter of rain on the roof the fine weather had broken it was still raining when rutledge woke up in the morning sometime in the night hed changed out of his clothes and gone to bed only half awake as he fumbled with the sheets mrs smith was serving breakfast when he came down and he discovered just how hungry he was the warm charger she set in front of him was demolished in short order and he sat there drinking his tea and eating the last of the toast the door opened and the thin manwill wasnt itwith whom hed played darts earlier in the week stepped into the inn and shook the last of the rain off his hat he nodded a greeting to rutledge and went to find mrs smith rutledge could hear their conversation over the banging of pots and pans when he came back he had a thermos of tea in one hand and a cup in the other he sat down at rutledges table with a polite dyou mind not at all he answered driving all night are you more or less the rain wasnt so bad at first but by dawn it was heavier ive stared at the road for longer than i like it was coming to look the same every curve and straightaway played darts since that night no opportunity if my mother hadnt taught me my manners id wonder aloud what a man of your stripe is doing here at the smiths arms its convenient to what to nowhere the man smiled i know when to stop she taught me that as well i came here to solve a riddle rutledge said and its not likely to be solved as easily as id hoped about the white horse theres a legend you know that on certain nights it comes down to the smithy to be shod indeed theres more than a few say theyve seen it but i reckon they were not as sober as they claimed to be are you here to keep an eye on us the lorry drivers rutledge laughed hardly that should i be a man gets an itch between his shoulder blades sometimes and looks around to see who might be watching watching for what surely you cant be smuggling this far inland smuggling no the war put an end to that as a matter of fact ships couldnt put in to a small cove and offload goods there likely to find a submarine staring back at them as they upanchored or a coastal warden coming to see what they were up to he finished his tea and prepared to go im off ever see anything strange here at the white horse on nights you or your mates were driving through will grinned like seeing it come down to be shod no more human agency than spectral he shook his head its quiet through here which is why some of us choose this way better time with the roads so empty he walked to the door then paused i was told not long ago that a fair woman in a motorcar was stopped at the side of the road and she was crying close by waylands smithy the driver drew up alongside her motorcar and asked if there was aught wrong and she said no she was fine he drove on but he told me later hed seen that motorcar before and it wasnt a woman driving then where had he seen it here outside the inn how long ago did this happen the driver shrugged a fortnight more or less interesting story i think it must be true hes not the sort given to lying he said she didnt look like a whore who knows since the war theyre bolder arent they not enough men to go around like and he was gone his lorry roaring into life and rolling down the road spray from the tires throwing up mud and muck like a brown bow wave rutledge watched him out of sight now he had a second report of a fairhaired woman in the vicinity of the tomlin cottages difficult to connect this one with the woman who had knocked at parkinsons door stillit could mean that shed come back to try again and encountered him along the road where no one else saw the meeting and the interview hadnt gone well any query through sergeant gibson at the yard about parkinsons family would surely jangle tins on the wires that directly or indirectly reached deloran and then deloran would have rutledge back in london and on the carpet it was one thing to pursue a man who didnt exist quite another to look into the past of one who not only existed but was also safely dead what then were his choices hamish said return to london that made sense he hadnt been able to contact sergeant gibson to see what had turned up about henry shoreham and there was still the nameless victim on inspector madsens hands to be officially identified not to mention the mystery of why partridge or parkinson had died in yorkshire the best place to draw these threads together was in london hamish said a man could bribe a lorry driver to take away a body it wouldna be the first time sich a thing was done if partridge had been found by the road id agree but what lorry driver would risk carrying a dead man deep into fountains abbeys ruins and setting him down by a cloister wall ye ken it would depend on how much the man was offered to take sich a risk and if that was the case the driver had long since vanished into a new life there has to be some trace somewhere he hadnt been aware hed spoken aloud mrs smith stuck her head around the door and said more toast sir thanks no ill be leaving in two hours but first theres something i must do ill have the accounting ready for you when you come back thank you he folded his serviette and set it beside his plate where to begin that was always the policemans dilemma it could spoil chances as well as open doors he went up to his room packed his valise and then left it on the bed the rain was heavier now and he could feel it across his shoulders through the wool of his coat he thought of the old cliche about april showers last april he had hardly known who he was or where he was had he come this far in only a year if it had rained at all last april he couldnt remember it at the clinic the days ran into one another and the nights were torments the cries of other disturbed patients in the darkness nothing to distract his churning mind no routine to force him to shut down his memories nothing between him and a fear so great he couldnt close his eyes that was before he learned that hamish couldnt follow him into sleep and so he had fought sleep he had paced the floor of his room until his feet were numb and his legs ached and still he walked anything to stave off sleep hed even pinched his arms until they bled to keep himself awake and then at dawn he would fall into a stupor and sit in his chair staring at the wall a sleep of sorts but never deep enough to dream night after night and in the rooms around his other men suffered as well banging on their walls crying out for something to stop the anguisha true madhouse of fear that was worse than anything found in an asylum the doctors had had to keep him drugged to let him sleep and if he could have found the powders the sisters brought him he would have swallowed them all to end it not a bad way to die a way where dreams couldnt follow him he cranked the motorcar and got in sitting there shaking it had nothing to do with the rain hamish said roughly aye that was the heart of it you wanted to die i wanted to live and we neither of us got our wish and so were damned both of us because god got it wrong i wish you had lived and i had died i would have come to haunt you and when you married your fiona i would have been the skeleton at the feast no hamish said his voice cold i would ha forgotten you and left you rotting in france rutledge wasnt sure how he had driven to the tomlin cottages when his mind cleared he was there the motor still ticking over quietly and the white horse washed clean in the rain he got out and walked to one cottage he hadnt called on yet he knocked on the door and waited it was opened finally by a broadshouldered man whose prematurely white hair was brushed back from a young face it was hard to judge his age but when he spoke it was clear that he was of a class that possessed victorian manners good morning are you lost rutledge introduced himself id like to ask you a few questions he went on mainly about one of your neighbors mr partridge silly name the man said i should think he dreamed it up were not a friendly community you see ive often wondered how many of us use the name we were born with come in out of the rain man he stepped aside and allowed rutledge to enter the main room of the cottage it was a parlor with a georgian desk in one corner and a tall shelf of books along the inner wall singleton is the name he continued tell me why youve been looking for partridge you know he was away then rutledge asked taking the chair offered him his friends have been anxious about him were they indeed i shouldnt have thought he had many friends no one ever comes to call he smiled the austerity of his face relaxing i can see the horse from my desk and his cottage as well we have very little to occupy us you see and while none of us is anxious to have his own business bruited about we are curious about our neighbors to the point of nosiness there was i understand a young woman who came to his door yes i remember but she wasnt admitted and i found myself thinking that she had stopped to ask directions she never came again you see it was a possibility that rutledge hadnt considered in the pause singleton asked in the war were you france rutledge answered then you were lucky to survive i salute you it was quite different in my war skirmishes in the empire mostly though some of them turned nasty of course for the most part we played polo set a good example and dined rather well india for the last ten years i spent some time at the khyber pass for my sins the tribesmen were a wretched lot troublesome in the extreme and knew the country far better than we did keeping them bottled up was a bloody business any way you looked at it rutledge gestured to the cottage this is not the england you fought for it was a statement singleton shook his head sadly no its far from that we learn to cope you know its what were trained to do im writing about my experiences not for publication you understand but for my own satisfaction were too busy living to fully understand our lives you see where we came from where we were going what went wrong its a way of making sense of the past as if hed said enough about himself he changed the subject is there anything else i can tell you about partridge we spoke the usual platitudesgood morning lovely weather were having i see your hollyhocks were knocked about by the wind last night yes a pity isnt it cold enough to be thinking about a fire again heavy mist this morning wasnt it nothing of consequence was he interested in the chalk horse on the hill strange that you should ask that i sometimes saw him standing in front of his door staring up at it at odd times of the day or by those trees just down the lane where he could see the beast at night it has an ambient glow you know starlight i suppose im sure most of us have noticed that slater the young smith is fascinated by it as well i expect we are all aware of the horse in one way or another living here but some more than others im told partridge left a time or two for several days did you see him leave or return i dont think he wanted us to know when he went away the chap in number nine takes care of the cat when it comes to him for food but theres no formal announcement about leaving hes there and hes not there any idea where he might have gone on these occasions good lord no we dont pry not in that way if it cant be seen at a distance then we leave it alone that makes for good neighbors rutledge said dryly actually it doesnt one of us could die here and no one would wonder until the smell reached him have you spoken to the man in number four he seems to spend an inordinate amount of time studying partridges cottage ive seen him at his window using field glasses number was bradys cottage delorans man no i havent ive just stopped at the cottages closest to partridges yes weve all seen you coming round i had wondered when it would be my turn rutledge smiled ive called on a few of the residents yes quincy slater mrs cathcart willingham he gave you short shrift didnt he i think ive spoken to him fewer times than i spoke to partridge and theres brady who are the other two theres miller in number seven just up from mrs cathcart hes a curmudgeon by nature and we leave him alone id go to anyone else before him if i needed help and the last of our happy little family is allen my neighbor in number six he would have made our dear patroness proud im told hes dying of tuberculosis sometimes of a summers evening one can hear him cough not precisely leprosy but a wasting disease nonetheless i appreciate your time mr singleton rutledge said rising and ill be on my way i have business to attend to in london but i expect to be back before long if you see anyone at mr partridges door make a note of it i shall if the occasion arises singleton saw rutledge to the door and added i hope you conclude your business with us shortly weve all secrets here and none of us enjoys the attention of strangers ill bear that in mind rutledge replied and before he was five paces down the path the door behind him was quietly closed hamish said were no what youd call sociable in the highlands but were no sae unfriendly as this lot as he said they have secrets not necessarily murder but to them just as important aye important enough to kill for it was a thought that had already occurred to rutledge sitting in singletons tidy parlor but how would any of these eight householders manage to take a body to yorkshire partridge has a motorcar and its still here aye so it is but that doesna mean it never left rutledge settled his account with mrs smith and turned the bonnet of his motorcar toward london he hadnt been in his flat five minutes when he saw the note propped up on the small table by his bed it was in francess handwriting and said only if you are home to read this call gibson at the yard she had been to his flat in his absence and found a messenger on his doorstep what had brought her here simon barrington a need to talk to someone another invitation to a dinner she didnt want to attend alone rutledge put the thought aside and looked at the time he could just catch sergeant gibson if he hurried turning on his heel he went back to his motorcar and drove to the yard gibson was just coming down the walk as rutledge was looking for a space in which to leave his vehicle the sergeant recognized him at once and came to the nearside of the car he was a big man and he bent down to see rutledges shadowed face theres trouble he said bowles not this time for one thing i couldnt find henry shoreham no one has seen him since he left whitby vanished from the face of the earth damn youre quite sure gibson drew back offended im sure sorry i meant to say given the case in yorkshire that this is the worst possible news that it is for one thing if hes nowhere to be found he cant speak for himself and inspector madsen has taken it in his head to send his men for the schoolmaster to help in his inquiries rutledge swore again i told madsen the book on alchemy had nothing to do with the dead man he said as much but since no one can produce mr shoreham inspector madsen is convinced hes the victim and what does the chief constable say or bowles for that matter theyre reserving judgment there was no point in going to deloran hed washed his hands of this business he would say now that since partridge hadnt died in yorkshire there must be some truth to madsens suspicions and leave crowell to deal with the consequences but where was there any connection between a man named parkinson from wiltshire and albert crowell partridgeparkinson hadnt attacked mrs crowell in whitby the man shoreham had been taken into custody he was a clerk known in his community hed admitted his responsibility but turn the coin the other way rutledge said do we have a photograph of shoreham was there one taken when the newspapers carried the story about mrs crowells injuries ive not been told there were any all right then look at it from a different perspective rutledge told himself in the dark how much did henry shoreham resemble gaylord partridge or rather gerald parkinson could a man with a grudge mistake one for the other but then where had he taken his victim to kill him not to the school and parkinson hadnt died along the road why when the evidence might in the end point in his direction had crowell left the body in the ruins of a medieval abbey where it was bound to be found and only miles from where he lived was he so arrogant that he didnt believe a connection would be made or when he realized hed killed the wrong man had he felt sure he was safe hamish said theres mrs crowell he would ha done his best to keep her out of it even if shed killed her tormenter rutledge didnt relish the long drive back to yorkshire but there was no other choice now damn deloran is bowles sending anyone north he asked gibson he sent a constable to see if youd returned home then ill report to him first thing in the morning he said goodbye to gibson and went back to his flat there he found frances sitting in his parlor drinking his whisky she lifted her glass to him i saw your valise by the door so this time i stayed im leaving tomorrow for yorkshire she pretended to pout pursing her lips and looking at him out of the corner of her eyes i might have known here my life is in total crisis and youre nowhere to be found hows simon the pretense vanished would that i knew frances she put down the glass no i didnt come for a lecture i just needed to hear a friendly voice frances he said again but in an entirely different tone i dont want to talk about it take me to dinner and make me laugh he rephrased her response would that i could i sometimes do wish that mother had had a large family rutledge laughed all right dinner it is let me change but at the door to his bedroom he stopped do you know a gerald parkin son parkinson no i dont think i do her interest sharpened should i i doubt it i ran across the name in wiltshire and i didnt want to ask the yard who he is at least not yet forget him for one night im sure hes not going anywhere at the moment as he went through his door he said to himself no hes not going anywhere hes dead and i dont know for certain what name will be on his stone inner was quiet frances in a mood of reminiscence and rut ledge distracted by his thoughts and hamishs crushing presence hiding his demons from his sister proved to be trying but the next morning he presented himself at the yard found a glowering bowles waiting for him as he walked down the passage toward the chief superintendents door and with a sinking heart followed him into his office well ill not be made a fool of rutledge whos this dead man stirring up trouble in yorkshire ive reason to believe hes one gaylord partridge who also answers to the name of gerald parkinson his neighbors and a postmaster confirm that and inspector madsen has reason to believe hes one henry shoreham he cant be both damn it ill go to yorkshire and get to the bottom of it see that you do whos gerald parkinson when hes at home never heard of him hes from wiltshire hes known there he has an estate there for some reason he left it and moved to berkshire not far from uff ington content to live in a small cottage under a different name his neighbors found him aloof and none of them seems to know he had a past different from the one hes given out to them which is precious little are you certain this sketch of yours is a good likeness youll look a fool and so would i if its off the mark no one in yorkshire admitted to recognizing the bodyor the sketch humph bowles rubbed his eyes well its time to get to the truth find out why inspector madsen is hellbent on causing trouble or what he knows that we dont either way settle it dont come back until you do ill do my best no man youll do more than your best if were to have a hornets nest burst about our ears we want to make certain we can survive it he leaned forward in his chair i have no more use for this deloran than you do i dont like outsiders meddling in an inquiry and above all i dont relish being made to look a fool do you understand me bowles had been an unexpected and unwilling ally when they faced a common enemy in the war office now he was back to his irascible self rutledge took a deep breath im fairly certain deloran is hiding information that might make our work easier but i cant find a way to get at it without bringing partridge to his attention again if youre asking me to beard the lion in his den youve another think coming youre expendable rutledge and dont you forget it during the long drive north rutledge had much on his mind and there was only hamish to break the silence that pursued him mile after mile when the next morning he pulled into elthorpe he had the odd feeling that nothing had changed since his first arrival only days ago as he switched off the motor he could have sworn the same faces were on the street the same wares displayed in the shop windows and the same rain clouds hovered in the distance he sat for a moment looking at nothing considering how best to say what must be said to inspector madsen a cold wind blew across the dales and into the narrow streets reminding him that here april had not brought the same spring softness that was awakening the south of england finally he got out of the motorcar and crossed the road to the police station there was a distinct pause in conversation when he entered and asked for the inspector madsen was not pleased to see him he met rutledges gaze with righteous hostility as he came through the door waiting for him to speak first ive been told that albert crowell has been taken into custody oh yes you explained away that book on alchemy very well its harder to explain away henry shorehams disappearance less than a week before we found our corpse in the abbey rutledge said ive had a positive identification of your victim he lived in berkshire and as far as i know never met alice crowell from a sketch you yourself saw both the sketch and the victim are you telling me that the sketch is faulty then what was your berkshire man doing hanging about in yorkshire i dont have the answer to that yet my sergeant told me rutledge went on that shoreham had left whitby shortly after the crowells refused to press charges against him and no one has seen him since where has he been these last few years madsen sat down in his chair and leaned back suddenly smug london isnt as thorough as a good yorkshire man can be when he puts his mind to it we ran shoreham to earth in the village of addl eford living quietly with a cousin only he went to stay with another cousin and vanished this cousin one lewellyn williams swore he never arrived and he left addleford because a family from whitby moved there and he feared hed be recognized why didnt one or the other of these cousins raise the alarm when shoreham failed to arrive in wales surely they were concerned about him the one in wales thought shoreham had changed his mind about coming just then the one in addleford thought he was snug in wales constable pickerel got the distinct impression that the cousin in ad dleford hadnt been in any great hurry to contact williams how did crowell find shoreham if it was impossible for the yard to locate him its our view that crowell ran into him quite by chance lucky for him not so fortunate for shoreham the crowells werent living in dilby when the accident happened shoreham had no way of knowing his danger for the sake of argument lets say youre right madsen smiled very well where did shoreham die and why did crowell take the risk of leaving him in the abbey ruins it was not the cleverest thing to do the legs of madsens chair smacked the floor with a sharp thump early days yet rutledge but well have that soon enough id like the name of the cousin in addleford and the direction of the welsh cousin as well wheres the need weve been over that ground already so you have rutledge responded with more patience than he felt but the yard will require assurances that all the evidence has been thoroughly examined more to the point we appear to have some confusion about identity ill remind you that mrs crowell didnt recognize the drawing and crowell himself said he couldnt identify the body when he was taken to the doctors surgery well they would say as much wouldnt they crowell because he had no intention of drawing attention to himself and almrs crowell that isbecause shes not about to betray her husband rutledge saw something in madsens face as he said the last few words that was very different from his manner to this point nothing in my conversations with her made me feel she would lie for her husbands sake and what about crowells feelings about killing theyre on record this is the man who ruined his wifes face for gods sake its all very well to make a public display of forgiving the bastard but deep down inside crowell was probably biding his time for a bit of quiet revenge madsen shook his head i dont hold with conscientious objectors i never have they were perfectly willing to let someone else die in their place werent they ill stay home cozy by my hearth thank you very much and leave you to do the fighting i remind you he drove an ambulance yes thats all very well a bit of conscience overcoming him for a guess it was a sneer and alice thought him quite the hero didnt she bringing back the wounded and saving lives and those of us who had to carry on back in england doing the job we were meant to do were not good enough madsen stopped short but not before rutledge had seen more than he was meant to see alice and those of us who had to carry on here in england were not good enough as madsen struggled to rein in his temper hamish said ye ken hes jealous and he canna live with it the inspector looked away from rutledge his gaze going to a half dozen folders lying on top of the table at his elbow it could be shes afraid to tell us what she really thinks theres no getting around the fact that every time she looks in her mirror the scar is there staring back at her he picked up one of the folders and opened it peter littleton thats the cousin in addleford and this man williams lives outside aberystwyth in a place called hill farm rutledge took the sheet of paper that madsen held out to him ill let you know what i discover precious little ill be bound madsen said under his breath as rutledge left rutledge made a detour to dilby to find alice crowell she was trying to keep the school open in her husbands absence there were shadows under her eyes and a tightness in her face that spoke of her distress the white scar seemed to shine in the morning light as if newly burnished by the reminders of how it had begun there was a flare of hope in her face as she saw rutledge in the passage outside the bookroom and she glanced beyond him to see if her husband was following in his wake and then it vanished as she realized he was alone have you seen albert she asked anxiously they wont allow me to speak to him i havent seen him im sorry he told her gently but hell be safe enough where he is until inspector madsen gets to the bottom of this business she shook her head but he wont do that will he wheres the point mrs crowell opened the door behind her and ushered him into the empty room she indicated a chair for him but he stood as she did there wasnt a great deal to be said by either of them whats behind madsens dislike of your husband rutledge asked coming directly to the point we were about to be engaged once my parents didnt care for my choice and i was young i listened to them instead of my heart i realized later when id met albert that theyd been wiser than i but at the time i was heartbroken i understand that inspector madsen has since married yes thats true but his pride was hurt when i had to tell him my father wasnt happy with the match father promised hed speak directly to harry but you see my father was in the army and there was no opportunity harrymr madsenwrote to him finally but there was no reply my mother who was alive at the time always thought that the war had prevented papa from answering i knew that wasnt true he didnt want to encourage either of us he felt i was making a poor choice a workingclass man is your father still living yes hes offered to come and fetch me now but i wont leave albert she sighed i thought when you first came here that my father had sent you i wrote to him when i saw how albert was being persecuted i asked him to intervene and did he i dont know she answered him frankly hes the colonel of an east anglian regiment i thought he might know someone bring a little pressure to bear in the right quarters but look how its all turned out i expect there was nothing he could do her voice trailed off forlornly and she looked at the windows there was a bright sunshine outside but it failed to light the room as if sensing the despair that filled it rutledge was tempted to ask her outright if she knew one martin deloran but thought better of it instead he approached the subject indirectly do you know a man called gaylord partridge what an odd name i should remember that if weve ever been introduced should i know him hope seemed to spring awake again is there any way he can help me later perhaps and gerald parkinson did you or your father know him she frowned digging for the memory i went to school with girls by the name of parkinson they were much younger we didnt have a lot in common but they used to tell everyone the most absurd stories about their father he was eccentric if half of it was to be believed always tinkering with things i cant think that hes the same person youre asking me about i agree it doesnt sound like it martin deloran do you know him deloran no thats not a name i recognize either ill do what i can for your husband mrs crowell but dont count on miracles but i told you she began indignantly yes so you did the fact is you arent a reliable witness if the victim of murder is henry shoreham then you have a reason to conceal your knowledge of him or anyone associated with him her mouth was open to protest vehemently he held up a hand to stop her i understand but you must examine this matter in the same way that the police must do first a book is found by a dead mans feet one that has your husbands name in it that can be explained away very well then theres some reason to believe that henry shoreham disappeared shortly before the corpse was discovered if the man in the sketch is henry shoreham then you lied to me and to madsen if it isnt then where is shoreham lets look at it another way until we can identify the victim with absolute certainty we must investigate all the possibilities someone is dead and he deserves to have justice the police are bound to see to it that he will alice crowell no fool looked at rutledge with weary resignation i dont know that this poor man will receive justice of any kind hes too convenient a whipping boy to make my husband suffer could albert crowell have killed him either because he was certain he was shoreham or thought he looked like the man her gaze moved toward the books on the shelves he believes in forgiveness he forgave henry shoreham and when he has done that he wouldnt take it back and kill the man her mouth took on a grim expression for some time after this happened she touched her face i could have killed henry shoreham myself i was asked to forgive him and i said the words but in the depths of my soul i knew it to be a lie and i hid it from everyone her eyes came back to his face as she added i wouldnt ask my husband to do murder for my sake if inspector madsen wasnt so blinded by his own anger over my turning down his proposal of marriage hed realize that he has the wrong crowell in custody im the one who had the best reason to kill henry shoreham addleford was a small dale village that had begun to shrink in the nineteenth century as men found work in the mills or mines it had continued to shrink into the twentieth on the outskirts of town were barns without roofs and houses with boardedup windows but the heart of the town with its plain church and churchyard its one pub and its tiny shops seemed to be hanging on for dear life the houses on either side of the winding street were well kept and the white lace curtains in their windows were cheerful against the gray stone of the walls there was no police station here but rutledge went to that other source of gossip and information the local pub he ate tough beef with a mustard sauce and fresh baked bread enjoying the peace and quiet of the small dining area next to the bar the man who served him limped one leg shorter than the other giving him a swaying walk that spoke of years of pain he set down the charger with rutledges food and went about his business taciturn and without curiosity about the stranger who had walked in and asked if luncheon was still being served hamish was telling him that this was a wildgoose chase better to leave the troublesome henry shoreham to inspector madsen but rutledge wanted every loose end tied up before he went south again and so as he finished his flan he asked the man who brought it where he might find one peter littleton hes the shoemaker two doors down from the greengrocer you have business with him then indeed the barkeep looked at him hell be finished his dinner in a quarter of an hour he always goes home for it then ill walk in the churchyard while im waiting he paid his reckoning and went out in the chilly air the churchyards wall cupped a small purple flower growing in a crevice and when he stopped to look at it he recognized heartsease it seemed forlorn there as if it had lost its way from someones garden hamish said its fionas favorite among the flowers rutledge went through the gate and walked among the stones until he saw the shoemaker striding back to his shop crossing the road after him rutledge waited until hed opened the shop before going inside the musical ring of a small bell above the door announced his presence and the shoemaker raised his head from the leather he was trimming he bore a faint resemblance to the dead manaround the same height the same unremarkable shape of face brown hair and blue eyes nothing to set him apart from hundreds of other englishmen m looking for henry shoreham rutledge said im told you can help me find him littletons face changed from the smile he used to welcome custom to a wariness that went deep whos asking he smoothed the leather with his fingertips as if judging its quality without looking at it rutledge inspector scotland yard the shop was redolent with the scents of leather wood and polish a cobblers bench sat by the window and there were lasts on the shelves against the back wall patterns lay on a table below and two chairs high enough to allow the shoemaker to work on the footwear of a client without squatting were set into the near wall facing the counter he never went to trial for what he did it was defensive as if rutledge had come to take shoreham back to whitby so it never ended you might say no one let him forget what had happened there was the young woman of course she suffered and was scarred mind you but henry also paid dearly for his drunkenness and he never set out to hurt anybody he wasnt that sort im not here to charge him the problem is we cant seem to locate him at present is he still living with you if youve come this far you know hes not here inspector madsen will have told you quite why did shoreham choose to come to addleford because you were here because he didnt have two pennies to rub together they didnt want him back at the bank bad for business they said everyone recognized him there was nothing else he knew how to do but clerking when no one would take him on and his savings ran out he left whitby and came to me to get back on his feet but he couldnt get the hang of shoemaking and then a neighbor of his from whitby moved here as well and the story was spread about again he decided to go to another cousin in wales sheep arent easy to manage but they dont have to fit someones foot just right hamish said ye canna judge how he felt about his cousin it was true there was a distance in what littleton was saying as if he were discussing a stranger rutledge asked when did he leave i could tell hed made up his mind and i let him go and the house was crowded with seven people under our roof ill admit it my wife was just as glad to see him move on but then hes not her kin hes mine when did he leave rutledge repeated his question it must be getting on to a week now littleton shrugged a fortnight even one of the little ones has been ill ive had more to worry about than keeping in mind when henry set out i had no way of knowing see that it would matter to have the exact day did constable pickerel or inspector madsen tell you there was a dead man at elthorpe who might be your cousin surely that should have worried you constable pickerel said nothing of that when he first came here he was all for leaving for wales straightaway my cousin llewellyn knew henry was coming but there wasnt a fixed date you could have blown me over with a feather when the constable reported henry never got there then inspector madsen came going on about a dead man i was afraid that it might be henry that hed finally done himself some harm out of remorse that he never intended going to wales yet you felt no need to travel to elthorpe to be sure littleton looked him in the eye it was the inspector telling me henry was dead add to that hed never arrived in wales had he so i believed what i was told my going to elthorpe wouldnt bring henry back would it i have a wife and family to feed a child thats ill and the doctor is costing us more than we can pay i have a shop that brings no money in when im not here to open it besides we never had a suicide in our family id not want that getting about who told you it might have been suicide rutledge asked sharply what else could it be i know the inspector was hinting that it was murder as i explained to the constable henry was persecuted it might have ended differently if hed gone to prison instead but the woman and her husband forgave him that turned everyone in whitby against henry when the law wouldnt punish him everyone else did there was a great outcry you never considered the fact that albert crowell might have killed your cousin that they ran into each other by accident and crowell took the chance offered to avenge his wife then why did this man crowell forgive him in the first place if thats what he wanted to do to keep henry shoreham out of prison to make sure he could be found and killed only he came here to addleford and crowell couldnt find him in spite of himself rutledge found that it made a certain sense perhaps explained why crowell had chosen to teach at dilby looking for shoreham madsen could easily make that case that was before the wara long time to wait to get even then youll leave your cousin to a paupers grave and let the police sort out how he died ill pay what i can for a decent burial inspector madsen knows that but i wont do more truth is the scandal affected all our lives harboring henry was what i had to do because he was my blood ill not bring him back here and put him in the churchyard for everyone to stare at and remember rutledge could hear martin delorans callous dismissal of the dead man did no one care what became of him an interesting point of view mr littleton still ill have to speak to your wife and your neighbors i need to know precisely when henry shoreham left addleford how he was traveling and in what direction youre not understanding me henry kept to himself most particularly after the jordan family moved to addleford i doubt my neighbors have clapped eyes on him since he never came to town went to church services called in at the pub he just sat in his room and stared out the window there was evasion here almost a washing of the hands why rutledge had brought the folder in with him and opened it now to pull out the sketch perhaps you know this man he asked littleton looked intently at the face hes the dead man yes littleton shook his head then glanced up at rutledge the description inspector madsen gave of the body was too close for comfort the hairs on the back of my neck stood up but this is like seeing henry younger and happier theres no cleft in this mans chin littleton was rattled should there be i dont see it here and inspector madsen never said anything about one shoreham didnt have one no then either mrs crowell had been mistaken or shed lied it had been six years and she had been in shock and pain at the time who else besides crowell might have wished your cousin ill if you found henry hes dead by his own hand littleton answered stubbornly rutledge considered the possibility that littleton himself had killed his cousin but judging the character of the shoemaker he thought not if the man went to prison or was hanged who would support his family did inspector madsen tell you that this man the one you see in this drawing died somewhere else not in the place where he was found it was clear that littleton didnt know what to make of this information inspector madsen for reasons of his own had kept some facts of the case to himself here i cant tell you what happened to him he left my house he told me he was going to cousin llewellyn in aberysthwyth then along comes inspector madsen saying he never got to wales that he was dead and lying in a doctors surgery in elthorpe ive told the police all i can you must ask himinspector madsenwhat this is all about rutledge was again reminded of martin deloran willing to give any name to a dead man for his own ends but what end could peter littleton have unless hed killed shoreham long ago and hidden the body hamish said ask yon cousin in wales blood was thicker than water how far would henry shore hams relatives go to protect him or be rid of him rutledge said if this man in elthorpe isnt your cousinif youre obstructing the police in the course of their duties it will go hard for you the threat registered in littletons eyes but he answered only i havent gone to elthorpe asking about this dead man it was inspector madsen who came to me the door opened and a woman walked in her eyes red with crying she stopped short as she saw rutledge peter if you could hurry but before peter littleton could answer rutledge said mrs littleton is it weve nearly finished our business your husband and i i was just asking him about his cousin her gaze sharpened whatever had brought her here quickly set aside peter she didnt glance at her husband she stood there trying to collect her wits its all right love this is inspector rutledge hes come about henry but i thought theyd found a body and were satisfied her voice was accusing so we were told here see for yourself this is a drawing of the dead man does it look like henry to you she took it and stared at it theyre the same age she replied after a moment looking not at rutledge but at her husband and the same coloring i dont understand i thought it had been settled hes come to tell me this man was murdered mrs littleton gasped butthere must be some mistake you didnt tell mewhat did henry have worth stealing and he hadnt touched a drop of gin since that day in whitby how do they know he was murdered you told me it was suicide i dont understand she was begging for help for reassurance her husband said warningly were trying to sort it out beth let it wait im sick of henry shoreham ive come to fetch you the babys worse we must find the doctor peter littletons face lost its color he said oh god and pushed past rutledge to his wife go home love ill bring the doctor to you and over his shoulder to rutledge he said shes had whooping cough and he was gone leaving rutledge to close the shop door behind them rutledge spent half an hour asking round the village for henry shoreham and met with a shake of the head most people had no idea that hed gone one to stay close to home the greengrocer said early on i saw him a time or two in the evening but not to speak to youd never guess he was in the house when i went to make a delivery he never came out to say good morning he never came to services not even to his nieces christening the rector told rutledge not a religious man peter littleton said but he ought to have been if ever there was a man in need of prayer it was that one looked like a ghost of himself the way i remember him when peter and elizabeth were married a woman pushing a baby in a pram told rutledge he was in the shop once when i stepped in to see about the heel on my best pair of shoes but he didnt know what he was about and so i told peter after that he never came to work at littletons and a man sweeping the doorstep of the ironmongers said i didnt know him well he used to walk about at night to stretch his legs we talked once or twice as i was taking harriet outshes my dogand she would sniff at his shoes and growl as if she didnt much care for him strange man my wife was glad when he went away when was that do you know i didnt even know hed left until id asked peter how he was getting on and peter said hed decided to live with a cousin in wales made sense i doubt they had room in the house and it was one more mouth to feed peter did his best mind you but it was a strain on the family were you ever told why hed come here to live fell on hard times peter said i didnt press for more it wasnt my business or anyone elses but my wife always thought he must have been in gaol somewhere and afterward had nowhere to go she said peter was a good man to take on responsibility like that she said that if henry had nothing to hide hed be helping more in the shop or walking the children to school or coming to services of a sunday the jordans said hed been in trouble in whitby attacked a woman he shook his broom against the wall of the shop to clean it and went back inside gossip for all i know he ended as he prepared to shut the door in rutledges face he maynt have had anything to hide but hed have fared better wouldnt he if hed been open about it hamish said as rutledge turned toward the motorcar he willna be missed even by his cousin which would go far to explaining littletons assumption of suicide the decision to move to wales notwithstanding good riddance a body to bury a family skeleton disposed of and on christmas or easter a prayer to be said in passing for shorehams soul reaching the motorcar rutledge decided to drive on to wales without going back to elthorpe today he spent the night in shrewsbury then crossed the border in a fine rain that seemed to wrap the river valleys in playful mist rising now then thinning the great sweep of hillsides and heavy clouds barely visible before they were veiled again he saw sheep sometimes not yet shorn of their winter coat huddling in the lee of whatever shelter they could find but the land was empty save for the few towns he had to pass through there were scattered farms at the end of long and winding lanes and even they appeared to be deserted as if all the people of wales had gone away somewhere else and yet it was a beautiful drive aberystwyth sat on cardigan bay the water curving into the town and a ruin of a castle standing out on the headland to the right rutledge stopped in the town only long enough for a meal in a small dimly lit cafe where he was regarded with interest asking at shops that catered to farmers he finally discovered where llewellyn williams lived there were seven men of that name within a twentymile radius he backtracked along the way hed come until he found the lane leading into a village with an unpronounceable name beyond it he soon spotted the track that continued into the williams farm it was a small house with a sagging slate roof surrounded by outbuildings as he stopped a dog came out to sniff at his motorcar before baying toward the house as a welcome it lacked a great deal and although rutledge good with animals as a rule did his best to befriend the dog he thought it best to leave well enough alone after a tentative move to leave the motorcar won him a low growl after some minutes a man came to the door he was of medium height thin dark nondescript but he didnt resemble the sketch at all llewellyn williams rutledge called what do you want with him it was wary as if strangers werent welcomed here call off your dog i need to speak to you and its too wet to stand here shouting at each other the man hesitated after a moment he whistled to the dog and it came to sit grinning up at him his hand went to its massive head a gentle touch rutledge walked across to him im inspector ian rutledge scotland yard ive come in search of henry shoreham whats he wanted for the man asked hes done nothing more than disappear his family is worried for him i doubt it he has no family to speak of but i havent seen him i told another english policeman as much if youd spoken to him it would have saved you a journey you arent welsh it was a statement williams shrugged my family iswas i moved to england when i was a child my mothers cousin lives in yorkshire littleton is his name henry was staying with him but left to come and live with you you can look about if you like hes not here so im told theres a possibility that he was murdered williamss eyebrows rose that other policeman simply told me he thought henry was dead he didnt say anything about murder yes well murder it was he pulled out the folder with the sketch trying to shield it from the rain heres the dead mans likeness inspector madsen has arrested someone for his murder williams looked at the sketch for a long moment and then said with resignation youd better come inside the house was plainly furnished many of the pieces early victorian but it appeared to be comfortable enough weather tight and warm with the coal fire on the hearth how long have you lived here rutledge asked with interest as the dog slumped down on the hearthrug and sighed i inherited the property from my fathers cousin he had no children neither do i but there it is the house is mine he ran sheep here but i couldnt manage it a neighbor offered me a good price for them and im living on what i was paid for them how well do you know your cousin peter littleton hes on my mothers side of the family i havent seen him in many years and henry from whitby did you see him often williams shook his head its a long way to travel we were never close yet you offered him houseroom here which he never took me up on just as well i dont know how the two of us would manage the house is large enough but the money i have isnt i dont know that i could afford to keep him he left addleford to come here to you and changed his mind as far as i know i expect he was walking or looking for a lift and found another place he liked better you drove here you know how long a journey that would be im not saying hes dead mind you he just never came to this part of wales there was no anxiety over shorehams fate no concern about the long walk across wales no interest in what the man might have encountered poor and alone and with no friend to turn to you never made any attempt to learn what had become of him if he were ill dependent on the charity of strangers dead and buried somewhere as a pauper williams had the decency to look ashamed its not that we dont care he said hotly its that life is hard enough without taking on another mans troubles henry isnt here you can search the house if you like you wont find him if i knew where he was id want to help him but i cant go searching half of england in the hope of finding him theres not the money for it and what about the man dead in elthorpe i could make a case that you and peter littleton between you tired of your cousin and killed him leaving him to be found by strangers williamss face paled his dark eyes wide and alarmed but you cant do that weve not touched henry weve not left him anywhere but where he wants to beaway from yorkshire inspector madsen has one albert crowell in custody to be charged for henry shorehams murder theres evidence enough to see him hanged williams sat down heavily youre lying to me ill bring inspector madsen to you to confirm what ive said but why would thisthis albert crowell wish to harm my cousin because shoreham scarred his wife for life you know this its the reason shoreham is unemployed and living on the charity of his family williams shook his head shock still washing over him i know about the accident thats what it was an accident henry swore it what do you want me to do help you prove that this is henry i havent seen him in years did you show this sketch to peter what did he say he avoided answering me he cared as little for your cousin as you appear to do no thats not fair it isnt a matter of caring god knows he broke off swallowing hard if you pass off a dead man as your cousin and albert crowell is hanged for it what then henry shoreham has done enough harm to the man and his wife and this will compound it williams began to cry his face worn with grief go away and leave me alone i wont hear any more of this its all a trick and i wont be taken in by it then i shall have you summoned for the trial you can sit there and watch what happens and then if your conscience pricks you you can tell the court what became of your cousin it was harshly said and intended to be i cant afford to come to yorkshire i have no money it will break me better to break you than to hang an innocent man rutledge had drawn his conclusions by this time he knew what was coming and he braced for it you cant do this to me ive been punished enough leave me alone then youre a coward shoreham and ill have you in that courtroom if its the last thing i do he turned and walked through the door the dog hackles rising coming to nip at his heels the man did nothing to call him off but rutledge had just turned the motorcar to go back the way hed come when shoreham was in the doorway calling to him stop rutledge paid no heed for the love of god wait rutledge braked but didnt turn he could hear williams splashing through the puddles to the side of the motorcar his face ravaged all right im henry shoreham peter wrote me about the dead man nobody knew who he was even inspector madsen didnt we thoughtwe thought if he was nameless it wouldnt matter to anyone if we let the police think it was henry me how long have you lived here rutledge asked again for two years since my cousin llewellyn died and left the house to me i thoughti thought i could take his place use his name find work again and live like a man and not someone elses dependent peter had done his best but they couldnt keep me he wiped the rain from his face then two years ago a man from whitby and his wife came to live in addleford with her mother theyd done their banking where i worked they knew me i couldnt stay on i came here and looked after llewellyn until he died and i took his place peter pretended i was still there in yorkshire and everyone believed him they never saw me i was known to be a recluse how would they know if id gone away or not your cousin couldnt go on lying forever you hadnt expected him to do that we played a little game hed tell the rector id seen him pass by the house or the butcher that id appreciated the bit of beef for sunday dinner but peters children were getting to an age where someone might ask them how i fared we were casting about for a way to explain id gone to london to search for work when the constable came looking for henry shoreham they told peter no one knew the dead man and he was quick to see how it might help me to be dead and buried we didnt know the crowells were back in yorkshire you were interfering with a murder inquiry it was a stupid thing to do i never meant harm to anyone i swear it you dont know what it has been like the crowells are everywhere i turn and i cant escape them he forgave me did you know that in public i fell on my knees and cried afterward but he never knew that others blamed me though and word that i wasnt to be tried ran round like wildfire i couldnt go on if peter hadnt asked me to come and stay id have killed myself somehow i didnt mean to harm alice crowell but shes repaid me in kind ive suffered as much for my sins as she has for my carelessness what am i to do to find any peace come to yorkshire with me the case will be closed and you can come back here and get on with your life i dont think inspector madsen is going to make a great noise about any of this it can be done quietly shoreham looked up at him i have no money if i go to yorkshire ill have no way to get back to wales i cant ask peter hes strapped as well ill see you safely back rutledge said inspector madsen will be furious hell know we lied to him it might do him some good rutledge said he needs a lesson as much as you do ill pack my things and find someone to see to the dog if youll come back later ill be ready and find a dead man here in your place i wont end it i swear it the temptation may be stronger than you think he began to turn the motorcar again and shoreham walked beside it to the house rutledge waited until the battered valise was closed then took up the dog in the motorcar with them to leave with a neighbor while shoreham was away then they turned toward england it was a silent drive only once did shoreham break the silence and that was to say whos the dead man then rutledge answered a man who also lost his way i expect rutledge drove straight through to elthorpe fighting drowsiness and an ache across his shoulders as he took the most direct route backshrewsbury to manchester leeds and then harrogate rutted roads slowmoving drays overladen lorries and the occasional wandering livestock made the journey feel longer than it was outside shrewsbury he waited impatiently for cows to make their way along the road for morning milking and in cheshire the royal mail had come to grief in a ditch where heavy rains had made a bend tricky a farm cart and a halfdozen burly men were doing their best to pull it out again hamish said they willna manage without help rutledge caught himselfjust before he answered aloud then called to the driver to offer his services he gratefully accepted and in short order the royal mail was on the road again they stopped for food and petrol and sometimes to stretch their legs shoreham was quiet resigned now though rutledge kept an eye on him throughout to gauge his mood one act of drunken unruliness unintended yet preventable had altered the direction of henry shorehams life and crowells forgiveness well meant had only driven the guilt deeper without hope of expiation it had become in a way retribution it was possible hed change his mind at some stage of the journey to yorkshire preferring to take his chances alone and nearly penniless rather than revisit his nightmare and in truth if he did change his mind there was no legal way to stop him the need to identify a stranger had brought him back to his own personal hell and indeed the closer they got to elthorpe the more noticeably anxious shoreham got still he said nothing and the silence was a strain on both men hamish filled it instead his voice alternately hostile and questioning at one point rutledge asked just to silence it shoreham do you know a gerald parkinson or gaylord partridge no should i is this another test not at all and the silence reigned once more when the motorcar pulled at last into elthorpe in the late afternoon a cold rain was falling and the streets were empty in the teashop they passed the tables were filled and steam clouded the windows the pub was dark but there was a motorcar in front of the hotel two men descending and walking briskly through the door shoreham said peter littleton lied as well but for my sake dont punish him for my sins rutledge didnt answer inspector madsen had gone home for his tea elthorpe was tranquil once more and no murderers wandered in the ruins of an abbey or anywhere else he could afford to take his time rutledge sent the constable on duty for the inspector and it was with studied reluctance that the man did as he was asked in short order inspector madsen came striding in confident and in good spirits his gaze swept over the stranger and moved on to rut ledge well then what brings you north again track down littleton did you fools errand i could have told you as much but there you are not quite rutledge replied dont you recognize this man madsen turned his attention to shorehams face and he frowned the welshman is it what possessed you to bring him back with you some of the confidence in his face faltered his real name is henry shoreham not llewellyn williams madsen laughed i daresay you could find a dozen henry shore hams across the breadth of england if you set your mind to it but the laugh rang hollow you found littleton i grant you and shoreham had stayed with him for some time but it was two years ago not two weeks when shoreham left to take up a cousins farm in wales littleton was clever he saw a chance to bury his cousin and the two of them were convincing youre mad hardly that bring out crowell if you will and see what he has to say of course hell identify your man as shoreham hes no fool shoreham said his voice not quite steady they will know me in whitby youve only to take me there to the police i dont want to see crowell or his wife madsen was staring at him with a hard expression on his face now convinced against his will and yet unwilling to admit to it he was wishing shoreham at the very devil rutledge said into the silence hes right then who is the dead man from the abbey answer me that if youre so damned clever it is my belief hes one gerald parkinson of wiltshire wiltshire is it and what was he doing in yorkshire im not sure but there was this business of shoreham to settle once and for all youll have to let crowell go you know maybe he mistook this parkinson for shoreham madsen snapped do they look that much alike to you rutledge countered generally of course in coloring and height the same could be said of your constable there by the door but theres no question about the features they arent the same madsen said bring me parkinsons murderer and ill let crowell go not before but it was bravado they had only to look at shoreham standing there with his eyes downcast and his face pale the strain evident to know that rutledge had found his man all the same ill take him to whitby madsen went on at your expense and after that hes free to return to wales agreed ill leave you the money to pay for his journey agreed it was reluctantly promised but madsen knew he had lost his gambit hed been wrong about crowell if in fact he had ever truly believed that the schoolmaster was a killer and now it was time to save face and back out with as much grace as he could muster rutledge took shoreham to the hotel across from the police station and found rooms for them he said to shoreham as they turned toward the stairs you couldnt have hidden forever you couldnt have lived with the lie shoreham stared at him for a moment then said yes i could have done that if you hadnt come to my door i could have ignored the truth and told myself the man was dead and there was no harm in giving him a namemy name he didnt have one of his own did he but when you stopped in my yard it was different somehow i couldnt pretend after that id lost the chance he held out his hand for his key and added you told me youd pay for my way back to wales the money will be waiting at inspector madsens office when hes finished with you shoreham grimaced i wasnt going to run and then he was gone the door shut behind him after four hours sleep rutledge left elthorpe and turned south he took with him the words that madsen had said to him when he brought the money for shorehams journey home it must be nice to sleep at night knowing youre always right i wasnt blinded by wishful thinking madsen theres the difference still and all the inspector told him bluntly i wish youd never come here wed have managed very well without you let go man before you destroy your career itud been worth it ill say that to you and no one else i dont know which of them i wanted to hurt more him or her it wouldnt have changed anything but it might have taken away a little of the pain on my side it was something rutledge was to remember in the days ahead rutledge put in a call to bowles when he stopped for the night in lincoln chief superintendent bowles wasnt there he was told but sergeant gibson had a message for inspector rutledge there was a delay while the sergeant was located and brought to the telephone he was gruff youre to come directly to london sir whats happened im not to say sir its a family matter your sister will be waiting for you at your flat if she was waiting there she must be all right but she wouldnt have had the yard pass on a message if it were only another snag in her relationship with simon barrington he could feel his mind searching for a solution and finding none very well thank you gibson ill be at the yard in the afternoon yes sir he sounded doubtful but then gibson was not known for his cheerfulness rutledge put up the receiver and turned around on his way out of the small room where the hotel telephone had been installed as he opened the door he was surprised to see simon barrington walking into the hotel dining room a woman on his arm rutledge could see only the back of her head dark hair and a slim figure he decided on the spot to find somewhere else to dine he had no wish to come facetoface with the pair but what was barrington doing here in lincoln hamish said yere too weary to go on to london it would be foolish he had read rutledges mind the policeman however walked briskly to reception and turned the book toward him to see who had registered with barrington there were two names separate rooms s barrington and j fel lowes barrington had given his address as london but fellowes had listed boston the clerk saw what rutledge was doing and came out of the office here police business rutledge said curtly and went out to find his dinner h e reached london in the late afternoon stopping twice on the road for a brief respite hamish had rumbled through the night as hed often done in the trenches and the soft scots voice had brought tension with it rutledge went straight to his flat and he found frances waiting as promised her face filled with concern he knew at once that someone was dead who is it he asked bracing himself not melinda melinda trent the intriguing elderly woman whod lived through the great indian mutiny of had been a friend of his family for as long as he could remember and cared for him as well he returned that love in full measure leavened by a strong suspicion that she saw through him more often than not if shed found hamish in his shadows she had spoken of that only obliquely her home was in kent and he promised himself he would find a way to go on there tonight taking frances with him no she crossed the room to greet him hands on his shoulders and said oh my dear i dont know how to tell you quickly would be best he replied tightly its jean she told him then shes dead jean the woman he shouldwouldhave married if there had been no war he had got over her he had told himself that often enough through a long dark year now it struck him that he had never said goodbye that day in the clinic when hed broken off their engagement so that she wouldnt have to ask him to set her free letting her go because it was what she desperately wanted and didnt know how to tell him she had walked out of his room promising to come again as soon as she could but she never had he had known she wouldnt be able to brace herself for another visit dead he could feel francess hands on his shoulders hear her voice and knew that she was there who told you he asked hoarsely how did you find out melinda telephoned to me a friend of hers had sent her a cable from canada it was in the papers in toronto that too was a blow that jean had died and he had felt nothing how did it happen complications of pregnancy she lost her childa miscarriage and infection set in afterward they did all that was possible to save her women died in childbirth every day only he hadnt expected one of them to be jean is she coming back to england the obituary says shell be buried in canada her husband is still serving there and so he would never say goodbye not now the last time hed seen her she was coming out of st margarets church where she was soon to be married a cluster of her friends surrounded her their voices traveling to him where he stood her face was shining with happiness and excitement as she discussed flowers and candles and ribbons it had broken his heartand yet he had never hated her for leaving him he had known what sort of husband he would have made she was better off without him still he felt a surge of guilt for letting her go if she had stayed in england but that was pointless rutledge set frances aside and went to the window to look out on the street not seeing it she went away and came back presently with a cup of tea rutledge drank it the hot strong liquid cutting through the shock of francess news there was nothing he could do no word of comfort for the bereaved husbandwho probably had never known rutledge existed and no flowers for the raw earth of the grave he finished his tea and said i need to walk will you wait of course he had never taken off his coat he just went out the door an hour later he saw that there was a church on the next corner smokestained stone with a spire that gleamed in the sun the door was unlocked and he went inside into the silent dimness his footsteps echoed against the stone walls and he got as far as the first row of chairs there he sat down it wasnt the comfort of god he sought so much as the need to be alone and hamish mercifully was quiet he hadnt expected it that was the problem the loss was emotional sharp their engagement had not been spent growing closer to each other settling into a warm and responsive companionship that would carry them into old age as it should have been four years of war had seen to that and changed them both she was another mans wife now not his never his and while he grieved for the girl he had asked to marry him in she had left a long time ago he rose after a while and walked back the way hed come hamish at his shoulder said only it was verra different with my fiona i should ha come home to her and left you dead in france your jean wouldna have missed you the voice was sad as if half convincing himself that this was true together the two men one of whom didnt exist went back to the flat frances was waiting as shed promised she said as he came through the door the yard sent someone you are to come at once rutledge swore silently there was never any time yes ill go shall i give you a lift home as far as trafalgar square if you dont mind ianare you all right do you want me to call the yard and ask them to give you an hour or two work he said bitterly is its own panacea but thanks he stopped long enough to change clothes and then he shut the flat door behind them as he led the way to his motorcar he couldnt help but wonder how long it would be before he crossed his threshold again without remembering the news that had been waiting here today frances kept him busy with trivial gossip until he put her down in the square and she leaned across to kiss him before she got out he watched her walk briskly in the direction of st martins in the fields and then turned toward the yard he hadnt mentioned seeing simon barrington it hadnt seemed the right moment and then too important to be a parting remark it was simons business and none of his after all as long as frances wasnt hurt but he thought she was going to be his eye was caught by a familiar figure walking toward him along the street it was meredith channing dressed in a becoming dark red coat and matching hat she didnt look his way but he could have sworn she had seen his motorcar and recognized it as quickly as he had recognized her bowles was waiting for him at the yard and almost as he walked in the door asked abruptly for his report theres no time to write it out but i want to know whats going on rutledge gave it orally as bowles stood fuming by the window when hed finished bowles grunted and rutledge couldnt tell whether he was satisfied or still irritated it was often difficult to read the mans moods stepping on toes is never prudent i want you back in berkshire tonight i want to see the end of this business with partridge or parkinson or whatever his name is finish it as fast as you can and report to me yorkshire is complaining were playing merry hell with their inquiry and giving them damn all in return they still have that godforsaken body and dont know what to do with it rutledge was as eager to leave london as bowles was to send him away but he said if i get too close to the truth deloran will be knocking at your door complaining and thats when ill know youre doing your job get on with it rutledge had been driving for three days but he said only ill be leaving within the hour somehow the road west seemed longer this time but in the end rutledge saw the familiar shape of the white horse galloping silently across its grassy hillside he drove on passing it then stopped in the darkness to look up at it what had it seen this chalk horse why had it brought parkinson here and why had he died in yorkshire and not in berkshire he got out and walked a little way up the hill somehow it seemed peaceful and comforting the horse had been there since time out of mind rutledge squatted in the dewwet grass and studied the dark silent cottages hamish said no one wants this dead man except to use him rutledge answered aloud a convenience sad isnt it the cottages are the end of the road for most of the people down there a place to grow old and die without fuss did death come looking for parkinson or did he go out to find it its a long way to yorkshire fra here there was movement below rutledge could just make out the smith coming home he slowed for an instant as if he sensed being watched then walked on toward his door a curtain twitched in bradys cottage a sliver of lamp light flashing briefly and then vanishing the lane was quiet again rutledge was content to sit here on the hill and listen to sounds of the night his mind was tired and even the puzzle of parkinsons life and death failed to interest him it could wait until tomorrow a catdublintrotted across the open space between quincys cottage and mrs cathcarts a dog barked in a farmyard a long way off the sound carrying without urgency for a moment rutledge wondered why he had ever chosen to become a policeman and deal so closely with death and he knew the answer even as he posed the question it was still the same as it had been at eighteen when hed told his father that he intended to join the metropolitan force when he came down from oxford tired he might be of death yet he was still here to speak for the dead only it was proving more difficult to speak for parkinson it was possible he thought that parkinson didnt want anyone to learn the truth about him that he would be glad to lie in an unmarked grave and be forgotten then without warning as if it had been busy this last quarter hour without his knowing it his mind offered rutledge a solution to the puzzle of gerald parkinson he had been working on the theory that the man had had something to hide like the other residents of the tomlin cottages and perhaps it was true but the overriding factor behind what had brought parkinson here was guilt a strong sense of guilt and that was where to begin if rutledge expected to unravel the puzzle of this mans life and his death rutledge stood up and walked back down the hill cranked the motorcar and drove on to the smiths arms it took him several minutes to wake mr smith and bring him down to unlock the door back again are you your rooms empty if you want it well settle on that tomorrow fair enough rutledge thanked him and followed him up the stairs in the wake of his flickering lamp as he opened his door the room smelled of lavender and fresh air as if the sheets had dried in the sun he undressed in the dark and went to bed fter breakfast rutledge drove on to wiltshire a good two hours tomorrow hed find out why guilt had changed partridges life one way then found again the turning for partridge fields the house where parkinson had lived once more there appeared to be no one about as he walked through the gate leaving his motorcar in the lane the sun was slanting through the trees beyond the house and long shafts of golden light barred the lawns and gardens it was a tranquil scene and he wondered again why parkinson had preferred the cottages to this place he went around the house through the gardens and the shrubbery that shut off the kitchen yard listening to a silence broken only by a bird calling from the miniature dovecote birdhouse in the kitchen garden was no one ever here moving on he was just on the point of taking the stone path through to the far side of the house when a shrill voice stopped him in his tracks hamish said ware in warning and rutledge turned slowly here what are you about a plump woman wearing an apron was standing in the door to the yard arms akimbo and a frown on her face i didnt think anyone was at home he said in apology or i would have knocked my name is rutledge and ive come down from london i couldnt care less where youre from what are you doing here looking i think for mr parkinson youre not one of them people from the newspaper are you there was a challenge now in her tone ive told you before and ill tell you again hes not here nor will he be here any time soon and you might as well march yourself back the way youve come and leave the premises close the gate behind you or ill see the police have a word with you for trespassing she was about to shut the door in his face and he said quickly im from the police scotland yard her face altered the hostility giving way to concern mixed with irritation the police is it what are you here for is there bad news youre bringing rutledge was walking back toward her now and she stood her ground with the ferocity of an old and trusted servant here youre not coming in this house policeman or no im trying to locate mr parkinson he replied his tone indicating a need for help rather than ulterior motive its a police inquiry you see and i should like to ask his assistance hed left the sketch in his valise at the inn and swore to himself she would surely have recognized it well you wont be finding it herehes not in residence and thats a fact she looked rutledge up and down youd think a london policeman would know that he said drawing on his experience dealing with watchdog servants my superiors dont always tell me everything they know much to my regret how long has he been away surely he must have told you where to send along his mail he doesnt receive any none that is im aware of and he left just a week after his wife died in the spring of here are you certain you arent from the london papers rutledge showed her his identity card and she studied it with suspicion as if certain it was counterfeit i dont understand why the newspapers should be interested in mr parkinson he went on in a conversational tone or disturb him perhaps the police ought to have been called sooner they were and they did nothing her sense of grievance went deeper than her circumspection it was on account of his poor wife of course like vultures they came here battering the door upsetting the household it was shameful thats what it was no respect for the dead was she well known in london circles was that their interest it was the way she died she left the gas open by mistake and they tried to say it was suicide but of course it wasnt she was a good and kind lady she would never kill herself but they told poor mr parkinson it was on purpose and he believed them it was the same way parkinson himself had died to follow her but then how did he come to be in yorkshire im surprised the london papers saw anything newsworthy in the story she sighed its because of what he did in the war of course and here at the bottom of the garden as well with that workshop of his mrs parkinson told me herself she was heartsick over it rutledge tried another tack im not sure i understand london didnt inform me what parkinson had done in the war he worked at porton down he was one of the scientists there gassed the kaisers men in return for our boys got our own back didnt he mrs parkinson was squeamish but not i he was startled by her vehemence even as his mind registered porton down it was a military facility on the eastern border of wiltshire across the county from here a place where absolute secrecy was the order of the day and for the first time rutledge understood why martin deloran was interested in the whereabouts of one gerald parkinson the army didnt care to lose track of someone like that someone whose knowledge was more valuable than his person eccentricity was one thing disliked but oftentimes tolerated even madness could be overlooked parkinson however had walked away from a comfortable family home lived elsewhere under a different name and disappeared with unsettling regularity the war office could do very little about it but that didnt mean they didnt watch his every move very likely deloran had put the change in parkinson down to excessive grief after his wifes deathgive him time and hed recover be himself again the wars nearly over we can afford to be patient but two years had passed and parkinson still went his own way and deloran was still watching him small wonder deloran jumped at the chance to bury parkinson under a paupers stone in rural yorkshire what sort of secrets had safely died with him guilt ye said hamish reminded him and rutledge remembered that would explain parkinsons choice to live in the tomlin cottages it still wouldnt explain where hed died he worked on the development of poison gases rutledge asked to clarify what parkinson had done for a living it would explain too the choice of reading material he had taken with him to the cottage well of course he did she said with pride where else and him fascinated by chemistry ever since he was a young man at cambridge mrs parkinson was at her wits end with fear for the children children indeed the light of her life they was i daresay mr parkinson found them a nuisance when he had his laboratory at the bottom of the garden always looking in the windows trying to see what he was up to it was when he killed the cows by accident that mrs parkinson put her foot down she rested her back against the doorframe a tired woman with no one to talk with as she worked but that caught the armys attention didnt it so he took himself off to a new laboratory there posh he said it was everything to hand martha they value me they know im right about this new direction germany hasnt got there yet but we shall wait and see youll be reading about it in the newspapers because its likely to stop the war and the dying my nephew the one gassed at ypres my sisters only boy was going to be avenged he said germany was the first to use the poisonous gases but wed be the last well show em he said wait and see youve worked for the family for some time have you i was maid to mr parkinsons mother and came here as housekeeper to partridge fields when he bought the place mrs miggs having just died and mrs parkinson didnt care for the work he was doing she worried that they were testing these gases on the animals she couldnt bear to think about it she saw my nephew when he was sent home lungs burned right out he didnt last long and died hard i told her the hun had brought it all on themselves whatever mr parkinson devised but it didnt matter she stopped sleeping well wandering about the house at all hours like her own ghost small wonder she forgot and left the gas on she couldnt even kill a spider that crept in at the window she was that troubled about hurting anything which is why i refuse to believe she killed herself but mr parkinson thought shed done it out of spite using the gas im told its as peaceful a way as any to go falling asleep and not waking up the housekeeper turned and looked over her shoulder as if a ghost could give her the answer to her question but it was the kitchen floors that concerned her and she said its dry in there must be by now and ive a good bit more to do before i close up for the day and youre sure you have no way of knowing where mr parkinson went his daughter becky might know but i doubt it he left me instructions not to say anything and i never have its not my place to decide such things where will i find miss parkinson no i wont tell you shell know who did and ill hear about it soon enough no one stays in the house of a night anymore myself im away before dark i can tell you that but she comes from time to time to tend the gardens and sometimes to knock at her fathers door you spoke of children rutledge began but the housekeeper shook her head firmly and disappeared inside without answering him shutting the kitchen door in rutledges face he had no choice but to move on rounding the house and coming again to the drive he could almost feel the housekeeper watching him from the windows making certain he was not sneaking about as she would call it but leaving the premises as he closed the gate behind him he thought this house has seen tragedy rutledge found a small pub for his noon meal and sat there over his pudding thinking about parkinson and the cottage in berkshire so much made sense now the fact that the cottage had no touches of personal warmthit was not parkinsons home this house in wiltshire was and his disappearances hamish said to his wifes grave you ken ye thought of that before deloran probably had the churchyard watched for all we know and going there would have bolstered delorans theory that parkinson was still grieving wherever parkinson went deloran couldnt find him and that was the trouble hamish said its verra likely that he went away to torment delo ran it wouldnt surprise me that he was just being bloodyminded rebelling against being watched showing the war office that he was clever enough to outfox them all a catandmouse game to worry de loran rutledge considered another possibilitythat when parkinson couldnt stand his own company any longer when the walls of the cottage were closing in he might well have needed to be around people a crowded train station a wednesday market a theater somewhere safe to remind himself he wasnt going mad it was dark when he reached the smiths arms rutledge left the motorcar in the yard then walked down to waylands smithy it was a far better place to leave an unwanted body than an abbey cloister in yorkshire who had decided that it was time parkinson should die thats what it all came down to not where the body was left but who had chosen to end one mans life now it was useless to speculate but who had become the bedrock of the case the heavy stone slabs that had created this ancient tomb caught his attention and he thought about the numbers of men it would have taken to build this place for a dead chieftain or priest we spend our energies in different ways he thought standing there how many aeroplanes and tanks and artillery caissons had it taken to end the great war not to count the rifles and helmets respirators and machine guns the number of boots the tunics and greatcoats and the tins in which we had brewed our tea or the casings of the shells fired a nations fortune surely greater than any man possessed in the centuries since this tomb was new and raw and the dead shut into it was still honored by those who had carried him here it was depressing to think about there was always a new weapon something to kill greater numbers of the enemy than the enemy could hope to kill on ones own side parkinson must have been more than a pair of hands in the work he was doing on poisonous gases men like deloran wouldnt have wasted an hours thought on the whereabouts of a minor chemist who carried out tests and wrote reports the housekeeper had said that parkinson was pleased with something new that would help end the war sooner had he left with that work unfinished or at a critical stage if that had been the case someone would have moved heaven and earth to get parkinson back into the laboratory as quickly as possible had he discovered a conscience when his wife died and decided that he was finished with what had always been his lifes work had he been frightened by the man hed become and walked away rutledge brought to mind the face in the sketch and tried to probe behind it all he could find was an ordinary man despite what he had done in his laboratories nothing in his features to mark him nothing that could have caught ones eye on the streets of london or canterbury nothing that would reflect what this person had chosen to do with his life neither evil nor good just a man with no calluses on his hands and no scars no means of telling him from a halfdozen others his size and weight and coloring then what had happened to him if he was so ordinary rutledge turned back toward the inn and asked mrs smith if he could have his dinner brought to his room after eating it by the window he went on sitting there in the darkness even after the yard was silent and the road in front was empty trying to picture jeans face the sound of her voice the touch of her hand he found it was difficult he had loved her or believed he had and grieved for what might have been when the engagement ended now with her death a door had closed she was the last link with the bright summer of and happiness and a world that was going to be his to grasp after a while he got up and readied himself for bed without lighting the lamp he had expected to lie there awake listening to hamish in his head in the morning he would go to the cottages and find out who might have wanted the death of one gerald parkinson or if they had wanted to kill gaylord partridge instead hed drifted into sleep without dreams bestlaid plans have a way of going astray someone was knocking on his door before the first light of dawn had penetrated his room summoning him urgently he fought his way back from a deep sleep and answered smith said his voice husky theres been trouble at the tomlin cottages youd best come rutledge dressed swiftly asking questions as he worked but smith knew nothing more in the lobby he found slater standing there pale and agitated what kind of trouble he asked the smith i dont know i heard a cry and after that nothing from the partridge cottage there no please hurry rutledge went at once into the yard and slater followed going to the bonnet and bending to turn the crank with his massive hand smith was calling after them shall i come as well not yet you may be needed later he got behind the wheel and slater slid into the other seat a hulking shadow in the light of the innkeepers lamp which cottage rutledge asked mr willinghams number three just above mr partridge the old man then they drove the short distance to the cottages in silence but rutledge could feel the anxiety in the man at his side and reaction setting in i didnt investigate slater said as the cottages came into view ive never heard anything like that i fear theres murder done mr rutledge sure as gods above can you be certain he wasnt calling for help taken ill suddenly in the nighta fall but he knew it must be more than that to frighten slater so badly slater walked the night and was of a size that brooked no interference it wasnt fear that had shaken him it was something closer to a primordial response to horror slater said nothing hunched in his seat willing the motorcar to move faster they arrived at the cottages soon enough and rutledge left his motorcar beside the smiths door rather than destroy any tracks or other evidence nearer willinghams he reached for his torch closing his eyes from habit because it was in the rear where hamish sat groping he found nothing and then suddenly his hand touched the torch as if hamish had pushed it nearer he flinched then gripped the cold metal turning toward the cottage the windows were dark the door closed nothing to mark forced entry but the question was did willingham lock his doors of a night or leave them off the latch rutledge started toward it and slater made to follow him rut ledge held up a hand no wait until i call you slater argued you may need help im stronger than you rutledge said then better to be outside than in the door was indeed unlocked inside rutledges torch seemed to pierce the darkness like a spear he moved it without moving himself until he had a feeling for the furnishings and the shape of the room it was very similar to other cottages hed been in but the placement of chairs and tables was different the sitting room just beyond the door showed no signs of disturbance a rug before the hearth a chair to one side a shelf of books on the other a small table by the window with two smaller chairs and a footstool by the winged chair under the lamp an empty glass rested on the stand next to it with a book open beside it the kitchen tiny even by cottage standards was tidy but a stack of plates and cups stood waiting to be washed while pans soaked in the sink guests for dinner or was willingham in the habit of washing up once a day the bedroom lay above the kitchen and on the threshold rutledge found splotches of blood black in his torchs beam he stopped flicking his light around the room beyond between the tall chest and the bed willingham lay on his side on the bare wood of the floor his eyes were wide and empty reflecting the light rutledge didnt need to cross the room to know that he was dead the bedroom still held a presence malice and fear as if the strength of the emotions that had ended in death still lingered but there was no one else there rutledge used to scenes of violent death quickly surveyed the bedroom digesting what there was to see there had been a strugglebedclothes pulled free and left trailing across the floor the lamp broken and the oil spilling into a chair soaking darkly into the green brocade upholstery the nightstand was overturned as well angered to find an intruder beside his bed willingham had apparently been galvanized to put up an energetic defense walking into the room rutledge could see a slash on the left wrist and a knife of the kind used to joint chickens deep in willinghams chest stubborn and cantankerous to the end willingham had not died easily and the killer must have suffered a shock rutledge went down on one knee by the body the cut on the wrist wasnt right somehow not the sort of defensive wound hed have expected to find on the hands perhaps or on the arms fending off the final blow but not straight and deep into the wrist with that wrist wound alone willingham would have bled to death the killer could have held him down in bed until it was over perhaps that had been the plan to make this attack look like an old mans final retreat from a lonely and despairing life instead it had been necessary to end the struggle violently before there was another outcry hamish was saying i canna see what this has to do with partridge i he broke off as a footstep grated on the threshold and flashed his light in that direction tensing for an attack slater was outside but the killer might still be within just at that moment someone said mr rutledge where are you are you all right slater had followed him contrary to orders the torchs beam struck him full in the face making him blink and duck his head damn the man go back outside he commanded sternly and slater hastily withdrew moving quickly for such a large man flicking off his torch to avoid attracting attention from the neighboring cottages rutledge followed him i saw him willinghams dead isnt he rutledge said quietly take my motorcar and drive into uffing ton ask the sergeant on duty at the police station to send someone here preferably an inspector tell them only that theres been a murder and someone should come at once slater repeated hes dead then yes theres nothing we can do for him now slater nodded and turned to walk back to the motorcar then he paused and said youll be safe here alone i expect i will be thanks the smith nodded and was gone rutledge stood there watching the first fingers of rosy lightrosy fingered dawn virgil had called itspread from the eastern horizon toward the road as he had so many times in the trenches when dawn had broken softly without the guns or the whistles or the shouts of men going into battle rutledge heard himself quoting o a manning aloud hamish had been fond of the lines as well the first reaches of light out of darkness pink with new birth and then gold like apricots on silk and the morning was here the earliest riser the man in number had stepped out his door and was staring in rutledges direction whats that is there anything wrong singleton asked the old man hasnt taken ill has he ive sent for the police theyll be here shortly i thought you were the police the local people then its their patch singleton nodded die in his sleep did he i always thought his heart would send him off choleric old fool that he was how well did you know him he shrugged how well do any of us here know one another its a morning greeting a nod in passing a good night before we shut our doors and in the end only what we can see from our windows and the windows of willinghams cottage had a clear view of parkinsons they also looked out on mrs cathcarts and on number the man millers door mrs cathcart opened her door a little as if by recalling her name rutledge had summoned her spirit good morning inspector is something wrong with mr willing ham do either of you know if he had a guest for dinner last night i shouldnt think so she answered he was alone last evening when i saw him working in his garden he seemed well enough then singleton said i dont think ive ever seen anyone enter or leave his cottage they stood there awkwardly uncertain what to say watching rut ledge to see if he would tell them what was wrong quincy came out his door and dublin ran ahead of him released for a day of hunting whats up its mr willingham mrs cathcart replied mr rutledge has sent for the police quincy disappeared inside his door and shut it firmly allen was next to stick his head out his face was pale drained as if hed slept ill anything wrong he asked nodding to mrs cathcart can i help a coughing spell sent him almost to his knees but when it had passed he said again can i help theres nothing anyone can do rutledge replied then im for my bed again not at my best in the mornings he shut his door and they could hear him coughing again he shouldnt be out at this hour mrs cathcart was saying the dampness after a moment she herself went back inside as if staying there and making conversation was more than she could cope with singleton remained standing with folded arms rutledge could see bradys face at his window staring with bleary eyes at the two men soon afterward the suns rays turned the window to brilliant gold and rutledge couldnt be sure if brady was still there or not he had seen most of the residents now curiosity had got the best of them in one fashion or another this break in the dull routine of their lives making them more willing to interact than they might have done otherwise miller had yet to appear but he could be a late riser unaware of what was happening after a long while slater was back with a slim dark man beside him in the motorcar they left the car by the road and walked toward the willingham cottage whats this the man said im told someone is dead and you are hill inspector hill you must be inspector rutledge they shook hands and rutledge began to point out his observations but hill said no let me he held out a hand for rutledges torch and went inside the still dark cottage after a time he came out again by then singleton had walked back to his house you were right to send for me any witnesses he looked in singletons direction then focused his attention on rut ledge none that ive found so far rutledge answered yes well if he was killed at night who would notice although slater here tells me he was awakened by a cry they turned as one to look at the other cottages ive not had much call to come here hill said peaceful enough little community no problems until now until now hill agreed slater didnt enter the cottage he came as far as the bedroom door i sent him back out again well if it were he who did the deed the struggle would have been shorter someone nearer willinghams size if not his age a startled man might fight with more strength than a frightened one i agree rutledge gave hill a quick overview of the other inhabitants ending with partridge hes not been seen for some time the general view is that hes been away and what hill asked his eyes sharp on rutledges face has brought the yard to our doorstep id been asked to learn what had become of partridge by interested parties he left without telling anyone where he was going or when hed return i see very well ill take over here if you please no thoughts on who might have had it in for willingham none and i doubt youll get much out of his neighbors they havent been very forthcoming about mr partridge yes well a man going about his own business is one thing ill have a chat and see if murder might sharpen their memories rutledge left him to it he told himself that what had happened to willingham most certainly had nothing to do with parkinson and yet a niggling doubt crept in why would the killer try to make the old mans death appear to be a suicide to silence him without creating a stir on the heels of parkinsons murder willinghams windows looked down on the partridge cottage at number had he seen something he shouldnt have then why wait this long to dispose of him hamish said it would be as well to wait until yon inspector went on his way before asking too many questions rutledge was about to answer when he heard mrs cathcart quietly call to him inspector hill was busy questioning slater his back to them she said will you come and tell me whats happened im afraid he turned to reassure her and instead seized the opportunity offered him she let him in her door and shut it quickly mr willingham is dead he said stepping into the sitting room did you know him well oh poor man i dont think any of us knew him at all he kept to himself was it illness she shivered i shouldnt like to die alone but its likely i shall im afraid he was murdered mrs cathcart that shook her badly murder by whom why oh my god it was most likely a personal matter mrs cathcart theres nothing for you to fear but his cottage could easily be confused with mine its happened before a letter to me was taken to him by mistake he kept it for a fortnight before he handed it to me and another time someone looking for me knocked at his door what if the murderer thought he was coming into my cottage she was genuinely disturbed he could see it in her face i dont think he began again and she put a hand on his arm to stop him no you dont know my husband hed do anything to be rid of me he lied to the court he told them i was a terrible woman unfit to be a mother and he divorced me he paid people to prove what he said was true he kept the children from seeing me again and turned them against me my son was killed in france and i never knew he had enlisted he was just a boy and i never said goodbye to him she began to cry and he gave her his handkerchief im sorry but she went on wrapped in her own despair theres another woman now ive seen their photographs in the newspaper in the last few months what if she refuses to marry him because she doesnt want the shame of a divorce in her family its quite a good family they could object and hed not stop at having me killed rutledge took her arm and gently steered her into the sitting room settling her in a chair she was distraught but when he turned away to bring her tea from the tray by the hearth she clutched at him im afraid to drink it now what if someone slipped in and put something in the leaves id never know until it was too late ill have to throw everything in the rubbish bin i darent trust my chances dont you see mrs cathcart no one is trying to kill you youve had a shock thats all and it frightened you mr willingham saw his killer whoever it was fought with him there was no doubt that it was mr will ingham who was meant to die this has nothing to do with you she tried to stop shaking her sobs choking in her throat he went to the pot and felt it still quite warm he poured a cup drank from it and said you see theres nothing wrong with your tea let me find you a fresh cup he went into the kitchen found a pretty white porcelain cup to match the one hed used and filled it he added sugar and milk from the jug on the tray then had to hold her hands around the cup to keep her from spilling it after a few sips she sat back a little steadier now ive made a fool of myself she said looking up at him in some embarrassment i couldnt think of anything but dying alone and afraid in the night why did your husband wish to divorce you he was tired of me i wasnt exciting the children mattered more to me than anything and he was ambitious he needed to be seen at parties and attend weekends in the country he told me it was important to meet these people that they could do so much for his career hes a solicitor you see and wanted his own chambers so he took away the only thing that mattered and punished me for fighting him she drank a little more of the tea hes tried to do away with me im convinced of it i was on my bicycle coming home from uffing ton and someone ran into me and left me in the ditch the driver never stopped and it was ronnie i knew it was rutledge didnt know whether to believe her or not but he sat opposite her listening and offering what comfort he could she had been tormented to the point of convincing herself that her husband wanted her dead and her son weighed heavily on her mind she returned again and again to his loss and the fact that she knew nothing of his death for months then someone sent me a cutting from the newspaper weeks old the announcement of harrys death circled in black that was the letter that went astray to mr willingham i think it must have been shoved under his door there was no stamp on it i wanted to kill myself when i read the cutting and then i knew thats what hed hoped id do i wanted to die but i wouldnt give him that pleasure damn him rutledge said is there anyone i could bring to you youre too upset to stay alone just now she smiled the hurt in her eyes very plain i have no friends mr rutledge they believed his lies and deserted me as well fair weather friends i call them they couldnt withstand the storm but its kind of you to ask ill be all right but i shall lock my door tonight and drag that table across it for good measure after a time he got up to leave and she saw him to the door he stood there listening to the tumblers fall into place as she locked it before walking away there were two more vehicles here now men from one of them carrying a stretcher for the dead others were gathering around hill listening to instructions the remaining cottages were shut tight ranks closed against outsiders even with murder done it was a matter of selfpreservation rutledge thought hamish said aye but they know one of them could ha done this and he was right two dead out of nine he walked on toward his car hed seen enough he knew as much as hill did at this stage quincys door opened and he said whats going on willinghams dead rutledge answered indeed quincy looked thoughtfully in the direction of will inghams cottage there was a cry in the night i heard it i thought dublin was having a romantic interlude and so i didnt investigate anything to do with events youll have to ask inspector hill hes the man in charge your only interest is partridge then i wonder why because hes dead too an uneasy coincidence dont you think in such a small community youd better come in quincy opened the door wider and dublin scooted between his legs and into the house quincy had finished his breakfast and the dishes were still on the table dublin jumped up to sniff at them then lost interest moving on to curl up in a chair why do you think partridge died hes gone away before quincy was standing by the window watching the activity up the lane and nothing happened rutledge was at his shoulder he always came home again in a matter of several days you said as much yourself he responded someone knew his pattern yes its true he was a man of habit in some ways where did he go and why i cant find anyone who will tell me quincy shook his head we never exchanged that sort of information i dont like the police prowling about will they be knocking on doors do you think i expect they will mrs cathcart is frightened i doubt theyll persuade her to open her door quincy hesitated then said i saw singleton walking late hed been up the hill i wondered if he was looking for you i saw you there two nights ago i stopped for a while the horse is interesting to me and so are we your specimens under glass i doubt inspector hill knows as much about us as you do because of partridge im not interested in your past just whether or not you had a reason to dislike your neighbor i dont have a reason to like or dislike him but ill tell you i dont much care for brady he cant hold his drink and millers a slippery sod i wouldnt put murder past him if you want the truth singleton is secretive and that means he has secrets whats yours mine i was a remittance man and told never to set foot in england again but i got homesick tired of foreigners their language their food their ways so i slipped back into england and the family thinks im still in mexico my keep is paid into my account each month and i like it that way it was a challenge but rutledge didnt take it up after a moment quincy went on whats your interest in partridge anyway i dont know that i believe the tale you tell for all i know partridge is a red herring and its someone else who is on your watch list id like very much to know why hes dead or you know why but not who killed him and my money is on brady because he hates partridge you know god knows why but he does which was an interesting consideration the watcher should be above reproach and until partridgeparkinsonwas a closed book there was no release for brady either was he tired of loneliness and orders rutledge left and was halfway to his motorcar when he heard hill calling to him he was just coming out of millers cottage and jogged down to meet rutledge his fair face flushed as he caught up i thought youd agreed this was my patch and here you are hobnobbing with the neighbors i had agreed rutledge answered him keeping his tone mild but mrs cathcart and quincy called to me wanting to know what had happened i told them willingham was dead they suspected as much with the police summoned well id be grateful if you kept away he paused what about slater he tells me he knew you were here and came for you instead of me he could have wielded that knife you know and used you for an alibi i doubt slater killed willingham in the first place why miller tells me slater has something of a temper and willingham was the devil to get along with he was an unpleasant neighbor i dont believe he invited his murder by tormenting slater yes well you never know slights sometimes galvanize people like slater into retaliation what do you mean slights rutledge asked you can see slater isnt the brightest star in the sky is he and hes had a runin or two in uffington hes been accused of doing bad work for one thing and overcharging for it ah the sexton yes bad news travels fast the work on that teapot was well done i saw it myself the sexton cheated slater if the sexton were dead you might have a case hill considered rutledge with interest you do know these people dont you better than youre willing to admit ive held a conversation with several of them hill was beginning to annoy him and he could feel hamish stirring in the back of his mind see that you dont hold any more until ive got to the bottom of this business and youve never been clear about the yards interest here in berkshire no ones said anything to me about an inspector sent down it has nothing to do with willingham i can assure you a watching brief for the moment yes miller informed me that youd shown an inordinate amount of interest in partridge where is he not dead by any chance a knife in his back hardly well keep clear of my men and let them do their work hill walked away he doesna care for you stepping on his toes i dont blame him id not like anyone meddling in my case he turned the crank and got in but sat there with the motor idling thinking he now had the perfect excuse to ask sergeant gibson to learn what he could about the people here in this tiny enclave of lepers it might be interesting to see what he could discover but he was no nearer to finding what had happened to parkinson a death in yorkshire a death in berkshire and both without the usual span of motives that often tipped the balance of an inquiry there was no village here in the real sense and no threads or connections to be picked up and sorted through the inhabitants of the tomlin cottages hadnt known one another before coming here to live as far as he could telland that could hold just as true of brady as any of the others martin deloran wouldnt have trusted such a task to anyone who had been a friend of parkinson he house when he got there was shut tight and no one an where was he to find the daughter that the housekeeper had spoken of in passing or the other children there was time to go back to partridge fields and ask although he was of two minds over involving this daughter until he was prepared to tell her that her father was dead swered the knocker hamish moody had much to say about his failure to ask the housekeeper about the children when he had the chance instead he had pursued the subject of porton down and then it was too late rutledge drove on to the post office and braced himself to face the elderly postmaster again the man was as irascible and unhelpful as hed been earlier im not supposed to give out information of this sort he informed rutledge im searching for her father she may know where he can be reached i cant help you there she doesnt live here very well the direction of the housekeeper at partridge fields where can she be found when no one is in residence its police business they went in circles for all of five minutes finally in exasperation rutledge said ill speak to the local police then and bring someone back with me it wont do you any good the housekeeper doesnt live here either rutledge turned away holding on to his patience with an effort but as he was walking out the door a young woman with dark red hair and freckles who had been in the post office putting stamps on a small stack of invitations followed him out into the april sunshine she called to him and said you are trying to locate rebecca parkinson i overheard you tell mr walsh you were a policeman yes i need to find her father is anything wrong is someone ill weve been asked to try to locate him id hoped his daughter might help she frowned i doubt youll succeed they havent spoken for two years i can try he said smiling down at her if i knew where to find her do you know her we went to school together look she and her father are estranged but if its important very important all right then shes taken a small house about five miles from partridge fields no ones lived at the house since mrs parkinsons death but rebecca keeps up the gardens if you go to the crossroads and turn left instead of right youll find her at a place signposted pockets he thanked her and went back to the motorcar the house was where the young woman had said it would be small and well kept the thatch overhanging the door and a pot of heartsease in tall stands on either side of it the gardens surrounding it were filled with spring blooms he went up the front walk and knocked lightly after a few minutes a young woman of perhaps twentyfour blond and attractive opened the door to him my name is rutledge he said im from scotland yard her face went white as if the blood had drained away and left only the flesh what do you want she asked holding tightly to the door her voice low and husky im trying to find your father its police business i dont know where he lives i dont care im told you came to visit him once not long ago a young woman of your description was seen knocking on his door where she had been pale she flushed now and he thought it might be anger i havent knocked on any door of his i can tell you that he killed my mother and i hate him she tried to shut the door but he prevented her with a wellplaced shoe miss parkinson i have reason to think your father is dead she stared at him as if trying to read something in his face dead its very likely well then hes in hell where he deserves to be go look for him there and she shut the door with some force he stood there on the tiny porch and waited thinking that she might be curious enough to want to know more but apparently she had meant what she said and after a moment he went back to the motorcar he had just reached for the crank when he thought he heard raised voices from the house only for an instant and even then he wasnt certain whether miss parkinson was arguing with someone or venting her own angeror her grief rutledge found a telephone in a small hotel along the road back to uffington and put in a call to the yard gibson couldnt be found right away and it was a good quarter of an hour before the telephone rang and gibson was on the line rutledge gave him a list of names and asked him to learn what he could about each gibson said it will take a while ive got all the time in the world rutledge said with irony and told the sergeant when he expected to call the yard again he ate his lunch at the hotel and then traveled back to the smiths arms there he found smith eager to hear what had transpired at the cottages rutledge said only inspector hill is dealing with it willingham is dead thats all i can tell you willingham smith seemed surprised i thought perhaps youd found mr partridge rutledge let it go but smith was starved for information and said but how did he die his heart was it you must ask inspector hill pshaw his like never show up here at the arms ill ask andrew when he comes for a pint care for a late lunch mr rutledge rutledge refused thanking him and went up to his room taking out paper and pen he sat down and wrote an account of what hed seen and done that morning at the willingham cottage signed it and set it aside after that he went to stand by the window looking out across the yard and the road watching the wind dancing through the high grass there there was a letter only just begun that hed found in the basket beside parkinsons desk my dear was as far as hed got before crumpling it up had that been written to his daughter apologizing for whatever hed done to make her hate him with such venom trying in some small way to make amends for the loss of her mother or asking her forgiveness for whatever role she felt hed played in his wifes death and yet parkinson had died as his wife had died using gas that would seem a bitter irony to rebecca parkinson when she learned what had become of her father unless hamish pointed out the lass herself murdered him that had to be taken into account as well except that the body had been found in yorkshire hamish said ware and rutledge turned to see andrew slater walking up the road toward the smiths arms minutes later slater was mounting the stairs rutledge had the door open ready for him why did you leave the smith asked aggrieved you left us to the mercy of inspector hill hes half convinced that i killed willing ham i ask you why would i come and tell you id heard a cry if id done the deed myself it doesnt make any sense to me hill is doing his duty and hell begin by taking a long hard look at the dead mans neighbors if youve done nothing wrong if your conscience is clear youll see thats true yes well the smith said gingerly lowering himself down in rut ledges chair it groaned under his weight if i survive ill applaud myself for my clear conscience who do you think might have wanted willingham dead rut ledge had promised inspector hill to stay out of the case but slater had come to him god knows we didnt much care for him and if we didnt who did hed never spoken of a family whos to mourn him then a good question rutledge answered i can tell you mrs cathcart is taking it hard and so is mr allen death came too close last night for his comfort and the others miller doesnt give a damn about any of it if we all dropped dead in our shoes hed probably be pleased mr brady is trying to make himself very inconspicuous he was drunk as a lord before he went to bed last night and i doubt hed have heard the angels chorus after that but he doesnt want it known to the world did mr partridge have better luck with willingham did they talk do you think slater shook his head wheres a beginning for friendship i expect i spoke with more of my neighbors than anyone else im too thick to notice when im being ignored besides im lonely sometimes no one ever came to call on willingham if they did i never saw them mrs cathcart is afraid someone might visit her thats sad he looked down at his large hands lying idle on his knees i wish i hadnt grown so but theres nothing i can do about it just as she cant help being afraid and i dont know if quincy is his first name or his last i never feel right calling him quincy mr allen is dying and theres no one to comfort him i expect he doesnt want to be comforted theres something stoic in that mr partridge had demons and didnt know how to rid himself of them and singleton wants to be a soldier still you have only to look at his carriage and how tidy he is hair clipped short clothes immaculate mr brady is tormented too because this isnt where he most wants to be and mr miller is the strangest of the lot because i think he wants to be here it was an intriguing summation of the inhabitants of the leper cottages sometimes rutledge thought a simple man saw more directly into the heart than one who was burdened with the sophistication of social behavior slater got to his feet you wont let them arrest me will you i dont want to be taken into uffington and put in a cell with everyone staring at me i think id go mad locked up and tell the police anything just to be let go even lies he went back down the stairs heavily like a man carrying an enormous burden outside he turned to the smithy not back the way hed come it was odd how he seemed to find comfort and even acceptance there slater hadnt been gone five minutes when hill came looking for rutledge he said seeing the door open into rutledges room id like to have your statement now if you please rutledge turned to the desk and picked it up its ready i wanted to put it on paper while my memory of events was still sharp hill took it and scanned it fair enough any thoughts on who might have done this murder i leave that to you but i will say if i were in your shoes id be no closer to an answer you were right theyre a stubborn lot wont come to the door wont say more than yes or no when they do and no one has seen anything granted it was in the middle of the night but i have the feeling that not much happens in those cottages that the rest of them dont know i could feel the window curtains twitching like a palsy eyes watching every move i make fairly gave me the willies i can tell you but if i had to pick one of that lot it would either be the smith or the exsoldier did you know hed been cashiered from his regiment for dereliction of duty some years ago thats the story i was given anyway by whom one of my men had seen him about and heard something of the sort ill look into it find out if theres any truth in it as far as i can tell theres nothing missing from the dead mans cottage so i have to rule out housebreaking although that might have been the original plan come to think of it willinghams wrist was slashed rutledge said neutrally yes probably while fighting off his killer you saw for yourself how the room was wrecked you dont think someone was trying to make the death appear to be a suicide no no too preposterous i talked to the man who calls himself quincy seems a levelheaded sort he thinks this murder is connected with partridges disappearance he predicted theyd all be killed in their beds if im not quick willingham by all accounts was an unpleasant man who had probably made himself a pariah long before he came to the tomlin cottages his murderer could have come from his past id considered that too and will be looking into it hed been standing leaning against the doorframe nonchalant as if rutledges opinion carried no weight with him he straightened preparing to go but hamish believed his coming to the inn was a fishing expedition rutledge tended to agree with that summation youll be returning to the yard hill asked from the head of the stairs im of the opinion your man partridge is dead thats mr bradys view as well i expect he may be right rutledge answered well at least i have a body to be going on with thats more than you can sayso far he turned and ran lightly down the stairs rutledge watched hill leave the inn and walk briskly back the way hed come in the afternoon he drove back to pockets to speak again to rebecca parkinson she was there in the house he could sense it but she refused to answer his knock he tried to sense how she had responded to itwhether she was stockstill waiting for him to go away or hiding behind the stairs where she couldnt be seen or lying on her bed looking at the ceiling telling herself that she didnt care and he found himself wondering if meredith channing if she were standing next to him under the overhang of thatch would have been able to tell him if he was right unwilling to leave rutledge waited in his motorcar for over an hour outside the house but it was a stalemate he couldnt go in and she couldnt come out finally he gave up and drove away the house at partridge fields drew him and he went there to sit in the gardens for a time this time the house felt empty and he knew there was no one inside he was about to leave when a motorcar turned in the gates and followed the drive round to the kitchen yard he realized it must be rebecca parkinson and he walked swiftly toward the shrubbery to catch her before she had gone inside but she must have seen him or perhaps glimpsed his vehicle where hed left it behind a shed she gunned the engine swung the vehicle in a circle to turn it tires spewing gravel and earth as they bit for a grip and then sped away down the drive before he could stop her he stood there winded from dashing after the motorcar and swore it was useless following her back to pockets by the time he retrieved his own motorcar and started after her she would have a head start enough to be safely inside again before he could get there but he was angry enough to try and drove after her anyway flying down the lane in her wake when he got to pockets there was no sign of the car or of rebecca he realized that she must have expected him to follow her and instead of going directly home as hed anticipated she had foxed him again and disappeared rutledge drove back to berkshire his mood dark and found the inn full of drivers stopping for dinner or the night avoiding them he went directly to his room tomorrow he would call gibson again and see what if any information hed come up with in the event it was very little although hill had been right about singleton hed been cashiered from his regiment but not for dereliction of duty he had lost his temper once too often and been asked to resign after hed struck a fellow officer the reason for the argument wasnt clear but gibson believed it was the excuse singletons commanding officer had been looking for mrs cathcarts nasty divorce had been as bad or worse than shed told rutledge her husband in gibsons view had set out to make her life wretched and succeeded beyond his wildest expectations after the divorce hed cut her off without a penny and she had had to scrape a living as best she could the rent at the cottages was cheap enough and she had inherited just enough from an aunt to live there frugally allen who in fact was dying had gone off like a wounded animal to spend his last days away from friends and family the general belief was that hed wanted nothing to do with surgery or cures and expected to die within the first six months he hadnt been that fortunate there was no information on the man who called himself quincy and none on miller or brady gibson suggested that brady was using a name other than his own and there were too many millers to be sure which one was living in the shadow of the pale horse and with only one name to go on quincy hadnt turned up in the files or memories of the policemen gibson had spoken to rutledge found himself thinking that perhaps quincy had spoken the truth that he was a remittance man back in england and careful to conceal that fact willingham had a rather sordid past as it happened he had been involved in dubious schemes designed to leave the investor poorer and himself richer skirting the law carefully he had managed to avoid trouble but in the end bitter and running out of money hed come to a place where he felt safe from persecution as well as prosecution although a few of his former clients had threatened to sue him over the years the general consensus had been that in doing so they would reveal their own avarice and their willingness to bend the rules to their own advantage still more than one had voiced physical threats hes been there for more than ten years and the taste for revenge must have grown cold by now gibson concluded but then you never know this didnt appear to be a case of revenge as far as i can tell the intent was to make his death appear to be a suicide not much satisfaction there none gibson agreed on the other hand it would confuse the police rutledge thanked gibson and put up the receiver on his way back to the inn from uffington he wondered at what point willinghams death would bring attention round to parkinsons empty cottage until it did he would leave hill to it he stayed away from the cottages but by nightfall he was restless he could feel the tension building and hamish in his mind was a bleak shadow that threatened to break through his guard he walked to waylands smithy back again to the inn and from the road watched the moon rise after a time he strolled on toward the white horse revealing itself as he neared it and felt the tug of its spell the graceful gallop was marvelous and he thought about the hand that had created it guiding the men who dug the sod from the chalk with antler spades until its dimensions were revealed what must it have felt like to see it complete for the first time shimmering in the moonlight magic in its own way he was suddenly distracted by something he could sense but not clearly see surely there was someone at the foot of the horse and instead of looking up whoever it was had his back to the horse rutledge stood very still letting all his faculties tell him what was there hamish said his voice soft in rutledges ear whoever it is it isna stirring else id hear it rutledge was thrown back to the trenches and scanning no mans land in the dark for any activity scanning until his eyes ached and he had to rub them with his fingers before opening them again his mens lives had depended on his alertness his ability to see a sniper crawling to a vantage point or men changing the watch along the line of trenches opposite sometimes even parties going out to look for their wounded once or twice hed caught the faint sounds of fresh men settling at the machine gun far across the pitted landscape hamish had been better than any of them at the game his ears attuned to sounds most couldnt hear the slightest movement caught rutledges attention dragging him back to the figure no sound just a minute change in position as if someone had been standing there too long and was beginning to feel stiff or chilled in the night air he waited slowly dropping until he was squatting and no longer a silhouette against the sky there it was again a figure in black he couldnt tell if it was male or female only that it was as quiet as a carving its shape altered by arms wrapped around its body giving it a bulkier outline in the day of the white horse hed have believed in ghosts or totems of a clan he told himself but this was human this figure and tiring after a bit it seemed to lengthen as if it too had been squatting or bent over peering toward the cottages and then it began to move away from rutledge back to the far side of the horse and toward a clump of trees that grew across the road he rose slowly to his feet and followed in its wake he was closer now and hed been right the figure was bent over as if in pain and its arms were wrapped tightly around its body hamish said yon motorcar indeed there was one left in the dark shadows cast by the trees a sound drifted back to him human and grieving a sob he thought that rose in spite of intense selfcontrol and for an instant broke free before being smothered again he was closer still the figure never turning to look back never dreaming that someone followed it it reached the motorcar and leaned against a wing as if struggling with some emotion then it went forward to the grill and reached for the crank as the engine fired rutledge broke from the side of the hill and raced forward catching the figure just as it turned toward the drivers door it fought with tooth and nail and shoe but he was stronger saying over the sound of the engine im not going to harm you ill let you go if you dont cry out neither one of us wants to be heard over there at the cottages there was a stillness and then a nod he stepped back ready to move again if it was a trick he knew who his prisoner was a woman rebecca parkinson and yet what he found almost incomprehensible was the pain hed sensed in someone who had clearly hated her father and reveled in his death what do you want the voice was husky in the darkness who are you and there was fear in that question as well my name is rutledge miss parkinson you know me we talked at your home youre lying no truly i was at pockets she threw her head back and said i dont live at pockets so the housekeeper was right about children here was the sister to rebecca im sorry if you arent rebecca whats your given name miss parkinson its sarah grudgingly spoken he noted where do you live near porton down in one of the old cottages what possessed you to attack me in that outrageous way im from scotland yard ive been trying to speak to your sister and shes done her best to avoid me its about your father she was still for an instant and then she said my fathers dead at least to me he is as he has been for the past two years yet you come here to where he lived he hazarded a guess and someone saw you here once before knocking at his door then sometime later sitting in what must have been this motorcar alone and crying she appeared to be shaken by his knowledge of her movements have you been watching me she demanded what is this i dont understand why the yard would take any interest in my father he hasnt been seen for some time we think hes dead and that he may have been murdered he could hear the quick drawn breath as the shock of his words hit her i dont believe you nevertheless his body has been found in yorkshire she broke down then turning away from him and burying her face in her hands he let her cry standing patiently behind her until she was calmer i hated him she said after a time i think you must have loved him as well how could i after what hed done to my mother she killed herself no matter how hard they tried to put a better face on it she killed herself do you know what it is to come home from a party and find the police in your house and everything at sixes and sevens and then youre asked to look at your mothers dead face and tell the police that you recognize her rebecca and i said goodbye to her and she was smiling she was smiling and she insisted on kissing us for luck she said and we went blithely away waving to her looking forward to the party and it never struck us either of us that she was different somehow that perhaps she was saying goodbye in a very different way he said where was your father when she died at the house no no he was at the laboratory he was always in the laboratory looking for a way to stabilize a gas so that it could be used in a shell or trying to make it more potent longer lasting more dependable in delivery everyone thought he was the cleverest man a practical scientist he not only could devise gases he could take them to the battlefield i heard them say so once when they didnt know i was there in the cottage he sometimes used and they were waiting for him to arrive practical as if this horrid way of maiming and killing soldiers was something to be studied for the most economical or useful way of doing murder the germans used it first what does it matter it was inhumane oh im sick of this business if you have nothing more to say to me im going home you havent told me why you came here to see your father why you were standing there on the hill tonight if you hate him so much why do you torment yourself like this i dont know she said wearily i remember sometimes the man who set me on his shoulders to see the queens carriage pass during victorias jubilee or held me on my first pony until i stopped being afraid of falling off and could take the reins myself or bringing me chocolates on my birthday when i was twelve and telling me they had come all the way from belgium little things that had nothing to do with gassing soldiers or killing the cows by accident or spending more and more time in his laboratory lost in the things he could create there she caught her breath on a sob then cleared her throat there was something new he was working on some terrible new possibility thats why he wasnt there with us that night mother died and he walked away from us and came to live here alone i told myself it was recognizing what hed done to her and to us but later i thought perhaps he was afraid to go back because in her will shed asked that her ashes be scattered in the gardens under their bedroom windows i i f she had intended to shock him sarah parkinson succeeded jl rutledge had walked in those gardens admiring them he had seen how carefully they were maintained and never guessed that they were in effect mrs parkinsons memorial he said is that why neither you nor your sister live at partridge fields would you she demanded if every time you looked out at the gardens you felt her presence i thought it might be comforting somehow but it isnt shes a restless unhappy ghost and were afraid of her yet you or your sisteror both of youkeep the gardens the way they must have been when she was alive he could see her bite her lip i hate it shes there scattered about the beds and were caught up in her revenge if we let the gardens go to seed if theyre overgrown and ugly were desecrating her grave if we dig and plant and weed were touching her ashes its as if the flowers draw their strength from her bones and morbidly flourish my father left it to us to decide what to do about the grounds and it was the cruelest thing he did she walked to the door of the motorcar im tired i want to go home ive talked too much as it is you must decide between you who will come to yorkshire with me and bring your fathers body back to wiltshire no ill have no part in any such thing let him stay where he is unloved and unwanted she hadnt asked why her father had gone to yorkshire or had died there hamish said it would ha been easy for them to kill him if he was lured to the house were either of the women capable of murder he rather thought that rebecca parkinson was her hatred was still whitehot and ran deep there was grief mixed into sarahs emotions but she would surely have supported her sister after parkinson had been killed the only other choice would have been to refuse then see rebecca caught convicted and hanged but if the sisters had killed their father why do it in yorkshire or had he got away the first time theyd tried and they had gone after him a chilling thought the question was how was he going to go about proving it did your father have enemies anyone who would have liked to see him dead it was the standard question to put to survivors not that i know of although there was one man in london whom my father didnt trust he told my mother once that hed been invited to bring us up to london to dine with this man and my father didnt want us to go i only remember because becky and i were so disappointed but my father said that london was quite dull because of the war and it wouldnt have been as exciting as wed thought what was this mans name rutledge asked although he had a very good idea i dont think i ever heard it my father referred to him as the dreadnought but that was the name of a ship wasnt it deloran in the end he let sarah parkinson go after asking how to find her if he needed her to answer more questions he had no grounds on which to keep her but then as she put the motorcar in gear rutledge put a hand on her door theres been a murder in the cottages a man called will ingham did he know your father by any chance a murder how dreadful she shook her head i dont think my father would have come here to live if he had known any of his neighbors he was running away from the house from mothers ghost from usfrom the army possibly even from himself who knows for that matter who cares it was selfish whatever his excuse was watching her motorcar out of sight rutledge found himself pitying the unwanted still nameless body in yorkshire hamish said he made his own grave whilst he was still living and it was true in many ways but in the end rebecca and sarah parkinson would have no choice but to bring their father home if mrs parkinson still haunted the house where shed died parkinson would be satisfied to lie in the churchyard far from the flower beds at partridge fields but which name would be engraved on the stone over him if rebecca and sarah parkinson denied that he was their father deloran would be only too pleased to add his own statement that the murder victim was an unknown unhappy man named partridge dead at the hands of person or persons unknown and in a year or two all of this would be forgotten brady might be brought in to testify and disclaim any knowledge of an assignment to watch a scientist who had resigned prematurely from porton down he was merely an exsoldier down on his luck and trying to sober up and rutledge would be left looking a fool he walked back to the inn and retrieved his motorcar it was late to be driving to partridge fields but the roads were fairly empty and he made good time keeping awake through sheer physical effort by the time he was twenty miles away he opened the gates and drove through them leaving the car near the shed the house was dark the gardens black in the moonlight the brash colors of spring disguised as varying shades of gray the kitchen door as hed thought was unlocked this was the country no one came to rob the house there was no need to lock doors carrying his torch he walked through the kitchen quarters and then through the formal rooms of the house the glancing beam of his torch illumined the brilliant colors of draperies and carpets and upholstery the gold filigree around a mirror the rich tones of polished walnut and mahogany the shimmer of silk wallpaper and cut glass in the chandeliers someone had had money mrs parkinsons dowry parkinsons wages from the government a family inheritance enough at least for a comfortable life and a wellappointed home he moved quietly in the silent house and avoided windows portraits watched him as he passed and once a mouse scurried out of the wainscoting and across the floor squeaking as it dived into the cold hearth like the gardens the house was meticulously maintained even without hamishs harsh reminder rutledge was well aware that he had no authority to open doors look in drawers and investigate the contents of desks but he rather thought he would find nothing even if he did even so he saw no trace of parkinson here although there were several photographs of a fair woman with two fair and pretty daughters set in silver frames looking at them he could almost see the girls grow from room to room as the array of photographs marked the changes of years he studied mrs parkinsons likeness she was slim very pretty and her eyes reminded him of a doe sensitive and vulnerable she should have married a country squire he thought not a man whose training in chemistry had taken a far different turn from anything either of them could foresee rutledge broke his own rule only once looking in the wardrobe in what appeared to be the master bedroom as hed expected it held only a womans clothing as if parkinson had taken everything of his with him leaving nothing behind because he never intended to come home again and reciprocally his daughters had banned him from the house by carrying out their mothers wishes he was shut out lock stock and photographs there were none that included him was that why the one on his desk was so precious to him taken the day we climbed the white horse rutledge inspected the lamps in the master bedroom and turned the key gently listening to the soft hiss of gas wafting into the room before shutting it off again it would be a simple matter to close the doors and windows and lie there in bed waiting to fall asleep and die but then mrs parkinson had been ready to die had parkinson been asked to come here for a reconciliation and then drugged enough to keep him from waking up when someone slipped in turned on the gas and laid towels outside the doors retribution without pity but without having to watch a father die hamish said aye but no in this room and no in this house he wouldna sleep here which might explain why the body had been discovered in yorkshire but even if parkinson had somehow been lured there where was the gas jet that killed him even two young women would have a problem dragging a dead man out of a hotel without being noticed hamish said ye ken it may ha been one of delorans men who lured him to where he was killed counting on the fact that the newspapers wouldnt concern themselves with a nobodys unfortunate death then why dress the body in mask and cloak attracting attention to it hard to believe that deloran would stoop to murder but then rutledge was still in the dark about why precisely the man cared what happened to either gaylord partridge or gerald parkinson it would be easier surely to discredit him than to murder him aloud rutledge said then why send the yard here when parkinson went missing drawing attention to him why not leave well enough alone to wash his hands theres the watcher he could ha sworn that nobody knew where partridge had gone just as nobody kenned where hed vanished before yes well i think tomorrow its time to speak to mr brady drunk or sober keeping his torch from striking the glass he went to the window and looked down on the dark gardens clouds were moving across the face of the moon as it set and he could almost imagine something out there as the shadows shifted very likely the horse fountain showing itself in ghostly white fragments as the shrubs moved in the wind but add a little guilt to that and he could understand how the family must have felt about this room and the gardens in the passage leading to the stairs rutledge paused to consider the nature of the silence around him the ashes in the garden must have been the last straw not the first he had a strong feeling that this family had broken apart long before mrs parkinsons suicide what had really brought her to the brink of despair it must have gone far beyond her belief that her husband was squandering his gifts and talents on work that he loved and she hated he reached the kitchen made certain that hed not tracked mud from the yard onto the stone flags by the door and left the house exactly as hed found it standing for a moment in the nights darkness until his eyes adjusted he thought he heard an owl call from the trees beyond then he walked to the motorcar without looking back hamish remarked it wasna wise to come here it could do no harm rutledge answered going down the drive without his headlamps and turning the bonnet toward berkshire aye so ye may think now and later live to regret it in fact hamish was right rutledge was eating a late breakfast at the smiths arms when the door opened and rebecca parkinson strode in what the devil did you think you were doing she asked harshly when you went to my mothers house in the night rutledge caught off guard said if there are no servants in the house to protect it if doors are left unlocked anyone can walk in how many times did your father go back to that house without your knowledge or for that matter the man he called dreadnought she opened her mouth to say something and then shut it smartly after a moment she asked what could you possibly know about dreadnought his real name that took her aback in the silence that followed she tried to absorb the implications of what hed said my father disliked him intensely it was personal and professional he told me once that the name suited the manhe feared nothing and he used people for his own ends if youve been sent here by dreadnought im not surprised that you would stoop to anything i told you im from scotland yard but i have met the man now why should you think that someone had been in the house at partridge fields returning to the grievance that had brought her here she said the gardener at one of the houses down the road was coming home late last night from a wedding and he saw lights moving from room to room hes known my family for ages my mother and he often exchanged plants he came to find me this morning to tell me that something was wrong something about the lights troubled him and he was afraid to investigate hes an old man and he may have thought it was my mothers spirit but i knew better it wasnt my mothers poor ghost it was you when you couldnt badger me you went to the house on your own thinking no one would learn of it he had been careful not to show a light and he remembered the flicker of movement he imagined hed seen in the shadows near the horse fountain had someone else been there after he left deloran might have had reasons of his own for taking the risk of searching the empty house if so what was he looking for he wouldna go himself ye ken hamish remarked his hands are clean rutledge said to miss parkinson but you yourself couldnt see evidence of someone there of course not youre a london policeman you arent going to leave muddy footprints in the passages what i want to know is what you took away if i was there it was without any legal right to take anything from the house i should have known you wouldnt have the decency to tell me the truth rutledge smiled faintly yes all right i was there but i touched nothing i wanted to see what drove your father away from his homewhy he chose to live where he did i was hoping that if i could understand that i could explain some of the other things i dont understand please sit down and let mrs smith bring you a cup of tea i have a few questions to ask you and we might as well get them over with she was still angry you went into my mothers room where she died why should i want to talk to you i wouldnt give you that satisfaction when she had first confronted him hed noted how much like her mother she looked but in the course of their conversation rutledge could see how much stronger she was than her mother must have been her spirit he thought must have come from her father however much she would fiercely deny it before she could turn and stalk out of the inn he said i can arrange to have you taken into custody to help us with our inquiries if you prefer that on what charges she demanded ive done nothing except refuse to speak to you and i cant be forced to speak as you well know on the charge that you murdered your father rebecca parkinson sat down thats utter rubbish yes but i rather think i could prove it it might be worth a cup of tea to find out what i know i dont want tea whatever you have to say it had better be said quickly or im leaving i told you the first time we met weve found your fathers body it was blunt and intended to be her angry flush faded hes alive and well and living in those wretched cottages under the white horse her denial wasnt completely convincing as if she knew her father was dead but must keep up the pretense that it was a lie her vehemence on their first meeting had been stronger but he went missing you see and now his body is lying unclaimed in a yorkshire village doesnt that mean anything to you or the fact that he might have been murdered it has nothing to do with me the line of her jaw was defiant he didnt die where we found him thats why we have to suspect murder im here to make sense of what little we do know and that means i have to follow him if i can every step of the way from those cottages to yorkshire to do that i need information about his life his family his friends his enemies whether you like it or not she said make sense of whatever you like just leave me out of it do you hate your father so much that youd prefer to see his killer go free she glanced down so that he couldnt see her eyes ive told you i dont really care did you know that one of the other people in those cottages was murdered last night a mr willingham i need to know what connection he might have had with your father she looked up then startled i dont believe you ask inspector hill in uffington hes handling that case leaning back in her chair she considered him her mind working i dont know anyone named willingham a coincidence it must be thats possible of course but in such a small community two murders in a few weeks has to be regarded with suspicion im forced to wonder what mr willingham might have known about your fathers disappearance if he saw someone come for your father and take him away the bicycle your father sometimes rode and his motorcar were both where he kept them surely your father didnt walk all the way to yorkshire he thought her mouth was dry she ran her tongue over her lips and said if youll summon mrs smith i believe ill have that tea now it was a surprising change of heart rutledge was wary he went to find mrs smith though hamish warned him that rebecca parkinson would be gone when he returned it was a risk he had to take he was relieved when he came back tray in hand to find she was still at his table rutledge passed her the fresh cup waited until she had added milk and sugar then taken the first sip i spoke to your sister last night she nearly choked i dont believe you you dont even know where to find her shed come to stand on the hill by the white horse i dont know what it was she was thinking but i distinctly heard her crying sarah has always had a soft heart shes like my mother taking in lost kittens and stray dogs worrying about young men we knew who went to france and stayed there in unmarked graves still i had the strongest feeling that she must know more about your fathers death than shes comfortable with and her conscience is tormenting her its rather too much of a coincidence isnt it that she came to grieve the night after willingham died rebecca parkinson stood up so quickly she knocked over her cup and tea splashed onto the skirt of her dress you leave my sister alone do you hear me dont go near her again or i shall have you up for harassment do you understand me what are you afraid of miss parkinson that shell break before you do murder doesnt always sit easily on ones conscience but sometimes a second killing is necessary to protect the secrets of the first the police may consider that possibility you see in investigating willinghams whatever part she played in your fathers death will eventually drive her to confess what will you do to stop her rebecca parkinson leaned forward and with all the strength of her shoulder behind the blow slapped rutledge as hard as she could across the face leave my sister alone and then she was gone slamming the door hard behind her mrs smith came hurrying from the kitchen i heard such a noiseand look at the tea spilled all over my clean floor what happened im afraid the young woman who was here has a chink in her armor he said and ive just found it rutledge walked down to the cottages and tapped lightly on the smiths door slater looking as if he hadnt slept opened it and said i dont think inspector hill wants you to talk to me not about willingham no rutledge said stepping inside before slater could shut his door im here to talk about mr partridge did you know that he had two daughters no of course i didnt he never talked about his family i thought he must not have any no one came to spend a sunday afternoon with him that sort of thing it was just a guess that the girl who knocked at his door was his daughter mrs cathcart likes happy endings for all we know she might well have been the daughter of a friend you would think wouldnt you that being alone would make the cottages a friendlier place but it doesnt work that way is hill still giving you trouble over willinghams death hes told me ill be taken in to sign my statement i dont know when that will be or if hell keep me once he has me there he was morose ive not done anything wrong but the sexton has said im a liar and a cheat i dont see that that leads a man to murder but inspector hill seems to believe it does for what its worth i dont think he actually believes that you did this but he has to look at all the possibilities did you know willing ham before he moved here i didnt know any of these people including mr partridge and what do the other inhabitants of the tomlin cottages have to say about the murder they arent saying anything no one works in their garden even as warm as it is this morning no one answers the door youd think we collaborated on the murder drawing straws to see who did the actual stabbing like julius caesar in shakespeares play when everyone turns against him i remember reading that and thinking he should have known the ides of march meant trouble but i suppose there wouldnt have been a play at all if hed listened to his wife in the first place rutledge smiled you cut through the chaff to the kernel the smile faded are you all right slater as best as i can be but im too anxious to work and if i cant work in the end i wont eat either no one will bring business to me if im under a cloud of suspicion i must go to bradys cottage he said but if theres anything you need let me know how if they take me away theres nothing you can do i can try rutledge replied simply he left the smiths cottage and walked on down the lane to bradys there was no answer to his knock and hed expected none a stranger arriving here would have sworn that all the cottages were empty their inhabitants fled but behind the shut doors and the drawn shades of the windows there were people who had nowhere else to turn dublin came to greet him as he returned to his motorcar rubbing herself against his ankles and he bent down to pet her just as a sparrow flitted by and she turned to give chase what did dublin know about the murder of willingham she prowled the cottages looking for mice had she been outside willing hams two nights ago when a murderer came to call hamish said irritably it wouldna matter if she did shes no able to tell ye what she saw he climbed to the muzzle of the horse and sat there watching scudding clouds cross the sky it would rain before long and hed be wet if he didnt leave while he could but still he sat there waiting for someone to stir he could feel the eyes watching for him wondering where he might turn up next and whether or not he was doing his own work or hills and then mr allen stepped out of his door rutledge could hear him coughing the sound captured and bounced up the hill to where he sat allen puttered a little in his front garden casting wary eyes toward his neighbors cabin fever rutledge thought watching him and a small defiance in the face of death im alive you havent gathered me in yet or was it because they all knew that rutledge was sitting here watching that they felt free to move about quincy opened his door and set a bowl of water down for dublin and looked up at the building clouds mrs cathcart timidly crept out and moved a flower pot to where it better caught the waning sun miller was next putting something in the dust bin by the corner of his house and then looking fixedly at rutledge as if to ask why he was still here when it was clear that partridge wasnt coming back rutledge hadnt met the man but it wouldnt do any good to hurry down to the lane miller would be inside long before that they were all accounted for except for brady but he was the watcher accustomed to peering between his curtains and not showing his face rutledge found it interesting that brady was still here when deloran knew perfectly well that partridge was never coming back just as gerald parkinson would never return it was rutledge thought a fanciful public faade deloran keeping his watcher there to report to him and to make it appear that he himself believed partridge was coming back or perhaps brady had already been put out to pasture and lived on here because it was his home rutledge expected the man would claim that if he were questioned rutledge sat there listening to hamish in his head for another quarter of an hour he hadnt seen so much as the corner of a curtain twitch in bradys cottage no sign of life that would attract rutledges attention and bring him down the hill to knock again a crow came to perch on bradys chimneytop scolding dublin as she made her rounds mrs cathcart seeing it went quickly back inside quincy called to the cat then shut his own door allen still in the garden in front of his house looked up at the sound of quincys door closing and after a few minutes his defiance turning practical as the first drops of rain danced on the flagstones that made up his garden path he disappeared as well rutledge came down the hill feeling the heavy drops strike his shoulders with some force they were only the forerunners of the storm but the clouds had thickened to the west and rain would come in earnest in the next ten minutes or so rutledge went up the lane between the cottages and knocked again on bradys door calling to him when it remained shut there was no answer feeling a stirring of his intuition rutledge put his hand on the latch and lifted it the door wasnt locked he pushed it open calling brady i know youre in there i want to talk to you the crow flew away cawing as he went shattering the silence that sometimes foretells a storm rutledge stood there waiting but there was no response from brady he stepped inside hamish loud in his ears and looked at the untidy room dishes left on a table books and papers scattered about a pair of field glasses standing on the shelf under the window from his vantage point brady had a sweeping view toward the hill of the white horse and also of partridges cottage for an instant rutledge wondered if deloran was mad enough to send brady to do his dirty work for him at partridge fields then laughed at the thought a man who drank as brady was said to do couldnt be trusted with murder and then as his eyes adjusted to the storminduced gloom of the sitting room he saw brady staring back at him as if accusing him of trespassing but brady was not accusing anyone of anything a knife protruded from his chest and both his hands were wrapped around the hilt frozen there by death it appeared to rutledge looking down at the body as if brady had stabbed himself his grip on the blade almost like iron sitting in his chair forcing the blade into the soft flesh under his rib cage he appeared to have sliced through an artery and on the table beside him there was a sheet of paper rutledge could see the writing on it from where he stood but couldnt manage to read the words his guess was that brady had died sometime in the night and the letter would express his fear of hanging or a full confession rutledge looked at the mans narrow face unshaven chin thin graying hair there was depression in the circles under his eyes indicating sleepless nights and watchful days and nothing to show for it but a shabby cottage and a reputation for the bottle at his back the rain had begun in earnest and rutledge turned to look at the ground behind him whatever tracks were there the rain would quickly obliterate yet all he could see from where he stood were his own and the mixed prints of hills men trampling about as they came to interview brady if the murderer had come up the garden path he knew he would be safe if that is murder had been done he looked about the room staying where he was in the open door a gust of wind came up and whisked the sheet of paper from the table sending it into the ashstrewn hearth behind it what would hill make of this death an easy solution to willing hams murder whatever path the inspector took it would give rut ledge insight into the man he closed the door against the rising wind and walked away he would have to send the smith again to summon the police slater was reluctant to go why me hell think ive had something to do with it as sure as the dawn follows the dark because i must stay here to keep an eye on the cottage but no one would go in there and i could as easily keep watch slater go on i dont have my motorcar here its at the smiths arms youll find it there and hurry theres no need to hurry brady will still be there when inspector hill comes slater collected rain gear from the cupboard where he kept his clothes and then paused at the door youre safe enough getting yourself involved in this youre a policeman who is willing to believe me and he was gone out into the storm rutledge turned so that he could watch the brady cottage the smiths house reeked of wood smoke hed never noticed it before but the dampness outside somehow brought it to the fore slater used fire and hammer for his work it was evident everywhere rutledge looked the hinges of doors and cabinets the bolts that held them closed the tongs on the hearth the scoop of the shovel used to take out the ashes so many details hed never had time to notice even the latches of the windows had been replaced by wrought iron and the candlestick holders on the windowsill were attractively turned there was a boot scraper by the door made in the shape of a hedgehog the bristles of broom on his back looking like the bristles on the hedgehogs back overhead a wroughtiron lamp dropped down out of the ceiling on a finely made chain the sconces shaped like tulips the candle in the fold of the petals alone here he realized how the smiths presence tall and vibrant filled the room now it seemed larger outsized because he wasnt there rutledge kept his eye on the brady cottage saw the rain running hard off the roof and cascading onto the path and spreading out into the garden only trickles at first and then tiny lakes that came together and separated as the wind pushed them back by the time inspector hill came dashing in from the motorcar his hair shining with rain the shoulders of his coat dark with it the clouds were thinning the worst of the cloudburst passed he shook himself like a dog as he crossed the threshold and said all right im here ill deal with brady the rest of my men are following he looked up into rutledges face and said you seem to bring death in your wake you have it the wrong way round rutledge answered mildly too bad the rain has washed away any sign of footprints along the walk but there may not have been any if weve got a suicide still better safe than sorry keep an open mind and all that i looked before i left the cottage it was hard to pick out any print in particular too much traffic hill grunted i hope the rain is finished before we go inside there as it is well be tracking in half the garden wheres slater hes still in your motorcar i think hes half afraid im about to arrest him on the spot early days yet i dont know whether to take it as a sign of guilt or just his way of looking at things suddenly he could hear himself speak the rain had stopped all right im off youll stay here it was more a statement than a question he went out and splashed quickly up the lane to bradys cottage stopping on the threshold for a time and then disappearing inside shutting the door behind him he was in the cottage for several minutes his men collecting at the bottom of the lane awaiting instructions then he hurried back to slaters cottage just as the sun broke hazily through the thinning clouds in his hand protected by his coat hill held what appeared to be the sheet of paper that had fallen from bradys table he came inside and offered it to rutledge rutledge scanned the words written there willingham called me worthless and a disgrace i dont stand for that from any man i killed partridge as well patronizing sod that he was i dont regret either of them find partridge if you can if you cant youll find me in hell i wont hang ive no taste for it a knife is faster and cleaner bury me where you will i dont care its over and im just as glad there was no signature rutledge looked up can you be sure this is bradys handwriting there are papers and notes all over the floor but whether they can tell us conclusively or not that this is his i dont know he took the letter back looks as if brady were keeping a diary dates and times scribbled down would deloran wash his hands of brady as easily as he had of partridge hamish replied he willna care to have it known that this was his man hill might believe what was in the note but rutledge did not what struck him was the reference to partridge but no admission that the body had been left in yorkshire half a confession hamish said if partridges murder and willinghams are solved sae easily who will be best pleased wi that a very good question deloran for one and what about the two sisters rutledge said aloud to hill do you think brady killed willing ham im not sure i can accept the admission that he killed partridge for one thing parkinson hadnt been killed with a knife hill frowned thats the problem wheres partridges body brady must have taken it away have you searched partridges cottage not yet but ill see that its done id like to be there when you go in im not certain it will be easy enough for me to obtain the necessary permission hill grudgingly agreed then asked whats this man partridge to you did you have a suspicion that hes been murdered is that what brought you here in the first place rutledge chose his words carefully my instructions were to discover where he could be found if he didnt return in a reasonable period of time and he hasnt which may mean that whats on this sheet is the solution to your problems as well he was probing if im lucky rutledge agreed in the background hamish was reminding him that once more someone was using partridges disappearance for his own ends ill see to searching the partridge cottage later in the day hill went on ill set my men to asking the other cottagers when they last saw brady i doubt itll be much use to me but there you are has to be done he rubbed his chin as if something were on his mind then thought better of speaking of whatever it was all right then the doctor is on his way the question will be whether or not brady could have used that knife on himself and after that i must ask myself why if we had no inkling that he was involved with willinghams murder he felt compelled to confess rutledge answered neutrally a very good question especially since you showed considerable interest in slater rather than the other residents brady was in the clear still but im told he was often drunk and not always thinking very clearly true enough hill turned as a constable tapped lightly on slaters door he nodded to the silent rutledge the doctor is here he informed hill slater finally brought himself to get out of the motorcar he crossed to where the men were standing in his doorway and said where will it end im not sure rutledge turned back to the room as hill walked away i think we could use a cup of tea slater came inside and began to prepare it rutledge quietly asked him who lived in bradys cottage before he moved here it was an elderly woman miss chandler a lawyer came to tell her a cousin had died and left her a goodly sum in his will she didnt remember this cousin but it wasnt surprising she was a little daft her mind going still she thought she could recall her father telling her that someone in the family had gone to australia to seek his fortune i expect that was who died quite a convenient windfall where did she go from here theres a nice home run by a mrs deacon in the cotswolds shes well known for taking in elderly ladies without families a bit pricey but miss chandler could afford it now couldnt she she was very pleased and shed hardly got the good news when mr brady came round asking about a cottage they must have come to an agreement because she left him most of her furniture what did he offer as a reason for coming here to live slater brought in the tea tray how should i know but she told me he was looking for a quiet life deloran had been very clever first the sizable bequest and then someone there to take the cottage off miss chandlers hands at the right moment rutledge took his cup from slater and said did partridge have any contact with miss chandler fancy your asking that id quite forgot she was a typist and the week before she left he took her a handful of papers to type up for him he had a machine and she told him she knew how to use it do you know the direction for mrs deacons house its in the cotswolds a small manor house just outside fairford its called thornton hall i took mrs chandler there in my cart with her boxes and trunks why are you interested in what she typed for mr partridge why is it important rutledge finished his tea theres no way of telling whats important and what isnt until all the information is in hand but slater wasnt to be put off why is it that people think i cant understand whats happening why do they think im easily distracted like a child rutledge set his cup on the tray mr partridge had another life before he came here they all had other lives except for me he shook his head no thats not right id lived in uffington hadnt i i dont like remembering my life there still i depended on the smithy for my livelihood and i couldnt go very far hamish was saying the soft scots voice just behind rutledges shoulder hes puzzled and no one has the time to set him straight sometimes it isnt distance that matters for partridge i have a feeling it was the white horse that brought him here not the miles from where hed lived before this you dont believe that brady killed mr partridge do you lets say im keeping an open mind until all the facts have been collected its a waste of time going to miss chandler possibly but i wont know until i speak to her he left dashed through the puddles to where slater had left his motorcar and drove to the nearest road that would carry him up to fairford hamish kept him company along the way as it happened the house he was looking for was three miles outside of the pretty little town set just beyond a small grove of beech that had been planted sometime in the eighteen hundreds judging from their size age had begun to take a toll and three closest to the road looked to be near collapse thornton hall was a handsome stone house built in classical style with a portico and dormers on the slate roof a porch to one side had been closed in with long windows looking out over a large garden and beyond that fallow land rolled into the distance mrs deacon wasnt what hed expected a maid in crisply starched black that rustled as she walked led him through the hall to a small sitting room at the back of the house a tall spare woman with auburn hair rose to greet him and offer him a chair by the cold hearth she took the other and nodded to the maid when they were alone she asked rutledge what his business was with miss chandler im afraid its private he told her with a smile miss chandler is a woman of means but shes lonely and easily taken advantage of id like to know that you wont upset her her gaze was sharp her eyes detached i have no designs on her wealth he said the question might be do you a red flush flared across her cheeks im not in the habit of taking advantage of my guests mr rutledge they are here because they have nowhere else to go and i am here because this is my home and the only way i can afford to keep it is to take in such guests the property isnt productive now and i have no other means of seeing that the roof s repaired much less the plumbing functioning now i think youd better leave im sorry he apologized and meant it the business i have with miss chandler has to do with some typing she did for a man in the cottages where she used to live her eyes didnt waver then youll have no objection if i stay while you speak to her none at all hamish said his voice soft the dragon at the gate she rose again and led him down the passage to the enclosed porch where several women most of them between their early sixties and late seventies sat dozing or gossiping they looked up with interest as mrs deacon came into the room smiling up at her as if pleased to see her then their eyes went directly to rutledge curiosity rampant is this the new doctor then one asked im sorry no a guest miss chandler she spoke to a small woman swathed in shawls and seated in a large winged chair near the french doors needlepoint pillows at her back and on either side made it more comfortable for her and rutledge could see that she was well dressed her clothes and hair and skin well cared for her eyes were a bright blue and still very clear he hoped that her memory was as well she leaned forward a little as if hard of hearing and mrs deacon said this young man is here to see you miss chandler would you like to speak to him is it my cousin from australia no this is mr rutledge miss chandler hes here to ask you about a little typing you did for someone he knows she was crestfallen to discover it wasnt her cousin and rutledge spared a moment to think of delorans deception but she brightened again as she said my fingers are getting a little stiff for the typing young man what is it you need he took the chair across from hers so that she wouldnt have to look up at him mrs deacon remained standing i wonder if you recall mr partridge he lived in the tomlin cottages near the white horse for a few weeks before you moved here she searched through the cobwebs of her mind and finally nodded mr partridge polite as i recall and very pleased to learn i could type yes i do remember him now that you speak of him do you perhaps recall what it was you were asked to type for him it appears to have been lost oh thats a shame truly but im afraid my brain is a little addled these days im sure i couldnt remember what i did well enough to type it again from memory that must have been all of two years ago hamish was saying it wilna help but rutledge persevered was it a letter memoirs he tried to think of anything else that partridge might have worked on reports papers for a professional society oh yes thats precisely what it was how clever of you mr rutledge yes indeed it was a paper for a professional journal i recall it now he promised to send me a copy of the journal when the paper appeared i suppose he forgot i never received it there was disappointment in her face as she considered the matter i daresay it wouldnt have mentioned my name i only typed it but still was the paper difficult to work on quite so a good many symbols had to be carefully inserted by hand i didnt know what all of them represented but i do remember how he insisted that they must be absolutely precise he told me that others duplicating his work must know exactly what he knew or it would be useless to try it appears hed made an interesting discovery in his laboratory just before he left his firm and he wanted to report it to some society or other as a last claim to fame and glory she frowned although truly i thought he might be joking about that he said it in such a wry way was he a man given to joking far from it he seemed withdrawn as if he had a habit of living alone and had to remind himself sometimes to be jolly in company dont misunderstand me he was quite professional very clear in his instructions and he went through the typed pages with great care to be sure everything was exactly as hed set it out i asked him if this discovery of his however small might be something mankind would be grateful to know about in some quarters perhaps he replied it will be highly regarded i thought perhaps he meant in the medical field hed mentioned once working in a laboratory you see i was a great admirer of madame curie and told him so he answered that he could never aspire to her greatness and i found i believed him mrs deacon standing to one side of the chair put in did you make a carbon copy for mr partridge my dear if the original went to the society no he told me that wasnt necessary there was only the original and he paid you for this work rutledge went on of course with a nice little bit extra for finishing it quickly as well as accurately i was planning to leave the cottage you see and he didnt want me to take the information with me i suspect he felt someone else might see it and steal his idea i told him it was safe with me i knew nothing about science and it was difficult enough making certain i was exact word for word hamish noted that as she traveled back into the past the strength of her memory grew but could it be totally trusted rutledge ignored him miss chandler leaned back in her chair i thought he might find me and ask me to do other typing for him ive missed it and it kept my fingers nimble he had a very nice machine but it was borrowed he said and must be returned on time from the laboratory very likely but what had become of the paper knowing that brady was watching himand might even from time to time search the cottageit would have been foolish for parkinson to keep anything valuable there and not at the house where his daughters came and went what would have felt like a safe place to him where his work wouldnt be found it was possible that hed long since taken the paper with him on one of his forays and put it in a bank vault or left it with someone hed trusted he hadnt had it with him in yorkshire and rutledge hadnt found it in the cottage hamish said why did he write whatever it is doon much less gie it to someone to type a good question a red herring or something parkinson had been working on and hadnt quite finished but knew that in time his earlier research might hold the key a better way of killing armies was always a marketable commodity miss chandler was tiring she made a little gesture with her hand as if to apologize for failing him thats all really i wish i could do something to help mr partridge must be beside himself it has been worrisome rutledge answered sidestepping the issue of partridge thank you for seeing me miss chandler i wish you a pleasant evening you wont stay and have tea with us she looked around the sun room at the other women seated there avidly listening we seldom have the pleasure of a young mans company im afraid ive a long drive ahead of me i have hoped against hope that someone from my cousins family might come to england so that i can tell them how grateful i am to their father but they havent i expect its a long journey to make just for an hour or so with an old woman he damned deloran in his mind yet could see that this woman was pleased with her good fortune and would be bereft if told the truth that it was the need for her cottage and not an interest in her wellbeing that lay behind the sums shed been given he wouldnt put it past her to refuse the money im sure they wish you well even if they cant visit how are my former neighbors she asked him then searching for a reason to hold him there a little longer will you give my regards to mr allen and mrs cathcart in particular ive missed them please tell them that mr miller was always kind to me as well yes most certainly he had reached the door when he turned and asked a last question has anyone else come to ask you about the work you did for mr partridge no one she answered him knew about it ive told you he feared someone might steal his discovery he thanked her again and mrs deacon followed him to the foyer you can see that my guests havent been cheated nor have i i have my house still and i would do it again if i had to she looked around her at the high coffered ceiling of the foyer the pineapples in each square flecked with gold at the paneling on the walls and the parquet flooring this is where i lived as a child my brother inherited the house you know but hes dead in the first fighting at mons ive been a widow for many years and i longed to come back here but his wife and i didnt see eye to eye a brief triumphant smile touched her face it took every penny i possessed to buy her out but i managed it i dont know why i should feel required to defend myself to you i expect its because you doubted my motives that was unkind of you he was reminded of the sunroom a comfortable place for old bones on an april day when the rain had brought damp with it he smiled in return i misjudged the circumstances i had reason to believe that perhaps miss chandlers good fortune was suspect but i see it isnt do you remember the name of the solicitor who handled the inheritance for her i should have asked there was no solicitor i was told she received the money directly from the solicitors in australia and put it in her account in the bank she held out her hand good day mr rutledge you would have made a good policeman if you arent one already he went through the door and she shut it behind him with a firm click rutledge stood there for a moment his work at the yard he thought had made him overly suspicious of goodness he had seen so much that was evil hamish said as he walked back to the motorcar yon mrs deacon is no afraid of anyone its her strength rutledge was late arriving at the smiths arms mrs smith had set his dinner on the back of the stove to keep warm he hung his wet coat over the other chair to dry and sat by the fire in the bar only half listening to the gossip of the lorry drivers and the locals who came regularly to sit and drink most of it was of no importance then hamish said hark and rutledge brought his attention back to the room in time to hear a farmer comment they took the smith to the police station today i always said he was a danger i wouldnt let him play with my son would i when they were in school together too big by half and didnt know his own strength it was a knife he used not his hands his companion reminded him yes well he killed them didnt he what had happened to bradys confession had hill already discounted it rutledge finished his meal and went out into the night directly back to the cottages there was still a light in quincys cottage and rutledge knocked at the door whos there there was an undercurrent of alarm in the query rutledge i need to talk to you its late but there was the sound of the latch being lifted and quincy stood in the opening the light behind him struck him from the left throwing that side of his face in stark relief while the other half was deeply shadowed it gave him an oddly malevolent look whats brought you here not another killing its slater i heard at the inn that hed been taken into uffington by inspector hill shows how wrong gossip can be no hill took him there to the doctor he was using a hammer while they talked working on one of those kettles he makes sometimes they sell well at the summer fair and he smashed his knuckles slater nearly passed out from the pain and hill called one of his men to get slater into a car then alls well why do you think hes not guilty quincy asked with some curiosity people like that often have a bad temper he turned his head to look at the cat asleep on her favorite chair shes mine now i expect she didnt mourn long for partridge if i thought it would work id make a gift of her to mrs cathcart god knows she needs something to calm her nerves shes afraid arent we all but youre right mrs cathcarts fear is exacerbated by what happened in her life before she came here she peers out the window at every newcomer ive seen the curtains twitch a pity really shell die a tormented soul which is probably what her husband had in mind rutledge thought did you ever see brady go in or come out of partridges cottage no he stayed away from partridge as far as possible considering he lived here as well look do you want some coffee i developed a taste for it in guatemala if you arent going away then you might as well come in ill take you up on the offer rutledge stepped inside and shut the door behind him the room where the birds were kept was in darkness but the flickering light of the fire on the hearth glanced off iridescent feathers and glass eyes he took the chair next to dublins and sat down the night was just chilly enough to make the fire comforting and he felt a drowsiness steal over him quincy was busy in the kitchen and the cat had begun to purr hamish urged him to keep awake prodding at him with words reminding him that the night watches in the trenches had meant life or death rutledge asked him silently if he thought quincy would poison the coffee and hamish gave him no answer id give much to know whats going on here quincy was saying as he worked the rich scent of coffee beans in a grinder filled the room so would inspector hill brady wrote a note before he died at least it would appear he had in it he claimed hed killed both willing ham and partridge willingham i can understand there was no loss of love there but partridge was if you forgive me the goose with the golden egg brady was out of a job if he harmed the man quite rutledge reached out a hand to smooth the head of the cat as she stretched her purr loud in the room youll have to give hill your full name on any statement you know its a matter of form im damned if i will as long as im not a suspect im giving him nothing after so many years do you really think your family cares where youre living its more to the point that you stay away from them i signed an agreement in front of witnesses my brother might take it into his head to see that the letter and not the spirit of the law is carried out and your parents dead for all i know it hasnt seemed worth my while to find out the coffeepot was on the stove and the aroma was building what did you do that was so unforgivable i was born do you have any sisters or brothers rutledge a sister close are you very well it wasnt that way in my family my brother hated me from the start no i swear it he was a nasty piece of work in my eyes as well we never got along and just when he was rising in his firm i was being sent down from cambridge in disgrace too much drinking too many women my schoolwork suffering into the bargain there was talk that i was the black sheep of a fine old name and i wouldnt amount to much and then i did the unspeakablei met the woman my brother was planning to marry and she liked me well enough perhaps a little too well for she broke off their engagement i like to think the contrast with him pointed up just how great a bastard he was my father offered me a sizable sum paid to my account anywhere in the world except england and i was young enough not to fancy taking a position in my fathers firm going off to build the panama canal for the french seemed to be a fitting revenge and off i went only the french died like flies and the engineers died with them so much for that he went for the coffee and brought a cup of it back with him handing it to rutledge i take mine black theres not much choice actually i dont have sugar or milk he fetched his own cup and sat down i dont know why i talk to you i dont care for people as a rule but before i know it im telling my life story and thinking nothing of it youre a bad influence rutledge laughed so ive been told did brady kill willingham do you think quincy asked abruptly changing the subject he confessed to it all right for the sake of argument what about partridge im not as sure of that nor am i which makes me wonder if brady isnt a scapegoat and accordingly i keep my door bolted at night now i can protect myself whats loose amongst us here it was an echo of the question slater had asked theres no way of knowing well if its slater he wont be using that hand to kill anybody for a while then we have allen who doesnt have the strength left to overpower anyone and mrs cathcart who is afraid of her own shadow which leaves in the suspect category miller singleton and me unless its partridge coming back from the grave we havent been shown his body and thats something to be taken into account rutledge couldnt tell if this was a fishing expedition or not but hamish was warning him to take care i think hill is planning to dig up the floor of partridges cottage tomorrow to be certain hes not under it it was a light answer to avoid the truth it was quincys turn to laugh but it rang hollowly yes well i wish him luck he drained his cup and held out his hand for rut ledges ill say good night thanks for coming by i was in the mood for company it was said with an edge to it as if he werent particularly pleased to have been disturbed he let rutledge out the door and bolted it behind him rutledge went back to the inn and to bed it was too late to see what inspector hill had to say about the murders in the night someone tried to burn quincy alive in his cottage but hed been telling the truth when he said he was armed the shotgun blasted a hole through the door and peppered the front garden then he was outside taking a broom to the rags someone had jammed under his door pulling them apart in smoky masses those shoved through the broken windowpane in the bird room took longer to extinguish damage was not as extensive as it might have been someone had counted on the door being unlocked to make firestarting easier and when he found it wasnt he had tried to improvise determined to set the house ablaze for the rest of the night quincy sat in his dark sitting room the shotgun across his knees and the coffeepot at his elbow when rutledge came back the next morning quincy said with an edge to his voice i want to make a statement as soon as it was first light quincy had been busy as he told rutledge with grim satisfaction he had gone to mrs cathcarts cottage and called through the door theres no harm done no one killed youre safe for whats left of the night inside he had heard her crying but he said bracingly youll make yourself ill in there go to bed sleep while you can theres nothing to worry about in the light of day it was two hours later that hed sent slater for hill and rutledge id be dead if it werent for the cat she smelled the smoke and was howling frantically to get out and when i came down i could hear whoever it was trying to stuff more rags against the door do you think you hit him i dont know and could care even less but i want to go on record that out the back window i saw a shape running toward the shadows of singletons cottage he may be dead as well or he may have tried to kill me and ill swear to that in any fashion you like i had a good look it wasnt my eyes playing tricks no feeling for size shape none but if brady killed willingham and then himself who tried to burn me out i ask you he was incensed about his door and demanded that a constable take him directly into uffington to find lumber that would cover the damage that door is going to be bolted again by nightfall or youll be assigning a constable to sit on my threshold all night hill said to rutledge as quincy and the constable left what do you think it could well be true but then quincy could have set the fire himself and then fired his shotgun through the panels of the door and both policemen knew it another constable came to report that singleton was in his cottage and safe i had to knock three or four times he added he was asleep well attend to him later see if he heard anything but for now rutledge ive cleared paperwork for the search of partridges cottage if youre ready we might as well get on with it they crossed the lane to the cottage and went in nothing had changed since rutledge had been there alone but this time he kept an eye open for the papers that miss chandler had typed while hill was poking about looking for a body neither of them had any success yeve been here before hamish reminded rutledge and you found nothing then i didnt know about the papers aye thats true but if yed seen them yed ha taken note they werena here hill sat down by the desk and said with some heat id have felt better if hed been here dead nothing against mr partridge but it would have solved my problem for me now that note of bradys looks damned suspicious rutledge debated telling him about the body in yorkshire but held off hamish looking ahead told him in no uncertain terms that it was unwise all the same he decided to wait until he was sure how the crimes were related i dont know that partridge is connected to this business on the other hand my presence here might have set off something we havent got to the bottom of yet the killings began after i identified myself as a policeman not before nonsense a scotland yard inspector doesnt go about triggering murders i havent time for foolishness he paused the doctor tells me that brady could have killed himself right enough the way the old romans used to fall on their swords the chair was directly behind him and the force of the blow drove him into it why would quincy want to put that in doubt hill got up from the desk and moved restlessly about the sitting room rutledge remembered the crumpled beginning of a letter in the basket by the desk and went to look at it again but it wasnt there now of small importanceyet it told him that someone else had been through the house since he had been here rutledge said i spoke to quincy for an hour more or less last night coincidence or fear they moved on to the shed where the motorcar was kept and hill did a cursory search of the vehicle but rutledge with a little better light now looked at the tires and the boot then thoroughly inspected the interior it gave up no more secrets to him than it had to inspector hill but as he ran his hand over the rear seat something was brushed to the floor of the motorcar it was so small he had trouble finding where it had got to but after a moment his fingers finally retrieved it the tab from a small box respirator he could see vividly the slit in the mask that parkinson had been wearing when he was found in the cloisters of fountains abbey just where this tab should have been it had caught on something and torn off rutledge straightened up parkinson had been in this motorcar along with the mask and no one noticed the tab was missing as it was slipped over a dead mans face he would have given any odds that parkinson had traveled to his death in this motorcar and someone had seen to it that it was quietly returned to the shed where it belonged when the journey was finished in some ways a motorcar was harder to hide than a body it could be traced better to leave the impression that parkinson had set out without it and that confirmed that parkinsons death was deliberate carefully planned and executed leaving hill to cope with his own case rutledge drove to wiltshire to the house called pockets where rebecca parkinson lived she was there and he had to bang on the door for nearly ten minutes before she finally opened it to him something in his face must have alerted her for the first words out of her mouth were ive told you ive had nothing to do with my father for the past two years or more its useless coming here he put his work before his family and now his family no longer cares his sacrifice was in vain the army didnt want him either how do you know that for weeks before my mother died he was obsessed secretive doing much of his work at night making endless calculations he hardly ate or slept it was as if he were trying to convince himself of somethingas if hed lost his way but couldnt bring himself to admit it in any other man id have said he was on the verge of a breakdown in his case i think it was pride crashing he wasnt as clever as he thought he was and he was about to be found out thats a rather harsh judgment is it he resigned didnt he if hed made a brilliant success of his work do you think hed have done that even in contrition over my mothers death and the man in charge of the laboratory let him go theyd have offered him a leave of absence if he was so indispensable to them the war wasnt over in the spring of and we werent certain of winning you dont know what it was he was working on i wasnt interested in his work it had brought nothing but grief to us and i hated it as much as i came to hate him it took me a long time to reach indifference but i have now he thought she hadnt she was still passionate about her father and anything to do with him the hate showed in her anger at the man rutledge stood there letting her feel the silence willing her to betray herself as if to fill it before she couldnt stand it any longer she said when my mother died i hated him so much all i could think of was making him feel pain in a way he couldnt ignore if hed still been using his laboratory id have burned it to the ground and wouldnt have cared if he was there inside when she asked that her ashes be scattered in the gardens she loved so much i strewed them myself i was half mad too i think i wanted to hurt him and i wound up hurting myself do you know what someones ashes feel like do you know how they blow on the wind and sometimes into your face or cling to your fingers in spite of everything a gray powder that was all that was left of my mother and i diminished it by letting it soak into the damp ground so that the house was uninhabitable and now im afraid to go there because im afraid ill see her ghost i think at the end he did see her thats why he couldnt stay there what will happen to the house i dont know i cant sell itnot after what i did i cant live there i cant let it go to wrack and ruin i cant have brambles and weeds on my mothers grave he ruined all our lives and i dont really care whats become of him she turned her back to him and he heard the catch in her voice when she added theres nothing i want in that wretched cottage where he went to live as far as im concerned you can burn it to the ground and then she was inside on the point of shutting her door he said the motorcar as well her voice was weary when she finally answered let them sell it i have no need for it miss parkinson i shall have to speak to your sister theres no way around it did she tell you where she lived at roads end a house not very different from mine its not far from porton down ironic isnt it a friend offered it to her for a small rent and she was upset with me about the ashes i cant blame her for not wanting to live with me rebecca parkinson laughed harshly that house at partridge fields is worth a great deal of money but the two of us have almost nothing to our names a small inheritance from mother thats it and i wouldnt touch my fathers money if he offered it if i thought it would solve anything id shoot myself but it wont dont come back here again and she was gone he stood there for a moment longer staring at the closed door if one of the sisters killed gerald parkinson which was it he thought that rebecca had the stronger sense of abandonment and might in a fit of anger try to assuage it by killing her father but surely in the heat of the moment not two years later unless there was something he didnt know some factor in their relationship that went so deep it had taken time to face when she had the only solution might have been murder and yet sarah the weaker of the two might have found she couldnt live with her own pain and grief any longer and made the choice between killing herself as her mother had done or killing her father rutledge turned and went back to the motorcar driving on to the house at partridge fields he walked through the grounds to the small garden with the horse fountain it was dappled in shade this early a mysterious and inviting place to sit but hed come not to sit but to look at the grass that surrounded the fountain squatting to see if there was any sign that someone had stood here two nights ago the grass was still dewwet and it was difficult to judge no one had trampled the green blades no one had left a tidy footprint in the moist soil of the shrubbery beds still hed have given odds that walking here in the dark would lead to a misstep at some point it took patience and careful almost inchbyinch inspection but he found something that might have been the half print of a heel just where an edge of the grass walk met the soil hamish said disparagingly a bird scratching a beetle trying to right itself an owl after a mouse rutledge got to his feet possibly but why havent they scratched over hereor there its no solid proof no he left the shrubbery and stood where he could see the windows of the master bedroom above the garden here at this housein that room for all he knewlay the heart of a familys collapse it was as if each of the parkinsons gave more energy to hurting than to healing for one thing why had mrs parkinson wanted her ashes buried here if shed been wretched at partridge fields the answer to that was she intended them to be a constant reminder to her husband of everything shed suffered he had no idea what shed had in mindan urn set on a marble square by the horse fountain or ashes scattered in the central circle of the frenchstyle beds where the roses grew it had been rebeccas decision in the first anguished days after finding her mother dead to spread them throughout the gardens neither mother nor daughter set on their acts of revenge had considered how difficult it might ultimately be for sarah or rebecca to live here punishing gerald parkinson was paramount shutting out every other consideration and rebecca was left to reap the whirlwind she had sown where had all this passionate need to hurt started there was parkinsons obsession with his work putting it before his family and his wifes morbid fascination with the destructive nature of what he did these must have led to violent arguments to turn her thoughts to suicide or had she been unstable most of her married life in that case why hadnt her daughters spared a moments sympathy for what their father must have had to endure there must have been something else to send a sensitive mind into a downward spiral of depression and finally despair had parkinson lashed out physically when hed felt his back was to the wall striking his wife would have erased any sympathy rebecca and her sister might have felt then why hadnt rebecca mentioned it in defense of her anger or sarah dwell on that as she remembered a kinder father rutledge thought its time to ask sarah what she remembers about her parents relationship not just her own with her father but he spared five minutes to walk to the kitchen garden and knock at the door no one came to open it and he finally gave it up and went back to his motorcar he had some difficulty finding the small house where sarah parkinson lived it stood at the end of a country lane and was no larger than pockets and far more isolated over a slight rise he could just see the roof of a barn and tall chimneys why couldnt the sisters live together it would have made sense especially if money was a problem rebecca was protective of sarah but there wasnt the closeness one might expect under the circumstances of their mothers death and their fathers desertion had the ashes been the only problem sarah parkinson was surprised to see him she had come to the door at the sound of the motorcar and now stood on the threshold trying to decide whether to tell him to go away or invite him in good morning rutledge began ive come to see if youre all right dont worry crying over the past wont lead me to do anything rash i expect not still may i come in id like to talk to you he could watch the internal debate as she frowned then said i dont expect i have much choice about it we can stand here if youd rather no come in but i wont take your hat you wont be staying long rutledge smiled i want to ask you about your parents if i come in are you prepared to answer my questions otherwise this will be a waste of time for both of us she was disconcerted by his bluntness if i dont like the questions ill tell you fair enough the house was old and had seen hard use but sarah parkinson had tried to make it comfortable and pretty adding paint to the walls and curtains to the bare windows a fine french carpet lay on the floor and some furnishings were a little out of date as if shed scavenged them from her parents attics they were far better quality than the walls that enclosed them yes ive come down in the world she said following his gaze i only have this house through the courtesy of a friend it was the best she or i could do i can understand that you dont want to live at partridge fields again but what will you do with it its the tomb of my mother when becky and i are gone it can be torn down by people who dont know why we deserted it better that way the housekeeper still comes to see to it who pays her to clean and sweep my father i expect i cant afford to keep her there may i ask why you and your sister dont choose to live together it would make sense i think we both prefer the silence if we were together wed talk too much about the past we wouldnt be able to help it whose motorcar do you drive your own or rebeccas it belongs to a friend of hers who went to france and came back without his legs he didnt want to look at it any more and told her she could drive it but you borrow it from time to time when i can she looked away from him her gaze following a bee at the window its a long walk for both of us to go anywhere we trade days its not the life id have chosen youre young youll marry in time and the past will seem less vivid after what ive seen of marriage she retorted i want no part of it it leaves you terribly vulnerable and in the end you hate each other my father killed my mother as surely as if hed held her head under the gas and made her breathe it in ive never understood why he couldnt love her enough to stop what he was doing she was so softhearted she couldnt bear to see a bird suffer he knew that but it didnt matter he turned his back on her feelings and did what he wanted to do anyway and in the end she died when he saw what he had done it was too late was it always that way you remember your father being kind to you but was he kind to your mother as well when you were five for instance did you think they were happy i thought they were more fool i it must have been a pretense for our sakes i realize that now they couldnt have pretended so perfectly that you didnt see the strain of their trying children are very perceptive think about when you were sixtwelve think about birthday parties and holidays and long winter evenings together he tried to suggest images that she could explore and watched her face closely as she frowned sorting through her memories when i was four we went to cornwall for our holiday i remember it well it was the first time id seen the sea and we watched moor ponies one afternoon and in one of the harbors there was a fishmonger with a tray of fish silvery in the sun we took our breakfast out to the rocks and watched the fishing boats coming in did your parents laugh hold hands with each other seem comfortable with each other or was there tension sometimes raised voices iyes i think everything was all right i rode on my fathers shoulders when my legs were tired and becky held on to his coat tails mama laughed calling us a dragon three heads six arms six legs and we made up stories about the dragon how he could run faster than anyone else and lift twice as much and see before him and behind him at the same time and my father made silly noises while becky laughed so hard she fell down and the dragon came apart she looked away seeing a day she had buried in the past i loved my father more than anything then i had forgotten and later we went to kent when i was six to visit an aunt she told us there was a ghost in her house but it was only mice behind the walls the next summer mama was very ill and kept to her bed i remember we had to be quiet and there were nurses coming in to look after her my father was worried he sat in his study and i think he cried his face was wet when i came in to kiss him good night her gaze came back to rutledge startled and confused i had forgotten it frightened me to see mama like that pale and helpless and i didnt want to think about it i dont remember her laughing for a long time even after the nurses had left and she was well again that was after my father had begun to use the laboratory in the garden he said he had more freedom there than at cambridge she railed at him once calling him a murderer she was so distressed and she threatened to burn down the laboratory and he told her that if she did he would leave her sarah parkinson put her hands to her face reliving that scene it was never the same after that never there were no more holidays mama told me that it was because my father refused to leave his precious laboratory long enough to take us anywhere that it meant more to him than we did and because he spent so much of his time there i knew it to be true sometimes he had his meals brought to him there and id hear him come up the stairs at night long after we were in bed i always waited for him to come in and say good night but he didnt i thought perhaps hed stopped loving becky and me why was your mother ill do you know i was never told i have no idea but it changed herand her feelings toward your father sarah parkinson bit her lip i cant answer that although she must have been happy when we were in kent she and my father took long walks together and i watched them from the windows i was a little jealous i expect i know i felt left out why are you asking me these things ive worked hard to forget most of it rutledge didnt want to tell her that hed come to find out if her father had struck her mother in arguments over the laboratory sarah at least had no memory of that or had suppressed any she did have i never had the opportunity to meet your father the man who died in yorkshire is a mystery to all of us why do you keep telling me that my father died in yorkshire there was an element of defensiveness in her question how do you know where he died all right the man who was found dead in yorkshire hes your father whether you wish to acknowledge him or not he rose to leave no one wants to claim his body hell be buried in a paupers grave without a marker you can put the name he used in those cottages on his stone it was the one he chose and it shut us out completely why should i care about him now you came back to the cottages rutledge said as he walked to the door why her eyes were bright with tears im looking for something i lost but i can live without it i learned the hard way to do that she didnt see him out he closed the door as he went hamish said as the motorcar turned toward the cottages at uffington she willna change her mind but when shes old shell have regrets to overcome unlike her sister aye the elder she learned to hate at her mothers knee her mothers child as sarah might well have been her fathers favorite looking into the past hasna given you a solution not yet rutledge arrived at the cottages and walked down the lane separating them turning in at mrs cathcarts door she was reluctant to open to him but in the end her innate politeness won she said that other policeman has been here asking me what ive seen what i know how mr brady struck me i dont spy on my neighbors and i didnt know mr brady well enough to answer him do you think mr brady spied on his neighbors im told he spent most of his time sitting at his windows looking out i expect he was lonely most of us are you know he did seem more interested in mr partridge than he was in the rest of us but then it was mr partridges cottage he could see best of course mr willingham was always accusing mr brady of staring at him i cant believe either of them is dead do you think mr partridge is as well if i had anywhere else to go id leave this place i dont feel safe here im terrified of being murdered in my bed he wished he could tell her that she had little chance of that keep your door locked dont open it at night to anyone no matter what he may say to you id ask mr slater to be sure my locks couldnt be tampered with but hes hurt his hand and it must be very painful will you look at my door and windows he agreed and followed her through the rooms of her cottage testing the latches on windows and the main door if youre afraid keep a light on it will be a comfort do you think inspector hill is capable of doing anything about these frightening events ive not been impressed by him hes a local man after all and he doesnt know anything about us hes making every effort im not sure thats good enough she tugged at her earlobe clearly upset for a very long time now ive been afraid of dying she confessed i always believed my husband would see to it that i was quietly disposed of now it may be a complete stranger who makes him the happiest man in england rutledge said would you prefer to stay at the smiths arms for several nights until this business is finished youre the only woman here you might be more comfortable she said the strain apparent in her voice ive considered that id do it if i could afford it let me have a word with mrs smith i think it might be possible to arrange mrs cathcart said please let me go with you ive only to put a few things into my overnight case when the sun begins to set i can hardly breathe for fear rutledge took pity on her and said yes of course ill wait it took her less time than hed expected she came out of her bedroom with a worn leather valise and handed it to him im so grateful you cant imagine theres no one i can turn to i could smell the smoke at mr quincys cottage in the night and at first i thought it was mine even so i sat here wondering what would be worse burning to death or walking outside into the arms of someone with a knife they say he prefers a knife i thought mr brady confessed she paused on the threshold stricken by a thought it isnt mr partridge is it coming back here and attacking us ive heard people can be struck down by a brainstorm and not know what theyre doing you dont have to fear mr partridge i dont think hell be coming back to the cottages she locked her door behind her but didnt look back as he helped her into the motorcar he could feel her worry drain away until she was lightheaded from relief it took him five minutes to convince mrs smith that he had no ulterior motive in paying for mrs cathcarts room he also made her promise to say nothing about who was taking care of the account then as mrs cathcart stepped into the inn mrs smith smiled at her and welcomed her saying ill bring up a cup of tea after ive shown you your room mrs cathcart cast a grateful glance at rutledge and followed mrs smith up the stairs answering questions about the two deaths as they climbed he went into the pub sat down in the window seat and tried to shut out hamishs voice the large room was empty of custom and in the quietness rutledge considered a possibility that had nagged at the edges of his consciousness for several hours which of his daughters had parkinson started a letter to only to crumple it up and toss it aside as if the words he wanted wouldnt come my dear if it was sarah then he must have held out hope of some sort of reconciliation if it was rebecca he might well be trying to make amends for what she felt hed done to her mother hamish said but he didna send it which brings up the question of whether hed ha gone with ither one o them if theyd come to his door late at night and it must ha been lateno one saw what happened interesting about the cars rutledge said the body was transported in partridges which suggests that the daughter without the car that night was the one who killed him its a long way on foot for ither o them a friend could have driven them to uffington its an easy walk from there but what if the unfinished letter was simply a first draft and parkinson had after all sent what hed written what if he had intended to sell partridge fields would that threat be the last straw for rebecca my dear rebecca i am writing to tell you that ive decided that the time has come to sell the house and grounds if theres anything in the house that you wish to have please make arrangements to remove the item before i put the property on the market and that would have brought rebecca storming to his door in the middle of the night after struggling for hours to find a way to stop him or look at it another way round the letter might have been very different my dear rebecca im writing to tell you that ive decided to move back to partridge fields now ive made arrangements for the house to be refurbished and the gardens cleared and replanted all that was necessary was to persuade their father to spend one night in the house while they argued over his plan the rest would have been simple drug him turn on the gas and let him die while he slept but why then remove parkinson from the house and carry his body to yorkshire why not leave him there for the housekeeper to find and let him be buried in the churchyard with his ancestors perhaps they had left parkinson where he diedand it was deloran who had ordered the body moved so that both parkinson and partridge were disposed of in one neat solution it was late but rutledge went back to rebecca parkinsons house and even though she refused to answer the door he stood outside and called her name miss parkinson i know you can hear me if you wont come out then we can conduct our business this way i want you to give some thought to what is happening in uffington inspector hill has a confession that was found next to the body of a man dreadnought set to watch your father for two years in that confession theres an admission by the dead man that he killed your father and then murdered another resident who might have seen this man going into your fathers cottage the night he disappeared he waited but rebecca parkinson neither came to the door nor answered him from inside hamish said yere wasting your breath if she didna kill her father shes verra glad someone did rutledge answered him in the silence of his mind we must have a family member make a positive identification of that body even if we must exhume it its the only way i can think of to persuade either sister to take that step well worry about murder after that its what every case is built on the identity of a body aloud he said im bound to tell you miss parkinson that inspector hill isnt completely satisfied that the confession is in the dead mans handwriting that must be verified but if it is and the confession is allowed to stand there will be matters you and your sister must deal with weve already found evidence that your fathers motorcar was used to transport his body north before being returned to the cottage well need to prove once and for all that the man in yorkshire is one gerald parkinson not gaylord partridge still there was no answer rutledge began to doubt that rebecca parkinson was in the house after all she could easily have gone out through the kitchen yard and walked away whether you like it or not you will be faced with other issues who will pay the housekeepers wages if your father is dead and his estate is left unsettled who will pay for repairing the drains and rooting out worm in the wood and seeing to the roof are you prepared to stand and watch the house fall down for lack of money whether you want to touch your inheritance or not you will find it will make a difference in what becomes of you and your sister and the house at partridge fields he had hoped that that would be a telling argument in persuading her to identify the body but the silence lengthened at least give me the name of your fathers solicitor miss parkinson i shall have to contact him meanwhile youre letting your anger blind you i think your mother would want to know that you and your sister were provided for but the bait was ignored no response no angry outburst no confrontation in the failing light where he could try to read rebecca parkinsons face and define her reactions hed learned long ago that when people could be persuaded to talk even about something as simple as the weather he had a better chance of building a bridge to the truth silence worked in favor of the sus pectif there was no conversation there would be nothing to stumble over later hamish said ye ken ye said fra the start this sister couldna be persuaded to work wi the police please god sarah would be a different sort certainly she was the more emotional of the two women and probably the less stubborn in the end he left driving back to berkshire in the waning light of a spring evening it was just dark when he reached the smiths arms tired and dispirited he had listened to hamish for miles and he wished only for peace as he walked into the inn he stopped short sitting quietly in the chair by the window where sometimes he had eaten his breakfast was meredith channing the surprise was so complete that he simply stood there unable to imagine what had brought her here how she had found him even hamish hadnt warned him and then he remembered that she was a friend of francess and he asked quickly is anything wrong she rose to greet him something in her face that frightened him but then she said i thought it best to come and tell you about simon barrington for your sisters sake how did you find me i asked a friend to call the yard sergeant gibson was kind enough to give me your direction she looked around listening to the sounds of laughter and someones harmonica making rowdy music in the bar is there anywhere that we can be private the night is mild enough we can walk if youd like she preceded him through the doorway and said i passed the white horse as i was coming in its amazing one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen theres something about it that isi dont knowrather fearsome and yet not at all frightening ive always admired it they turned in the direction of waylands smithy he said i saw simon when i was in lincoln with another woman i didnt know who she was yes well shes his sister and shes been having an appalling time he goes north every weekend even midweek if its necessary he hasnt told anyone but his closest friends people who know her too her husbands dead you see and shes ill rather a dreadful illness im afraid and he takes her to the doctor in lincoln for treatments i expect he doesnt know how long she may have to live and if she does how long she will need to convalesce why tell me this why not speak to frances directly if i tell her im betraying a confidence from a friend but frances came to me for answers and i know how wretched she is im hoping youll find a way to assure her that it isnt personal ill do my best he hesitated is she in love with simon do you think or is this a passing fancy ive been busy and there hasnt been time to find out i think shes lonely and sometimes that palls simon is single attractive and of her own social set if she isnt in love with him she may believe she ought to be and that could go a long way toward explaining her unhappiness he hadnt considered that possibility it put matters in a different light they had reached the smithy and stood beside it gazing at it but not really seeing it he thought that frances was not the only problem that mrs channing had brought with her after a moment she said i shouldnt have come this could have waited im glad you did in the darkness her face was a pale blur framed by her hair ian i only just heard about jean montroys death he took a deep breath it was a surprise inadequate but that was all he could manage yes it must have been im sorry rutledge turned away listening to the roar of hamishs voice in his ears and not understanding any of what he was saying what did the poet say that the saddest words of tongue or pen were what might have been its true if wed been married in the summer of last year the child might have been mine but it wasnt and if she was happy im glad her happiness was brief enough he walked a short distance then came back who told you it was in the canadian newspapers of course and a friend sent me the cutting i wondered if you would like to have it he considered that and in the end said thank you no at least not at present of course she put her hand on one of the stones that formed the smithy and said apropos of nothing whoever was buried here must have been famous in his day i wonder what his life was like and his death i dont suppose theres any way to know although the local smith will tell you that theres still treasure to be found inside perhaps hes right well its late and i must be on my way im staying with friends a few miles from here and theyll be wondering whats become of me they walked back to the inn in a comfortable silence and he found it soothing where is your motorcar i didnt see it when i came in i left it in the kitchen yard mrs smith thought it best he could hear the amusement in her voice i dont think she quite agrees with women driving he turned the crank for her and said as she pulled on her driving gloves thank you for coming i wasnt sure it was the right thing to do good night ian and with that she drove out of the inn yard and went on her way he watched the rear light disappearing down the road before turning back to the main door and going inside rutledge didnt sleep well he was awakened by the sound of guns firing in the distanceartillery german he could telland realized after the first startled instant that they were in his head hed been dreaming about the front and it had stayed with him even though he had awakened from it the inn was quiet around him and he lay there listening to the night in the darkness he heard hamish saying why did a friend send yon widow a cutting aboot your jean it hadnt occurred to him to question that at the time but it struck him as odd now why had she really come to see how he was mourning jean or to be certain that the news hadnt eroded his narrow margin of safety his tenuous grip on sanity he wasnt sure how much meredith channing knew about his war sometimes it seemed that she guessed more than he was prepared for anyone to know but then shed been at the front a nurse in the forward aid station closest to his section she had seen men in every state between living and dying and somehow managed to keep her own sanity intact there was a well of something there understanding perhaps or sympathy even knowledge but no pity he couldnt have borne that from anyone a rooster crowed in the distance and rutledge reached for his watch lighting his lamp long enough to glance at it dawn would be breaking soon and with it what another murder another day of chasing a truth that didnt want to be discovered sometimes he thought that gerald parkinson would be happier in an anonymous grave rather than one where he wasnt wanted after a time he drifted again into sleep his last thought one that had grown out of his conversation with meredith channing a murderer would have put parkinsons body in waylands smithy and called his death a suicide when he came down the next morning mrs cathcart was eating her breakfast at the table that was usually his but he made no move to join her she seemed to be in better spirits and mrs smith had been carrying on a running conversation with her as each dish was brought in the subject under discussion was affairs at the cottages and they had reached the point of debating whether partridge was one of the victims or not hes not been seen for some time but the police were there in his cottage and nothing was said about finding him mrs cathcart was saying he would come here sometimes to talk with the lorry drivers the distance to this place or that what accommodations might be had what kind of weather he might expect i didnt know for the longest time that he was from the cottagesi thought hed come in from uffington horrible to imagine him murdered are they quite sure of that mrs smith asked over a rack of toast rutledge asked did he ever talk about his visit to liverpool it was deloran and his men who had tracked parkinson there and rutledge had never been satisfied that parkinson hadnt lured them there to keep his watchers from guessing what hed really done during his brief absences but neither mrs cathcart nor mrs smith could answer that question mrs smith was called away by two drivers just in and mrs cathcart was still sitting over the last of her tea when he left the inn hamish said she believes her husband willna think to look for her here it was truethe smiths arms was hardly a place where the mrs cathcarts of this world spent their days but she seemed less anxious this morning as if she had slept well enough rutledge drove as far as the foot of the lane and pulled the motorcar to the verge the sun was watery as he walked up to the cottage occupied by mr allen the smith had fashioned a wroughtiron six in a gothic script for allens door giving it a distinction the other cottages lacked the curtains twitched in the front window before the door was opened to rutledges knock taking precautions allen said in explanation as he moved aside to let rutledge inside the small entry im dying but have no interest in hurrying the process miss chandler who once lived in bradys cottage sends you her regards she was pleased to hear that youre still alive he smiled she didnt belong here but beggars cant be choosers id wondered if her good fortune was truly that it appears to have been i wish i were well out of here myself this business of murder practically on ones doorstep is not good for any of us i expect ive found it hard to sleep i spoke to miller this morning and he agrees if we had anywhere else to go wed be off im not up to travel sadly ill have to take my chances what does miller think about events hes a rather timid man and he overcomes it with bluster once you get past that hes all right though i dont count him a friend you understand hes not convinced that brady is our man he favors poor slater telling me that hed not be predictable in taxing situations miller says he grew up with one such and there was murder done because of a misunderstanding that got out of hand i cant say that i agree ive never seen slater violent that leaves you singleton and quincy to be cast as murderers allen smiled i daresay im not in inspector hills sights given my health the smile faded whats become of mrs cathcart i havent seen her today has someone looked in on her yes shes fine she was enjoying breakfast earlier is partridge dead as brady claimed yes im afraid he is but under rather different circumstances than willinghams murder it will take some time to learn what bradys role was in his death if any i must say id have not thought it of brady he was a weak man in my view troubled by his drinking and whatever it was that brought him here to live rutledge prepared to take his leave watching allens face sag with fatigue one hand clutching the arm of a chair with whiteknuckled fingers allen was saying ill tell you something about partridge for what its worth i wouldnt have if there was a chance he was still alive rutledge waited i dont think that was his real name id seen him at a party in winchester several years ago and although we werent introduced he was pointed out to me as one of the people doing some sort of hush hush work for the government there were a number of important guests at the dinner and he seemed to know most of them i never asked him about this partly respecting his privacy and partly because i heard later that hed fallen from grace and was in bad odor with the government you can imagine my surprise when i looked out my door one morning and saw him walking down the lane he was calling himself partridge then but for the life of me i cant remember how he was called at the party something similar but id have remembered partridge if it had been that its not a common name and you said nothing about this to anyone else allen responded with irritation i told you i respected his privacy later on did you tell the friend whod first pointed this man out to you that youd seen him here in berkshire allens face flushed only because i thought it might reassure him that all was well i was in winchester to see my doctor when i ran into him how long after that did mr brady come here to live a month possibly less there cant be a connection id have sworn they didnt know each other but allen was no fool you arent trying to say theres a connection are you that word spread and thats why brady came here i refuse to believe it but the dawning realization was shattering if your charge is true why did the man wait so long to kill partridge answer me that bradys dead and theres no way we can ask him allen said again i refuse to believe my casual comments had anything to do with brady or the murder of partridge he stepped forward forcing rutledge to move back outside the door and shut it with firmness that was how martin deloran found his missing scientist he said to hamish as he walked back the way hed come a chance encounter a remembered name and face a chatty reference in a conversation and somehow the news had reached delorans ears hamish said ye ken parkinson knew as soon as the watcher came but didna understand how it was that hed been found im sure of it he stopped to tap at millers door in number this time to his surprise it opened the police have been and gone ive nothing to say to you rutledge said i happened to call on miss chandler and she asked to be remembered to you and to mr allen kind of you good day but rutledge had his hand on the door to prevent it from closing ive also come to ask if you knew mr partridge well no one here knows anyone well i thought youd have learned that by now rutledge studied the man a thin face hair graying early a sturdy build he could have been the conductor on a streetcar or a clerk in a shop middleclass with an accent that didnt betray his roots one cultivated to win him a better position in the marketplace but not completely natural to him it was his eyes that were interesting they were what many would call hazel but the dominant color was a golden green and oddly feral and they were guarded as if someone else stood behind them a very different man from the one the world saw at first glance inmates of prisons sometimes had that shuttered look surviving as best they could in a place where they were afraid rutledge said every cottage has windows and theres nothing to see except the horse on the hill and the comings and goings of your neighbors i dont watch from my windows but he had like the others and now he denied it as the others had done what was his secret had he embezzled funds at his place of business or been passed over for promotion and lost his temper allen had called him a timid man and slater had said he was evil there was something here something that rutledge an experienced police officer could feel in the air you saw nothing the night that willingham was killed or on the night when brady must have disposed of partridges body i didnt see anything when willingham was killed thank god i was asleep as for partridge i dont even know what night that was but i can tell you that it was about three days since id seen himhe used to walk over to where the trees start and stand there looking up at the horsewhen i heard the motorcar come back it was close on three in the morning and i was having trouble sleeping i got up thinking i might have a cigarette and i stood there at the window watching someone open the shed door and then drive the motorcar inside as a rule partridge shuts it straightaway but this time i didnt see him walk around to the door as he usually did the shed door stayed open and in the morning the shed door was shut and all was quiet i thought perhaps hed slept in after a long drive i never saw him again when rutledge didnt comment miller hesitated and then added the next night brady went there to partridges door knocked and went inside he stayed nearly an hour and then hurried back to his own cottage my guess at the time was that partridge had been taken ill but nothing came of bradys visit rutledge said no one else has given me this information miller laughed harshly even quincy must sleep sometimes i seldom sleep the night through its become a habit with me now hamish said the truth or what ye want to hear rutledge considered his answer both to hamish and to miller miller added to the silence hurrying to fill it again as far as i know mr brady didnt have anything with him when he left the cottage and youd be willing to swear to this under oath at the inquest mr miller i wish id been told earlier while brady was alive a flicker of emotion passed across millers face you never came to ask i was here several times you failed to answer your door yes well these things happen he waited with expectancy as if he thought this time the man from london might leave rutledge thanked him and went back to his motorcar to hamish he said its hard to say what mr millers motive was in telling me what he just did unless it was to speed the police in finishing their business here sooner than later offering us lies we want to hear he had caught that slight movement when hed asked miller about appearing at the inquest for bradys death miller hadnt expected his admission to be taken any further than a statement certainly not to be sworn to under oath and in public and that rather reinforced the possibility that he hadnt told the truth rutledge thought he understood now why slater had called miller an evil man those arresting eyes coupled with an unfriendly nature and impatience or outright antagonism toward a man with a simple view of the world must make the smith very uncomfortable in millers presence hamish said its no likely that he showed you the same face he showed the ithers rutledge had just reached his motorcar when hill came down the road toward him and waved him to wait he got out of his motorcar and came across to rutledge his face sober he said without preamble we managed to get our hands on something brady wrote before he moved to the cottage it was a list of what he wanted to bring with him somehow it had fallen behind the desk and out of sight but it was enough for us to compare handwriting if brady wrote that listand theres every reason to believe he didthen he didnt write the suicide note we found confessing to the murder of willingham and partridge he held out a sheet of paper and rutledge took it the list wasnt long but there were references to my green folder and later my black coat as well as clothing books and personal items it ended with the file md gave me martin deloran i wasnt completely convinced rutledge began but hill interrupted him thats as may be the question is what are we going to do about this and ive brought two constables with me theyll take turn about watching the cottages day and night until we get to the bottom of it two middleaged men in uniform had stepped out of the motorcar behind him and were walking up the lane they went into bradys cottage and shut the door behind them the list of suspects isnt long rutledge said thinking about what allen had said to him quincy allen slater miller singleton youve left out the woman do you really believe she could have wielded that knife i doubt it very much but im not taking any chances he marched off after his men head down and mouth a tight line rutledge turned the motorcar in the middle of the road and drove back to partridge fields it had represented many things in gerald parkinsons life a happy childhood for two young girls a mothers illness a fathers obsession with his work a death by suicide and then a house left to stand empty but not abandoned rebecca parkinson may have seen to the flower beds but it was her father who made certain that the lawns were well kept and someone was paid to clean and polish and see that the rooms stayed fresh parkinson had even used the name partridge after the name of his house gaylord partridge the gate was always closed and today was no exception but he let himself in and walked around to the kitchen he was in luck the housekeeper was therea dust pan and brush stood beside a mop and a pail of old cloths just outside the door and from the kitchen he could hear a woman humming to herself as she worked he called to her but she didnt immediately answer he stood there his back to the house looking past the kitchen garden to the small orchard on the left and the outbuildings just beyond shrubbery tall with age partly blocked his view but there appeared to be a small stable for horses a coop for chickens and a longer building where everything from carriages to scythes barrows and other tools could be stored leading to the buildings was a cobbled walk to keep boots out of the mud when it rained and someone had put a tub of flowers to either side he walked to the orchard where plum and apple and pear grew cheek by jowl and beyond there was another outbuilding this one low foursquare and without grace apparently built for utility not beauty it was one story so as not to be visible at the house over the tops of the orchard trees a pair of windows was set either side of the door someone had tried to make it prettier for it had been painted green and there was a lilac avenue leading up the walk to it three to either side a silk purse and a sows ear rutledge thought hamish regarding it with dislike said the laboratory rutledge went up to the windows and looked inside the workbenches in the center of the floor were too heavy to be overturned but someone had taken an axe to them and the rest of the room was littered with glass and twisted metal broken chairs and a scattering of tools and equipment someone had come in here and destroyed everything that could be destroyed with a wild anger that hadnt been satisfied by mere destruction it had wanted to smash and hurt and torment who had done this gerald parkinsons late wife or his daughters hungry for a revenge they couldnt exact on their father hamish said the elder one it was true rebecca parkinson was riven by an anger that went bone deep unsatisfied and uncontrolled but sarah might have been jealous enough of her fathers passion to hate the laboratory just as much he heard someone calling from the direction of the house and retraced his steps coming out of the orchard to see the housekeeper standing in the doorway a hand shading her eyes as she called i saw your motorcar from the windows where have you got to theres nobody here but me she broke off as she heard him approaching and turned his way you mustnt wander about like this it isnt right she scolded him policeman or no i called to you i could hear you humming in the kitchen he said lightly shifting the blame for his walk squarely onto her for not answering him i was arranging fresh flowers for mrs parkinsons bedroom and taking them up i do sometimes it cheers me a nice touch he said you must have been very fond of her i was that a lovely lady with gentle manners she sighed it seems to me sometimes that i can still hear her voice calling to me at his look of surprise she smiled wryly no not her ghost of course not but her voice all the same in my head just as it used to be martha do come and see what ive done with the flowers or martha i think ill take my luncheon in the gardens if you dont mind making up a tray little things id do for her and knew shed appreciate but that times long gone and i dont have anyone to spoil not even miss rebecca or miss sarah do you recall when mrs parkinson was illsome years ago when her daughters were young ive told you it isnt my place to gossip about the family it isnt gossip im looking for he said but something to explain what makes gerald parkinsons daughters hate their father it might be traced back to her illness for all i know i dont think they hate him exactly what else would you call it ive spoken to both of them and id be deaf not to hear the way they felt about him yes well i expect theres some hard feeling over poor mrs parkinsons sudden death on the contrary i think it went back longer than that sarah parkinson remembers how happy she was before that illness but she was too young to understand what the illness was or why it changed her parents come in then i was just about to put the kettle on you might as well have a cup with me she led the way into the kitchen and set the kettle on the stove he could see that it was already hot and she said i like to cook sometimes when im working nothing but a bit of warmedover soup and some tea once in a while my bread baking for the week this is a better oven than the one i have in my little house no one objects surely no at least theyve never said anything once when id done some baking i came back and found half my lemon cake gone it wasnt all that long ago either i expect miss rebecca was sharpish after working in the gardens mrs parkinsons illness he reminded her i wasnt here then as it happened i left service to go and marry a scoundrel and when i came back looking for work she took me on again the interim housekeeper had just left without giving notice do you know why i was told she hadnt counted on being a nursemaid but it was more than that i think mr and mrs parkinson werent getting on he was spending more and more time in that laboratory of his and she didnt leave her bed for a good two months after i came back shed lost her will to live i thought and i tried everything i could think of to bring her back to her old self it wasnt until miss sarah caught the scarlet fever that mrs parkinson got herself up and dressed and stayed up night and day with the child i think that was the saving of her but mr parkinson when i mentioned it to him said that even great sorrows dont last forever i took that to mean that mrs parkinson had lost a child she was carrying i dont know why i thought that except it was just the sort of thing that would break a womans heart no one ever said in so many words but theyd have liked a son im sure to carry on the name hamish said truth or only wishful thinking it was something neither parent would discuss with a young girl but a loss that would send the father to bury himself in his work and leave the mother to mourn for what might have been do you know if the doctor who cared for mrs parkinson is still in practice my goodness no dr butler died six years ago of a heart condition his son was going to take over the practice but then the war came along so much for verifying her supposition he drank his tea as the housekeeper rattled on about her work and the family she had served small anecdotes that she had taken pleasure in remembering through the years i dont expect youve ever seen a photograph of her when they was first married mr parkinson said hed like to have her painted she was such a pretty thing mrs parkinson fair hair and blue eyes a real english rose you might say it was a pleasure to look at her when she was all dressed up for a party or to travel up to london blue was her color it brought out the softness of her skin but she could wear most anything they made a handsome pair i can tell you him dark her fair when hed finished his tea he thanked her and rose to leave i shall have to mention to miss rebecca and miss sarah that you were here she told him as she saw him to the door if they ask and if you could see fit to forget anything i mayuv said out of turn it would be a kindness but you being a policeman and all its not like gossiping with the greengrocers wife is it he promised to respect her confidences and walked back to his motorcar thinking about what shed told him a miscarriage could change the relationship of husband and wife most certainly if the doctors had told her she mustnt have another child the emotional impact of loss and grief could have frightened children who didnt understand what had happened they would certainly have felt the great distress wrapping their parents in shared sorrow and they might have felt left out of it something like that could shake the safe world a child was accustomed to living in it went a long way toward understanding the sisters anger and even explained to some extent why mrs parkinson had finally killed herself if she had never quite come to terms with her grief but it didnt explain patricide hamish said she died many years later i dont know that time has anything to do with grief but yes it must have added to her burden hed spoken aloud from habit and caught himself up hamish said aye ye can pretend im no here but you canna turn around to see for yoursel it was true the one thing rutledge dreaded was seeing the face of a dead man however real hamish was he was lying in his grave in france and if he was not it didnt bear thinking of the housekeeper martha might not have believed in ghosts and for that matter neither did rutledge the voice in his head had nothing to do with dead men walking it was there because hamish had died and there was nothing he could do to change that it was his punishment for killing so many of his own men for leading them over the top and across no mans land and coming back without a scratch on him while they fell and cried out and died hed had the courage to die with them but fate had decided to spare him and scar him with the knowledge that his very survival mocked him when he got back to the smiths arms rutledge was surprised to find that the exsoldier singleton had come to the bar and was there drinking heavily it was mrs smith who told him her voice pitched not to carry but her concern very real i dont want smith to throw him out it isnt good for business and besides hes likely drunk enough to take exception to it and then where will we be and for that matter poor mrs cathcart is in her room frightened of her own shadow with him shouting down here as hamish warned him to stay out of it rutledge pushed through the door and found smith behind the bar standing there grimly watching singleton he was talking with a lorry driver and the man had pushed back from the table to escape the intensity of singletons vehement certainty that the world was going to the dogs and before long theyd all be murdered in their beds walking over to the pair rutledge greeted them with a nod and then said singleton id like to have a word if you dont mind the exsoldier looked up at him if its about the murders i have nothing to say its not a military matter is it youre right still youve more experience than most of the residents there at the cottages he sat down moving his chair slightly so that he could watch singleton and his irate companion at the same time experience in what it was a low growl as if rutledge had accused him of the killings dealing with men what if hill is wrong and brady couldnt have killed himself or willingham who do you think might be capable of it singleton shook his head as if to clear it blame it on partridge if you like its as good a guess as any why else did he run off and bring the police prowling about like ants hardly like ants hill and his men have tried to be discreet yes well id had enough i came here for a little peace if mrs cathcart can flee the scene so can i shes a woman and nervous i intend to stay the night mrs smith doesnt have a free room then ill sleep here all i need is a pillow and a blanket im afraid thats not possible let me drive you home youll be safer in your own bed safe has nothing to do with it theres no peace there any more i wish willingham had never died or brady for that matter though i didnt like him at all smelled of trouble the moment i saw him he never disturbed you to my knowledge rutledge pointed out id have dealt with him if he had the lorry driver cleared his throat and started to get up singleton told him shortly to sit down and mind where he was youre drinking my round and youll finish it out of courtesy but the lorry driver said ive had all i can drink and still drive you dont have another fifty miles to travel before youre done i want company singleton retorted ive never liked to drink alone youve got company the driver pointed out but subsided in his chair casting a pleading glance at rutledge singleton ill ask smith to give us a bottle and well finish it at the cottage singleton considered him i told you i wanted to get away from there this is hardly the place to drown your sorrows but its where i am partridge is dead his body was found some distance from here its likely he was murdered as well but not necessarily by the same hand as brady and willingham singletons eyes sharpened youre lying you cant have two murderers prowling the same patch why not murder is as individual as the man or woman who resorts to it youve killed you know thats true what do you mean ive killed rutledge thought hes beyond reasoning with and hamish said once more ware all right singleton were leaving rutledge got to his feet and pushed his chair back to the table are you ready to come with me it was not the conversational voice hed been using but the tone of an officer expecting his men to obey on the spot surprisingly singleton responded standing and then gripping the edge of the table to steady himself give me a shoulder man he appealed to rutledge and together they walked out of the bar mrs smith standing in the shadows by the stairs watched and up on the landing mrs cathcart had wrapped her arms about her body as if to stop shaking rutledge got singleton outside and into the motorcar they drove back toward the cottages and singleton was silent brooding as rutledge turned up the lane toward his cottage the exsoldier said its quincy if youre looking for one of us to be the murderer hes half mad anyway with all those damned birds someone should fire the cottage with him in it someone did try he got a shotgun barrel in his face then youve only to look at any one of us to see who it was quincy fired through the door apparently scaring the hell out of someone but not hitting him i told you he was mad yes probably youre right do you want me to come in with you no youre not drinking my whisky and telling me lies suit yourself good day singleton he waited while singleton made up his mind after a moment the man clambered down threw a mockery of a salute in rutledges direction and said its the pain that gets to you after a while it drives you mad were you wounded rutledge knew singleton had served in india the disgrace damn you it turned my father against me ill tell you that he never spoke to me again his only son disgraced before his regiment and mine but i didnt care any more and he did he walked with surprising steadiness to his door and went inside as rutledge turned the motorcar he was close enough to number to see miller standing at his window what if miller had been telling the truth or part of it that someone had brought partridges motorcar back to the cottage to make it appear that partridge hadnt used it with the tab of the respirator found in the vehicle and millers storyif trueto show that the motorcar had been returned late at night by an unknown driver the pieces of the puzzle were falling together but rutledge still hadnt determined where parkinson had died if it was in his own house then the sisters were involved if not then it could have been brady or if deloran didnt trust him another of his minions he hadnt died in the cottage had someone overpowered him while he stood in the trees looking up at the white horse it would have been easy quiet rutledge had come to know rebecca and sarah parkinson letting their father die the same way their mother had killed herself smacked of a certain justice if he took them into custody and a jury found them guilty hed have to be present when they went to the gallows and he was fairly certain that rebecca would protect her sister to the end claiming that she alone had carried out the murder even if it had taken two of them to drag their fathers body to the motorcar and drive it to yorkshire the newspapers would make a sensation out of the trial parkinsons daughters would be vilified in print their familys secrets dragged out into the open and dissected over tea and the butchers counter and in the pubs he had better be damned certain that his facts were irrefutable before he tossed two young women to the wolves but for parkinsons sake his murderer or murderers had to be brought to justice even if he would have railed at the police for doing it rutledge thought ive always spoken for the victim this time the victim might well prefer to see me fail rutledge drove to sarah parkinsons house waited at the door while she decided whether or not to answer his knock and when she came at last he went straight to the point you have a choice miss parkinson come with me to yorkshire and identify your fathers body then help us solve the mystery of where and how he died there have been two other deaths among the residents of the tomlin cottages and so far weve managed to keep the two inquiries separate but the fact remains that both of the dead men mr willingham and mr brady had a very good view of your fathers cottage weve been told by another witness that your fathers motorcar was returned after he went missing this witness saw one person driving it and since your father wasnt there the next morning we have to believe that it was his killer who brought the motorcar back both mr willingham and mr brady were closer to the shed than our third witness they could very well have seen the driver more clearly if the police cant prove otherwise then a connection will be made between your fathers death and the other murders he could see the color draining from her face its been my experience miss parkinson that murdering another human being is easier after the first time if you didnt kill those men then we must assume it was rebecca trying to protect you my sister did nothing of the sort youre trying to frighten me go away you can shut the door if you like and ill leave but what ive told you wont leave with me it will echo in your head until you come to your senses and act to protect yourself shes your sister miss parkinson but shes placed your own life at risk cant you see that youre wrong she told him resolutely you are wrong then tell me what the truth is and let me deal with it theres nothing to tell her voice held a world of sorrow this business at the cottages has nothing to do with us and you said yourself that my fathers bodyif it is hiswas found a long way from here miss parkinson listen to me whatever happened you must find the courage to speak out if youre afraid of your sister well protect you why should i be afraid of her shes done nothing nothing at all and this talk about murders to cover up what witnesses saw is wild guessing nothing else let this witness meet me facetoface and tell me i was there i was not but you cant speak for rebecca can you if you werent there you cant prove or disprove that she might have been come in and give us a statement tell us what you know let us set the record straight if i sign a statement youll use it against becky shes the only family i have left do you think my mother would ever forgive me if i did something that would hurt becky do you think i could forgive myself my father is dead theres nothing more i can do to hurt him and nothing more he can do to hurt me let it go murder isnt something i can walk away from when i leave here im going to take a statement from the witness who saw your fathers motorcar return three nights after your father left the motorcar is there still but in the rear seat i found something that you or your sister overlooked its a tab from the respirator he was she moved so quickly he couldnt have forestalled her the door was slammed and he could hear on the other side the rasp of the bolt as it was shoved into place he had planted the seeds of doubt about her sister in sarah parkinsons mind it was what he had come to do but he felt unclean now it was a cruel thing ye did what would you have me do tell me rutledge demanded impatiently as he cranked the motorcars engine tell me how else i could show her the danger ahead if she remains loyal to her sister hill will come round to thinking this same way hes no fool would you betray your sister the circumstances here are different but even as he denied it he knew how much he loved frances and would protect her no sae different in my view hamish said dryly as if hed read rutledges mind you had no sisters or brothers how can you be so sure what youd have done in my shoes aye its true all the same youll no get anywhere with this lass he had a strong feeling hamish might be right in the end they could very well get away with murder if they could prove they hadnt touched willingham or brady and while it was essential to his evidence that they go to yorkshire and positively identify inspector madsens nameless body they might decide to accommodate him let him take them there and in front of witnesses deny that it was gerald parkinson he was surprised that rebecca at least hadnt considered doing just that if she ever separated her anger from her best interests it might still happen that way and her father would be buried as gaylord partridge and as surely as the sun rose every morning martin delo ran would be delighted to support her testimony it was time to put his case in writing rutledge drove back to the cottages to ask allen to make a statement identifying parkinson as the neighbor hed known as partridge it wasnt strong enough to overturn what parkinsons own daughters told the court but it might serve to cast doubt on their motives but when rutledge arrived on allens doorstep the man shook his head he seemed to have aged in a matter of hours the color of his skin mottled and his hands trembling i must rest come back this afternoon if you please when rutledge expressed concern allen reminded him there are good days and bad and this hadnt been one of my better ones theyre farther and farther apart now my doctor warned me but of course one always supposes hell be wrong he wasnt he closed his door and rutledge heard the click of the bolt as he locked it rutledge walked away thinking that allen would have a difficult time when it came to giving evidence at a trial but he would be believed he was that sort of man and the view of the jury might well be that a dying man had nothing to gain by lying the next statement he wanted was millers rutledge was surprised when the man answered the door he explained what he needed miller said i told you what i saw i dont see any point in writing it out what you told me is evidence in a murder inquiry i can corroborate what youve said but i cant speak for you it was you who saw the motorcar come back it was you who saw brady go into the partridge cottage if both events happened the way you described them to me you have nothing to fear im not much for what follows appearing in court youll be summoned to give evidence whether you wish to or not its out of my hands oh very well miller replied grudgingly come again in half an hour and ill give it to you he said almost as an afterthought what was it you were badgering allen about did he see something as well let him give you a statement in my place it doesnt work that way miller rutledge went to quincys cottage and at first thought that quincy might not open his door but he did saying the minders those two constables in what was bradys cottage what are they supposed to do arrest our killer as soon as he strikes again theyre not fit enough to run a man down a hot spicy aroma filled the air behind him distinctly unenglish theyre hills men here to keep the peace quincy snorted well theyre a damned sight too late for willing ham and brady and if brady did the killing what are we in need of minders for tell me that its the fire setter who worries me early days yet to be certain it was brady his curiosity got the better of him what are you making its something i learned to cook in mexico chili with chocolate cooked in it not bad i admit to homesickness now and again at least for the food ive grown fond of a bit more flavor than boiled cabbage and boiled potatoes and boiled beef i gather youre looking for something other than culinary lessons and if its character references you want dublin will do have you told me everything you could or is your fear of your brother finding out youre back in england locking up your tongue i dont know anything more than ive told you i kept the cat when he wasnt here we spoke from time to time and that was it he never gave you anything to keep for him while he was away like state secrets do you mean he grinned hardly he knew he couldnt trust me for the simple reason that i put myself above all else ive a comfortable life here and im not interested in setting it at risk the kettles on if you want a cup of tea rutledge followed him inside and as quincy worked went into the room with the birds you were lucky the cottage didnt burn down with you in it he told his host it was a near thing and i havent got rid of the smell yet did you notice it i expect thats why i decided to make chili i brought spices back with me when i came to england and theyre running out i need to find a way to stock them in again surely you left behind friends who could oblige you quincy came back with the tea no i didnt i burnt those bridges i didnt want someone showing up in england to surprise me here you are what fascinates you about my birds how you killed them before you mounted them thats what partridge asked me as well sorry to disappoint you but i had others do it for me i didnt like that part of it but birds live and die either by the hand of a small boy with a slingshot or in the jaws of a predator stalking them on the jungle floor i knew what birds i wanted and i paid to have them brought to me ive told you so he had but rutledge still had his doubts quincy said as he passed rutledge sugar for his tea i borrowed the sugar from allen by the way i knew youd come calling again all right lets look at the broader picture if id killed willingham and brady id have done it more efficiently taken my shotgun and seen them off quickly and with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of noise theres that quincy acknowledged but im not one for carving up my enemies with a knife its a favorite weapon in central america but i never took to it the same holds for why i didnt kill these birds myself i dont have to feel guilty every time i look at them for how they may have died everyone here has secrets you said as much yourself i know most of them now and none of them appears to be worth a murder much less two yes well there are secrets and secrets and yours might be that if your brother demands that you leave england again you dont dare show your face in central america something flickered in his eyes but quincy said the world is wide and there are other places to hide hamish said he canna return or he wouldna ha risked coming home rutledge smiled there are ways to find out if there are warrants out for your arrest im not so worried about the police damn it theres a family out for my blood and likely to have it if im not careful its easy to hire an assassin where people are poor and desperate id never know the face of my murderer until he was on me and so i paid a few bribes of my own and got out it had the ring of truth but that left allen and miller and singleton as well as rebecca parkinson ye forgot the smith hamish warned rutledge he had finishing his tea he asked what secrets did willingham have that made him a victim who knows if you caught the rough edge of his tongue you might want to kill him on general principles rutledge rose to leave but you were nearly a victim as well after brady died yes we might need to ask ourselves what set something in motion that cant be stopped and thats why i sleep with the shotgun to hand if he comes in here ill be ready for him it was an interesting remark and it stayed with rutledge after he left quincys cottage we might need to ask ourselves what set something in motion that cant be stopped he climbed the hill and sat down on the chalk edge of the great horses foreleg secrets within secrets something set in motion that cant be stopped what had changed in this tiny hamlet of nine cottages over the past two years partridge had come to live here and then allen had unwittingly given him away to someone who passed the news of parkinsons whereabouts to deloran brady had then taken over the cottage vacated by miss chandler after her fortuitous inheritance from a cousin had allowed her to move elsewhere that had covered what the space of a few weeks or months and after that nine people had lived together in peace if not in harmony until partridge went away and failed to come back hed have thought rutledge mused silently that the first death ought to have been bradys but partridge had accepted his watcher and very likely proceeded to play with him by disappearing at intervals better the devil you know partridges death had stirred up something here or was it rutledges appearance on the scene to find out where hed gone and why that was more to the point whatever inspector hill wanted to believe hamish said else someone came looking for what yon old lady had typed when you didnt find it but rutledge couldnt believe that parkinson would have trusted anything of value to a curmudgeon like willingham then again why not the least likely place might have been the most secure that still wouldnt explain bradys death even if brady had gone to search number while he thought willingham was asleep it all came round to what theyd seen the night partridge vanished andboth deaths occurred after rutledge had made himself known to parkinsons daughters that ought to have been included in his time line speak of the devil hamish began below rutledge a motorcar went speeding by and he recognized itit was one that sarah parkinson borrowed from her sister it looked as if the things hed said to her only this morning had sent her headlong to confer with rebecca rutledge went down the hill fast reached his own motorcar and set out in pursuit he wanted to be there when the sisters met halfway down the hill he stopped the door to allens cottage had swung open and allen himself stood there for an instant and then went sprawling head first into the front garden rutledge changed course and shouting for slater or quincy raced to allens aid no one came to help him not even the constables hill had left on watch when he reached allen he could see that there was no need for help the man was dying rutledge turned him over and lifted the thin shoulders into his arms holding him allen looked up squinted at the sky then slowly brought rut ledges face into focus its you he said you wont get your statement after all sorry he lay back trying to breathe after a moment he said i dont regret going this way im just grateful that im not alone i always worried about that you know silly when i chose to live here by myself rutledge said is there anything i can do anyone you want me to contact its all there in my desk youre a good man rutledge thank you for coming allen began to recite the twentythird psalm breathless and yet not hurrying as if he knew he had time when hed finished he said i didnt live a blameless life but i never did anyone any harm i expect god will take that into account rutledge had seen men die most of them young and had held more than one frightened boy until it was over allen worn and frail had reached the end of a normal life span but it made no difference watching was difficult but he spoke quietly steadily to the dying man and allen answered as long as he was able and then he was quiet but still breathing after an interval he said quoting king charles ii i seem to be an unconscionable time adying his chuckle caught on a small cough and then he was gone the light fading from his eyes rutledge said rest in peace i hope you have found it wherever you are he could feel his leg cramping but went on holding allen for some time until slater returning from the direction of uffington saw them there and came on the run whats happened he called as he reached them allen is dead time caught up with him i think yes he told me once that the doctor had given him six to eight months but he was determined to live longer and so he did he reached down and gathered the mans body in his arms lifting him gently and carrying him into the cottage where he laid allen on his bed rutledge working out the cramp in his leg followed them ill go for inspector hill will you stay here slater asked rutledge thought of the sisters meeting the danger that sarah might stand in it was already too late to get there in time he answered go on ill wait for a time rutledge stood by the hearth in allens cottage listening to the ticking of the carriage clock on the mantelpiece the old man had been sitting in his chair when he realized that the end was near a handful of papers had scattered across the floor as he struggled to his feet and dragged himself to the door to call for help it must have taken enormous will to travel even that short distance but he hadnt died alone in an empty house it was even possible that from his windows hed seen rutledge sitting by the horse and held on until the man from london got to him rutledge gathered up the papers to set them neatly on the table beside the chair they were mostly letters from allens family and he put them down without reading them but among them he saw that allen had begun his statement writing out the first sentence in a trembling hand before realizing that his malaise that morning was the precursor to death the sheet below that one caught rutledges eye for it was a list of the occupants of the tomlin cottages partridges name had been struck off and then willinghams and bradys there was a question mark by millers and the notation the likeliest choice i think mostly because he doesnt belong here allen had been playing at amateur detective beside quincys name was another notation armstrong or perhaps remington cant be sure must write to halloran and see next to slaters name was an x as if allen had crossed him off as a suspect the notation beside it read he might manage one killing but not a second not in his nature and after singletons hed written soldier trained to kill still it appeared that hed come to no particular conclusion the door opened and inspector hill walked in youre sure allen died of natural causes rutledge said very likely see for yourself and hill went into the bedroom rutledge pocketed the list allen had made then looked in the desk as allen had told him there was an envelope with the words to be opened after my death written in the same hand as the list rutledge took it out and set it against a lamp where hill would notice it slater was still outside his face pale rutledge went out to him i know it was what he wanted all the same what are we to do i think these cottages are accursed they shouldnt have been put here in the first place it was a desecration slater if i were you id sleep at your smithy tonight not in your cottage im not afraid if thats what you think if you arent here you cant be accused the mans eyes widened but what about mr quincy and miller and singleton you cant leave them inspector hill came out of the cottage and cast a glance in the direction of bradys where his men had been stationed why the hell didnt they come slater said you were here alone youd better have a look hill gave him an odd glance then set out for bradys cottage at a trot he went through the door without knocking and even from this distance rutledge could hear him shouting angrily at his men he came back still furious and said they thought it might be a trick they were told to watch and damn it they watched their eyes glued to the other cottages for any sign of trouble there wasnt anything they could do no all right then ill take over here thanks and he turned to go back into the cottage rutledge walked down the lane with slater will you leave ill think about it good man quincy was standing in his doorway allen was it yes rutledge answered shortly he was still angry with quincy for not coming to the mans aid im glad you were there quincy said and went back inside rutledge left then knowing it was too late but driving anyway as fast as he dared toward pockets the house where rebecca parkinson lived when he got there sarahs motorcar was gone he wasnt surprised but she hadnt passed him on the road and he thought he knew where else she might have gone and hed guessed right she was at partridge fields sitting in the motorcar just outside the gates crying he pulled up behind her and got out she looked up and said youve done enough damage go away im sorry no youre not i went to rebecca to ask what we were to do she and i and she said there was nothing we could do if you arrested us so be it a charge of murder is a very serious matter he looked up rebecca parkinson was peddling toward them on her bicycle she hesitated when she saw rutledges car pulled in behind her sisters and then she came on resolute sarah are you all right i was worried she said ignoring rut ledge yes im fine come inside its one of marthas days she may still be here she can make us some tea im not sure i want to go in then why did you come there was nowhere else to go it was said with great sadness i know come along in and it will be all right i promise you sarah cast a glance in rutledges direction what about him she asked her sister i dont think i can bear any more if he comes after us ill have him up on charges of trespassing rebecca turned to rutledge challenging him to argue with her leaving the motorcar where it stood in the middle of the road sarah opened her door and crossed to where her sister was still astride the bicycle rutledge waited sarah said her back to him theres something youve forgotten mr rutledge in your concern for my father and whatever justice it is you seem to want for him you didnt have to live in this house all your life we did push too hard and we could choose the way out that our mother chose because right now there isnt much left of our future if you really want justice what about a little for us as for those men in the cottages im sorry about them but i didnt know them and neither did rebecca i wont take their deaths on my soul rutledge said your father is dead he doesnt care now what you think of him what you owe him or what he made you suffer for all you know his own life was as wretched as yours sarah started through the gate still not looking at him then were even arent we he and the two of us rebecca followed her propping her bicycle just inside there was triumph now in the glance she cast over her shoulder toward rutledge hamish said shes got her sister under her spell and they were gone up the path walking side by side in silence rutledge swore it was as if they drew their strength from each other secure in the knowledge that if neither of them confessed what they knew there was nothing the law could do to them hamish reminded him that one of the lorry drivers had seen a woman alone and crying in a motorcar drawn to the side of the road near waylands smith ill give you odds he answered aloud that it was sarah while her sister returned their fathers motorcar to the shed waiting to take her back to pockets when it was finished the timing would be about right although it would be hard to prove exactly which night that was or find the lorry driver who had seen her it was late but there was still one thing he could do he drove back to the crossroads and began searching for a doctors surgery if butler had been called to attend mrs parkinson during her pregnancy he must be near enough to summon at need and whoever took over his practice might still have butlers records in a village not two miles distant to the west he found the first of them and then another just a little farther to the east a third was due north but none of them had treated the parkinson family or knew what had become of dr butlers records he kept moving first down this road and then that and as the sun began to set he turned on his headlamps determined to find what he was after hamish said they had money the parkinsons they would ha seen a london doctor not for measles or a fall or a sore tooth there would have been someone closer who could be called no for the lost child for the despair that followed rutledge considered that possibility but hed got the impression that for many years mrs parkinson had withdrawn into herself shutting out her husband and would never have been persuaded to see a london doctor of his choosing it would have been an admission that they shared a grief mrs parkinson had hugged it to herself instead and in the end used her death as the ultimate punishment he gave up after another two hours he was too far afield he was halfway back to partridge fields when he saw a house well off the road sheltered by a small copse its lights were burning in the dark and a drive wandered in their direction it was just outside the first village hed tried what had caught his eye in a flash of his headlamps was not a doctors board but a small elegant stone pillar at the end of the drive hed almost passed by it a second time when he realized that the scrolled name inset into the pillar was the butlers he backed up and turned into the drive pulling up by the door the knocker was a worn brass caduceus and he felt his hopes soar a woman answered her face framed in soft waves of reddish brown hair and behind her peering around an inner door was a girl of about twelve betsy dear she stopped when she saw a stranger standing on her threshold oh i do beg your pardon i was expecting a friend and shes late are you lost my name is rutledge he said offering her his identification she peered shortsightedly at it scotland yard oh dear perhaps i ought to call my husband she turned to the girl will you fetch papa darling theres someone here to see him she sounded uncertain the girl disappeared and in a moment or two a man came to the entry he was dressed in rough work clothes and there was paint on his hands and across his face sorry were doing up my mothers room how can i help you mrerrutledge is it yes from london im looking for a dr butler who once practiced in these parts are you by chance related to him good god how did you ever find us yes he was my father dead now im afraid i dont think he practiced after one of his patients was a woman named parkinson im trying to learn more about her and the illness he treated you dont by any chance have his records butler brushed a hand across his forehead pushing his light brown hair out of his eyes and leaving another streak of paint there i doubt theyd do you much good but yes we do somewhere in the attic at a guess well not his records actually those went to the man who took over his practice and hes dead as well killed in the war worst luck i dont know who might have taken over from him but my father kept a series of diaries and theyre boxed up just as he left them would that be of help if im lucky rutledge said do you need them now it was clear mr butler would have preferred another time well be up all night with our painting my mother arrives in the morning this morning it would be best let me clean up a bit first then come in man rutledge followed butler into a sitting room and waited there for nearly threequarters of an hour before butler came back with a wooden box in his hand inside were rows of small leatherbound diaries each with a year printed in gold on its spine rutledge had been trying to calculate which year he was after based on what sarah parkinson had told him about her holidays as a child he pulled out a likely diary but there was no mention of the parkinsons at all save for a reference to a cough that had kept sarah in bed for three weeks and a burn that the housekeeper martha ingram had sustained while cooking a christmas goose butler was sitting across from him clearly anxious to get back to his painting and mrs butler held by curiosity sat quietly knitting and watching from across the room the girl was nowhere in sight rutledge had to go back two years before he found the diary entry he was after there was a date april and then the notation mrs parkinson went into labor at two oclock in the afternoon all proceeding normally three weeks short of full term was that the reference hed been after the housekeeper had distinctly told him there was a miscarriage this child was nearly full term yon housekeeper wasna there she left to wed a scoundrel on the twentyeighth there was a second entry eleven in the morning boy survived only an hour gave mrs parkinson a strong sedative and told the housekeeper mrs fortner to sit by her through the night until i can arrange for a nurse four oclock same day set robert dunnings leg after he was kicked by a horse five oclock peggy henderson brought in with a splinter in hand sixthirty looked in on mrs parkinson again sleeping nurse meadows with her now replacing mrs fortner just as well not impressed with housekeepers skills had long talk with parkinson explaining situation question about who should see to burial he left arrangements with me i did what i could sad day for that family there was nothing else about treating mrs parkinson except for the daily visit to be sure she was recovering from the birth rutledge scanned ahead two months later there was a final entry mrs parkinson refuses to leave her room have advised husband to let her mourn in her own fashion would have been easier if she hadnt heard the child cry and knew it lived better to have told her it was stillborn but it was out of my hands the only other mention of the parkinsons that year was a notation that parkinson had come to dr butler in july with cuts on his hands after an accident in his laboratory selfinflicted had been added to the terse notation but dr butler hadnt seen fit to elaborate the heartbreaking loss of a son recorded in a few dozen words written in a cramped but clear hand rutledge went through the next year to be sure but there was no other mention of the child or how the family had learned to cope whatever role dr butler had played in mrs parkinsons recovery was not given these were reminders to himself not a medical record he jotted down the dates and events then closed the diary and thanked the butlers they were glad to see the back of him he thought another woman had arrived with an armload of freshly ironed bed hangings and mrs butler had taken her directly upstairs he could hear her voice drifting down after her betsy youre a good friend to pitch in like this id never have got them ready in time theres just one wall left to paint butler followed rutledge to the door as politeness dictated saying i dont suppose you found what you were looking for sorry it was worth my time to read what was there rutledge thanked him and went out to his motorcar it was after midnight in fact closer to two oclock he could feel the long day in his shoulders and in the tension in hamishs voice as they drove back to berkshire there had been a living child so much harder to forget so much more of a tie for the grieving mother who had heard him cry it had been a wildgoose chase as hamish was pointing out but martha ingram had been right in her supposition that while she was occupied with her shortlived marriage there had been another child a boy after two daughters and when she returned to serve the family mrs parkinson had never told her the whole story he recalled the comment had long talk with parkinson explaining situation and later gerald parkinson had smashed something in his laboratory cutting himself badly things had gone wrong for him as well when he reached the inn rutledge went up to his bed and fell asleep almost at once hamish silent at last waited as he always did for the dawn there were no alarms in the night and mrs cathcart announced over breakfast that she was ready to return to her cottage rutledge took her back and on the way told her that allen had died she cried for him poor man but he knew it was coming if i had anywhere else to go id leave here but theres no hope of that and i mustnt even dwell on it he saw her safely inside then stood there in the soft end of april morning light looking up at the white horse there were workmen repairing the damage to quincys door the blows of their hammers echoing against the hill and rebounding legend had it that if someone knew the secret he could stand on the ground below the hill and make his voice appear to come from the horse rutledges father had told him that but try as they would they never found the spot a priest or chieftain would have known where to look for it and like the delphic oracle could have given his pronouncements the power of a god it was time to go back to london and report but he was reluctant to leave until inspector hill had caught his murderer what he would do about his own was another matter altogether it hadnt worked to turn one sister against the other slater called to him as he was walking home from the village and rutledge went to meet him you were wrong nothing happened last night but hill had left a message earlier at the inn for rutledge saying that hed collected a sample of handwriting from each of the surviving inhabitants and the results were unclear the message ended with whoever wrote this confession must have tried to emulate bradys hand or at the very least tried to disguise his own hard to say which nothing happened rutledge agreed but why take the risk im not convinced brady killed anyone slater looked up at the horse i spent much of the night thinking about mr brady if hed killed mr willingham hed have tried to bluff his way out he was that sort good at making excuses perhaps the point was to kill willingham and see that brady took the blame willingham was free with his tongue i grant you and he never cared who he hurt slater agreed and if thats whats behind this business he invited his own death hes called me a simpleton and witless often enough but im used to it ive been called names all my life i cant kill every man or woman who hurts my feelings the attempt to burn down quincys cottage was probably a sham to throw us off the scent the question is did quincy set that fire himself slater said they should all be burned down they were never meant for us but then id have nowhere to go he went inside and shut his door a lost and lonely man who would always draw spite because he was different hill arrived just then and said theres been a development i got your message yes well the doctor says now that brady couldnt have killed himself no matter how it was made to look the angle of the thrust is wrong he conferred with a colleague so two murders and an attempted one if you count the fire at quincys i was just going up to speak to miller would you like to join me hill shook his head its slater im interested in that mans got the arm to wield a knife like that and whatever he says i think he was pushed over the edge id like to look through willinghams cottage my men have been thorough im sure they have it wont do any harm to add another pair of eyes go ahead all youll find will be the sketches constable smith saw them before i did nasty piece of work but it explains doesnt it why we were so ready to believe that brady had killed the man what sketches hill said with a grin didnt you know he took aim at all his neighbors quite hogarthian really still he knew his way around pen and paper but rutledge was already on his way swearing under his breath hamish was pointing out that it wasnt his case rutledge ignored him there had been a constable on duty the first day but he was gone now rutledge let himself in shutting the door behind him it wasnt hard to locate the sketches they were in the desk drawer in a folder tied by string he unwound the string and brought out a dozen or more pen andink drawings that were as vicious as any hed ever seen each one showed one of the residents involved in a scene that was often crude and at the same time close to the mark singleton as a soldier miller in the dock and later standing by the hangman mrs cathcart drunk in public allen craftily using his illness for pity quincy paying ragged children to bring him his birds slater creating teapots without handles offering them for sale at a market fair the sign below them reading stolen from churches partridge was there wearing a mask that was what the artist must have seen as his true self it was goatlike the real man cringing behind it scapegoat only brady was missing from the collection presumably because he would have taken his sketch when he killed willing ham only he hadnt killed anyone rutledge stood there studying them hill was right the draftsmanship was excellent the content exceedingly vicious and most certainly the work of a man who cared nothing for the feelings of others he was a recluse by habit and inclination charles dickens might have used him for the model of half a dozen unsavory characters whatever had embittered him in his youth he had slowly become a man to avoid a nasty piece of work indeed but had he created these sketches there was an imagination at work here that didnt fit willingham as rutledge had seen him these had taken time to draw in such detail and from willingham rutledge would have expected more dash and less drama his temper flared too easily these were secretive closet vengeance a pleasure taken in private so that no one knew hed been savaged on paper a cowards work hamish said quincy for instance could have taken pleasure in skewering himself and his neighbors but there would have been more dark humor rutledge thought not such earthy attacks if it had been his hand holding the pen there was no whimsy here rutledge went on searching the desk but couldnt find more of the paper that the artist had used nor the nibs that were necessary to carry out the design he went back through the drawings remembering how mark benson had worked on the face of a dead man the strokes the intensity of concentration mrs cathcart was too emotional allen couldnt have killed either willingham or brady no match for them physically slater worked with his hands but not with ink or charcoal it was a very different skill a very different brain that left singleton or miller he considered the two men then went back to the portrayal on paper miller in the dock yes that went along with what rutledge himself had suspected it could be proved the portrayal of singleton was more like the recruiting posters rutledge had seen at the start of the warthe hun bayoneting innocent belgian women and children and committing other atrocities it had made excellent propaganda men had volunteered in droves and like most propaganda there was not much basis in fact to support it the emotional impact was all hamish said he was trained to kill so he was but why should he attack willingham or brady suddenly and without apparent warning rutledge put the drawings back in their folder and shoved them out of sight in the desk well start with mrs cathcart her cottage is near enough to have heard any exchanges she was reluctant to talk to him about willingham hes dead we should respect the dead he was murdered mrs cathcart theres a difference theres that she took a deep breath then answered with a self deprecating gesture he would say the cruelest things i tried not to listen he told me once that i was a selfcentered woman with nothing to offer any man that was when he was very angry because id had someone come and repair my roof it was a noisy business and he shouted at them to stop and quincy they got into a shouting match once because willingham called him a neerdowell who had never worked a day in his life who else took the brunt of his tongue mr miller of course willingham called him a liar and a scoundrel and said he should be locked up what was that about im not really sure mr miller told quincy it was because will ingham thought hed seen mr millers photograph in a london newspaper some scheme to defraud it was mr singleton he annoyed the most called him a toy soldier a disgrace to the uniform mr singleton ignored him but i saw his face sometimes and it would be twisted with his fury any truth to the charges i dont know it hurts most when theyre true doesnt it hearing them shouted about like the town crier i dont think anyone would have blamed singleton if hed taken on willingham and beaten him until he took back every word she flushed at her own vehemence im sorry i could never like the man though i wouldnt have wanted him killed it might have been the only way to stop him yes theres that a pity wouldnt you say but i thought it was mr brady whod killed willingham why are you interested in the rest of us making sure weve got the right man he said and thanked her hill was waiting what was that all about mrs cathcart had heard some of willinghams shouting matches did you find the brady sketch in his cottage no but then hed have burned it wouldnt he if hed been guilty i dont think willingham drew any of them there was no paper no special ink no pens in his desk how had he done them without the proper tools look rutledge were doing our best if you want to point a finger then get on with it if not leave us to our work start with singleton he and brady were both in the army there might have been something there singleton might not have known that in the beginning brady kept his past to himself i should think when the truth came out singleton might have thought that brady knew more than he should singleton makes no secret about being cashiered he didnt did he perhaps it was too late when he realized hed been better off keeping his mouth shut then why kill willingham first willingham irritated everybody kill two birds with one stone and put the blame on brady before setting up his death hill glared at him youre not serious do you have any better suggestion go talk to him but watch your back if youre going to make accusations hill looked at the cottages the way they were set out to give each one maximum privacy willingham could have seen anyone going into bradys cottage couldnt he a good soldier would have taken him out then launched his main attack rutledge walked back to his motorcar and said as he took up the crank good luck hill was dragging his feet ill ask the army for information he said ive been wrong once already i dont relish a second time your decision rutledge agreed and drove off hamish said he doesna believe you rutledge answered i think he does hes just covering his back he turned the car and went to call on sarah parkinson on his way back to london sarah parkinson was just leaving her house when rutledge drove up she was riding the bicycle today miss parkinson no go away she mounted the bicycle and pushed off leaving him there rutledge turned the motorcar and caught up with her slowing his speed to a crawl to match hers i havent come to talk about your father im uncomfortable being hunted this way is this what the police do drive you to distraction until you cant sleep or eat or think put your bicycle into my motorcar and ill take you to your sister or to partridge fields wherever youre setting out to go he could see her hesitate she wasnt as skilled with the bicycle as her sister and she had wobbled once or twice i can manage very well thank you you cant get down before youre hurt i swear i wont ask you any questions on the way the front wheel jerked and almost threw her into a bank of late thrift where the road narrowed a little rutledge sped up and cut her off getting out he said you shouldnt be riding this in your state of mind go on let me put the bicycle into the back ive given you my word she stopped just inches from where he stood i may be your enemy he said gently but accepting a lift from me doesnt convict you of anything but good sense i hate you did you know that she said with some force but when he reached for the handlebars she dismounted and let him have the bicycle he set it in the back more concerned about invading hamishs space than anything else his hands shaking as he maneuvered it to fit hamish chuckled derisively saying only when im ready to be seen ye canna hide rutledge got back behind the wheel his mind on hamish and nearly choked the motor sarah parkinson said tartly youre no better driver than i am she was goading him and shed succeeded but rutledge kept his promise only asking where she wanted to go to pockets my sisters house he took off the brake and set out as they passed the cottages she shivered as if her fathers death were still too raw a reminder he said nothing letting the silence grow heavy between them finally sarah parkinson said if you will let me out a mile before her house ill pedal the rest of the way as you like it was almost as if the silence accused her again she broke it first you werent there when my mother died you cant even imagine how we felt and my father standing over her after wed summoned him and saying that it had been a long time coming then why hadnt he tried to prevent it why hadnt he made her happier when it mattered he didnt answer her sometimes in the dark while im trying to fall asleep i can see all of it again people talk about nightmares but this was real and it happens over and over again until im half sick my head aching my mind struggling to forget you have no idea what thats like you must sleep well at night duty done and you have no idea what its like but he did he wanted to tell her that she was wrong others suffered as she did and that his hovering spirits were as fearsome as hers she must have read something of it in his face for she snapped oh dont sit there pretending you cant hear me then id have to ask you if you killed your father to stop your nightmares if it helped at all to punish him for what hed done to your mother and to you id like to know i cant kill my ghosts you see i left them all on the battlefield in france she stared at him you were in the war i was in france yes he fought to get himself under control it was worse than anything you can imagine worse even than finding your mother dead and it went on for four years relentless without respite and there was no one to kill except the germans and even that wasnt as easy as wed thought in the night sometimes you could hear them singing mens voices homesick and as frightened as we were and the next day you were firing at them trying to make every shot count and using your bayonet when you had to and trying to stay alive one more minute one more hour and after a while you didnt even care about that only about not letting your men down shaming them in the face of the enemy trying to set a good example that they could follow and the worst of it was they trusted me and i led them to slaughter as surely as if id been the judas goat at an abattoir if you want to compare nightmares miss parkinson youve chosen the wrong man she sat there stunned her face pale and her hands shaking in her lap the gloves she wore bicycling clenched into fists to stop it you see your righteous defense of your mother is all very well but if you killed your father you are a murderer as surely as any other murderer in the dock your excuse may seem important to you but it never is enough death is a very final solution miss parkinson and no matter how you try to excuse it if you took a life without provocation you will hang as surely as the man who killed two people back at the cottages no better no worse the same he suddenly realized that hed lost track of where he was where the motorcar was heading the darkness through which hed spoken began to recede and nothing was familiar nothing as it should be but then he recognized the tower of a distant church and knew he was on the right road miss parkinson was opening her door he braked quickly to keep her from falling out into the road ill take my chances with the bicycle she said tears on her face i should never have trusted you to keep your promise rutledge said you were the first to speak if you remember you were the one who said i didnt understand it doesnt matter ive had enough she said getting out as the motorcar came to a stop go look at yourself in your mirror miss parkinson and ask yourself if your mother will be avenged by letting your father be buried in a paupers grave it will be on your soul and not hers if thats what you do he brought out her bicycle for her and set it on the road she took it mounted and pedaled off her shoulders hunched her head down this time he watched her go not making any effort to stop her again hamish said it wasna well done i think ill stay here a while and see who comes back sarah parkinson or her sister he pulled the motorcar to the verge staring across the fields at the rooftops of the next village trying to interest himself in the people there but all he could think of was what hed said to the young woman disappearing in the distance it was all true but who was he to judge her who was he to set his torment against someone elses and make comparisons hed known sarah parkinson for a matter of days it wasnt his place it wasnt his duty he waited some time thinking she might come back this way it was useless trying to talk to sarah when her sister was present and he could see no point in continuing on to pockets to confront the two together rutledge drove back to the inn abandoning his decision to drive to london he couldnt remember the last meal hed eaten but he wasnt hungry upstairs in his room he stood by his window looking out at nothing that was visible hamish said what if youre wrong about singleton then im wrong the drawings were not willinghams style ill stand by that aye but of the lot theres the man with the birds there is if im wrong about singleton then i shall have to look at quincy more closely it isnt his style either yere no authority on drawing theres a darkness in him it was true hed grasped his jeweled treasures in desperation and he kept them with him because they were a talisman in his eyes without hope men go mad small feathered defenses against the family that didnt want him and enemies that wanted to see him dead which brought rutledge back to parkinson two men madsen and deloran had tried to use his body for their own ends parkinsons two daughters refused to claim it and until they did the case couldnt be closed there were heavy clouds in the sky shortening the day and as the light faded rutledge considered turning on his lamp and then decided against it three lorry drivers were pulling in as another edged his vehicle back on the road the men called to their departing colleague and then walked toward the inn looking for food and something to drink one of them was the man rutledge had defeated at darts laughing they made their way through to the bar in the distance he thought he saw a flash of lightning but he could hear no thunder afterward if there was a storm it was far to the west still hamish said ye canna sit here in the dark and pity yoursel it wasnt pity but a need for peace he thought in a little while he would have to decide what to do next he hadnt seen sarah parkinson pass along the road again on her way to her house he thought it odd by this time unless she had decided to wait out the storm with her sister rising he went down the stairs and started through the door one of the drivers was leaving his lorry backing out of the yard and moving off down the road rutledge watched him go then set out on foot for the white horse all was well there lamps lit in the cottages belonging to miller quincy and mrs cathcart and a thin trail of wood smoke rose from her chimney singletons cottage was dark then slater came up from the village and went in his door the white horse offered ambient light and rutledge walked its lines as he had done with his father then he turned and went back to the muzzle standing there watching the sky he thought it was nearly simultaneous the flickering of fire he could see in willinghams windows and bradys then partridges were suddenly bright with singletons not far behind they were burning rutledge raced down the hill shouting for slater and quincy but he knew it was useless the five of them could do nothing to stop the cottages from burning he cursed himself for not bringing his motorcar then remembered that partridges was in the shed next to the house slater finally came to his door to see what the commotion was about and rutledge pointed the smith turned to stare then wheeled back to rutledge rutledge shouted partridges motorcar go for help fast as you can quincy had heard the shouting and came out to look then he was back inside his door shut hamish said hell protect the birds mrs cathcart answered his knock and was frightened when she saw the smoke and flames miller came out just then and swore as he realized that his house was in danger rutledge knocked on singletons door and waited then opened it and went inside it was burning as well but there was no sign of the exsoldier where had he gone partridges motorcar kicked over on the third try and slater was backing out on his way to uffington rutledge took mrs cathcart with him and called to miller to come down as well but he stubbornly stayed where he was quincy was occupied in the room where he kept his collection and rutledge pushed mrs cathcart through the door saying help him it would keep her busy that done he began to run toward the inn thinking about his own motorcar standing there in the yard singleton was no fool under the cover of the fire he must have slipped away and his best chance of putting some distance between himself and any pursuit was to go fast and far the motorcar was still in the yard when rutledge his heart hammering and his lungs burning reached the inn he wouldnt have put it past singleton to take it another of the lorries was pulling out and he shouted to the driver to wait he was ignored there was still one of the lorries left and he dashed inside calling to smith but he stopped short in the bar two lorry drivers were still thereand only one vehicle remained in the yard he said forcing the words out harsh and curt theres a fire at the cottages take your lorry to uffington pick as many men as you can and bring them back to help the drivers were on their feet heading for the door and then he heard shouting rutledge said to smith have you seen singleton smith shook his head ill fetch something to drink theyll be needing it is it bad over there the fire may spread to the occupied cottages tell mrs smith that she may need to make up beds for tonight and then he was gone cranking his motorcar with such energy that the motor almost missed fire then caught his headlamps found the road as the lorry drivers demanded to know what had happened to the other vehicle he didnt have time to tell them the lorry had headed west away from the cottages and he followed singleton was having trouble keeping it on the road at speed by the time rutledge caught him up he could see the rear wheels swaying as singleton took the curves rutledge swore to stop him meant finding a stretch where he could get ahead and block the road he ran through the map in his mind seeing where the bends would slow singleton down where he could gain time on the straightaway singleton went through the next village far too fast scattering people and brushing past a cart stopped at an angle in the road the cart went winding and someone cried out in pain rutledge slowed keeping singleton in sight but trying not to hit anyone in his path and they were out into the open again moving far too fast for safety in the stormy light rutledge thought singleton had a very good idea who was behind him even if he couldnt see the motorcar for its bright headlamps there was a long straight stretch enough for rutledge to gun the motor and make an attempt to pass but singleton swung the lorry into his path and it was all rutledge could do to keep from plowing headlong into a stone wall where the road angled to the right hamish was shouting now telling him to watch what he was doing kill us both and hell go free hamish reminded him rutledge fell back for the next mile or two there was a double bend first one way then a short interval then the other way he wasnt sure the lorry could make that at speed but singleton had got the hang of driving it now and in the dark made the adjustments necessary to keep his lumbering vehicle on the road though it swayed dangerously the load it was carrying sometimes shifting with the curves the road was straight again houses and a barn flashing past a roadside pub and then a long looping bend singleton wasnt prepared for it he swung the lorry too hard around the first part of the bend then overcompensated as he began to slip sideways on the rough surface dust flew up from his wheels and he lost speed as he struggled to keep himself upright the bend ended in another short straight stretch and then a copse of trees loomed ahead at the next bend and then in the lorry headlamps a single bicyclist stood out with shocking clarity he had been lucky this far singleton had the road had been empty and he had had the time and the strength to keep the wheel under control but his first reaction as he saw the bicycle was to swerve his tires failed to grip and the side and rear of the lorry began to slide inexorably toward the oncoming bicycle it was like slow motion rutledge could see the bicycle and then as the lorry slowly lost traction it blotted the rider from view the scream of the brakes was almost human and like a juggernaut the lorry moved on across the road now blocking it from verge to verge in the glow of the headlamps the bicycle rose in a gleaming silver arc rising above the truck like a winged thing and then the silver faded and it was lost to view rutledge was braking with all the power of his arm knowing it wasnt going to be in time that either the bicycle could catch him or he would slam at speed into the side of the lorry he fought the wheel heard the bicycle crash into something just to the left of him and saw himself sliding too this time sideways and his brakes could do him no good somehow rutledge managed to gun the motor at the last forward momentum clashing with his sideways slide he wound up in a field by the road came to a jarring stop and was out of the motorcar while it was still rocking heavily the lorry was crashing into the wood trees snapping as the weight of the vehicle mowed into them metal rending with a highpitched whine that was earsplitting he couldnt see what had become of the rider and his greatest fear was that whoever it was had been caught beneath the lorry wheels and dragged suddenly everything was quiet from the verge of the road he heard a whimper and went quickly toward it cursing himself for not bringing his torch there wasnt a light for miles it seemed except for the lorrys headlamps and his own she was lying in stubble and high grass and he stumbled over a stone and nearly went headfirst into her he and hamish saw her at the same time it was sarah parkinson and she was badly injured he thanked the gods wherever they were that she was still alive and knelt beside her he didnt know what had happened to singleton and he didnt care his hand touched blood wet and warm at the side of her head and then as he ran his hands down her body he could feel the odd angle of one arm broken he thought but the head wound was more serious she moaned as he touched her and he was afraid to move her until he knew the extent of her injuries another motorcar was coming from the east and rutledge stood up not sure that the driver could see the lorry and his motorcar in time to realize what had happened he moved to sarah parkinsons feet prepared to wave off the other driver but the motorcar slowed then stopped is anyone hurt it was a womans voice frightened but steady hello over here rutledge called bring a torch or fetch mine from my motorcar the driver got out and ran toward rutledges motor rummaging for the torch rutledge had a fleeting thought about hamish from long habit she came racing back nearly tripping on the rough ground torch in hand flicking it on and shining it inadvertently into his face she stopped rutledge whats going on she demanded as if he had staged the accident to throw her off stride he said its your sister i dont think the lorry struck her but shes here on the side of the road one arm broken and a cut on her head if there are internal injuries rebecca was beside him pushing him away shining the light on her sisters face sarah for gods sakesarah she began to work quickly but there were tears spilling down her cheeks now and her voice began to quiver as she talked to her sister there was no response ive killed her rebecca parkinson cried we had a quarrel it was my faulti shouldnt have let her go alone in the darki tried to find her again her sister moaned and rebecca bent over her trying to cradle her head dont move her rutledge cautioned we dont know the ex tentyou must go and find help at once theres a village back the way i came no more than three miles four go there and ask if theres a doctor i wont leave her its my fault i tell you he grasped her by the shoulders and shook her hysteria wastes any time she has left get in the motorcar and go theres a murderer loose here he was driving that lorry and you cant stay here alone go she stumbled back to her motorcar and got in pushing her foot down on the gas pedal with such force that the car leapt ahead as she turned it and he heard a wheel of the bicycle crunch under the tires but she bumped over it and kept going disappearing into the darkness with such abandon he wondered if she would make it herself he used the light to look for more injuries and then bound sarahs head with his handkerchief to control the bleeding as he moved her slightly she cried out her arm or her back he had no way of knowing speaking to her quietly he tried to reassure her but she seemed not to know where she was or what was happening a blessing hamish said at his shoulder taking off his coat he rolled it and set it under the broken arm then ran his hands down her legs he could feel bloody bunches of stocking blood soaking through her skirts but there was no indication of a break on either she came to for a moment and he said rebecca is here shes gone for help hold on it wont be long i hurt all over he tried to smile thats good it means you can feel stay quiet ill be here from the lorry he could hear the sound of a door creaking open singleton was still alive he did nothing said nothing and listened after a time a voice from the darkness called i can see you even if you cant see me ill kill both of you if you try to stop me you arent my case youre hills go on he snapped off his torch you arent armed i am i said go on he could hear footsteps crunching in the dirt of the road and then fading as singleton reached the grass verge hamish said hell no leave witnesses but rutledge remained silent listening from where he knelt at sarah parkinsons side to hamish he said id swear he wasnt armed you canna chance it hes hills case you said so yourself yes he could hear the crank turning and then the motor came to life the drivers door shut singleton was backing rutledges car into the road he could see the sweep of headlamps across the sky for an instant rutledge thought singleton might try to run them down but the ground was too roughjust where he was kneeling by sarah and the risk of doing serious damage to the motorcar was obvious and then the moment came where if singleton was armed he would fire does he have a service revolver many of the enlisted men had brought them home as souvenirs the motorcar idled in the road rutledge held his breath keeping his back to singleton making sure that he was between the killer and the girl on the ground at his feet she said whats wrong i heard a motorcar is it rebecca rutledge didnt answer counting the seconds as he waited and then singleton was driving away leaving them there in the night he could feel the tension in his back to sarah he said shell be here soon it couldnt have been more than ten minutes later that rebecca was back braking hard calling to her sister a door opened a man carrying his medical bag hurried toward them rebecca was maneuvering the motorcar until the headlamps shone directly on her sister giving them light to work the doctor was there beside rutledge whats most urgently needed the head wound its bleeding heavily rebecca hadnt emerged from the car rutledge thought he could hear her teeth chattering over the sound of the engine head wounds generally do next right arm broken i think cuts and bruises i dont know about her back but she can feel pain all over she says a good thing he began to work slowly at first and then with greater assurance as he learned the extent of sarah parkinsons injuries he did what he could to brace the broken arm put bandaging over the head wound and then turned to rutledge shell be all right but i daresay theres concussion and shock is setting in we need to get her to hospital rutledge said theres a rug but his motorcar was gone he called to rebecca parkinson do you have a rug there yes i think he could hear her getting out now coming toward them is she alive her voice was under control but tense with stress shes all right he told rebecca and took the rug from her helping the doctor wrap sarah in it between them the two men carried her to the motorcar and lifted her into the rear seat it must have hurt like the very devil the doctor got in after her and made certain she was comfortable then he turned to rutledge andersons the name rutledge he nodded to rebecca ill drive all right ill direct you can we get around that lorry i think so thats the fastest way whats become of the driver is he dead he went for help anderson nodded then we neednt concern ourselves with him sarah regained consciousness several times complaining of feeling cold and hurting anderson reassured her but rebecca next to rut ledge didnt look back or answer her sister they drove into a mediumsize town where there was a hospital of sorts near the church it had anderson was telling him been a lying in hospital before the war and after that had been turned into a burn treatment center but most of the patients have been sent elsewhere now and the town has taken it over where are we salverton i need to find a telephone as soon as possible the lorry is still blocking the road yes of course the hotel just down that street should have one give me a moment to find someone with a stretcher then you can go rutledge stayed until sarah parkinson was in a room on the first floor nurses working over her with quiet efficiency rebecca still silent was with her no one noticed as he slipped quietly out and went to the stairs the clinic had been a bank in an earlier life rutledge thought noting the marble pillars in reception and the ornate staircase sweeping up to the first floor his footsteps echoed as he crossed to the door a nursing sister passing through nodded to him he found the hotel the white hart without any difficulty put in a call to uffington and after a time heard hills voice on the other end of the line rutledge gave the inspector a brief report and asked about the cottages we couldnt save the empty ones where the fire had been set inside we couldnt get enough water to them the rest the ones still occupied will be habitable wheres singleton i wish i knew i told you he left in my motorcar he wasnt injured in the crash not as far as i could tell surely you could have stopped him hills frustration came to the fore backed by anger i couldnt leave the woman he ran down but shell live you say it appears that way early days he saw again the doctors grave face as he examined the head wound and tested sarah parkinsons reflexes the next twentyfour hours will tell us where do you think singleton went where does he feel safe i dont know i expect hell abandon my motorcar as soon as possible and find other means of transport it could be a country bus or a train one that isnt crowded i should think we havent got enough men to watch train stations no hill said i delayed waiting to hear from london singleton wasnt cashiered from an indian regiment that was all a lie hed been in the regular army and was called up again in seems he killed another soldier on the transport ship to france used a knife then as well he was put in irons but somehow in the confusion when they docked he got away london thought he was still in france hiding in the south but he probably came home with the wounded and just walked off he must have thought brady recognized him and when you came nosing about he was sure you were searching for him well find your motorcar for you pray god we find singleton too rutledge walked back to the hospital he found rebecca sitting in the small waiting area down the passage from her sisters room someone had kindly brought her a cup of tea but she was holding it between her hands as if she didnt know what to do with it he sat down across from her waiting until she broke the silence i told you we quarreled i should have never let her go back on that bicycle but i was angry i thought she deserved to suffer too but not this i never imagined this there was no way you could its partly your fault you upset her more than you know she didnt kill our father leave her alone id come to the conclusion she hadnt i dont think its in her nature to kill are you saying its in mine she looked up at him holding his gaze challenging him i dont know you must tell me i havent killed anyone she said wearily at least not until tonight she wouldnt have been on that road if id kept her at pockets or even driven her home what did you quarrel about she wanted to go to yorkshire and bring home fathers body i was just as happy to leave him there to rot why did he die he waited and when she didnt answer he said look you might as well tell me what happened i know most of the story and can guess the rest of it she gave him a withering glance oh no you couldnt in your wildest dreams guess what happened to gerald parkinson i dont think any of us know a young nursing sister stuck her head round the door your sister is awake miss parkinson and asking for you rebecca got up and followed her rutledge after a moment went as well sarahs head was bandaged her face pale and by morning shed have a very black eye her arm was in a cast and she lay there trying to stand the pain they cant give me anything she said as her sister came into the room not until theyre sure about the concussion i cant tell you how much it hurts i feel sick with it im sorry sarah trulyi had no way of knowing this would happen i never meant for you to be hurt i thought i was going to die it was terrifying when the lorry struck the bicycle i was thrown through the air can you imagine watching yourself die and when i landed there was such pain i didnt expect to live but i did for a reason we might as well tell him becky i want to get it off my conscience at least but i cant say anything without your consent please will you let me tell him her eyes were pleading but dry as if shed already cried as much as she could rebecca answered her with a coldness that startled her sister i thought we swore on mamas memory i thought it was agreed sarah you sound like father youre as hard as he was rutledge stepped forward before rebecca could vehemently deny the charge theres a solution here i can take rebecca into custody and let the courts sort it out the publicity will be painful but that was your choice when you started all this go ahead rebecca told him defiantly sarah said we neither of us killed him you know he was dead when we found him rebecca opened her mouth to deny it but sarah went on relentlessly hed come to the house sometime in the night we found his motorcar there the next morning he hadnt been there in two years and we were horrified when we went through the house looking for him he was in mamas room lying on her bed and the room was filled with gas we shut it off opened windowsbut it was too late he was already dead and had been for several hours her sister turned on her heel and went out the door sarah watched her go and then said its all true ill swear to it under oath what happened next was awful we didnt want him to be found there not in mamas bed so between us we dragged him out of there and down the stairs she began to cry do you know what its like to move a dead man it was awful but we were angry with him and all we could think about was being rid of him it was rebeccas idea to drive him away from the house we got him into his motorcar found the opera cloak in the attic and wrapped him in it pulled his hat down over his face and set out i think we drove all day and part of the night by that time we were beginning to come to our senses but rebecca wouldnt take him back i couldnt bear to dump him at the side of the road i wouldnt have done that to a dog and then we saw the wood it seemed like a good idea and we managed to get him that far thats when i glimpsed the abbey just beyond the trees and i made her help me carry him there heavy as he was she wouldnt leave him in the nave it was holy ground and he didnt deserve it so we took him into the cloister and left him there and she put the gas mask on his face because she said it was his epitaph he could picture them the anger feeding on itself until they found the strength to do what had to be done as the anger faded a cold reality had set in but rebecca was still adamant he had to be punished sarah was saying when we got back to berkshire i waited by the side of the road in our motorcar while rebecca took his to the shed and left it as if he hadnt gone far and would be back soon i was so exhausted so anxious i began to cry and she told me i was not very brave but then i saw shed been crying as well and she swore it was because she hadnt killed him herself did you believe her of course i didi was there with her when we found him she couldnt have been so shocked if shed already known i saw her face it wasnt a lie for the first time there was a ring of truth behind her words why does rebecca hate your father so much she was older she saw more i dont know you must ask her sarah lay back against her pillows exhausted now its done over with i can sleep at night she closed her eyes for a time then said are you still there mr rutledge im here when i was hurtling through the air all i could think of was god let me live and ill make amends i swear i will it wasnt a bad bargain he stayed with her for some time asking that a few more details be cleared up but he couldnt catch her in a lie or a mistake afterward he found rebecca in the waiting room sitting there he thought like a martyr waiting to be led to the flames i have no regrets it was all she said no i expect not what had he done to you rebecca that you could hate so well id like to understand why a daughter could be as your sister just saidso cold she turned on him my mother lost a child when we were small i didnt know why she was ill only that she stayed in her room with the curtains drawn for week after week but then one day when id been a nuisance the housekeeper we had then mrs fortner told me what no one wanted us to know the child was born alive a boy and so badly deformed that no one could bear to look at him he died almost at once and it was a blessing my mother told my father it was because of all the things he did in the laboratorythat hed brought something home that maimed and killed their son and nothing was ever the same again she broke down alone and wretched and confused my mother was never the same either and when she killed herself she was holding the christening gown that was meant for my brother dont tell me it was long ago in the past she grieved for him until the day she died rutledge said he was born full term and died from natural causes there was nothing in the doctors report to say he was deformed ive read it but he was the housekeeper was there he remembered the words in the late dr butlers diary had long talk with parkinson explaining situation question about who should see to burial he left arrangements with me what had that long talk been about and why had parkinson slashed his hand in an angry moment in his lab hamish said it isna wise to tell the lass aboot that i think your mother grieved for her son and possibly even blamed your father for the childs death that much must be true but the housekeeper created a monster for reasons of her own she left shortly afterward with no notice given its likely your father discovered what shed told you rebecca said i never told sarah i never wanted her to know but i can remember the day and the words spilling out of the housekeepers mouth and her face leaning down to mine i remember feeling sick and not being able to eat my dinner there must have been some truth to the story or my father would have come to me and tried to explain that mrs fortner was lying he may not have known how to explain such cruelty he could have told himself youd forget in time remember your father had suffered a great loss too he couldnt have been himself after a moment she got slowly to her feet i must talk to sarah rutledge caught her arm to stop her you dont intend to tell her this do you it would serve no purpose now no never i couldnt bear her to know she left the room rutledge went to find transportation back to uffington that done he put in a call to the yard hamish said how can ye be sure it was suicide and not murder because rutledge said it explains rebeccas behavior thats why she was ready to humiliate a dead man because he wasnt there to hate any more if he came back to partridge fields to be buried in a churchyard like a decent man then it was over hed won to be abandoned in yorkshire was to leave him outside gods grace so to speak he said goodbye to rebecca sarah was resting and didnt answer as he stepped briefly into the room but rebecca raised haunted eyes to his then his driver was at the door and rutledge left by the time he reached the inn it was early morning and hill had left a message for him your motorcar is in oxford my sergeant will drive you there as for singleton he was caught in the train station as youd expected its finished rutledge arrived in london and went to his flat to change his clothes his first duty he knew was to go to the yard and report after that he would find frances and talk to her about simon barrington he knew his sister all she needed was to be told simon hadnt deserted her shed be able to cope after that the yard was bustling the passages crowded he asked inspector peterson as they met turning a corner what was happening and peterson said theres been a murder in kensington its taken most of our manpower to cover the ground on top of everything else on our plate old bowles is in a foul mood walk clear of him if you can rutledge took the warning to heart but there was no avoiding the upcoming meeting chief superintendent bowles lived by the philosophy rock everyones boat but mine only it wasnt working today hed been called on the carpet for lack of progress still he sat there and listened to what rutledge had to say about berkshire then nodded its been a bugger here everything at sixes and sevens i want you ready to help chief inspector johns with kensington there was to be no respite then rutledge said ill do my best see that you do bowles went back to the letter hed been reading when rutledge had knocked rutledge took that as his dismissal but bowles stopped him at the door as he was about to open it i explained matters to martin deloran after your preliminary report from salverton whoever he may be when hes at home delorans a nasty piece of work this letter came an hour ago here read it rutledge took the letter from bowles and scanned it quickly then read it more slowly martin deloran was a bad enemy the letter said it has come to my attention that inspector rutledge is being considered for advancement to chief inspector my recommendation is that he is not ready for greater responsibility his handling of the recent affair in berkshire showed a lack of understanding of the facts and a grievous failure to follow instructions the feeling in certain quarters is that inspector rutledge has not earned promotion at this time rutledge looked at bowles you know none of this is true i dont care if its true or not im not going to fight him or ill be brought down with you ive told him that you went to berkshire against my advice and i wash my hands of you you told me that the yard doesnt take orders that murder was murder wherever it occurs so i did it was a mistaken belief youll take your medicine like a man and not cause more trouble thats an order rutledge stood there hearing what bowles was saying if you think deloran is a bad enemy drag me into this and youll discover what kind of enemy i can be rutledge took his time replying i understand he said and left the room this time bowles didnt stop him from going he walked out of the yard and debated bearding deloran in his den but it was no use he went back to his flat the mail had arrived in his absence and he looked through it quickly before dropping it on the table by the door and then he went back again to the large manila envelope that hed glanced at and passed over the return address was slater andrew tomlin cottages uffington berkshire he turned it over in his hands several times before opening it hamish said ye ken he tried to tell you and i ignored him rutledge answered he set the packet on his desk and went into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea then changed his mind and came back to take it up again inside there was no letter of explanation only a sheaf of paper that miss chandler had taken such pride in typing rutledge read through it following the chemistry as best he could here was parkinsons new discovery with the admission that he hadnt completely worked out the formula to his satisfaction another gas this one deadlier than anything used in the war rutledge saw rebecca parkinsons face and then thought about delorans retribution for defiance by rights these pages should go to deloran for some reason parkinson hadnt delivered them himself because of his wifes suicide two years ago instead hed had them typed then had deliberately given them to slater to keep for him where brady couldnt find them and slater had kept them faithfully until he knew for certain that partridge was dead then he had passed them on to the only person he trusted hamish said hell be pleased will deloran yell be given your promotion after all rutledge considered that still holding the pages he went into the kitchen struck a match and over the sink burned them to ash parkinson knew what was in these sheets and still hed withheld them it was enough for rutledge hamish said that was no wise it isnt a matter of wisdom he watched the ash cool and turn graywhite or spite ive killed enough men to last me a lifetime
