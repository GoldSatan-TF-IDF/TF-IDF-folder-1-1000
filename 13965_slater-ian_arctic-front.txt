ian slater arctic front prologue at least four republics have said they will leave the command structure of the soviet army and form their own armies the economist october nowadays it is not only misleading but also wrong to view russia and the soviet union as one political entity districts like the irkutsk regions of siberia have adopted declarations of equality and independence time magazine november in july col gen nikolai chervov announced that the soviet army had tanks in europe with the conventional forces in europe treaty signed in november there were hopes that a significant fraction of these tanks would be dismantled data released by the soviets on november indicate that there are now only soviet tanks in europe where did all the other tanks go after stonewalling the newly aggressive soviet press for two months regarding the mystery the ministry of defense information administration finally offered to clarify the situation for the paper sovetskaya rossiya officials claimed that in excess of tanks were moved beyond the urals prior to signing the treaty document about tanks from europe were handed over to soviet units in asia either to bring them up to strength or to replace old tanks a further tanks were placed into storage bases in western siberia or central asia armed forces journal international march chapter one general chernko was a big man his body hiding hers as he showed her the room she had been chosen by chernkos subaltern purely at random despite the severe rationing she had the kind of full figure accentuated by the dark red dress she was wearing that the major knew general chernko liked kapitalnye titki prominent breasts as the general would say something to hang onto dont undress chernko ordered her and for a second the terror in the womans eyes harbored a faint hope dashed by his next words well have to hurry he told her as if she had any choice in the matter soon the americansll be here as he pulled the drapes closed she glimpsed the kremlin directly across the square still burning even the goshawks traditional guardians of the kremlins snowcapped towers were fleeing the shellpocked citadel leaving the supreme soviet to the crows the russian surrender to the legendary american general douglas freeman having been signed at minsk by marshal kirov though the allied troops had not yet reached moscow proper thousands of red fires smoking sullenly amid the blackstained snow marked the end for the city chernko chief of the committee for public safety the kgb and now interim president of the ussr following president suzlovs death could smell the sickly sweet odor of cooked flesh and the acrid fumes of burning diesel rising from the gutted ts in the citys outer rings the smoke bleeding darkly into the still cold blue air normally the sight of dead bodies didnt bother him hed had thousands of people executed in the course of the war for unsoviet activity and had carried out many of the executions himself but now the sight of stiff bloated bodies in the frigid dawn brought his own mortality closer had it been possible he would have ordered the corpses buried in a mass grave but the frozen ground was too hard for burial except in the craters left by the allied bombing and the mass concentrated fire of the american millimeter howitzers that had reduced much of the city to rubble it was am and chernko knew it could not be long before freemans advance armored columns with battle honors earned from korea to vietnam to the iraqi desert reached the inner city to occupy the kremlin which now lay smoldering across from his office in dzerzhinsky square with president suzlov dead chernko thought it possible the allies might well use him as theyd used the nazis in world war ii to run the huge complex government apparatus until they learned the ropes themselves or they might shoot him on the spot he glanced impatiently at his watch it was major wheres the car he was anxious to reach the new headquarters bunker in the outer ring communications here at the dzerzhinsky square offices were unreliable because of the artillerysevered underground cables any messages he wanted to send would have to be delivered by dispatch riders cars on its way comrade director replied the major not yet used to calling chernko mr president the supreme soviet military command stavka had backed chernko when he had personally shot president suzlov when the latter had issued the idiotic command to fight to the last russian but chernko knew that while his action might have been supported by his russian colleagues it might not be so well received in the other republics everything was in flux with all the debris the major explained your car will probably have to make a detour around the majors words were drowned out by a tremendous crash the tower above the kremlins spassky gate telescoping into itself crumbling amid flames shooting so high they threw the citadels rustred walls into a stark dancing relief for chernko the collapse of the tower was ironically like a shot of adrenaline injecting him with an overwhelming urge to live come here he ordered the woman she didnt utter a sound didnt look away for to anger him would mean death for her family as well as for herself she had never seen chernko before except in photographs already she was trembling trying to be brave at least she thought beria stalins kgb henchman had gone out himself to prowl the streets for women but chernko no doubt considered himself above that he sent underlings his major she could smell the expensive cologne on chernko no doubt purchased at one of the partys elite stores in the end gorbachev and yeltsin had changed nothing the powerful were always the powerful what could you do but submit he opened his greatcoat take that scarf off he commanded her you look like a peasant he sat down told her to kneel in front of him and tore open her gray prison blouse reaching forward roughly pushing down her calico bra beneath her breasts now she was aware of another smell his mixed up with the cologne if you bite he said matteroffactly sitting back in his doeskin recliner ill kill you understand before she could answer he unzipped his trousers slowly at first he instructed her go on she did it as she and so many others had done so many other things for the chairman of the committee of public safety and his thugs who called themselves the kgb soon chernko was grunting like a pig leaning forward on the edge of his chair pulling and pushing her head until suddenly he seized her breasts so violently she gasped with pain he shuddered pushed her away and then backing up in the chair its rollers going off the heavy protective plastic that onto the carpet he shot her far enough away that no stains would get on his greatcoat careful to use a us ninemillimeter parabellum load for his makarov pistol in the unlikely event anyone would find her despite the physical release the woman had given him chernko was still anxious he had learned from his agents in novosibirsk that his name was on an official sibirskie predatelisiberian traitorslist for his part in moscows decision to surrender he decided it was time to take out some insurance but he was under no illusion his down payment to the siberians would have to be something spectacular the biggest secret of all an offer that as american gangsters would say the siberians couldnt refuse a plan that was certain to mollify novosibirsk and protect him from the siberian vengeance against those who had authorized the russian surrender a plan that would also wreak havoc with america it was at that moment that a dispatch rider his arm bleeding grimy uniform smudged with oil smoke arrived and handed chernko two messages from the new army hq in the outer ring the first message from the siberian capital city of novosibirsk seventeen hundred miles to the east beyond the natural barrier of the ural mountains was short and to the point if moscow had surrendered siberia hadnt furthermore it had no intention of doing so why should it asked the siberian central committee in novosibirsk traditionally when siberians speaking podusham from the heartspat out their contempt for the west they meant moscow which they distrusted as much as they did the us now the greatest collection of scientific minds in all the russias those of the siberian mozgovity eggheadcity of akademgorodok just outside novosibirsk along with the tartars and the twentynine other indigenous groups that made up the millions of siberyaka feared that with the mideast oil fields in a shambles from the war and still burning the us and particularly its resourcestarved ally japan would take up where moscow left off sucking siberia dry of her enormous natural wealth more than one and a half times the size of the entire united states including alaska and hawaii stretching for four thousand miles through nine time zones from the urals in the west through the spacelaunch stations on the steppes to the icbmstudded granite fastness of kamchatka peninsula siberias natural and industrial might and now its own army would be more than a match for the allies from its mountains endless taiga across its endless steppes to the deep gorges of its twothousandmilelong river systems siberia harbored vast reserves of oil iron ore gold coal timber diamonds and hosts of other strategic minerals as well as the worlds largest natural gas field at novyy urengoy adjacent to the kara sea the second message handed chernko from his kgb chief in novokuznetsk a siberian industrial center miles east of novosibirsk was the one hed been waiting for it contained the details of a plan conceived by the directors of the citys giant kuznetsky metallurgical kombinat or kmk works the conception was so daring in chernkos opinion he was sure he could trade it for a promise from novosibirsk not only to protect him from siberian extremists but to afford him albeit secretly a leading role in the siberian wartime government and assure his future after the siberian victory the plan from the kmk was chernko confessed to the major nothing less than blestyashchiystunning it would at first maul then consume the americans if they dared attack sibir chapter two to err is human to forgive is not first army policy so read the shingle above gen douglas freemans headquarters in minsk which his aides were now in the process of taking down and packing for shipment back to the states freeman was a fighting general of this the pentagon the president and the allied liaison commission in washington had not the slightest doubt at fiftyfive he was the youngest fourstar general in the us army but not as the state department emphatically advised the white house diplomatic material his abilities foggy bottom pointed out lay in action not in the delicate business of helping russia back on its feet the advisory memorandum from state quoted an interview that freeman had in states view illadvisedly given the armed forces journal four months before in europe freeman had declared unequivocally that nobody seems awake to the fact that even in gorbachevs day the soviet military had expanded by getting rid of obsolete equipment and making it look as if it was reducing its forces that in fact there were more mobile missile sites built during gorbachevs tenure than by any other soviet leader since the russian revolution which freeman had gone on to say just as unequivocally proves a sound military axiom that you cannot trust any commie son of a bitch as far as you can kick im and that what the american people have to understand is that when you get right down to it regardless of changing civilian leaders its the soviet military with which we will ultimately have to contend the joint chiefs of staff albeit reluctantly agreed with state yet they knew it would be unpopular in middle america to recall the general and with such haste it would be especially unpopular with the troops freeman had led on his nowlegendary nighttime airborne raid on pyongyang in north korea whose leader he called kim ii runt and with those hed led in an equally spectacular outflanking movement on europes northern plain breaking out of the dortmundbielefeld pocket his armored columns racing ahead and breaching moscows defenses he was however too brusque for washington a soldiers soldier so that the joint chiefs of staff felt they had no alternative than to agree with state in advising the president that it would be much safer for everyone to recall freeman to leave the peace to the experts at am the first car a handtooled zil limousine weaved its way through the rabblestrewn snow and drew up in front of dzerzhinsky square the two kgb door guards snapping to attention despite their weariness a group of blearyeyed and emaciatedlooking army officers walking or rather shuffling up from the old intourist hotel through the ruins of marx prospect slowed to stare across the square they managed to see two figures in civilian coats entering the zil the grayuniformed chauffeur quickly checking the limousines side mirror and the car moving off quickly yet quietly in the snow several of the young army officers saluted but werent sure whether it was the new president or not behind the black curtains seconds later a battered white moskvich taxi a fourdoor compact swung into the curb and the officers across the square saw another figure also in civilian garb emerge from the old kgb building the two guards coming to attention just as they had done for the zil inside the zil chernkos aide tried to hide his surprise having expected chernko to wait and board the battered moskvich decoy rather than following him into the highly visible zil the major said nothing busying himself dialling the patrul flying squad the special motorcycleandcar security unit that was to be less than a minute away from the director at all times on occasion however particularly during the shelling theyd taken as long as ten minutes immediate demotion followed the major checked the squads position against his watch the moment the unit answered his phone call he glanced across at chernko theyre where they should be comrade director i mean mr president the kgb boss said nothing the driver was busy finding his way through the body and rubblestrewn ordynika street south through red square onto gorky street a surprising amount of soviet bmd armored personnel carriers were evident following the surrender all strangely quiet on the hardpacked snow chernko pressed the driver intercom button on his plush leather armrest well go up gertsen he instructed the chauffeur around by the us acanada institute whats left of it yes sir answered the chauffeur and the limousine weaved through manege square past the alert military policeman who had stopped all traffic the moment hed seen the zil in the outside vip lane the car turned right on gertsen the major was always tense at such moments with chernko you never knew the directors passion for security verged on the paranoid a reflection of the fact that he himself had sent so many assassins abroad to hunt others and there had always been the danger of siberian separatists long agitating for autonomy from moscow to run their own federation never varying your routine chernko knew was the biggest single mistake hence his proverki spot checks as he called them on his flying squad despite the inconvenience it caused his own timetable the major had to concede that such precautions were part of the reason chernko was still alive to be chief of first and second directorate and now president an old babushka a grandmother head wrapped against the cold by the traditional black scarf slipped on the icy sidewalk the stroller she was pushing rolling out onto the road the driver braked hard and both chernko and the major were jerked forward restrained only by their seat belts the driver instinctively slammed the car into a sliding reverseturn but it was too late by then the flying squad had the road blocked behind and in front of the zil the gray figures of the squad emerging ghostlike surrounding the limousine there were no harsh words from chernko to the driver but the latter immediately knew he would be punished and at a time when he and his family would desperately need what few perks remained for the driver of the most powerful man in the soviet union the driver normally a strong man was reduced to a quivering jelly looking back pleadingly whey faced at chernko he was crying im sorry comrade director comrade president i vladimir said chernko nodding at the two flying squad members holding the driver to release him it was only natural but i should have known comrade remembered my training yes said chernko sitting back in the plush afghan leather you should have it could have been a siberian eh the man wanted to speak again but couldnt find words a small bedraggled crowd of refugees was gathering plainclothes kgb men quickly brusquely ordered them away chernko knew news of the incident would spread quickly as he intended it should and then for a while at least everyone on security would be on special alert and he would be safe long enough to make his deal gain his insurance policy with novosibirsk full circle eh he said to the major i dont understand comrade president insurance major our kgb building in dzerzhinsky square was once an insurance building fitting dont you think as one of the security team took over as driver and the babushka an agent in her early thirties folded up the stroller the zil moved off back along the long bedraggled line of people who since the war had started continued to line up day after day all the way down past the alexander garden toward lenins mausoleum not to pay homage to the founder of the revolution but to receive their daily ration of sawdust bread already fights were breaking out in the line and chernko sat grimfaced staring ahead the very idea let alone the sight of any disorder was deeply disturbing to him not only did it signify the end of the long reign of the revolution but if he could not protect himself he would lose all rank all privilege and be cast among them now major chernko said with renewed urgency to the new headquarters to transmit my proposal to novosibirsk he meant to the kgb shelter at their new hq in the outer ring before the americans reach us comrade president if i might mention something i heard at the officers yes chernko said curtly the plan you have to offer the siberians the major hesitated is it exwar minister marchenkos plan you are borrowing borrow i didnt borrow any such idea major of course put in the major quickly i didnt mean to imply i stole it said chernko srazmakhom holusbolus he turned his steely blue eyes boring into his aidewhat does it matter where our strategy where our tactics come from the trouble with you major is youre a child of gorbachev in the revolution and now in this war theres no room for that sentimental bourgeois tripe about taking somebody elses ideasomebody elses property we are the sword and shield of the statethat is all that matters the point is to deliver the blow wherever we see the opportunity present itself a blow said the major nonplussed when we have surrendered weve surrendered siberia has not if siberia were to defeat the americans chernko paused what is it the americans say major its not over until its over they were approaching the kgb bunker as soon as we arrive chernko instructed the major i want you to send up the file yes sir but the major sounded distinctly apprehensive dont worry chernko assured him the presidents mood now buoyant in a month well be watching news reports of the americans reeling while were eating their rations i call that sweet revenge major and no matter what the siberians think of us theyll be grateful for the plan the weapon im about to give them theyre not stupid theyll want it spread around that anyone who helps them against the americans will be rewarded if my plan works the americans will be sent packing for the it will mean full membership in novosibirsks central committee you to full colonel perhaps general with all the benefits of rank in the postwar siberian forces would that be satisfactory comrade very replied the major knowing generalship would at the very least rate a chauffeur and access to the partys special stores chernko of course would probably get yet another dacha out of it a few more and he could start a hotel chain after the warafter the american army had been chopped up piecemeal and swallowed by the vast winter that was called siberia gen douglas freeman alighted from his military transport plane at monterey airport at pm his impending arrival unannounced to the press by the pentagon in any event his departure from washington had been deliberately delayed at the last minute by the pentagon so that his arrival on the west coast would be too late for the new york networks evening news this would minimize the pentagon hoped any damage freeman might do in an open press conference should he be asked any questions about the russians now that the brief if intense applause for him in the new york parade had died the ticker tape swept away freeman didnt expect a heros welcome on the west coast america was demobilizing much faster than it had mobilized anxious to get on with enjoying the fruits of a hardwon victory racing to put the war behind it as the generals car pennant furled headed south on highway the bloodstreaked sun was sinking beneath the sharp black line of the sea freeman wondered aloud to his driver how quickly she thought the feats of first army would be forgotten the trim driver blond hair swept back in a bun was watching the road too intently to really think much about the generals question and said she didnt know normally the khaki chevrolet would have been flanked by four mp outriders but the general ostentatious enough when it suited first armys purposes had set a frugal example throughout the war insisting on stringent conservation measures regarding the use of gasoline now that the middle east fields were once again in ruin freeman caught a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror and was momentarily lost to the contemplation of whether or not he should stay in the army at fiftyfive he was hardly old even in a modern youthoriented hightech military nevertheless he and everyone else knew he was being put out to pasture what made it worse was that he understood the pentagons decision damn them they were right he was a warrior he had the spittle for battle but not for peace he recalled the memo to the white house from the british liaison officer in washington brigadier soames who had advised the president that london like the us state department considered freeman a tad too hobbesian superior son of a bitch muttered freeman probably figured his memo wouldnt be understood by anyone who hadnt gone up to oxford and read philosophy well freeman had told his boss general of the us army james grey ive read my hobbes and my bugs bunny i know what that limey son of a bitch means general hes claiming i see mans natural condition as one of war now douglas grey had told him dont go getting yourself all riled up well freeman had replied pulling on his leather gloves tighter flexing his fist limey bastards right i do peace is war by other means general when you cut through the thin veneer of civilization only thing that keeps the goddamn yahoos from running this world is strength of arms question is whose arms ours or some commie son of a bitch whod take whatever freedom the irs has left us lord didnt we learn anything from what happened to gorbachev while every tom dick and jane fonda in the west were going gaga over gorby all those marxistleninist pals of his were just going along for the ride till he fell ill then by god look what we got suzlov and now chernko and his pals same old gang remember general we all wanted peace the british lion sheathed her claws the american eagle clipped talons and beak and the russian bear why he was just so darned happy about it he hugged em both to death go home douglas grey had told him enjoy your ocean view youve done yourself and first army proud the countrys grateful you ever doubt that look at those rows of decorations you have from every corner of the world but youre smart enough to know that the peace whether its another form of war or not douglas will be fought in board rooms and with diplomacy god help us the brigadiers right douglas its not your cup of tea freeman grimaced even though he knew they were right the very thought of sitting in the bleachers while other players took the field and the glory was anathema to him he knew it was pridepride right through as he remembered henry the eighth had said of cardinal wolsey but douglas freeman saw his pride as a godgiven hubrisas natural as salt in the blood as undeniable as the steel blue of his eyes and his graying hair it was the fuel that drove his consuming ambition to be the greatest commander in the history of the united states in the history of the world an ambition that had burned fiercely within him as a boy long before his first glimpse of the plain at west point intellectually politically he understood washington was correct to recall him now the battle was over and peace secured but in his heart the tunes of glory would always call the snare drums roll the sweetest music he remembered watching apocalypse now at the armored school at fort hood to which he and other officers had returned fresh from their victories in the iraqi war the gungho colonel in the film had confidently whipped away the yellow cravat of the air cavalry from his throat and hands on nips announced to a terrified subaltern i love the smell of napalm in the morning everyone in the theater had laughed derisively everyone except freeman he didnt like the smell of napalm in the morning or any other time it plugged his sinuses but he knew what that colonel had meant what he felt he too loved the smell the sting of battle that shot adrenaline to his chest only then did he feel fully alive some men he knew were born with the same feeling and spent their lives hypocritically denying it in deference to the civilized world but freeman made no apology believing his destiny his responsibility was to put it to good purpose to preserve the civilized world to defend his america against all those who sought to destroy her yet now his career having finally rounded the corner heading into the straight as his father would have said the race was suddenly over his purpose fulfilled in the clash of armor around minsk and moscow that had brought the russian surrender suddenly he was adrift his past glory flat as the twilight sea glory was like sex he mused having just had it you felt youd never need it again then an hour later outside his fogshrouded house on the monterey beachfront a bungalow design with a sixfoothigh chocolatebrown fence running around it to ward off the encroaching dune grass a crowd of wellwishers had gathered one of the signs read welcome home general freeman another freedoms freeman instead of her usual gradual braking the corporal was forced to hit the brakes hard as the crowd surged forward unexpectedly revealing a long yellow tape which at first she had thought was a yellow ribbon of remembrance she now saw it ran clear around the house freeman could smell the fresh tang of the sea three army humvees were parked about ten yards apart right of the crowd by the curb one of the vehicles sprouting its caliber machine gun on a swivel mount immediately behind the sixman cabin a california highway patrolman in khaki cap and uniform and one of the mps from the humvees looked as if they were arguing left of them a man in white shorts and tshirt his left hand on the lip of the curb which was overrun by dune grass lay sprawled in the gutter the white shorts were red with blood now freeman saw more policemen pushing the crowd back as the man was photographed from different angles for a second the general thought he saw his wife doreen in the crowd but it was difficult to tell with so many people a hundred or more milling and flowing about the house a man in jeans and wildly colored hawaiian shirt tried to duck under the yellow tape near the curb holding up a newspaper with a picture of freeman at the surrender ceremony at minsk a patrolman pushed him back behind the tape so much for crowd control corporal joked freeman yes sir whether it was the sight of the army humvees or the strange excitement of the crowd that tensed up his lumbar muscles freeman didnt know but it hurt like hell and for a moment he was back in the dortmundbielefeld pocket just after hed given the order for the breakout the end run that had outflanked the enemy and ultimately brought chernko and his stavka to its knees after leaving his headquarters near munster the concussion from a millimeter soviet shell had knocked his humvee right off the road lifting the vehicle and flinging it into a ditch his back took most of the impact against the humvees steering column and the drivers steel helmet the pain was still with him and bone deep determined not to show signs of what doctors insisted on calling discomfort to make themselves feel better freeman hauled himself quickly out of the chevrolet asking the corporal to answer the cars cellular phone that was bipping annoyingly in the back as freeman alighted it was a small detail opening the door himself but the kind that newspapers hungry for copy used to define what they called the handson nononsense freeman style the reporters didnt realize that the general opening the door for himself was more a sign of his impatience to get things done than it was disdain for ceremony as he emerged from the car the fog lifted the suns dying rays catching the edge of his decorations strips the blueredblue of his silver star vibrant in the fading light chapter three following the kremlins surrender president mayne thought he had finished with the white houses subterranean simulation room now two floors below his oval office he found himself once again walking past the marine guards into the bunker its fluorescent light oppressive as usual illuminating the huge map stand with its clusters of blue and red pins showing the disposition of allied and russian forces at the moment of moscows unconditional capitulation glancing at the alert board however he saw thered been a change all allied forces had been placed in defcon ii attack believed imminent press aide trainor who had been normally gungho even in the worst moments of the war looked drained as pale as the bluish white light the silence among the joint chiefs of staff and allied liaison officers was deafening trainor handed the president the message it was from saceur supreme allied commander europe lieut gen william merton and read autonomous siberian republic has disregarded moscows surrender novosibirsk has issued orders for all siberian armies to resist angloamericaneuropean aggression against the motherland we are now facing forty siberian divisions along sinosoviet border plus tvd air forces commanded out of khabarovsk and entire soviet pacific fleet egressing vladivostok our forward units one hundred miles east of moscow already under attack by elements of west siberian second and fourth jesus christ it was the first time trainor had heard the president blaspheme and despite trainors secularity it made him wince wheres the rest of the message asked president mayne looking up at trainor and the joint chiefs of staff satellite communications were cut mr president answered trainor or rather jammed by the siberians god almighty said mayne looking down again at the message in disbelief brigadier soames britains europeanus liaison officer cleared his throat politely londons received the same response mr president advised soames looks rather sticky im afraid but your chap merton is in error regarding the siberian divisions there arent forty well thank god for that said the president the brigadier looked around untypically nonplussed glancing for help at the chiefs of staff but found he was on his own im sorry mr president but what i mean is that there arent forty divisions its fiftyseven to be exact with ah four mongolian divisions in reserve around lake baikal president mayne sat down the message dangling from his left hand his right unconsciously massaging his temple what the hells happened i mean these divisions must be reservists army chief of staff grey shook his head afraid not mr president the siberian divisions have a combat afghanistantrained cadre of officers and ncos crack divisions trained for a sinosoviet conflict moscow used to be more scared of china than nato trouble is its not only the number of siberian armies were faced with the place is so damn big westernmost border of siberia doesnt even start till you get a thousand miles east beyond moscow then it goes on for more than three and a half thousand miles to the pacific and despite popular misconception it has as varied a topography as the us far as the siberians are concerned moscows in another country looking at the map mayne saw the siberian divisions were stretched out from siberias east cape then inland behind the mountainous kamchatka peninsula all the way down to vladivostok and the manchurian border a dark red cluster showing enemy surface vessels and submarines off the coast around vladivostok and nakhodka thought we gave their pacific fleet a bloody nose off north japan he asked chief of naval operations admiral horton elements of the pacific fleet yes mr president answered the cno but the hemorrhaging stopped apparently their air forces mayne asked air force chief allet fifteen hundred tactical aircraft including mig e fighters and backfire bombers the fulcrums mig es are faster and more maneuverable than our fs to qualify for siberian station you have to have had combat experience in western europe only the best mr president general allet indicated airfields far to the northeast near siberias east cape they clearly dont intend letting us get across the bering strait from alaska the president was shaking his head the vastness of the new threat had descended like sheet lightning upon what until only moments ago had been the promising dawn of the russian surrender blindsided by siberia the essence of the awful allied blunder the assumption that all the soviets would automatically follow moscows decree it was so obvious now that mayne wondered why they hadnt thought of it before the only comparable miscalculation he could think of was the cias confident report several months before the shah of irans fall that no such overthrow was in the offing but men the more he thought about it the more he understood how the seed of the blunder had taken root for he too had always lumped soviets and russians together oh yes hed known how dissident the baltic republics were and some of the asian republics but siberia so far from moscow a place where moscow sent dissidents had never been thought of as a separate entity but now the full impact of the differences between the two russian republics the united soviet socialist republics and the newly declared united siberian soviet republics hit him as the cia overlay each color representing a different ethnic group in the mix that was the siberyaka covered the huge expanse of siberia which in turn overlaid the map of the americas on the same scale completely obscuring the us the region of the yakut alone was three times the size of texas the other siberian regions the tartar kalmyk komi bashykur and the karelian autonomous republic were all united in their common determination with novosibirsk not to surrender wont they deal asked the president why should they proffered the brigadier realizing at once that hed overstepped the line of deference accorded the president of the american republic with all due respect mr president our allied forces in and around moscow are by all accounts battle weary quite simply worn out our supply lines through western europe are overextended to say the least soames glanced at the american joint chiefs of staff their glum faces evidence enough that they agreed then he turned back to address mayne holding moscow might seem a compelling victory to the general public in the west sir but he turned toward the map his hand making a small arc across the expanse of siberia capturing moscow im afraid is nothing geographically or strategically speaking and now it seems not even politically our troops have as general grey pointed out another thousand miles to go before they even reach the urals the western border of siberia then theres the rest almost four thousand miles of mountains taiga rivers and plains deep in snow thrown in for good measure theyve got the ural mountains on their western flank and the more mountainous kamchatka peninsula on the east they could give away half of it and wed still be in enormous difficulty no sir im afraid the siberian chiefs of staff in novosibirsk have thought this one out rather carefully its a very sticky wicket indeed the president frowned not because he didnt know what sticky wicket meant the tone conveyed all the meaning he needed but because the englishman was right what in hell could the allies do sticky wicket means being between a rock and a hard began trainor i know what it means snapped the president what i want someone to tell the is what in hell are we going to do about this mess he looked up at his cno the chief of naval operations admiral horton can we bracket them with our boomers dick he meant the allies icbm submarines already have sir the trident subs can drop an icbm on them anywhere but they can do the same to us even without their subs most of their icbm sites are now in siberia especially on the eastern flank down kamchatka peninsula it would mean allout nuclear war and one thing the russians including the siberians were always ahead of us in mr president is civil defense for such an eventuality wed come out much worse than they would yes yes i know that a nuclear strikes no option next he turned to the army chief of staff sir said general grey brigadier soames is correct in his estimation weve shot our wad for the time being in and around moscow itd be another two months at the very least before we could muster enough men even to attack the urals with any hope of breaking through best we can hope for there is to keep it at a stalemate what about their eastern flank shot back the president if we could get enough men across the bering strait fast perhaps but theres still kamchatka peninsula further south its heavily garrisoned and now it looks as if the whole coast from the east cape all the way south to vladivostok is also well protected theyve even got soviet forces on the kuril islands running down from kamchatka case the japanese move to reclaim the islands they lost in the second world war but either way wed have to get men across the strait take command of their east cape airfields once we did that we could hit them further south without constantly worrying about their east cape planes how about our air force cut in the president general allet can you secure air cover over the bering strait so that we can get our boys across to their east cape secure a beachhead what is it across there only fifty miles or so from alaska fiftytwo miles sir well then sir before we could move anybody across there wed have to have air supremacy wed have to take out the aa missile batteries sam sites and the like on big diomede its shallow around there some places no more than twenty fathoms not deep enough for our subs big diomede asked the president largest of two islands sir little diomede ours is the smallest on our side of the international date line big diomede is theirs high and solid rock locked in by ice and covered in snow this time of year its a fortress five miles long oneandahalf to two miles wide with deeply recessed and superhardened aa missile and aa gun battery defenses theyve also got half a dozen longrange naval guns in place that can shell alaskas cape prince of wales our staging area for any invasion you telling the that they can shell us from over twenty miles away admiral horton looked surprised that the president didnt know this theyve had the longbarrelled gun got it from south africa after that canadian inventor bull sold it to iraq and never mind the history lesson cut in mayne i want to know what the hell were going to do if the air force cant guarantee it can take out this big diomede can we try naval bombardment too much ice for the battle wagons to get within range said the cno but we can try carrierborne aircraft from further south then get ready to try dick and while youre doing that i want you he turned to general grey to send this to the siberians and all allied commands as he began writing the message he asked our k satellite still operational far as i know mr president but with all that snow in siberia and the siberians camouflage its going to be difficult even for our satellite to pinpoint their positions maybe so general said president mayne his writing hand moving with singular determination but i have a hunch the siberians might just be bluffing i dont mean about what theyve got to throw at us but whether this central committee or whatever it is in novosibirsk has really been able to break free of moscows political arm the president depressed the tip of his ballpoint adroitly slipping it inside his suit jacket has it occurred to you gentlemen that we might be getting all steamed up for nothing anyway he handed the message to general grey thisll answer that the presidents message to the novosibirsk central siberian command read you have twentyfour hours in which to surrender all your forces to allied command if you have not done so by tomorrow washington time the allied armies will reengage with maximum force mr president asked general grey you think there might be some confusion about what we mean by maximum force the president smiled yes thats for them to figure out jimmy he turned to air force general allet bill i want covers off at least a dozen midwest and just in case the siberians arent getting any satellite readings of their own have our k photographs of our mx silos when their lids are off beamed down to siberian air space put them clearly in the picture brigadier soames felt it his duty to voice his skepticismmr president i really dont think the siberians would have gone on the offensive against our troops in the urals in the western sector if they didnt think they could win this thing and if we use nuclear weapons no one wins i dont think theyre bluffing mr president i didnt want to unduly depress anyone but my aide informs the that im also incorrect in my estimate of how many divisions the siberians have at hand it is in fact in excess of sixtyfive thats well over a million and a yes yes i know brigadier but threatening to use the mx doesnt mean we have to our bluff could work they might just cave in when they see our determination i beg to differ sir i think well lets give it the old college try shall we brigadier by all means sir by all means just as press secretary trainor had never heard the president take as mayne would have put it the lords name in vain neither had he heard the president use shall we before the president he thought had handled the brigadier and thus in effect the joint allied high commands anticipated criticism rather well shall we had just the right tone to it one of confident authority unbowed by the frightening possibility of having to confront more man sixty fresh highly trained siberian divisions twice the total number of us divisions perhaps the president was right maybe the siberian colossus had not shucked off the long political reach of moscow and would think twice about it seeing the missiles standing proudthat is their warheads above the silo openings perhaps the siberians would blink the presidents message was transmitted in plain language so that all the siberian forces would be aware of it a smart move trainor acknowledged in that there might have been some siberian units reluctant to go along with novosibirsks decision to attack the allied forces east of moscow though he didnt know it trainor was right there had been such resistance notably in the person of vladimir cherlak the general commanding the siberian third motorized rifle division at tyumen halfway between novosibirsk and moscow though no friend of president chernko cherlak like so many senior russian officers had attended the frunze military academy using this tenuous connection with chernko to maximum effect cherlak stated flatly that he had no intention of disobeying moscows directive to surrender novosibirsks central committee said it respected his loyalty to moscow but appealed to cherlak to place his responsibility to the united siberian soviet republics above any personal loyalty to a defeated moscow cherlak replied that his hesitancy to throw in his lot with novosibirsk was not merely a matter of personal loyalty but one stemming from the oath he had taken to the russian federation which chernko now headed novosibirsk decided there were only two ways of dealing with cherlak shoot him as an example to any other undecided officers or show him chernkos plan they sent an emissary to tyumen cherlak was notoriously selfcentered some said he was so full of himself he must think himself a czar but he knew when he had met his match and upon seeing chernkos plan was unabashedly awed its brilliant he conceded tell novosibirsk the third motorized is with them chapter four as freeman walked toward his house the wind cold for monterey carried with it the invigorating tang of sea air mixed with the oppressive smell of a highsulfurcontent oil the lower grade of crude still being rationed for civilian use while consumer and antipollution groups pressed hard for the less sulfurous grades previously reserved for the military to be released for the domestic market now that the war was over freeman saw that the man spreadeagled in the sand and dune grass was dead his tshirt dark cherry red a beethoven motif faintly visible in the clinging stain of blood freeman heard the sound of sirens in the distance seemed to be one coming one going his battletrained hearing was acute he did not make the mistake of confusing the echo for its origin a mistake that had proved fatal for those troops during the war who had come up against the fivetruck platoons of forty multiplelayered bm katyushas truckmounted rockets for the first time general freeman yes it was a young female police officer shortcropped blond hair skyblue eyes her khaki uniform smart creases crisply ironed green side piping without a wrinkle the smith and wesson high on her left side he noticed my wife he said the smile hed had for the welcomehome crowd now gone he could have been back at minsk asking for sitreps on unit deployment his tone concerned his control born in part from having witnessed what the russians had called the boynya abattoirin germanys fulda gap there the russian armored echelons had poured through in right and left hooks before being stopped in the south by the american and bundeswehr divisions and in the north by the british army of the rhine the choking dust literally dampened by blood as motorized infantry of both sides were torn apart in the shrapnelfilled air is she all right asked the general a cheek muscle taut his gloved right hand now a fist critical sir im afraid shes en route to peninsula hospital what happened a young boy smiling grasping a tiny stars and stripes started beneath the ribbon toward the general one of the mps gently cut him off were not exactly sure general the female officer told himwe got a in progress breaking and entering about eighteen minutes ago when we got here the officer turned freemans gaze following her outstretched hand her notebook obscuring the mans legs for a moment we found the front gate open back door was closed but not locked apparently he entered that way round the back we found some blood on the back pathway it looks as if your wife fired two shots but he made it to the sidewalk before he collapsed she paused hes dead freeman turned back toward the army car its khakiblackgreen wave camouflage paint dulled even further by moody stratus threatening the coast as far up as santa cruz his driver was pale waiting anxiously the situation obviously beyond her experience general sir said the policewoman i know its inconvenient but could you identify the weapon your wife fired what the weapon your wife fired sir the man who broke in well he he used a knife general we assume that mrs freeman was the one who freeman seemed to be looking through the crowd through the house his right fist balling in his left walther he said nine millimeter this it sir asked another police officer holding up a ziplock plastic bag containing a ninemillimeter automatic looks like it said freeman glancing at the gun serial numbers in safety deposit he was looking out to sea eyes squinting in the metallic glare that was still present though the sun was covered with cloud first savings and loan he told them duplicate license at the base fort ord registered in your name general yes look id like to get to the hospital if there are any more questions you can a flashbulb popped he froze first rule for any combat soldier caught in a flare natural instinct was to dive but movement was what the enemy was looking for if you could steel yourself to stand perfectly still chances were they either wouldnt see you or would mistake you for something else it was only a second but to the crowd outside his house it looked as if the general were momentarily transfixed with fright freeman sensed it and glowered furiously at the photographer before freeman arrived at the emergency ward at peninsula hospital there was a story on all the networks that the wife of general douglas freeman had been the victim of an attempted burglary gone wrong was critically wounded and that the general was as the still photo accompanying the sound bite seemed to indicatevisibly shaken the photo was also picked up by reuters and upi and the implicit suggestion made explicitly in the tabloids of the la roche chain was that the reason freeman had been recalled in such haste after the moscow surrender was due to the hardtodisguise fact that the generals nerves were already shot when trainor handed the president the green file a crimson diagonal stripe on its cover containing the eightbyten blowups he bent the gooseneck lamp down closer in the semidarkness of the working study with double steel reinforced walls in the south wing not far from the oval office the smaller office was favored by the president not simply because it was more protected but because it had an older comforting smell reminiscent of his childhood an air of old leather lounge chairs of security of how things used to be of how he wished they could be again in the rapidly changing world also here he could better work in the subdued light a necessity not a choice when he was afflicted with the migraines that had plagued him ever since his congressional days and which were as much a secret between trainor the president and his secretary as were the codes for nuclear war in the possession of the air force officer who even now was sitting outside the study with the briefcase or football containing the daily go codes the headaches didnt slow mayne down on the contrary he held to nietzsches adage that that which doesnt kill you makes you stronger and believed the will required to surmount the pain served him better than those whose faculties were not tried by any such ordeal it was a constant reminder to him of what could be done despite the obstacles if you set your mind to it he examined the photographs before him more closely but the mountain range continued to puzzle him nebraska and montana were as flat as a pancake unless these mx sites he was looking at were smack up against the big horn mountains or the rockies of the continental divide that rose so dramatically from the prairiewhat was the name of that old jimmy stewart movie he mused aloud to trainor the far country thats not the western states answered trainor moving around to look over the presidents shoulder its supposed to be kamchatka yeah it is no wonder i was began mayne feeling foolish only now realizing what he was looking at that the halfdozen black doughnuts a white dot in the middle of each the size of a pinhead were the siberian icbm sites set in the deep vshaped defiles of towering glacierhung granite these were open missile silos in kamchatka peninsula the next photo was of the icbm complex at petropavlovsk which though difficult to get at with us missiles because of the acute southnorth turning angles required to hit a target in deep eastwest axis defiles could nevertheless very easily take out the us trident and sea wolf bases as far away as washington state and san diego its their answer mr president said trainor solemnly they havent blinked you go nuclear they go nuclear nobody wins mayne shoulders rounded head bent like an accountant confronted by the overwhelming power of the irs ranged against his client reluctantly flipped over the other photographs more black donuts in the siberian snows then it has to be allout conventional he said glumly to trainor yes mr president but as the joint chiefs point out well have to neutralize the icbm silos on kamchatka sooner or later cant afford to leave them there so they can pummel us anytime they like trainor pulled over a cia reportsiberian conventional ammunition reserves are sixty days after that wed risk them going nuclear again mayne was struck by the terrible irony of the nuclear age you invented nuclear weapons which supposedly made conventional arms obsolete but in order to make sure nuclear arms would never be used you had to fight modern wars with conventional forces and yet if supplies for the conventional weapons of one side ran out it might revert to nuclear anyway so this meant you needed even more conventional weapons in the first place to take out the launch sites to take out the nuclear possibility it was an equation that the massachusetters which was maynes term for all the doves never understood from george mcgovern on down but it was something with which every president democrat and republican had to contend once he sat in the oval office then said mayne looks like were back in the war room yes mr president damn with that mayne got up and asked trainor for a tylenol and an aspirin only the double whammy stood any chance of dulling the tightening steel band of pain around his head and the thick pain that had waylaid his trapezius and neck muscles so that they felt as hard as bridge cables trainor saw him wince on the way down but once in the corridor leading to the room there was no sign that the president was in pain and anyone noticing his drawn features the bags beneath bis eyes from lack of sleep and the worry lines etched deep into his forehead saw these as the inevitable signs of the enormous responsibility shouldered by the commander in chief and trainor knew it was the truth the strain taking its toll more gray hair about the presidents temples and a set about his jaw that came from him being a nighttime grinder the nightmare of a new war continuing to sabotage his already wartorn sleep it was not a very long meeting for the joint chiefs of staff the chief of naval operations and the presidents special national security adviser harry schuman they were of one accord as well as ordering the offensive on the western front reactivated pushing from moscow toward the urals us forces with canadian air cover as an assist would have to engage in an airland battle to attack siberias eastern flank and so establish a beachhead for allied land operations against the united siberian soviet republics cross bering strait proffered mayne seeking unanimous agreement yes sir replied the cno but first the navy and air force planesll have to knock out big diomedes early warning and aa as well as antiship missile batteries no chance with a land force two diomedes islandsll be surrounded by a sea of jumbled drift ice the cno produced a photograph of the jagged expanse of pressure ridges created by wind and sea action many of the ridges up to sixty feet in height and six feet thick carrierlaunched planesll hit it from the south air force from the alaskan peninsula how about the russian subs attacking our carrier put in mayne our battle groupsll have usual guided missile destroyer and cruiser screen as well as helos and air cover including fighter cover from the carrier itself and helos also we have several batteries of heavy guns on little diomede range to big diomede is less than three miles or five depending on angle of fire can our batteries do much against granite some all depends how deep the russians are dug in but our big ordnance bombs should do the job his right hand massaging his temple mayne said nothing his mood of deep concentration inviting no comment when he finally did speak his tone was subdued the confidence exuded by big ordnance men in the air force wasnt shared by him they had never really learned the lesson of vietnam or iraq in vietnam theyd dropped more bombs on the network collectively known as the ho chi minh trail than they had in all of world war ii and they still hadnt beaten the north vietnamese in iraq theyd hit husseins troops with over three thousand sorties within the first week but at the end of the day the coalition had still needed the ground war to win and husseins troops though inferior to the siberians were dug in in sand not granite also the siberians morale was rock solid compared to the iraqis no mayne wanted backup just in case freeman it was more a question than a decision after saying it he looked up at trainor the cno and the joint chiefs in turn as well as soliciting the wisdom of his special adviser harry schuman trainor heard the breath go out of general grey chief of the army the president shifted his gaze to the general what is it jimmy sir douglas freemans a good man but in his present condition i dont think itd be fair either to the troops or to him mayne was nonplussedyou think hes too tired hell general were all tired general grey shot a glance of surprise in trainors direction then back at the president i thought you knew sir cia report came in about an hour ago trainor made no apologies reports were coming in all the time there was a river of reports you got buried in reports what about freeman no sir his wife in critical condition in peninsula hospital multiple stab wounds they say mayne tried to remember whether hed ever met mrs freeman some reception or other for the desert storm veterans back from iraq a tall goodlooking woman unpretentious but the exact features of her face were lost amid a blur of official receptions when did this happen asked mayne emotionally reassured by his own concern that after a war that had claimed the lives of countless thousands he could still feel compassion for an individual what was it stalin had said one death is a tragedy and more is a statistic its something you had to guard against particularly as president last night apparently answered trainorfbi was called in by the mps at fort ord freemans new hq because it had been called in on the police radio as a break and entry possible burglary but army intelligence figure it might be one of chernkos boys a spets attack asked mayne surprised after all freeman was no longer a threat to the russians the spets short for spetsnaz or voiska spetsialnogo naznacheniya specialpurpose forces were the highest trained foreignspeaking russian commando elite who among other things had spread havoc when dressed in american and british uniforms theyd been dropped behind the allied lines in the dortmundbielefeld pocket under the command of grus or military intelligences second chief directorate the twentyfivethousandman force was the most brutal and best trained of the russian special forces but an attack on general freemans wife after all hitting a commanders wife didnt stop a commander and besides freeman was being recalled its to show i suspect put in the british brigadier soames that they can reach whomever they wish a caution perhaps against us using freeman may not be chernko of course hes pledged his full assistance to us it could be whoever is taking over his agents its chernkos style all right trainor concurred hes been known to have his sleepers agents already in placetarget our nuclear sub captains while theyre off base here as well as abroad two of them got it while they were on leave around faslane in scotland near our holy lock sub pens but the fbi doesnt figure hed try that now not after the surrender besides our forward units are already in moscow whats in it for him quite said soames problem is gentlemen mayne reminded them that kgb or not general freemans going to be too preoccupied with his wifes condition we cant have him leading any mopup operation after the bombardment on big diomede now mayne saw trainor about to speak but carried on i know hes thoroughly professional that hed do it if we asked him but the fact is hell be too preoccupied with her condition its rotten luck all other things considered he seemed the perfect man for a mopup but i dont want the life of one american not one endangered because of some minor detail overlooked by a man too overwrought by family concerns back home once our naval battle group and air force take out big diomede i want it secured and tightly with no chance of them taking it back and cutting off our logistical supply between alaska and siberia thatd be fatal in any event lets not worry about freeman now hell if your boys do a good enough job admiral he was looking at horton and then air force general allet there wont be any garrison left to mop up maynes confidence was bolstered by the plans of the naval battle group admiral horton was assembling out of san diego san francisco and bangor washington even now orders were being issued for extra munitions to be rushed up to little diomede for while its few guns on its more exposed western side couldnt hope to do any significant damage to the eastern cliffs of the siberian island three miles from them little diomedes gun emplacements would along with the infamously changeable and hostile weather of the bering strait run interference for the main naval battle group attack approaching from the aleutians to the south and led in its center by the carrier uss salt lake city big diomede was about to be subjected to a storm of firepower while the island might withstand it it was almost certain to destroy the will of the siberian garrison so that marines could be sent in and merely take it over but all this wouldnt be necessary if novosibirsk and all the space program brains of akademgorodok failed to get the approval of the soviet pacific fleet to go along with the siberian decision in any event preparations were underway to reactivate an element of the joint americanbritish sas special air service commandos the allied equivalent of the spets based in wales whose main squadrons of seventytwo men each were in the process of being demobilized mayne doubted theyd be used but both he and the joint chiefs believed that the preparations would be another clear signal to the siberians if there was no soviet naval attack in the next twentyfour hours this would confirm quite clearly that the soviet navy traditionally the most conservative of the russian forces were not in concert with novosibirsk the white house knew that if novosibirsk lost its vital sea arm it could not hope to prosecute any war for very long let alone win one and neither freeman nor any other general would be needed chapter five freemans sisterinlaw marjorie duchene stood in silence by the general as he looked helplessly down in the intensive care unit of montereys peninsula hospital watching the comatose figure of his wife the array of blinking monitors iv drips and translucent green color of the oxygen mask transforming doreens appearance utterly here the general felt as useless as a conscript on his first day at boot camp powerless to do anything but stand and take it all he could do as the chief resident informed him was wait for freeman it might as well have been a prison sentence the very idea of waiting of being confronted by a problem he could not attack do battle with was anathema he knew what he should be doing he and doreen had talked it over often enough intending to empower each other to pull the plug if either of them was ever struck down by some such incontinent paralyzed condition but ironically the man who had been so thorough in his professional life on more than one occasion astounding logistical officers with his attention to minor details of supply and combat support was now faced by the fact that neither of them had actually got round to doing it to making a living will back at the house the silence of the rooms was all the more oppressive because of the thunderous crashing of high tide and surf which freeman noted in his diary were he an enemy commander offshore would be disastrous for any amphibious operation pacing the rooms flicking on the tv seeing protesters against any impending war with siberia freeman muttered an obscenity and switched it off he was like a caged lion spitting out his contempt for those whose selfishness was so profound that they would not fight for the very freedom that allowed them to protest there was only one place for conscientious objectors frontline stretcher bearers that put their high principle to the test but it wasnt all anger with the protesters that was adding to his concern or dare he say it anxiety about doreen but rather guilt a civilized luxury he rarely allowed himself it was not the usual guilt of a military life that he hadnt spent enough time with her that now he had the time to give her to make up for the long separations she was probably not even aware that he was around rather it was the guilt he felt for being angry at her for being in a coma it was bad enough hed been put out to pasture but now just as war threatened to reopen with the siberian breakaway from moscow washington would keep him out of it because of her he knew it was selfish but he knew that to command men in battle was what he had been born for and he knew doreen would be the first to understand it was why he loved her yes it was his duty as a husband to be with her but if he couldnt do anything for her what was the point of him staying around to thank god youre back home said marjorie in her bubbly godsinhisheavenallsrightwithmeworld voice im sure dory knows youre here douglas it must be a comfort to her deep down you know what they say about some stroke victims that just knowing a loved one is nearby yes yes said freeman irritably im sorry douglas marjorie said mistaking his irritability for anxiety about dory why dont you go out to the pool and ill make some coffee and bring it out maybe youd like to just sit awhile freeman gave in it was the only damn thing you could do with relatives sit by the pool till she got so tired of her own goodness or the cold front locking in monterey that shed hightail it back to sunny phoenix she was one of those people who said god had planned it all he believed the same thing in his own way but whenever she said it she made it sound so pious and selfsatisfied leaving no room for the possibility of human intervention that she sounded positively evangelical by the pool freeman fell silent marjorie patting him understandingly on the arm as she placed the coffee cups atop the bubbled plastic table again shed completely mistaken his mood his staring down at the pool an attempt to turn her off for a while but she was as unrelenting as a soviet artillery barrage her vigor something he would have admired in any soldier in her case it seemed nothing more than the energy of a certified airhead she was a good woman doing the right thing but by god he wished shed go back to phoenix at heart her optimism was born of the same kind of deepseated confidence that freeman held in the face of lifes vicissitudes but something about her unquestioning conviction that all is for the best only moved him to seek the opposite view if only for arguments sake a perversity alien to his usual nature my she said pouring the coffee in an irritating upanddown motion that he saw no point to i was reading the other day about those brentwood boys three heroes all in one family my and the article said one of them was with you in korea and the dortmundbellfeld pocket bielefeld grumped douglas he wasnt with the there hed been dropped outside the pocket by mistake smack into the russian lines you must be very proud of him she continued oblivious to the correction medal of honor winner and all proud of all my boys who he was about to say are instead of were in my command he pulled the coffee toward him young david brentwood hes a good man wounded in russia but back on his feet in no time for a moment that indicated to him that hed been away from the front too long freeman almost found himself in violation of security about to tell her that members of the allied outfit in which brentwood served britains special air service were blood brothers with americas delta force and the two other brothers continued marjorie the one on that roosevelt boat submarine freeman corrected her but that poor other brother ray the one whose face was all burned on that other boat guided missile frigate said freeman carelessly dropping in two sugar cubes as if they were dumb bombs the miracles those surgeons did on him my oh my if ever i saw the hand of god at work douglas that was it a zephyr passed over the pool wrinkling it and he watched it like an omen before the surface was placid again and they have this special mask now looks like one of those hockey goalies to help the healing and freeman restrained himself tempted to ask her where gods hand had been for the men whod drowned in the attack on the uss blaine the first american warship to be hit in the war but he didnt bother he believed gods plan was a lot more complicated than that that freedom meant the freedom to but what the hell he thought airheads like marjorie also served him her task no doubt to talk the devil to death isnt it nice out here she said taking a deep breath of the cool salty air i always find the pool so calming dont you freeman grunted where marjorie saw a translucent pool of ultramarine beneath the clearing sky saw nature in harmony insects happily skimming across the waters mirrored surface freeman saw an unending battle one insect pursuing another a fight to the finish which made him think again of amphibious operations they were undoubtedly the riskiest of all military undertakings there murphys law was king no matter how much planning how many rehearsals disaster always lurked in the everchanging sea if the siberian threat turned to war the shortest distance was across the bering strait which now would be a mass of ice floes the moment he thought of ice he recalled two things simultaneously the first was the english lord who in the lounge of the titanic as it struck the iceberg had exclaimed imperturbably i sent for ice but this is ridiculous the second thing was the curious feet filed away in his brain along with a thousand other apparently trivial yet vital pieces of logistical information that at latitude sixtyfive degrees thirty minutes north the ice cakes forming in the dead of winter would be more dispersed more loosely packed than in the warmer spring months when local currents and wind changed to shift ice northward that is packing it tighter together in spring than in the winter it was precisely the opposite to what one would imagine and this would make it much tougher for icebreakers or any other ship to negotiate also during the winter unlike the spring and the fall skies tended to be clearer often with brilliant sunshine bad news for closesupport air cover when it would be possible for observers on ratmanov the soviet name for big diomede to see clear across the strait anyway you sure as hell couldnt launch a sea invasion of siberia or diomede if you had to contend with pack ice there was something else about the ice that he could not recall was it that there was no ice south of the pribilof islands but hell that was over miles south of ratmanov no it was something else but it wouldnt come to him perhaps it was the note hed made in his card index file computer discs could be wiped clean by a big bombs electromagnetic pulse that unless a ship wanted to risk being locked in the ice or forced to move so slowly it would be like a dinosaur as a target it would have to stand off the southern protective side of the pribilofs to launch any cruise missiles at ratmanov no that meant it was some other detail about the ice buzzing around in his head but it wouldnt settle amid the constant patter of marjories antiaircraft fire he wondered if the pentagons contingency planners knew as much about the area as he did he doubted it not immodestly but from long experience the trouble with the pentagon was that there were too many desk jockeys not enough people who had actually walked around and seen the places where they might have to fight a battle one day douglas freeman had on his own money and time hed used every vacation and other time to visit every major battlefield in europe before the war and had jotted down his observations on his threebyfive cards operational plans for what he called potential flash points one such plan had been for the kuwaitiraqi border another for the dortmundbielefeld pocket freeman had also been to alaska he had trekked to see the lonely windswept monument to will rogers eleven miles southwest of barrow on the godforsaken tundra of alaskas north slope and had seen more than thirty bald eagles at once on the banks of the chilkat river their white throat fur above the black body and white tails giving them a nobility among the winterstripped cottonwoods that he would never forget he had also been to cape prince of wales where high up in the stunningly clear air at the westernmost tip of alaskas seward peninsula he had gazed out over the white strait the cobalt blue line of siberia on the horizon and had seen the two specks that were the diomede islands perhaps it was there he had learned whatever it was about the ice that now he couldnt recall he would have to go down to his basement go through the rotary card file excuse me he told marjorie think ill take a nap he forced a smile still not over my jet lag yes you poor thing douglas thank the lord im not affected what pardon asked freeman as he stood up and pushed the chair back by the edge of the pool jet lag said marjorie serenely thank the lord i dont get it im not affected you wouldnt be said freeman under his breath pardon youre unaffected said the general yes to tell you the truth douglas i think its all in your head if god had intended freeman wasnt listening his attention drawn momentarily to the windruffled pool and knew instantly what it was about the winter ice floes in the strait not only were they looser than summer ice but they were wind sculptured to heights of twentyfive feet above the frozen surface of the sea he remembered them now the purest white glistening like mirrors in the sunny clear air and then as night came turning to extraordinary hues of blue a forest of jumbled sharp ice that would spell the death knell of any marine or army hovercraft invasion against ratmanov the ice too jagged to permit the necessary air cushion for the troopcarrying hovercrafts theyd be torn to pieces immediately he rang general grey at the pentagon using his personal scrambler code to get a secure line may i ask whos calling please said the secretary general douglas freeman hold on please general vivaldis four seasons assaulted him at full volume before the receptionists voice came back on the line ah douglas came general greys voice hows your wife the same thank you look jimmy with this siberian thing looming i thought you could do with some advice from an old soldier out here freeman was waiting for a positive response but got none he told grey about the ice thanks douglas appreciate your interest really do but to tell you the truth we think this novosibirsk thing is pretty much a bluff to squeeze concessions out of us after the moscow surrender itll blow over what if it blows over ratmanov asked freeman what ratmanov big diomede oh well douglas cia agrees with us that if we stand our ground novosibirskll back off besides air force figures it can handle big diomede if it comes to that and the navy of course but look its great to hear from you you keep in touch you hear and douglas give my regards to your wife yes sir freeman put down the phone and cussed he might be the commanding officer of fort ord but he was effectively unemployed out to pasture the no help wanted sign up in washington yoohoo douglas are you awake no said freeman as he walked over and spun the globe arresting the spin turning it to him like the end of a football so he could see the arctic circle goddamn diomedes were so small they werent even marked like him they were off the map get a goddamn grip on yourself he muttered goddamn pity is for goddamn sissies you a sniveller freeman no then stop your goddamn whining yoohoo douglas the general inhaled deeply slowly teeth gritted damn woman knew he was in his basement den why in hell did she have to yes what is it its visiting time the hospital you coming along yes said freeman morosely then his conscience berated him not only with what should have been concern for doreen but because hed caught himself at the shoreline of another sulk the one thing he couldnt stand in anyone least of all himself yes he said clearly straightening up grabbing his cap im coming surely the man who had handled the raid on pyongyang and broken out of the dortmundbielefeld pocket and pierced the famed minskmoscow defenses could handle the barrage of inanities and clichés launched by his mobile sisterinlaw you see douglas she said as they walked out to the generals car see what he asked as pleasantly as he could how things work out for the best i mean you coming home just when dory needed you the most goddamn it marjorie shes comatose said douglas i cant do a thing to help her but youre nearby and just think if youd still been on active duty you might have got caught up in all this terrible siberian business yes said douglas i probably would have marjorie there you see said marjorie slipping her arm through his and patting him it was meant to be off canadas west coast captain valerys saratov one of the soviet unions pacific fleet subs out of radio contact with its home base of vladivostok was on silent running listening on passive rather than active sonar an active pulse having to originate from the sub would be too dangerous to use as the saratov penetrated deeper into allied asw microphoned waters north of vancouver island sound from the ships it had been tracking for the last fortyeight hours was faint yet discernible the sound travelling at four times the speed it would in air racing through the saline molecules of the sound layers whether the contact was now fading because the ships his sub was shadowing had moved closer in to the coastline during the storm further away from the saratov or whether they had in fact reduced speed giving off less signature noise captain valery couldnt tell but with his sub at the end of its osp operational safety perimeter hed soon have to decide take her up he instructed the first officer thirty meters up to thirty meters confirmed the officer and planesman rising angle ten steady at thirty meters sir up search scope valery flipped the beak of his cap about his eyes glued to the column and draped his arms on the scored grips moving around with the scope as if he were one with it now hopefully he would see the actual shape of the ships his sub had been tracking so far only by noise what he saw through the infraredpenetrated darkness puzzled him in the grayish white circle of wave action obscured now and then in the nights dark curtain of spray the canadian coastline rather than being visible as a low blur before the mountains appeared to be missing only the sharp geometry of the snowcapped coastal range beyond was visible as if the range rose straight out of the sea he turned the scope another five degrees but still no trace of the coast it was as if the diameter of the periscopes gray infrared circle had been painted black then he realized what he was looking at why turning the five degrees hadnt made any difference two great slabs the two ships had overlapped obliterating the coastline gospodi my god he called ya ikh vizhu pryamo peredo mnoy i have them dead ahead bearing zero eight two came the reply down scope ordered valery attack scope up down search scope up attack confirmed the first officer above the wheeze of the scopes column the tone signal of action stations gonged urgently though softly in control the pulsating red of the battle stations alarm bleeding pink into the red of control two of them the captain informed the control crew as the attack scope slid into position both tankers enormous brutes eyes welded to the attack scope valery quickly picked the ships up again on the same bearing the attack scope its field of view not as wide as that of the search scope but higher allowed the sub to go deeper for a shoot the scopes haircrossed circle was completely blocked by the massive walls that were the tankers sides the bridge and crew housing astern of one tanker etched silver in moonlight as the clouds broke and two small blobs tugs could be seen bobbing up and down in the swells prevoskkodno it couldnt be better said valery not only had he made the right decision by venturing in closer to the coastline now he was no more than three miles from them but at this angle of attack he would in effect not be firing at two separate hulls but at one long cliff of steel over seven hundred meters almost half a mile long for safetys sake the second tanker was sailing not directly behind the first where it could not hope to stop should anything happen to the tanker in front but starboard aft of it in staggered convoy position and the two tugs were all but obscured by the rising seas now even if they were armed with asw depth bombs and subsurface torpedoes valery knew that they would be so busy with damage control if one or both tankers were hit that they would give him little cause for concern in any event he ordered forward tubes two and four loaded with submarine simulator decoys of the kind that had been perfected after the cruiser yumashev had been the victim of an american moss a mobile submarine simulator the cruiser dummied into positioning itself to be sunk by the us nuclear sub roosevelt in the early months of the war now it was valerys chance for revenge but he would try to save the decoys for later use if possible hopefully hed have complete surprise and wouldnt have to use them at all he heard the officer of the deck confirming forward tubes one three five and six were loaded with live fish bearing zero eight three mark valery ordered range thirtyfour hundred meters sir valery could feel a movement energy transmitted by underthesurface wave oscillation a slight down pitch hold her steady he said without unlocking his eyes from the scope forward tubes one three five and six set the up angle forward tubes one three five and six set up angle the confirmation came from torpedo control up angle set the first officer was watching the relay screen showing the computerized keyedin angles that allowed for everything from the enemys speed variable friction caused by differing salinity and water temperatures to surface turbulence next he checked that the decoy fishthe simulators were in forward tubes two and four bearing zero eight four range thirtyfive hundred meters bearing steady zero eight four shoot ordered valery set came the firing officers reply fire one fire one confirmed the firing officer fire three said valery a slight tremor passed through the sub as one was away and running fire three came the confirmation fire five fire six down scope down scope sir hold position the first officer was reading out the count from seconds as the four twentyonefootlong torpedoes sped without visible wakes toward their target two apiece announced the officer of the deck valery said nothing his eyes on the computer clock he knew he should hit both of them if all the computations were right but with such a storm raging on the surface off the heavily timbered and logged coast there were bound to be deadheads or floating logs in the water it would take only one torpedo to hit a piece of waterlogged timber and the remaining three torpedoes could all be blown off track molis pray said valery sonar sir everything alright humming sir beautiful pipe it to the pa but low on the volume yes sir now everyone throughout the sub as if equipped with stethoscopes could hear the fast heavy heartbeats of the tankers and the steady hiss of the four torpedoes running for them get the book said valery the officer of the deck passed over the enemy ship silhouette recognition binder the moment they blew if they blew it was valerys intention to surface for quick visual confirmation of type naval intelligence at vladivostok would want to know for a moment the surge of adrenaline in him stopped as he remembered the reason for hqs insistence on getting all possible information including sea conditions during attack the scuttlebutt going the rounds of vladivostok was that apparently some jews from the jewish autonomous oblast or region around the sinosoviet border along the amur river had been sabotaging munitions valery hoped it had only been air force and army munitions that had been tampered with and that when they found the saboteurs they hanged them slowly shooting was too quick for saboteurs nine seconds to go answered the first officer softly valery nodded still leafing through the book trying to identify the class of tankers he was attacking from the brief glimpse hed had through the scope he tried to suppress his excitement but it was difficult it was so easy a dream of an attack one thing he knew already they were not vlccs very large crude carriers but ulccs ultra large crude carriers ha he exclaimed to the first officer give it to the americans they always do things big eh even if only one was hit thered be a hell of a spill and if the crudes flash point was raised high enough and it started to burn there would be no way the enemy crews could put it out he could use the light to take his time on the second should any of the first four torpedoes miss on the first tanker mv sitka captained by jesus llamos assistant radio operator sandra thompson was taking her break a shy slim redhead the subject of half the crews on and offduty fantasies despite the fact that she was married and in the early stages of pregnancy she stood on the quiet semidarkened bridge of the enormous tanker watching the amber island of light that was the marconi anticollision radar she found the phosphorescent dance of its hypnotic sweep comforting nothing was showing west of them eastward the coastline ran crooked the radar trace a knotted ambercolored snake flanked by the saltandpepper dots of offshore islands glancing up from the radar for a moment out through the darkness of the sitkas bridge sandra could see the moonlight bathing the seas turbulence in a deceptively soft light the great sliding gray metallic swells momentarily robbed of their violence something hit her like a strong hot wind as she reached for the radars console for support there was a flash from forward midships an enormous crash the ship shaking violently like a car at speed with a blowout then a tremendous whoomp as the shock wave rebounded in an ethereal moment of calm she saw captain llamos running toward the steering console but his image shivered and he looked as if he were moving in slow motion hands outstretched for the autotomanual levers then the ship listed to port for a second sandra thought the tanker had collided with one of the big tugs the next moment the bridge shifted violently to port and she was thrown hard in the darkness onto the cleated matting glass shattering its invisible hail all about her alarm klaxons blaring several lights on the wing tank monitor console blinking furiously indicating at least five of the forward starboard wing tanks were ruptured spilling their liquid cargo into the sea her face and hands soaking wet she tried to get up but the port list had increased to fifteen degrees and she felt herself sliding down the incline suddenly lights came on put that damn switch off it was llamoss voice shouting at the starboard lookout llamos hunched hanging onto the steering console in the middle of the bridge were hit arent we the lookout yelled defiantly you dont have to make it easier for them llamos shouted keep the damn light off sandra could see him dimly against the shattered bridge glass as he flicked on the intercom to the radio room ordering the operator to send an sos there was no reply he gave the order again still no replythompson he called out sandra yes sir im here go do it yes sir pushing herself off the wet latticed decking she grabbed a flashlight from the port lookouts rack making her way downhill to the radio room within seconds she was drenched the sprinkler system going full bore in the gossamer spray cut cleanly by the beam of her flashlight she saw blood streaming down her arms only now realizing that her face had been lacerated by glass shards from the bridge there was another flash of light momentarily night became day the second tanker was hit one of her tanks immediately catching fire an overwhelming explosion of crimson flame curling in the blackest smoke shed ever seen the flames now spiralling and joining in the corner of the radio room she saw the operator trying to get up holding his head instinctively moving to help she checked herself and instead issued the sos as she went into the third repeat giving the tankers approximate position from the last fix the computer readout dead there was another sound like an enormous door creaking the radio room began to move as if disembodied from the ship proper and she knew that the sitka was breaking its spine snapped by either torpedoes or acoustic mines one of the russian subs torpedoes hadnt exploded valery entered it in the saratovs log as a possible dud though he noted that given the seas condition it might have gone off course because of a sudden thermocline in any case all valery was concerned with now was that he had sunk two tankers the first though not on fire was doomed its funnel and aft crew sections each half a quartermile long drifting apart and in toward the wild coastline of british columbia meanwhile the inferno on the second tanker was spreading over the sea in huge fiery fingers riding up and down the swells in the fast current because of the lack of surf between the protective offshore islands the fiery spill fed by its enormous tar balls and mousse blankets of crude was already washing up on the pristine shoreline fanned by the galeforce winds the huge flames were licking the dense shoreline forests setting the timber here in the dry cold several hundred feet below the coastal ranges snow line afire in what would be the biggest single blaze and ecological disaster since the oil spills and fires of the iraqi war in the search scope valery could easily identify the stricken tankers illuminated by the flames as ultraarge carriers of the globtik tokyo class both in excess of three hundred thousand dead weight tons even better than i had hoped he informed the officer of the deck but i dont understand why the first tanker isnt burning the fires were probably doused by the flooding commented the ood even so rejoined valery the tankers own engine oil should suddenly valery snapped the grips hard against the scopes stainless steel column down scope dive to five hundred down scope dive to five hundred repeated the ood the diving officer stood directly behind the two planesmen hands gripping their two bucket seats knuckles white as he watched the gauge of the sub if they dove at too steep an angle the subs stern would come clear out of the water before they were fully submerged podgotovit k vypusku torpedo simyulatorpodvodnoy lodki zadnyaya truba prepare to fire submarine simulator torpedo stern tube as the torpedo officer confirmed the order valery explained the rush to the ood a helicopters coming off the second tanker most likely for crew rescue but could be asw for a second valery chastised himself for not having fired the submarine simulator before the attack but it was an enormously expensive piece of equipment besides shooting out millions of rubles with each fish its noise while a decoy for any asw aircraft or ship in the area would have been picked up by the sosus the underwater microphone arrays of the sound surveillance system giving the subs general area position away with the depth needle approaching five hundred meters valery decided hed made the right decision saving the simulator till now true hed glimpsed the helicopter on the tankers deck for only a split second but he was sure its rotors had been spinning ready for takeoff possibly with asw munitions level at five hundred sir fire decoy decoy fired sir silent running ordered valery silent running sir from now on if any crew member made a mistake dropped anything on the metal deck that might be picked up in the sound channel it would cost the man three months pay plus a zebraa blackstriped demotion entry on his blue service sheet but valery himself had made a serious error the bell twinturboshaft chopper rising aft off the second tankers stern housing pad was interested only in trying to rescue two crew members whose saltactivated vest lights were orange pinpoints in the raging cauldron about the stricken tankers the sprayroiling beam that was the choppers searchlight turned rustred above the blankets of burning oil in the beams circle that was moving up and down the chaotic sea like an undulating sheet of blood the two crewmen lay limp in the helos harness having suffocated in the oil after having been concussed by the explosions of the torpedoes likewise scores of seabirds were already smothered in the bunker c crude sandra thompson llamos and the starboard lookout struggled on the slippery incline of the stern deck of the first tanker the ships two halves continued drifting apart as the three survivors tossed over a white drumsize beaufort canister its tether flying free of the ship like some long snake the canister hit the water instantly shedding its fiberglass shell and blossoming into a tent raft of vivid dayglo magenta highlighted by the fire on the second tanker aboard which small toylike figures could be seen vainly manning a crisscross of hoses inflate your vest llamos shouted to the starboard lookout hold your breath as long as you can and llamoss voice was whipped away by the galeforce winds as he pointed toward the treaclemoated raft now about thirty feet away from the badly listing stern section the lookout jumped sandra pulled the c string on her life vest heard the sudden hiss of air felt the mae west swelling above her bosom as she tightened the waist straps and bent down to inflate the vest of the injured radio man whom she and llamos had dragged precariously from the bridge llamos had taken a turn about the operators waist with a painter from one of the lifeboats to prevent the injured man from sliding down the deck that was now dangerously slick with the oil which had been blown skyward in towering black spumes before falling back on the tankers drenching the four and fuelling the fires with a driving black rain the radio man was so quiet sandra thought he was dead but putting her finger on his carotid artery she thought she felt a faint pulse go llamos yelled out to her jimmy and ill look after him you need to reach the raft transmit our he didnt finish his voice drowned in a gush of superheated steam a boiler beneath them exploding splitting the ships port after section the stern heaving the stack spewing boiling water swept forward for hundreds of yards in the gale force winds the stern was now split and sliding back into the sea rolling revealing the flanges of its enormous prop blades llamos and the other three were toppling out of control down the cliff of the deck a lifeboat wrenched from its davits swung upward like a trapeze smashing itself to splinters the hissing roar of the stern was so loud it could be heard above the gale by the few crewmen still battling the second tankers fires unable to save sandra or the others the twoman helo crew watched helplessly as the rear half of the mv sitka disappeared then they turned their attention to the tiny frantic figures on the stern of the second tanker the choppers pilot had ordered his assistant to jettison the bodies of the two dead men theyd hauled up lessening the choppers weight so the helo might try to pick up as many survivors as possible from the twentyfiveman crew on the second tanker and any others who inconceivable as it appeared might be alive on the forward section of the first tanker though still afloat it was certain to go under within minutes the pilot shouted his instructions regarding excess weight into the throat mike and his assistant after having grabbed the autoflash canon and taking head shots of the two dead men for later identification pushed the bodies out the chopper banked in the darkness toward the stern of the second tanker its fire now so fierce there was no hope of the ships hoses extinguishing it the hot air currents streaming up from the blazing ship were so powerful that the pilot knew there was no chance of getting anywhere close to the deck cautiously he brought the chopper toward the stern his visibility now reduced to zero because of the continuing oil smudge on his windscreen combining with the buildup of salt crust a combination the wipers couldnt handle his assistant saw a crimson streak several hundred yards away to the east a flare and in its flickering light the dayglo of a beaufort teepee yelling at the pilot and gesturing eastward the assistant guided them to the point seventy feet away the chopper hovered above the raft and lowered the harness swiveling in the c clip but then seeing the raft was overcrowded with survivors from both tankers and that this could easily lead to a capsize should the chopper be suddenly caught in an updraft the pilot shouted into the mike were only a few miles from shore best leave em for air sea rescue in the morning stand a better chance i reckon i dunno yelled the assistant could go bellyup anyway in the swells during the second of hesitation the bell which could not fly on one engine unless traveling in excess of one hundred miles per hour gave a shudder an engine coughed then the other cut out its air filter jammed solid with soot from the oil fire the chopper plunged its rotors chopping into the loaded raft then catching a swell the blades cartwheeled the chopper several hundred feet splashing into the mousse of bunker c parts of the main rotor whistling through the gale everyone aboard the tent raft was drowned in effect suffocated by the oil including sandra thompson and the twomonthold child she was carrying general grey had thought nothing of freemans call about the peculiar condition of winter ice in the bering strait surely the pentagon planners would know this grey called downstairs to make sure they didnt know this shocked grey but even so it wasnt freemans familiarity with the minutiae that now impressed him but rather the simple yet profound realization that for freeman to think of such a detail in the midst of his wifes catastrophic injury meant that the soldier in freeman was not only alive and well but there was only the soldier that freeman was straining at the leash with his genius for logistical detail as well as strategic thought he was unquestionably the man for the job america had never fought a sustained arctic war but now with the mideast oil wells afire and the siberians having answered president mayne with the sinking of the two american tankers which by itself constituted an immediate threat to the us oil supply from the alaskan north slope the us had no option it was war grey lifted his pentagon scrambler phone got the joint chiefs approval including that of the cno admiral horton then he rang the white house and suggested that general douglas freeman be appointed commander in chief operation arctic front the moment he landed at elmendorf air force base alaska the president approved the call came through to freeman in monterey as marjorie was watching a news flash cutting into the tonight show with jay leno announcing that america was at war my glory began marjorie in a state of shock one hand clasped before her mouth as the other worked the remote to bring in cbn you hear that douglas she called out russian submarines have attacked two of our ships were at war again freeman had put the phone down and was already doing up his necktie in an oldfashioned windsor knot so old that it was now said to be back in style he had already called fort ord to make transport arrangements and issued a series of orders marshalling elements of the marines rapid deployment force my glory marjorie repeated slumped down in the recliner thats terrible yes freeman agreed sure as hell is it may have been the light of the tv flickering but for a moment marjorie could have sworn douglas was smiling still marjorie he added must have been meant to be she suspected in a vague sort of way that it might be a jibe at her but it was clear he also believed it i hope itll be quick said marjorie like iraq freemans smile was devoid of condescension one of those a parent gives when obliged to break a truth of life gently to his offspring the truth that in life you couldnt hope for nonstop easy victories he took nothing away from the men who had fought in desert storm in which he himself had led part of the seventh armored in the decisive outflanking movement north that caught the republican guard with their pants down but the iraqi war for all its moments of undeniable american and coalition bravery had been when all was said and done a hundredhour ground war even the dimmest private would see that siberia was a far different situation that any comparison to desert storm was naive to say the least he spoke quietly marjorie iraq is desert some high country to the north but in the main a desert siberia has everything by which i mean every natural land water and ice barrier on gods earth and taiga pine birch and fir forests far as the eye can see wermacht used to talk of distance illness the endlessness of russia and marjorie he was looking in the mirror straightening the khaki tie the krauts didnt even get to siberia they were in the small part of russia he buttoned up his coat the rows of campaign ribbons and decorations attesting to the battles he had fought for america from southeast asia to iraq to the minskmoscow line his reflection in the mirror at once eager for and awed by his responsibility there is he said pulling on his cap another minor detail what marjorie asked though her attention was distracted by a cbn broadcaster somehow theyd got one of their cameras twentyfour miles across the strait from alaska to little diomede island and had it set up on the sloping but still steep western side of the small american outpost near the eskimo village of inalik the cbns camera was filling the tv screen with the icecovered basalt that was the bottom half of big diomede or as cbn was calling it ratmanov island freeman shot a glance at the tv and marjorie had seldom seen such a look of outright contempt on his face as he watched the cbn announcer in a furlined eskimo parka telling americans how the us air force were already assembling fighters and fighter bombers on the alaskan peninsula for what was certain to be an aerial bombardment of the squaremile ratmanov island the island was so heavily defended the reporter continued that many military experts believe it to be the most heavily defended piece of real estate in the world whose troops unlike the illsupplied republican guard of the iraqi war are known to have months of supplies and ammunition deep within the granite fortress along with stateoftheart air defenses that are bound to inflict heavy casualties upon the americans if they try to take out the sam sites on ratmanov and which they must take out if they have any hope of its not ratmanov island shouted freeman at the cbn announcer its rat island and were going to exterminate the bastards by the bushel douglas he flashed a winning smile sorry marjorie arent you going to tell the then he looked at her puzzled as he unconsciously felt for what he called his backup his vestholstered hivel automatic beneath his tunic tell you what you said there was one other thing about siberia that made it so different oh dear you arent going to tell the you expect it to be a long war are you yes answered freeman slipping in a rubberbanded clutch of threebyfive index cardsarctic opsinto his pocket siberia he told her is twenty times the size of iraq actually it was more than twentythree times as big but he knew civilians preferred round numbers suddenly marjorie realized hed been dressing with more ceremony than usual for duty at fort ord youre not going she charged ordered by the president marjorie he said no choice it was only the second lie hed told since leaving europe the first during a news conference in paris on his way home in which he had apologized under direct orders from general grey for having called his russian counterparts a pack of vodkasucking sons of bitches it was quite wrong of him he said later to have said anything against vodkahell i have it on good authority that you can run tanks on it if i didnt know better douglas said marjorie id think you enjoyed it on the way to fort ord he heard on the radio that cbn was reporting that us air strikes against ratmanov from elmendorf air force base near anchorage and from the bases further west on cape prince of wales were imminent thats right you bastar he stopped short oldfashioned about using rough language in front of women wonder is he told the blond chauffeur they dont tell the siberians how many planes are involved theyre probably working on it general chapter six with most of the us s seventysix fa stealth fighters still in europe only five were immediately available to alaskan command the fas primary role being radar avoidance attack not defense led in by a wild weasel fg phantom jamming big diomedes radars with white noise the five stealth fighters despite their relatively low maneuverabilitysomething not known by the public at large thundered only four hundred feet above the white blur that was the eastern half of the bering strait coming in at seven hundred miles per hour executing both high and overtheshoulder toss bomb release runs they sent paveway pound laserguided ordnance along with twelvefootlong modularglide bombs sliding down the icecream or laser cone toward the eastern cliff face that sprouted retractable flatface squateye spoonrest and lowblow radar arrays that serviced batteries of four barreled eighteeninchdiameter surfacetoair missiles seconds after the four nose canards behind each laser seekerdetector nose assembly whistled through the dry arctic air their explosions lit up the face of ratmanov or big diomede in crimsoncurdled orange balls of fire the thunder rolled between the two islands on the clear night jagged sea ice reflecting the light so that big diomede was lit up like some huge blackveined massif that had only suddenly burst through the frozen sea it was an illusion created by enormous slivers of ice sliding from the islands cliff face from the heat and the concussion of the bombs crashing into the sea ice below the following aardvark or ff fighter bombers came in on the deck at miles per hour to deliver their slide beams for more laserguided bombs pilots expecting to run into heavy antiaircraft fire on the approach weapons officers centering the cross hairs on the infrared screens closing on the target lasers were activated to lock on and seconds before the slide bomb launch the electronic warfare officers tensed expecting heavy aa fire but there was none on the second approach by the f fighter bombers flying low to deliver more bombs the aircraft presumably radar safe in the frying pan static set up by the fg phantom wild weasels big diomede suddenly erupted spewing streams of red and green tracer crisscrossing the sky in deadly tattoo the white noise now settling down so that the f pilots knew that either the wild weasels had stopped their jamming or the russians had outjammed the jammers whatever the cause over forty batteries of zsu quad twentythreemillimeter cannon and soviet sa missiles filled the air above the strait each gun firing over ten thousand rounds a second the twentythreemillimeter fire created a curtain of redhot metal in the narrow corridor that the wild weasels had believed secure for a safe run in yet despite the heavy aa fire only one of the f fighter bombers and one wild weasel were taken out the f going down spitting flame then erupting on the ice into a thousand fiery pieces the weasel crashing because the intakes of its twin eighteenthousandpoundthrust jet engines were fouled as the plane struck a mass of terrified glaucouswinged gulls by now the f fighter bombers had delivered their loads against the cliff face in an effort to penetrate the enclaves of the aa fire but many of the heatseeking missiles from the fs had been dummied by what photo reconnaissance later discovered were wired hot spots to sucker the heatseeking american missiles the siberians zsu twentythreemillimeter and sa missiles coming from relatively cooler apertures from within the sixteenhundredfoothigh cliff face of the elevensquaremile island in most danger were the five stealth fighters poorly maneuverable compared to the fs and wild weasels and slow at seven hundred miles per hour the stealths only superiority to the others lay in radar evasion they sought the safety of flying practically on the deck only two to three hundred feet above the jagged ice that was racing like an endless white runway beneath them one just off the northern end of little diomede less than two and a half miles from target had ironically begun to climb for an overtheshoulder toss when a wind shear created among the ice floes jagged peaks sucked it down for a fraction of a second at seven hundred miles an hour the stealth could not rise in time and the siberian quads fire raked it from the ventral scanner below the pilot past the canopy actuator to the lefthand tail fin it was as if a swallows tail had been suddenly clipped the planes implosion on the ice and the detonation of the paveway twothousandpounder blew a black hole in the ice the giant eruption of flame from it illuminating the strait between the islands like some enormous charred skating rink for an instant it was bright as day the siberian gunners pouring an enfilade of zsu twentythree millimeter fire toward it it took a full burst and the second stealth was gone high above big diomede thousands more seabirds screeching in panic driven aloft by the shrapnelfilled night cried even louder some falling now tumbling down toward the ice either killed outright or stunned by the bombs explosions and aa fire two siberian sa missiles radaridentified by a highstationed rotodomed boeing estreaked toward two of the three remaining stealths as they banked hard right turning north swinging still further to an eastward heading there were two winks of light from cape prince of wales cape mountain and in less than five seconds two footlong pound us patriot land mobile surfacetoair missiles intercepted the two soviet sas blowing them out of the sky in the mobile command center of the patriots in a bunker in cape prince of wales the videos from the cameras of the first american wave were already being shown the representatives from raytheon co of lexington and the martin marietta corp of bethesda maryland the prime and subcontractors for the milliondollarapiece patriots were well pleased watching their companies being guaranteed future contracts for the milliondollar patriots mobile five unit system they were also joining in the congratulations to those pilots who had toggled the laserguided bombs via the white cross of the tv image smack onto their selected targets the silent soft white bursts of light on the videos showing the smart bombs exploding but there had been very few secondary bursts within the initial explosions meaning no ammunition or missile dumps but if the contractors were pleased the co of alaskan command wasnt he had lost four multimillion dollar aircraft and six air crew two each from the downed f fighter bomber and the phantom g wild weasel two from the stealth fighters and for what if the highfrequency russian radar hadnt picked them up because of the earlier jamming by the wild weasels then low frequency which had been known to work on the stealths before must have in any case what was the result he pointedly asked the hitherto exhilarated pilots the infrared videos showed nothing more than the cliff face splattered with black sootlike marks and splotches like white paint clumps of old guano that had accumulated against the sixteenhundredfoothigh granite cliff now covered in ice and snow yes the bombs had landed where they were supposed to but there was no evidence of any real damage where the hell were the knockedout zsu quads never mind the absence of any real damage to the sa and radar array sites probably all recessed proffered one of the remaining f weapons officers of course theyre goddamn recessed said the general they popped up long enough to get a fix on you fired and then they were gone back in their holes like a bunch of prairie dogs we must have hit a few ventilator shafts sir that led in from the cliff they have to breathe hell captain they could have ventilator shafts coming in from all over that island from the western side islands only three miles wide we were firing at hot spots that the videos now show were just that hot spots thermal patches each one probably run by a goddamn flashlight battery i dont know how the hell theyre doing it but were wasting bombs and weve just shot off five million bucks worth of ordnance in five seconds to shoot down missiles from sites we cant even see well sir continued one of the two remaining stealth captains were just going to have to get those satellite boys in washington to get their magnifying glasses on has to be somewhere we can get ordnance into that sucker time gentlemen said the general urgently time the joint chiefs want this one taken out in a big hurry we dont knock out big diomede we cant cross the strait we dont cross the strait and the siberians can move everything theyve got to their eastern flank fifty miles from us the general was studying one of the video stills well have to go in with more infrared seekers hope some of them can fix on rhps he meant residual heat patches which theoretically should have been identified by thermal patch imaging sights even after the periscopelike radar antennae popped back down in their holes trouble is sir its so cold rhps signatures disappear on you almost immediately i know i know ill put the word out to our chief weapons officer see whether he can crank the infrared sensors up a notch or two im surprised we didnt run into any migs said the captain in charge of the stealths maybe they dont have any in their eastern tvd he meant the siberians eastern theater right said the stealth captain cheekily and i m marilyn monroe then come to bed marilyn said one of the weapons officers but no one felt like laughing the exhilaration of the attack was wearing off with the realization that six of their buddies were no more and in the two stealths alone alaska air command had lost million dollars of the taxpayers money one thing was for damn sure the general told his aide after the debriefing he wasnt going to send any more pilots against that hunk of rock until he could loosen it up a bit by other means by which he meant that despite norads insistence that the attack on ratmanov not siphon off any aircraft from the continents vital north american defense line he would request that a b bomber be released from its blastproof shelter six hundred feet above sea level to launch airtoground b cruise missiles at the rock firing the threethousandpound twothousandmilerange missile outside the siberians effective airtosurface missile envelope from a distance of between forty and fifty miles would be like hitting the rock at pointblank range if that didnt shake a few things loose granite fortress and all he didnt know what would he could of course wait for more bombers to be released from europe but this was unlikely now that they had to contend with containing the siberian west flank and the air commander knew that if he couldnt shake up big diomede and quickly knocking out its radar aa and no doubt its surfacetoship missile batteries he would have to yield the job to the navy he was right the tomcats aboard uss salt lake city with their pounds of ordnance on four underfuselage points and two wing hard points were even now taking their turn as squat bright yellow mules tractors positioned them ready for the four waist and bow catapults the alaskan air commander was too much of a professional to let petty interservice rivalry with the navy stand in the way of an operations success still in the backseat of the lead tomcat frank shirers rio his radar intercept officer walter b anderson a twentyfouryearold from wisconsin raised his thumb signalling the redjacketed ordnance men that he had seen all the redribboned safety pins extracted from the bomb racks now through the white blaze of steamcurtained light shadows of yellow and greenjacketed men darted about the bow and waist cats and blast deflectors the twin bluish white cones of the tomcats pratt and whitney tf engines going into the high scream of a fortythousandpound thrust shirer saw the yellow jacket drop left knee on the deck left hand tucked up behind his back right arm fully extended go shirer braced himself there was an enormous hiss shirer felt himself slammed back into his seat saw a blur of deck lights felt a rush like a long feather pulling through his rectum involuntarily ejaculated and was hurled aloft at miles per hour the carrier deck a yellow postage stamp sliding away downhill into the darkness behind him shirer was already feeling nostalgic for the tomcat after this he would be transferred to shore duty at elmendorf navy fighters being used to fill the norad gap it would mean hed have more opportunity to be with lana but he liked carriers they kept moving now however all thoughts of lana la roche nee brentwood her beauty her fear of her husband jay la roche a wifebeater and psychopath all rolled into one behind the respectable exterior had to be put aside as shirer leader of the twelve tomcats headed toward ratmanov island their offset aiming point the quartermilehigh fairway rock twelve miles south of their target shirers f coming in over the ice pack led the attack diving into the slot of the bering strait where the blip of ratmanov was already on his target scope magnified by the second then the arctic night came alive with streams of red and green tracer not shot higgledypiggledy shirer noted as in the baghdad raids hed been on but carefully vectored toward the tenplane arrowhead formation his rio anderson reported that he had a cluster of siberian spoonrest radar masts on the eastern cliff of ratmanov in the cross hairs of the green infrared screen he switched on the laser designator beam and in less than a second informed shirer they had a lockon in another second twothousandpound dumb bombs fitted with paveway conversion kits turning them into smart weapons were sliding down the beam at the same time six batteries of quadmounted zsus opened up along the cliff sending swarms of sixtyfiveroundpersecond thirtymillimeter fire at the american jets faster eighteenfootlong sa missiles followed the siberian radar having got a radar fix weve been painted warned anderson the missiles at over fortytwo hundred miles an hour travelling faster than a rifle bullet were streaking toward the american formation the fs began evasive measures but shirers tomcat was hit as it rose sharply before a dark cleft in the cliff erupting with massed machinegun fire the tomcats wings going into the swept position for more maneuver its turbofans screaming on afterburner shirer felt a shudder the tail actuators were severed eject eject he yelled anderson pulled the eject handle there was a bang the explosive bolts disengaging knowing his rio was out shirer pulled his eject and the next moment was shot out in the rocketassisted martinbaker ejector seat the freezing arctic wind howled about him as he reached the apogee of the thrust he began to fall heard the snap of the chute opening and in flickering flare light spotted anderson below off to his left as they descended toward the snowcovered southern end of the high rocky island they had been illuminated by the flare light for only a second or two but it was enough for the sixman troop of the elite russian spets commandos who unseen by the americans came up out of their deep rockroofed tunnel complex and invisible because of their white winter overlays against the snow ran with the controlled pace of top athletes despite their heavy weapon load they continued sprinting toward the islands narrower southern end anderson from the downed tomcat had barely finished wrapping up his chute when shirer quickly released himself from the chute before it could drag him over the seventeenhundredfoothigh edge of the cliff the spets were almost upon them ne dvigatsya dont move neither the pilot nor his rio knew a word of siberian but they understood the lead commandos shouted command and stood hands raised the first two commandos knelt covering them with their aks as per regulation at least one of the elite spets troop the tailend charlie spoke english and without a trace of an accent what airfield are you from he asked them both his gaze settling on shirer who despite the fact that the russian was only several feet away couldnt make out the commandos face beneath the dark makeup and the hood of the white overlay my name is franklin g shirer my rank is colonel in the us navy my service number is whos the senior officer snapped the russian commando his infrared goggles giving him a grotesque bugeyed alien appearance i am shirer told him you said the commando turning immediately to the rio what airfield are you from my name is captain walter b vozmite egotake him ordered the commando two of the other spets grabbed the captain shirer instinctively moved to help and felt himself lifted off the ground the pain hitting a moment later the blow to his stomach winding him so acutely that despite the howl of the wind moaning across the icy crust of the island he could hear himself gasping hoarsely his windpipe making a rasping sound as he struggled for breath amid the flashes of the siberian zsu quads and streams of tracer gracefully arcing and climbing skyward he glimpsed his rio at the edge of the cliff what airfield shouted one of the russians holding him anderson wouldnt answer the next second he was gone off the cliff his screams quickly lost beneath the loud rattle of the siberians aa quads jesus shouted shirer you bastards a spets hit him again and he blacked out the navys air attacks from the salt lake city were fierce fearless and ineffective the only thing that they achieved was a pervasive sense among the siberian tunnel garrison of the superiority of their saddam bunker defensive measureslessons learned from the iraqis experience during the massive american and allied bombing of even if the starye perdunyold featsin russias frunze military academy had not absorbed the experiences relayed to them by their pupils the republican guard survivors the lesson of the logistical brilliance of the americans had been duly recorded by the soviets liberation army daily it was not so much the lesson of the uss smart bombs as despite the propaganda spread about by what novosibirsk called the unwitting dupes of the western media the americans laserguided weapons constituted only percent of the total bombs dropped the remainder being world war ii iron bombs some of these turned into gbu guided bomb units with the pave penny laser seeker conversion kits no it was the logistical capability the tooth to tail supply lines feeding and in general maintaining over a quartermillion men and machines with everything they needed from rifle rounds heat high explosive antitank rounds starlight infrared night vision goggles condoms to reduce the percent vd casualty rate of most armies and mre meals ready to eat trays warmed by body heat alone to toothpaste and toilet paper this logistical capability of the americans was in the siberians eyes the real victor of desert storm as the siberians believed that man for man their troops raised born and trained in the arctic were far tougher than the american and british allies the americans were superb at organization and improvisation the commanding officer lieutenant general dracheev pointed out to his twothousandman ratmanov garrison and the american capability was seared into the psyches of the entire garrison the siberians in their saddam tunnel complex now moved with a welloiled efficiency as if some vast collective unconscious had risen from within the great rock to insulate them between ratmanov and the smart bomb attacks only in two places the northeastern end of the island and through a clutch of radar antennae whose bases had become dislodged before they were able to be retracted far enough did shrapnel from the allied bombs permeate killing eight men and wounding a score more even so the integrity of the rock proved anew the feet grudgingly conceded by the us air force and the pilots of the navy tomcats and the beloved grumman ae intruders with their eighteenthousandpound bomb loads coming in from salt lake city that aerial bombardment though it might cause jawsplitting headaches toshnotanausea from shock wave multiples and blurring of ones vision could not win against or even dislodge the deeply dug keepers in the oilcushioned saddam bunkers of ratmanov island lieutenant general dracheev who knew that the sole reason for the ratmanov garrisons existence was to remain an immovable threat and obstacle to the americans obviating the need for novosibirsk to risk precious aircraft over the strait felt secure in his control bunker halfway down the island it had been dug one hundred feet into the solid rock three hundred feet in from the eastern cliff face he peered at the night sky though his infrared periscope which could be used at either the level he was now standing sixty feet below the surface of solid rock or two levels further down in control at the hundredfoot level seeing no sign of enemy activity and assured by his radar controllers that no air traffic could be detected in the local area of the diomedes dracheev headed down toward his bunker from the first periscope level the concrete stairwell was watched over by a kpv vladimirov heavy machine gun post only part of its centimeterlong barrel visible in the ball turret mounted in the door at the machine gun the reinforced concrete stairwell took a downwardsloping uturn to yet another closed door here at the second of the three levels another machinegun inset had to be swung open to allow the commander and his aides into this eightyfoot level of the hundredfootdeep bunker the floor was a twofootthick antidetonator slab of reinforced concrete and high tensile steel the next flight of stairs led to the air lock in the event of chemical attack outside the main command bunker at the onehundredfoot level all three levels were separated by at least ten feet of rock the upper level contained a spets guard detachment whose dormitories canteen and bunks were on the second level which also contained all communications consoles a conference room and two bedrooms for lieutenant general dracheev and his aide a spets colonel the lowest level was comprised of electricity generators water tanks along with air water and sewage filtration units other nuclear shelters like it had been built but this command post had earned its name as a saddam bunker because it had pressurepumped quicksetting rubberized cement poured beneath it as well filling every nook and cranny at the base of the enormous command center with what was effectively a hard rubberized foundation four feet thick that even extended five to six feet outside the bunker to fill the gaps between the hewnout rock shaft and manmade steel walls of the deep rectangular bunker this allowed it not only to withstand the shock waves of a nuclear burst but also to move on the rubberized foundation in the event of earthquakes and other natural realignments that radiated out from the inherently unstable aleutian chain the allies had heard rumors of such bunkers for years ever since the iraqi war when they had failed to get saddam as he moved from bunker to bunker the allies were better acquainted with the layout of the siberian bunkers for the troops it was a fundamentally simple design combining the best german engineering with the best british steel to create a series of interlocking hshaped pipe tunnel garrison complexes drilled out of the basalt the complexes one deep below the northern half of the island the other beneath the southern half consisted of a series of prefabricated hightensile steel sewer pipe tubes or rooms leading off from a connecting cylindrical tunnel corridor to form an h each of the sewerpipeshaped chambers was a onehundredfootlong tenfootdiameter barracks containing at least one hundred troops who slept on folddown bunks at the ends of the tube it was an astonishingly costeffective and efficient design borrowed from the federation of nuclear shelter consultants and contractors each h unit was only one hundred and fifty feet from end to end and barely two hundred feet left to right an extra twenty feet of concrete extended from either side as an added margin of protection for the tubular barracks in twenty h barracks ten north of his command bunker ten south dracheev housed a thousand troops together with a sick bay and kitchen stacked with dried foods the air vents were cleverly concealed at surface level in natural rock chimneys and fissures all equipped with chemical attack filters dracheevs command bunker while midway between the two was not connected by the usual tenfootdiameter tubular bombproof corridor but a narrow twoandahalffootdiameter crawl pipe so that in the event of the islands secure buried land lines somehow being cut and radiotelephone links severed between the three elements communications could be shuttled by the use of runners the tunnel was only wide enough for one man at a time though neither the british nor the americans knew the extent of ratmanovs subterranean defenses freeman en route to alaska doubted that the russians would have failed to make any garrison as bombproof as possible so that even as the b bomber with its shortrange attack missiles taxied down elmendorf runway freeman was addressing himself to the problem dick from force of habit he looked behind him to speak to colonel dick norton who had served as his aide in europe and whom he had requested for this operation momentarily forgetting he was still en route from europe reach isnt it he asked the young major whod been appointed by the pentagon as his interim aide ready and waiting sir i want three soc up here and deployed at cape prince of wales ready for disembarkation in twentyfour hours three soc special operations capable was the name for the twentytwohundredman marine expeditionary unit the smallest magtaf marine airground task force unit out of camp smith hawaii based on the pacific fleets salt lake city carrier yes sir answered reach but even as he conveyed the order to one of the s console operators for encoding he wondered aloud to freeman whether it wouldnt be better to collect the fmpacs hawaiibased marine expeditionary brigade it was a force of almost sixteen thousand fifteen thousand marines and five hundred and fifty navy medical and support liaison staff in turn supported by forty marine av harrier fighter bomber jump jets fs fortyseven assorted amphibious vehicles troopcarrying hovercraft and a hundred helicopters hell said freeman watching their eta for elmendorf air force base change on the computer screen due to strong polar winds were not going ice skating the general could see reach still didnt get it it wont be amphibious dick ah i mean reach johnny isnt it yes sir well it wont be amphibious john i want airborne and fast airborne said reach a chopper assault what hell no responded freeman siberiansd pick em off those heavy assault chinooks like flies with their sams i mean halo highaltitude lowopening chutes drop em right on that goddamn rat island before the rats know whats hit em anyone drifts off target theyll be all right wait on the ice until later marine choppers can pick em up after theyve taken in the mev to mop up major reach was astonished by freemans plan as was the british brigadier now being apprised of freemans request for a seventyman squadron of joint britishamerican troops from the sas special air service unit out of hereford in wales the same unit in which david brentwood lana brentwoods younger brother had so distinguished himself during the sass breaching of moscows innermost defenses but general protested reach dont you think the hovercraft amphibians could launch an assault against the island they have infrared highresolution optics no i dont pressure ridges between the alaskan mainland and diomedes stretch the full twentyfive miles thats no goddamned hockey rink out there reach you ought to know that its pack ice thirty feet thick and roughern grannys tits up and down movin all about those hovercraftd get a good run going on that air cushion then bang an ice ridge big as a house besides itd be a turkey shoot for those rat batteries might as well give em invitations to a ball no major i want the best parachute troops weve got why dont we call fort campbell suggested reach hundred and first airborne get them and their howitzers aboard those big cs they could be up here within twentyfour hours or we could get the eightysecond airbornes ready brigade out of fort bragg douglas freeman looked sternly at reach the young major seemed amiable enough but two things about him were bothering the general the first was that reach either didnt know or had forgotten that the screaming eagles of the st airborne were now only air mobile no longer a parachutedelivered force despite the retention of their gung ho title the second thing was that reach didnt know the eightysecond airborne were still in europe trying along with the brits and us ranger battalions to penetrate the ural mountains on siberias west flank in any event the marine expeditionary unit wasnt to be a spearhead but would only go in after if the sas and any other special forces freeman could dig up could first unplug in the generals words the rats maze that was big diomede reach sir youre fired dont know a goddamn thing about the ice and you still think the eightysecond is in north carolina you also think the oneohone uses chutes nothing personal major but i cant afford to have you around you dont do your homework you get yourself back to g bury yourself in siberiana and if gods with you youll get a second chance with me but not against rat island your ignorance is too damned dangerous son in the silence between the boeings banks of electronic consoles all that could be heard was the boeing itself its four twentyonethousandpound pratt and whitney engines in a steady roar as if endorsing the generals decision by the time the royal canadian air force fs from norad released by headquarters in cheyenne mountain to escort the generals plane for the second half of his journey to alaska were high over the rockies in alberta major john reachs unorthodox firing was known to everyone aboard the boeing and among ground operators from anchorage to nome freeman hoped it would sweep right through alaska command especially through the twentytwo hundred men of the meu and to every pilot aboard the meus four apache attack choppers and those who would be driving the sixteen ch and ch medium and heavylift assault transport choppers to every man and woman associated with operation arctic front that old hardass freeman was back besides if he didnt take rat island the pentagond fire him if he didnt take it hed fire himself freeman called fort bragg to ask for two of the remaining onehundredman delta force companies the best combination of demolition radio and handtohand specialists who with their blood brothers the sas would go in first however delta force command even drafting instructors from its shooting house used for antiterrorist training at bragg could come up with only seventy men at most only as many as the sas would have the remaining sas and delta force already in action trying to take out the siberian prepo sites giant ammunition and fuel dumps believed hidden and wellcamouflaged in the urals most of these were american and british commandos from sas and delta force who in had been dropped behind the lines during the iraqi war looking for the kind of upgraded scuds that some moslem fundamentalist groups were now threatening to use against the british and american southern command that was spread out between the black and caspian seas with sas and delta force commandos combined freeman would have only one hundred and fifty men at most to throw in on the halo jump but with what he had in mind a quick unexpected spearhead attack by the superbly trained british and american commandos it might be enough to bolster that confidence he had personally requested that the survivors of the sas raid into moscow especially young david brentwood who also had the experience of the pyongyang raid behind him be included in the attack freeman also insisted big diomede be referred to as rat island because of the danger of mixing up big diomede and little diomede in the maze of radio transmits that would fill the air once the assault was underway and that if the siberians were stupid enough to risk sending troops across the ice to assault little diomedes patriot antiballistic missile batteries the batteries should be destroyed the last thing freeman said he wanted was casualties from shorts or ad accidental discharge that is friendly fire he knew better than most soldiers that up to percent of all casualties would result from friendly fire anyway after dday in july the us breakout from rommels beachhead defenses into the bocagethe open hedgerow country had been seriously delayed because of shorts second household cavalry he told his new interim aide suffered more casualties preparing for dday than they suffered in the first four months after dday you believe that ah yes i dont know sir its true all right said freeman im sorry sir i didnt know said the aide still unnerved by reachs dismissal no reason you should captain freeman assured him but just about every possibility in war has already been thought of trick is to think of it again freeman smiled you read your history captain its all in there freeman steathed himself against the buffeting of a wind shear that suddenly sucked the plane down in a gutwrenching plunge all the while his gaze remained fixed on the playdough model of ratmanov that hed made up after ordering four loaves of bread from the gallery squeezing the bread into the tooth shape of the island course said freeman theres always the surprise factor rule of thumb told him that for any assault on the island to stand a ghost of a chance he should have a fivetoone advantage but then again thats just what the siberians would expect from the americans a massive chopperborne attack everything came down to a matter of speed the kind of speed the blackhooded sas had used on may cleaning out the iranian embassy taking out all the terrorists and rescuing the hostages in eleven minutes flat with the kind of professionalism and hairtrigger expertise that young brentwood and his sas troop had penetrated the kremlins defenses suddenly freeman was gripped by a bowelchilling fear he recalled the report of at least two navy flyers going down they had ejected safely but no id flares appeared though they would have shown up brilliantly against the snow if the flyers had had time to activate them which meant that the moment his sasdelta force airborne troops landed enemy troops might well be ready to swarm up and out like cockroaches bringing the battle to the allied force before any of the british or americans had landedwhat we need against those rats said freeman is a big can of raid get the elmendorf the air commander yes sir as the young captain contacted elmendorf he tried to figure out what the general was up to you had to start figuring things out with freeman otherwise the hardass would come down on you like a ton of bricks as he heard freeman outlining his latest brain wave to elmendorf the captain couldnt help thinking there were a lot of guys whod like to see hardass on the end of the first chute after the call freeman seemed more relaxed even if preoccupied his calm blue eyes now fixed on the dough model like a chess player noting again how the island sloped steeply westward from the seventeenhundredfoothigh eastern cliffs you could go around the island come in the back door but the island was so small five miles long and three miles at its widest that it didnt matter where you landed a combined sasdelta team of a hundred and forty men providing they didnt land too close to the cliffs edge as the general stared at the cliffs of his makeshift model he was no longer aboard the boeing but back at monte casino where the nazi troops reinforced by ss commandos held off the attacking allies for weeks weeks were something freeman knew he couldnt afford every day lost was another day that the siberians could use to reinforce their far eastern flank it had to be a complete surprise after the air force had roughed up the rats nest with their cruise missiles running his hand through a shock of graying hair freeman kept his gaze on the model trying to think what the siberian commander would do if the cruise missile attack didnt do the trick and if the siberian anticipated an airborne invasion hopefully the missiles would knock out the islands main defenses from the sheer shock of the explosions a piece of crust part of the cliffs edge was swelling as the cabin pressure altered during the boeings descent then fell off we should be so lucky eh general said the captain handing him a coffee they say the spets are their upper crust general yes answered freeman he sounded morose suddenly feeling all eyes on him as if every console operator on the boeing had suddenly become unnerved by his tone freeman adopted an airy friendly mood you know what the upper crust is gentlemen he asked immediately answering his own question lot of crumbs stuck together with dough a few laughs some groans youre right its awful all right then how about this guy comes home and his wife points to the light bulb and says that bulbs been flickering on and off all day its not the bulb it must be the wiring or something will you fix it do i look like an electrician says the guy and flops down in front of the tv get an electrician next day he comes home and she tells him the tap in the basement is dripping driving her nuts will he fix it hey do i look like a plumber he says and flops back down in front of the tv next night he comes home the lights working fine and no more dripping tap you did it yourself he says no she answers that young guy down the lane out of work he fixed them whatd he charge i asked him and he said he didnt want any money either i could go to bed with him or bake him a cake geez says the husband hope you baked him a cake and she says do i look like betty crocker laughter was mixed with the whine of the undercarriage going down buckling up freeman turned to his interim aide you know what causes the largest percentage of preinvasion casualties son airborne sir if you like practice jumps sir chutes that dont open replied the captain friendly fire vehicle accidents said freeman most of our young turks are under twentyfour captain drive like maniacs any man convicted on a speed or recklessdriving offense answers to me personally and his co pays the fine five hundred dollars got it five hundred dollars general first offense a grand for the second yes sir how old are you son twentyone sir freeman nodded now when we reach cape prince of wales dick norton my aide from europe will take over your job in my hq i want you to understand theres nothing personal in this its just that weve got very little time to spring this thing and dick and ive worked before planned the sas moscow raid understand yes sir no problem the young captain was enormously relieved rumor was that when you worked for freeman it was a steam bath twentyfour hours a day seven days a week on call every second and god help you if you screwed up only man that worked harder than freemans aide they said was freeman himself but continued freeman to stress that ive full confidence in you son youre invited along for the jump in a rush like the feeling when hed slithered down the bannister when he was a boy coldbowel fear struck the captain freeman was going to take the airborne in himself given his reputation in the pyongyang raid and the fact that the general had led the allies armored breakout from the dortmundbielefeld pocket it shouldnt have been a surprise but it was dick norton said freeman happily is gonna have a pup goddamn he hates flying course said freeman confidently ill need him to stay behind to coordinate the meu followup hell come in after in the choppers but ill kid him a bit you watch his face captain go white as flour sort of like yours he slapped the captain heartilyjust kidding son no ones going in who hasnt had halo training you come in with the choppers too the captains legs felt weak as the wheels hit then grabbed the tarmac freeman saw the drops of condensation on his window winddriven into long tears just hope to christ that that siberian son of a bitch isnt anticipating an airborne assault course it wont be necessary if that big bird from elmendorf does its job chapter seven in alaska high above the yankee rivers winding ribbon of gray ice that cut through the predawn darkness of the seward peninsulas mountains the four crewmen aboard the rockwell bb its four thirtythousandpound gef turbofans on afterburner could see the two white dots of the diomedes jutting up westward through the white ice pack as the bomber rose to stand off position in a direct line eighty miles from big diomede the bs wings were now fully extended for greater stability as it fired off ten million dollars in the form of eight sram agmbs short range attack missiles each with a one hundred mile range they streaked in eight white contrails from the bombers revolver chamber rotary launcher the bs ewo ignored the missiles the moment the launch was over alert now only to the eaton defensive avionics system another crewman kept a close eye on the singerkearfott inertial navigation system the sound of the earsplitting explosions as the threethousandpound warheads hit big diomedes eastern cliffs was heard almost instantaneously in inalik village on little diomede followed seconds later by the shock wave the latter started loose ice and rock falling it crashed a quarter mile north of the village in a dirty spill of unearthed boulders and rubble that spilled onto the icefringed shore the multiple cracks on the thick ice floes sounded to the villagers like the splitting noise of stiff sealskins drying in the bitterly cold wind meanwhile the commander of little diomedes patriots was primarily concerned about possible soviet air strikes against his hydrauliclegged canisters which for quick action against any incoming missiles bound for alaska needed to be on the surface and ready to go so far he could only conclude that the soviet migs were not being used against little diomede because they were being saved to deter any possible american invasion force across the fiftytwomilewide strait a force that big diomedes radar would give the siberians ample warning of most depressing of all to the patriot commander this minute was the information that he reluctantly had to convey to the general in charge of alaskan air command although the eight srams had all hit big diomede sending bouldersize ice and rock fragments flying over a thousand feet into the air before they rained down on the ice floes a few hitting little diomede there was no apparent in depth damage done to the siberians radarguided zsus for while the enemy cliff face as seen through his infrared goggles was badly scarred the srams explosions had sheared off great sheets of ice that fell crashing down onto the frozen strait over sixteen hundred feet below the impact of the srams had done nothing to silence the deeply revetted missile batteries the enormous and foreboding cliffs of big diomede were impervious it seemed to any attack but that of an atomic bomb a course of action that once initiated would set off a nuclear chain that would destroy both sides for the young captain on little diomede in charge of the patriot defense unit big diomede had grown in menace over the preceding months its summit was often obscured by clouds so sharply it was as if someone had drawn a line with a rule along its fivemile length but this morning as changing pressure ridges from the ice reflected the pale winter sun and the previously downed american aircraft wreckage flickered harmlessly here and there at its base the enemy island seemed more brooding and threatening than ever chapter eight david brentwood was tossing in his sleep willing the snow to stop but the white storm that kept up during the moscow raid wouldnt abate he could smell it the cold fresh tang of the blizzard shot through with the reek of burning armor and through it all the warm metallic whiff of blood from those sas who lay dead in the cathedral of the assumption the latters strangely beautiful gold baroque columns dimly visible in the creeping dawn light as the russians closed the net in the counterattack about the blazing hulk of a t which choir williams had stopped with a round from the little genie a light and disposable french arpac antitank launchermissile pack david felt the heavy weight of the squad automatic weapon weighing him down every muscle aching from the fatigue of the jump and the fierce fighting in and around the cathedral across from the council of ministers he knew the spell in the counterattack couldnt last for long once the enemy grader tank that was rumbling up pushed aside the burning t blocking the remainder of the russian column down to the last three magazines for the saw david selected semiautomatic fire and waited choir williams and a few remaining sas troops having made good their escape covered by david who had ordered them to do so now with only captain cheekdawson the leader of troop c whose job it had been to secure the perimeter against the kremlin guards streaming out of the armory david readied for the russians to attack again cheekdawson having propped himself awkwardly against one of the cathedrals columns his leg shattered to the bone told david to leave him with the saw and the last of the grenades so that he could do a spot of bowling the grader came but a counterattack was halted because of chernkos surrender at minsk but as cheekdawson would have said it had been a nearrun thing as vivid and as immediate as david david it was a soft urgent voice he could smell it too roses yellow summer roses but it was still snowing heavily and he was perspiring sitting up mouth dry as parchment though he was lathered in sweat only then as he became fully awake the outside view not moscow the snowcapped church spire he could see devoid of the onion domes of the kremlins inner sanctuary did he realize that he was looking at the small church at laugharne and the snow that was falling was disappearing into carmarthen bay the outflow of the river taft and in the distance there was the open sea indistinct the defeated rays of the sun rising over llanrhidian sands smothered by sudden bad weather that had swept all the way down from the brecon beacons in southeastern wales where the sas trained down over west glamorgan county to swansea and the mouth of the bristol channel poor boy you have been in a state david was catching his breath embarrassed that georgina should have seen him experiencing the recurring nightmare following in my brothers footsteps he had happily put it when he had written home telling his folks of visiting the spences in surrey during roberts last leave in england before robert had been recalled from the us sub base at holy loch in scotland to command the uss reagan in surrey hed not only met his older brothers new wife the former rosemary spence but her younger sister georgina the smart money in the family meaning that of davids father retired admiral john brentwood predicted from his eldest sons letters home that georgina wasnt young davids type his skepticism was fueled though he didnt know the details by the failure of his daughters marriage to jay la roche what types that davids mother had asked her husband robert says shes pretty very well educated london school of economics and political a lefty declared the admiral who had definite views on everything from lse graduates to the conviction that battleships were totally obsolete that if the navy had any sense it would build more fast guidedmissile frigates like the blaine in which his middle son ray had served instead of spending millions refurbishing old battle wagons like the wisconsin and missouri purely for sentimental reasons how can you say that asked his wife catherine build more boats like the blaine that boat nearly killed him it was not a boat catherine its a ship i regret what happened to ray as much as anyone it was but all that medical stuff is over catherine hes a distinguished skipper of it was horrible said catherine the stuff john brentwood was referring to was the other side of a theory about fast light modern ships that like the hms sheffield were so badly gored in the falklands one hit and they burst into flames the fire reaching temperatures unknown in earlier warships with the aluminum superstructures white hot within minutes many of the crew would the not from the intense heat of the conflagration but from the overwhelming toxic gases given off by everything from synthetic carpeting in the officers mess to the resins and plastics used in the hightech electronic consoles when the blaine had been hit off korea it sent the first of what the medical establishment euphemistically referred to as unprecedented burn cases to san diegos veterans burn center many had died and it took more than a dozen sessions under general anesthesia and the most intricate plastic surgery before ray brentwoods face had regained even the faintest resemblance to his former self admiral john brentwood more afraid in fact than catherine of feeling the horror had tried his best to rise above it it sounded noble but in the long dark nights he suspected it was not so much an act of bravery as of escape anyway he told catherine we were talking about this georgina spence davids not the intellectual type you mean he isnt smart of course hes smart but she sounds a bit hoitytoity to me degree in political science and you may know a lot about boats john but youve a lot to learn about women davids probably attracted to her because shes got brains lord you dont want an airhead for a daughterinlaw do you besides you didnt mind robert marrying her sister and shes a school teacher thats different proclaimed the admiral more wellnow theyve got the young one coming along this georgina on the other hand doesnt seem the marrying type then youve got nothing to worry about its this shackingup business retorted john brentwood oh so thats it you think she might be preggers as the english say well arent you concerned fiddlesticks i gave up worrying about that a long time ago after ray i didnt think hed live through that ordeal and i vowed to god that if he did if beth their children that family came through together id quit worrying about things that dont matter dont matter you tell the pregnant doesnt matter of course it does but davids a grown man john you still think of him as a little boy yes he said and paused i do john your sons have been decorated by the president of the united states and if young david has survived that maelstrom in europe dont you think he can take care of himself in bed not the same i should hope not im glad hes not in combat he might be if he marries too soon by god catherine ive seen domestic situations in the services make your hair stand on end like sailing into a typhoon husbands away at sea for months at a time you cant expect well weve stayed together havent we anyway david isnt in the navy and for another thing hes about to be demobilized the admiral normally tightlipped about such matters decided that it was time to enlighten catherine about something that normally wasnt discussed even between husband and wife catherine davids in the army yes but he volunteered for sas i know that but you only know that because those blabbermouths on tv have no regard for military security if id had my way i wouldnt have allowed anything to be printed about the raid on moscow for my money every damn blabbermouth on those networks would john dont go on about what youd do to peter arnett besides i dont think its anatomically possible with a cannon the admiral scowled catherine patting his armwhat were you going to say about david hes on the sasdelta force list theyre on twentyfourhour call catherine especially during crises like this like what good god catherine siberias decision to oh that im sure theyre bluffing bluffing woman havent you been watching the news you told me i shouldnt watch tv i didnt say you shouldnt watch it i said you shouldnt believe any of the goddamn then why watch it and dont swear it makes you sound like a lefty while admiral brentwood was fuming his youngest son was calm made so by georgina spences attentions but there was nothing inactive about his serenity the blood pumping through him with every caress the old stone cottage turned motel was a favorite among sas because it was no more than fifty miles from brecon beacons the threethousandfoothigh twin peaks east of carmarthen bay that marked the site of the most gruelling commando courses in the world hed chosen the cottage carefully for he could be back in hereford sas hq in a matter of hours should the call ever come but here in laugharne he and georgina were away from it all in the world of under milk wood not twenty minutes from the tiny roughandready room with the copy of van goghs bedroom tacked on the worn white wall where the drunken genius of dylan thomas had poured forth its heart for georgina despite what her father had earlier referred to as her somewhat radical politics or perhaps because of them the room had quite unexpectedly become a shrine when her cool reason happened upon the banal yet arresting truth of the heart that the heart hath reasons that reason cannot know georgina snuggled dose to him holding him the panicfilled disorientation of the nightmare drained from him as she gently nibbled a lobe of his ear the nails of her trailing sensuous touch stroking him until all thoughts of the moscow raid were replaced by visions of her astride him gently rocking back and forth her hair softly whipping his chest her lips against his but for now georgina hadnt moved from where she was but he knew she would stop stroking him soon taking off the engagement ring and he would moan oh god no which meant yes but tease the a little longer then slowly she would rise from the bed fending him off and walk about the room wearing his khaki drill shirt slipping on pulling up her panties slowly swaying like a tart in front of him and then holding onto the two bedstead knobs at the end of the bed gently pushing herself thrusting against the brass bars moving sideways against them no more he begged she pretended not to hear him then suddenly she pulled the cord of the overhead light and all was in darkness he would have to find her when he did she switched the light on i love you she said and enjoyed watching him watch her well do it she told him any way every way until youre sore he moaned his arms outstretched feeling for her hair love you he said in answer her tongue slid down on him her lips tight about him sliding back and forth with a furious intensity chapter nine deep in ratmanovs control bunker lieutenant general dracheev was stressing the importance of a quick response to his specialpurpose forces or spets emphasizing how the moment any enemy paratroopers were detected or even suspected of being dropped on the island fortress the spets teams must go out and engage pomnite antverpen remember antwerp dracheev reminded them cut them to pieces before they even touched ground as general douglas freeman stepped out of his plane onto the rainpolished tarmac at elmendorf and a push of reporters some in anoraks their hoods up against the pelting rain crowded about him he was handed an urgent message from the white house it read under no condition are you to personally lead airborne assault general j grey jcs freemans first order upon arriving at cape prince of wales was that the cbn reporter was to get off little diomedeposthaste another cbn reporter who challenged him on this order had a followup question is it true general that youve referred to the siberians as rats well they sure as hell arent family retorted freeman some of the british reporters from itn thought this was rather good but the cbn reporter was determinedly grimraced is it true general that you said well pound them so hard he consulted his notestheyll have to pipe in sunlight i did not wish i had the cbn lead story flashed around the world was that general freeman called the siberians vermin as this was being received by enemy troops as well as those at home the cbn reporter in what he said would probably be his last broadcast from little diomede because of the generals extraordinary order that no newsmen were to remain on the island asked the general via the satellite linkup whether he was conscious of the extremely delicate ecological system of the arctic and did he have any information on what adverse effects would be produced on the environment because of the imminent bombing of ratmanov island well sir answered freeman looking at the video hookup of the cbn reporter on the forlorn western side of little diomede the same bitter arctic wind tearing at the gaggle of microphones thrust before freemans race and flapping the eskimostyle hood of the cbn man seems youre a lot less worried than i am about the environment what do you mean general asked the reporter somewhat nonplussed by the unexpected retort all the reporters at the conference were now looking at the linkup picture of the cbn reporter on little diomede that blue fur collar on your hood said freeman arctic fox isnt it the reporters face was turning red i dont know general freeman looked grim i respectfully suggest sir that you find out blue arctic fox is on the endangered species list one of the most beautiful animals on gods earth crying shame to be butchering them just to keep us warm you should know the general turned to all of the reporters clustered about him some of them wearing identical parkas that it is strict defense department policy not to use animal fur in deference to our concern for the environment synthetics only and that goes for everything from gloves to full winter uniform that true asked colonel dick norton the generals aide yes it is dick my god did you see that greenpeace fella thought hed have a goddamn stroke right on the spot thatll break up their marriage with the media for a while ill tell you stopping pulling on his gloves tightly he told the general of alaska air command i want that cbn joker off little diomede now and if he doesnt go enquired a brassy cbn news crew chief out of anchorage freeman ignored the newsmans question he had learned his lesson in iraq to give them a deadline by which they had to remove the reporter from the island might be to let slip an approximate eta for the new wave of us bombers he was asking alaska air command to send over ratmanov instead freeman told the news chief that little diomede would undoubtedly be suspected by the russians of being a laser indicator bouncing lasers off suspected soviet sam and radar sites to provide slide cones down which laserguided bombs could plummet to their targets with pinpoint accuracy in fact no such plan was afoot the laser designators would be the attacking aircraft themselves freeman entered his mobile trailer which was dug deep in the alaskan tundra on cape prince of wales and gave his second order for alaska air command to undertake another bombing run against ratmanov if it was effective it would give the enemy commander a surprise freeman doubted he could anticipate kneeling beside his cot freeman prayed that he would be proven wrong that rat island might be neutralized quickly and effectively as he made his supplication he could hear the sonic booms racing across the tundra only fifty miles away from the enormity that was siberia it was only a few pinpricks of light on the amber screen at first and the siberian operator on the eighttomidnight watch deep in ratmanov control dismissed it as possibly a burst of white noise caused by the notoriously changeable arctic atmosphere but the next second the top third of the screen was a haze of tiny lights and he knew what it was he called the officer of the watch khlamchaff he told the lieutenant strips of foil cut to various wavelengths to clutter the radar overloading it with incoming signals as a cover for another air attack the only good thing about the chaff was that it meant the americans couldnt use laser slides the chaff would cut the beam outboard personnel stand up it was the sergeant aboard the c transport high above the chaff finishing his air safety check hookup check static line aw shit responded the air force corporal not seeing any humor in the sergeant sticking to normal jump procedure and wanting to get the hell out of rat air space before white tails siberian surfacetoair missiles began streaming up through the darkness push em out sarge lets get the fuck outta here outside in the black void the stars were so bright the corporal felt he could reach out and grab them but below the thundering roar of the airplane the blackness was absolute the dark camouflage mushrooms of the t static line were quickly disappearing into the swirling clouds of arctic air so cold that even with full thermal issue the corporals throat felt a hot burn of the freezing arctic air the fifteenfoot yellow static lines fluttered now like ribbons above the swirling chaffriven night in ratmanovs complexes one and two north and south the guttural klaxons sounded like submarines diving as smudgefaced spets zipped up white overlays snatched weapons from the rack and raced for the spiral exit shafts that wound one hundred feet through the rock up to the windswept surface of the barren snowroofed island ready to engage the enemy before they even touched ground five minutes later two stealth fas swept in low at miles an hour on a southnorth run even at this subsonic speed they were over the fivemilelong island in twentyseven seconds most of the chaff had now dissipated and siberian radar picked up one of the stealths via ultraw frequency radar and fired an sa but missed even though the spets were already out and had closed the triplearmor manhole covers of the exits the infrared video taken by the stealths in their twentysevensecond overflight revealed the exits the latters he or heat emission spots distinct against the snow showing up on the video film like white overexposed blurs on a negative the moment he was awakened and given the information ten exits five north five south of the islands midpoint freeman ordered them cmrd computer map referenced it was done in less than five minutes while his staff was exultant with the way he had dropped weighted chutes duping the ratmanov commander into sending out his troops and so revealing the exitentrance positions freeman was too busy to celebrate alright jim he told his air commander tell your boys were going to give em the can of raid make up for what those cruise missiles of yours failed to do get them to drop three laserguided babies on each of those exits twothousand pounders mightnt do the trick but its bettern dropping dumb proximity iron bombs the whooping continued in the revetted mobile home that was freemans prince of wales hq you suckered em general freeman told everyone to quiet down it was true he had tricked the siberians a bunch of hotshot spets now running across the snow shooting at dummies or whatever the air force could put on the end of a chute to simulate an airborne attack on the russian radar but if the laserguided bombs didnt blow up the exits penetrate and spit some fire down the seams between the exit plates and rock then hed have to go in with the airborne after all just pray those bombs do the job gentlemen freeman told them someone whod lost a buddy in one of the fs mumbled that so far god hadnt been listening chapter ten across the dark blue of dutch harbor on unalaska island the first big island near alaska in the aleutian chain lana la roche née brentwood and elizabeth ryan a black nurse from boston could see the bobbing lights of the fishing boats that normally plied the seas north of the aleutian arc south of the ice pack the harbor this evening was fairly glistening with the dipping lights of the small but powerful deepsea trawlers that had run for cover in the harbor before a clump of arctic fronts that were en route from the pole with kilometerperhour winds in the offing i thought said lana easily there was supposed to be a blackout in progress you know what those fishermen are like honey said elizabeth who had done her nurses training with lana on the east coast at a joint uscanadian navy hospital in halifax and from which lana had been officially transferredin effect exiled for having given a young dying british seaman a womans caring touch aboard an allied hospital ship the head nurse at the hospital and on board the ship matron scud socalled because it was said that you never knew where she and her broomstick would land had been outraged by lanas unprofessional conduct so had lana for about five seconds then she realized she had only been guilty of being a woman who had given a dying man sexual release something that because of his youth and his very proper middleclass british upbringing hed hitherto not experienced besides it wasnt as if theyd actually been in the bed together but it made no difference to matron and so lana had been sent to americas siberiathe aleutians yet despite the fact that she didnt like her posting in dutch harbor that she always felt cold she never regretted doing what she had done for the young englishman look at what had ensued from it his personal effects had been returned to his parents in england by lanas eldest brother robert a submariner when he had taken leave from holy loch in scotland robert had met rosemary spence the boys eldest sister and ended up marrying her till it hits them like a williwaw theyll keep the lights blazing said elizabeth a williwaw was the hundredmileanhour wind that along with fog and rain and sunshine which could all occur within half an hour made the climate of the bering sea one of the most unpredictable and harshest on earth it was one of the reasons lana was so deeply touched by elizabeth having voluntarily transferred to dutch harbor to be with her i hope theyre right responded lana that it doesnt get this far south the fighting i mean you heard from your sweetie pie asked elizabeth as they headed for the bridge that led over to the clutter of buildings and what little night life there was in the harbor no sighed lana her hands folded sending a piece of ice skittering across the road as they made for the dirty shoulder of salt and snow to allow an army truck to pass they were heading for stormys restaurant their big adventure for the week to try some greek chicken one of the house specialties such outings from the naval base were rare now that the hospital like so many other bases from fort ord to faslane in scotland were reopening after only recently being closed down because of the russian surrender at minsk the hospital staff found themselves shorthanded everyone was working extra shifts preparing for what they all hoped would never happen massive casualties coming in from the battles on and across the bering sea she hadnt heard from frank for a month or so but knew it wouldnt be long before he was mainland bound to the naval air base at elmendorf with two war tours in the pacific behind him during one of which he had shot down the mig fulcrum stateoftheart fighter flown by soviet ace sergei marchenko as theyd mixed it up over the yalu river in korea though shirers radio intercept officer in the tomcat hadnt seen a chute and theyd both seen a pinheadsized blossom that must have been the fulcrum crashing into the frozen wastes of manchuria there had grown in shirers mind a nagging doubt about whether the russian had gone down with his plane meanwhile the twentysevenyearold shirer had been celebrated except in the la roche papers for having shattered the myth of the marchenko invincibility among allied pilots wheres he going to asked elizabeth elmendorf said lana he might already be there uhhuh murmured elizabeth scuttlebutt was rife around any base in any war theyd all been told that and how rumors were sometimes spread by the enemy just to eat away at morale so no way elizabeth was going to tell lana that there was a rumor floating around that salt lake city was in the thick of it launching air strikes against some russian island up in the strait that some planes had been shot down anyway maybe lana was right and her man was safe and sound at elmendorf you know something elizabeth lana asked stopping elizabeth kept walking glancing backhoney youll freeze your ass off you dont keep on truckin elizabeth whatve you heard elizabeth stopped and turned around all right i heard that nogood husband of yoursmister la roche has been living pretty high off the hog i mean girls lots of em papers are full of it they say lana shrugged it wouldnt be in the papers if he didnt want it known he likes to show off big shot big kid they dont print the rest of it elizabeth was starting off again lana catching up their thicktread winter boots cracking the brittle ice their breaths clouds of steam above their anoraks the icecrystalline air so clear the moon looked like a huge communion wafer you want to talk about it honey said elizabeth ever the willing ear to her friends no said lana you wouldnt believe it honey nuthini mean nuthin fazes lizabeth ryan ive seen them all no you havent thought lana but she said nothing trying not to think of jay la roche trying to ignore the fact he wouldnt give her a divorce he loved power and wouldnt let go of anything it wasnt enough that he owned the huge chemicalarms la roche multinationals from new york to shanghai to paris he had to control everyone and everything in his world lack of control spelled not only humiliation for jay la roche but the secret fear of madness yet the great irony she knew was that he was already mad clinically certifiable but his power was a moat around his castle keep that normal society could not cross his tabloids would smear anyone who tried his lawyers would do the rest hey said elizabeth isnt it your birthday next month you know my blood type too said lana smiling trying harder now to forget jay la roche how one night the last terrible night in shanghai before shed left or more accurately escaped in one of his drinking bouts hed poured whiskey on it and pushed it into her mouth telling her if she didnt suck it dry ill bash your fucking head in and if she threatened to take him to court hed use his tabloids not on her but to smear shit all over your loveydovey ma and pa the big fucking admiral and mrs fucking admiral and then later in the gray of the china dawn hed come in to her like a whipped spaniel stale boozy breath telling her he was sorry that he loved her and the most awful part of it was her knowing he meant it that he couldnt control his other self the one beneath the public persona beneath the lean suave richindustrialist smile the one that turned every act of love into a depraved ritual obsessive and obscene hes a survivor said elizabeth and for a moment lana thought she meant jay hes probably got his feet up in elmendorf said elizabeth heartily chewing the fat with some other hotshot pilot probably writing you a letter this minute oh lordy will you look at that now it was a marine sergeant stepping out of a humvee the driver making a uturn so the vehicle was facing back toward the town as the sergeant driver approached the two nurses my said elizabeth huskily id sure like to mother him elizabeth said lana as the sergeant kept walking toward them yes maam elizabeth continued unabashed he could spect my plumbin any day mind you hed have to say please maam pretty please hussy said lana thats me boston boobs you lookin for me sergeant ah ah yes maam you lieutenant brentwood i am said lana maam said the sergeant snapping a salute they said you were heading over to stormys yes there was an awkward silence and all lana could hear was the spitting of the humvees exhaust its long bluish white curl trailing up behind the truck then suddenly disappearing in the pristine night air maam the sergeant saluted again and gave her the brownwidow envelope it was stiff with cold she couldnt open it with her mittens and elizabeth did it for her but didnt read it despite her almost legendary selfcontrol lana was crying the tears freezing her cheeks can we give you a lift maam lana looked at elizabeth she needed help elizabeth told the sergeant to forget stormys to return them to the base then halfway back she thought perhaps they should have gone to stormys after all do something anything she didnt know they returned to the base thank you sergeant said elizabeth noting the mans name patch dukowski ah inside the quonset hut lana was collecting herself surprised at how poorly shed handled it good grief she sobbed to elizabeth i deal with this every week on the wards i mean i used to elizabeth handed her a mug of coffee that lana held between her knees for warmth she began rocking gently back and forth like an old woman and it bothered elizabeth more than when lana had first read the fax hell honey elizabeth tried to assure her never the same till it hits you no said lana no it isnt now you listen to me lana that dumb old fax says mia that doesnt mean well if hes mia he could be on the ice pack up there bettern in the drink elizabeth looked up at the curved ceiling of the quonset hut no matter that it wasnt a ward everything smelled of antiseptic man i never thought id be thanking god it was winter i dont understand said lana well summertime theyd be in the water freezin water they stand a better chance out there on the ice they lana was confused two guys in a tomcat lana oh i know all about tomcats honey said elizabeth smiling i like em lana tried to be cheerful in kind but everything about her the darkness about the quonset hut the smells of the hospital of fresh coffee brewing oppressed her the very air suddenly too heavy and the forlorn howl of the arctic wind soulcrushing other nurses nurses who had lost loved ones said it was the not knowing that was the worst not knowing for sure whether they were alive or dead but lana felt no such yearning for a definite answer so long as they werent certain definite knowns there was hope that frank had been rescued or as elizabeth had said was on the ice waiting to be rescued what frightened her most was that now when she wanted desperately to remember every detail of her and franks intimacy of his strength and gentleness when they made love she couldnt see him clearly in her minds eye it had happened before at moments when it seemed that she had wanted him too much jay la roches face on the other hand was so clear his jealousy and hate so palpable it was as if he were a presence in the room with his contemptuous smile of victory his eyes cokesniffing bright and alive chapter eleven not one of the two thousand men in the two anges alaska national guard eskimo scouts believed that the fourfootdiameter eighthundredmilelong pipeline that snaked its way from prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope through the majestic brooks mountains over the yukon river and down to valdez on alaskas south coast could be adequately protected neither did joe mell joe wasnt in the eskimo scouts and mell wasnt his real name but white men could never get athabascan names right so he called himself mell fucking eskimo was what one of the whites had called him joe never forgot it along with all the other insults all right he said taking another suck of southern comfort looking down morosely at his snowshoes hed made them the traditional way from birch and used caribou rawhide for the lacing so the pink noses thought he was a dumb eskimo all they saw was a native with no teeth left and a rubbery smile he took another drag at the southern comfort what did they know pink nose big shots from the oil companies down south coming up with their prefabricated houses to give to all the natives no problem pops theyd said you just stick em together yeah well the pink noses didnt think he knew about bethel town far to the southwest where the kuskokwim river flows into the bering sea the big shots had guys put all the prefabricated huts up in the summer but come the winter they all started to crack and buckle joe took another belt of the southern comfort swallowed and grinned sod houses were still the best had a soul they knew the arctic winds and ice sod houses didnt fight the weather like the white man sod houses let their earth give a little here and there and the wind understood no crazy stiff doors either only sealskin storm entrances that started way back from the house in the earth and angled up to keep out the snow all white men werent bad though or stupid one from the other side of the ice bridge the other big country had paid him in the cold war a lot of money and booze with a promise of much more if the hot war broke out joe was to break the long silver snake it wasnt a big pipe all you had to do was wait for the next blizzard so thered be no tracks found after and wrap a belt of hide about the fourfootdiameter pipe with the white package attached to the belt you pushed the white button and you had five minutes plenty of time to get away even in deep snow the man said then the rest of the money us dollars would come and whose country was it anyway when some pink noses bought alaska the rest of the pink noses booed them said it wasnt worth anything so how come the pink noses had come up in the thousands it sure didnt belong to the native people anymore the pink noses from across the strait werent much better they stopped the eskimo people from walking across the ice to meet their cousins and took everybody off the big island because some big pink nose secret had been going on there one of the pink noses from across the strait said one of their sailors called bering discovered alaska joe had known it was there all the time another thing he knew the pipeline didnt belong here it was like a scar on the land as if a beautiful chukchee woman had taken her kk blubber knife and slashed it across her face it was a desecration but if you put the strap on the silver snake would the fire despoil the land no the russian pink nose had told him not at all the fire will only burn the oil then joe knew the white men sucking the oil from the north slope would have to stop those who had insulted his athabascan forebears with filthy talk about eskimos wouldnt try to scar the land again theyd know what could happen joe heard the wounded cry of the land in the arctic storm and knew it would not end until he had placated its soul healed its hurt unhurriedly he put on his kamleika the gut raincoat that once belonged to his father and taking the hide strap and its package he crawled out through the sealskin storm trap and called the dogs now like white lumps of sugar in the swirling snow from his sod house through the village to the stretch of pipeline that bent in a long gentle curve in the frozen valley of the dietrich river on to the southern side of the mighty brooks range the pink noses even gave their names to the sacred places would take only half an hour the silver snake would now be caked in an icy sheet running alongside the wide gravel trail from fairbanks in the center of alaska to prudhoe bay on the beaufort sea the pink noses called it the dalton highway he took another swig from the bottle worst of all some of his people had been traitors had gone into the pink nose courts and palavered for money to allow the silver snake to despoil the land joe looked intently at the dogs only the lead husky had turned and paid him any mind they were tired and he was tired and he took another suck at the bottle then murmured to the dogs in the dialect of his parents who had come from galena far to the west but the dogs didnt know his parents dialect as he only used it when he was drunk throwing the empty bottle away he reverted to the dialect again shouting into the wind the words meaning to hell with it ill use the skidoo unsteadily he pulled the starter cord at least a dozen times and fell over once before the skidoo gave forth its crackling roar it backfired several times before settling into its highpitched whine he told himself the greenpeace noses would be as happy as he was because they were the only pink noses who understood about desecrating mother nature the skidoo plowed into heavy drift but joe gave the throttle sleeve more twist and the steering skis went straight through it dogs were scattering in the village as he whooped at them an old man shouting at joe telling him that he must show more respect for the dogs but joe was already through the hamlet snowcurtained birch slipping by him on either side of the trail he knew like the back of his hand the irony of the whole situation was that joe mell was considered by the siberian military intelligence canvasser as one of the least reliable of the halfdozen natives they had suborned and the least likely to succeed in the mission on ratmanov island more than two hundred spets commandos streaming out of the exits fired at the descending shapes as they became visible only a few meters from the ground had they been paratroopers coming down it would have been a massacre the spets marksmanship with the aks was highly accurate they hit everything that had been used to weigh the chutes down it took the whiteuniformed spets all but invisible against the snow only two or three minutes to realize theyd been obmanutyhadand fearing an air attack they quickly retreated to the exitentrances like ants being vacuumed back into their deep hive leaving the dozens of american chutes buffeted by wind and rain mixed with snow in the swirling blizzard now blanketing the island make sure the engineers have doublechecked the exitentrance seals ordered dracheev theyre already doing it comrade general good the americans are obviously going to use their smart bombs they have deceived us into betraying our exit points the chaff must have covered the approach of a reconnaissance aircraft their smart bombs cannot take out the saddam entrances said his aide but his voice betrayed more hope than conviction the general asked his radar chief if there were any signs of another american air attack on its way there were none his aides crowded around him the smell of sweat mixing with the oily odor of the tunnel complexes gun emplacements on rails behind sealed doors at the cliff face general dracheev was biting his bottom lip as he bent over the tables map trace computer consoles giving immediate zoom blowups on the screen whenever he touched any part of the island map he was worried the whole point of having made ratmanov selfcontained selfsufficient was so that it could survive without novosibirsk having to risk vitally needed aircraft over the narrow strait but now the american freeman would know where the exits were and he was bound to send in air strikes though the heavy snowfall would work in dracheevs favor effectively cutting the american flyers laser beams even so the only exits dracheev could now use with any reliability were the two emergency exits r a quarter mile from complex one at the midpoint of the northern half of the island and r above complex two on the southern end of the island the same distance from dracheevs control bunker two exits for up to two thousand spets it had the makings of a disaster dracheev knew that if he failed to hold the americans until novosibirsk hq had time to reinforce the siberian coastal defenses it would be best if he stayed on the island rather than make a run for it aboard his chopper to the mainland for he would almost certainly be shot for his failure but then he had what he called his osenivshaya ideya brain waveborn of the fear of what would happen if he didnt hold the island and from the deep anger he had experienced at being duped by the american freemans fake paratroopers a humiliation made worse for dracheev by the fact that in addition to his regular troops manning the islands underground aa network he was answerable for the effective use of the spets siberias elite force we dont have much time he quickly told his aides in ratmanov control well use two emergency exits exit one for complex one exit two for complex two eto originalno thats original murmured one of the spets but dracheev did not demand an apology he had made a serious mistake sending out the spets before he had visual confirmation that they were really allied paratroopers descending and not dummies and the spets had every right to expect him to correct it i m confident he told them that the smart bombs while they may take out one or two of the exits the americans have discovered will not samolyoty vraga priblizhayutsyahostile aircraft approaching rising from seward peninsula all secondlevel plates are to be sealed dracheev ordered he meant each exits number two hatch slotted in at the sixtyfoot level in every onehundredfoot spiral stair exit had to be sealed like the hatches of a diving submarine just in case any of the smart bombs highexplosive charges were despite the lack of laser beam accuracy lucky enough to blow out the top saddam seal within minutes the bombs started to fall the lights in control flickered momentarily as circuits were broken and auxiliary generators kicked in general dracheev his legs shaking involuntarily from the smart weapons bombardment turned anxiously and angrily to his aide the american flyer we captured do you think he knows what freemans strategy is he hasnt talked yet general hes a tough customer weve tried to then try again snapped dracheev the aide nodded to one of the two spets nearby anyone can be made to talk with pleasure said the spets who on his way down the corridor announced matteroffactly to his colleague the generals right everyone has their breaking point even you asked the other spets challengingly yes of course i couldnt withstand what im about to do to that american bastard youll see electronic monitors were telling general dracheev that four of the manhole covers had been breached and that the other six should not have their secondary hatches opened even after the air raid had ended for fear of redhot debris raining down the shaft then thats decided it general dracheev told his spets commando leader we only use the two emergency exits your menll have to move swiftly to get out in time to do what asked the spets commander red lights were blinking all over at the control centers console indicating that rock flour thick in the air from the bombs had choked off some of the air filters overheating them soon the red lights faded the backup filters holding and the duty officer informed him that all electronic indications were that the six exits he had decided not to use might be usable after all dracheev however would not be deterred from his plan he never doubted for a second that an allied airborne assault would now follow but to use the six exits would be suicidal they were almost certainly pinpointed by the americans and would be among the first targets should another bombardment precede the allied troop drop only this time dracheev told them theyd outwit the americans to this end he called a hasty radio conference of the ten company commanders of the two spets battalions he told the commanders the alliesll realize they cannot bomb us out that no matter how many bombs they drop ultimately they will have to use troops in this gentlemen we have the overwhelming advantage for when they try to dig us out they cant be dropping bombs on their own men he turned to the spets commander his tone crisp with confidence the spets commander a full colonel soon understood the reason for the generals rush of confidence dracheev was good on his feet a commander who didnt need hours to ponder a problem and used the american generals initiative as a spur to his own the spets commander heartily endorsed the plan it was brilliant and would cut the americans to pieces the colonel also knew that a citation from general dracheev for the ratmanov victory would slash his waiting time for an apartment in half he told his battalions political officer the zampolit that he almost felt sorry for the enemy dracheevs assumption was that the american general would attack soon after the bombing had shot its wad and attack quickly the american would know that every hour he failed to breach ratmanovs defenses was that much more time for the far eastern tvd to build up siberias eastern flank some of the chukchee members of the spets men chosen for their special knowledge of the area didnt like general dracheev as he was a yakut from central siberia but even so they like the spets commander had to admit grudgingly that he was making it easier for them it would be nothing more than a seal hunt all youd have to do after is go out and club them american cigarettes gold teeth watches burial would be the hardest job of course the american dead would be frozen solid no good covering them up with the snow come spring the stench would keep even walrus away best thing the yakuts believed would be to burn them but general dracheev probably wouldnt allow that fuel consumption being one of his priorities so in the end the corpses would be left to the blue foxes and the murres the birdsd clean them to the bone come spring and there were the golden eagles from alaska a feast for the spets the idea of american eagles eating american dead was appealing and spawned many a joke as they waited for freeman to take the bait freeman standing in his blastprotected mobilehome hq was dwarfed by the wall map of the bering sea he donned his reading glasses and contemplated the diomedes halfway across the funnel showing up on the aerial recon photos as white fists thrusting up through the ice im glad youre here dick he said turning to welcome colonel richard norton a solidly built amiable at times intensely serious fivefooteight logistics officer and new yorker whod been with freeman in europe but there was no time to talk over old times freeman told the colonel that the siberian commander wouldnt be caught with his pants down twice other problem dick is half these jokers dont know a damn thing about arctic warfare like those poor bastards washington sent up to the aleutians in fortytwo in summer uniform no wonder the japs were all over them i told the quartermaster this evening to make everything ready for an airborne attack on ratmanov jump time an hour before civil twilight hell he thought i was talking about some dame called sybil then he thought it was the end of the day so i told him first light eleven oh six hours said norton taking his cap off running his fingers through hair as gray as freemans sunset around seventeen fortyone correct now dick i go in with the airborne at civil and exactly one hour later earlier if we radio or fire red flaresyou come in with the marine choppers freeman put the glasses back on tearing off an incoming meteorological report on the fax looking down over his reading glasses at norton he said didnt think youd be too keen on a halo dick norton had a flashback to the time hed been ordered by freeman to fly in the back seat of an fb from krefeld to brest to hurry up air resupply from the french port for the beleaguered fifth and seventh american corps and the british army of the rhine in the dortmundbielefeld pocket to this day norton could actually feel nauseated just thinking about the terrifying night flight in the supersonic fighter hurtling through space and you couldnt see a damn thing and it wasnt nearly as smooth as it appeared from the ground everything shook im not too keen on any kind of jump general norton replied you clear this with washington the mission of course no sir said norton looking at the maps order of battle clustered around galena field from where the marines would take off i mean you leading the drop personally dick said freeman turning to the map tapping the map using his glasses as a pointer main problem is going to be the palletized drops were going to need hundred and five millimeters now rat islands big enough but our guys are going to be spread all over it jamming c plastique in every goddamn crack we find well have to smoke em out same way we did with the japs on iwo jima same situation here theyre dug in deep and siberians havent surrendered a fight in except for the weather interjected norton what same as iwo jima except for the weather minor detail said freeman grinning you know general its minus twenty degrees over that ice pack how do you know that asked freeman not disputing nortons assertion but intrigued as to how he knew the specific temperature on the pack i can read upsidedown type general remember norton indicated the fax freeman was holding anchorage says the satellite cloud cover indicates twentymileanhour winds that drops the temperature to minus fortysix chilly said freeman before norton could object further freeman slapped his arm on nortons shoulder dick you see by god youre the right man for the job no one else in this godforsaken peninsula knows that windchill factor except every eskimo thought norton details dick you and i know thats what wins wars and strategy general thats my department dick said freeman turning to the map slipping his reading glasses back on and gods there wasnt a trace of insincerity his right hand swept across the bering strait speed dick thats what we need now we know where all those rat holes are im personally going to see every one of those blown up then you know what im going to do im going to drop high explosives down those rat holes itll be surrender or the for them dick white flag or beef jerky if there are spets on that island general and intelligence suspects there are therell be no surrender i know dick said freeman pausing solemnly i know we wont butcher them im not a butcher my sasdelta teamll give them fair warning for several moments there was silence broken only by the howling of the arctic wind outside bout two seconds ive thought it through dick ive tried to think of every damn detail but i know its still a gamble he turned to look straight at norton ultimately all great victories are times against us but i say go norton nodded which meant that though he saw the generals logic and the military necessity as clearly as hed seen the giant bergs on the way over from europe glinting like glass castles beneath the arctic moon he couldnt share in freemans enthusiasm never had freeman was a warrior to the bone brave and unapologetic in his quest for glory all dick norton hoped for was that he would be alive after the war when he would be quite happy to retire mind and body intact he had fought in the snows of minsk by freemans side and did not doubt the generals determination and sas and delta were the besttrained to jump from high altitudes and make pinpoint landings even so he wondered how many would end up on the ice flow and how they might be the lucky ones the normal ratio one that freeman well knew dictated that an attacking force must outnumber the dugin defenders by at least five to one but denied the luxury of waiting the need for speed disposed freeman to go in now with what he had the man sasdelta force team the pentagon boys were saying ratmanov island was more than an ancient wrecker of ships it was a career disaster waiting to happen in the predawn darkness of a blizzard two long lines of sasdelta troopers seventy in each line made their way along the tarmac at galena air base on alaskas seward peninsula toward the gaping hold of the c starlifter bloody lovely said aussie one of the seventyman sas squad the column to his left was made up of men from the american delta force what are you whining about now asked choir williams a fellow veteran with aussie and david brentwood the leader of the sas force most of whose troop of twenty men had been wiped out in the moscow raid last week you were getting right tired of wales said choir williams so the president and the prime minister say what can we do now to placate aussie and ere we are very bloody funny said aussie wales in alaska shouldve known better all set to go ome back to sydney up to kings cross give those sheilas a bit of the old inout and where are we freezin our burn off in another bloody wales im cursed with bloody wales ah replied choir williams his deep welsh baritone barely audible now as the noise of the cs pitch climbed you volunteered laddie musta been bloody drunk said aussie anyway advised williams who like aussie and the rest of the men lining up for the c had qualified in the most gruelling allied commando courses in the world you dont want to go back to sydney all those girls you wouldnt know what to do with them yes he would called out another welshman aussiell screw anything that moves e will you oughta know jones responded aussie yeah asked muldoon whats jonesy like aussie very nice said aussie but too tight watch it barked the sas sergeant major officer on parade the man himself a few turned to see freeman helmet down against the roar of the c engines and young david brentwood at five eight looking decidedly smaller than the general with whom hed served on the pyongyang raid one of the men in the delta force line noted that freeman and brentwood looked like father and son together but it was an illusion created by the close attention brentwood was giving his superior as they went over lastminute details the other illusion was that freeman was going to jump with them he was certainly dressed for it in full jump suit and helmet wrist altimeter and oxygen mask but if freeman through ordering the decoding of a scrambled message from the president requesting him not to jump had been successful in sidestepping maynes directive he had failed to avoid an outright order from army chief of staff grey who like schwarzkopfs superiors in the iran war viewed freeman as being infinitely more valuable directing strategy on the ground rather than risking his neck in combat but greys instruction notwithstanding freeman was determined to at least go up with the sasd force and stoke morale before the jump going over the additional infrared shots from satellite pictures taken before the onset of the blizzard freeman and david brentwood had ringed each of the rat holes that freeman had suckered dracheevs spets into revealing starting to snow again said freeman goddamn it well we cant wait brentwood another hour damn thingsll be all covered in fresh snow be one big white blanket over that island cover up the bomb scabs anyway the moment we take off salt lake citys going to hit the holes with a final f strike lasersll be chopped up by the snow but they should get bombs near enough the exits to remark em for us freeman looked at his watchtomcats should be halfway over the ice pack now remember sas out first top half of rat island deltall take the southern half now our pvsfives the general meant the night vision goggles powered by a twelvehour threevolt lithium battery are much better than anything the siberians have but theyll be able to pick us up in civil twilight even if the snow keeps falling i know sir acknowledged brentwood not meaning to butt in but his adrenaline was up for the jump ive told everyone in sasdelta diamond glow recognition it was the footlong velcro diamond pattern that like the inverted v of the allied forces in the iraq war would distinguish friend from foe good said freeman then were all set by now most of the troops in the two long columns the first men in being the last men out during the jump were inside the cavernous interior of the starlifter last man in was brentwood freeman was already walking up the center of the deck nodding cheerily as the men took their seats facing one another and began to buckle up the planes engines reached fever pitch as it began its lumbering run down the tarmac it was to take off and head eastward away from the strait to give the big c time to gain sufficient height before it turned for the highaltitude lowopening drop the higher altitude would give the jumpers more time to steer themselves to the assembly points on the island the ped palletized equipment drops scheduled to take place ten to twenty minutes after drop zone perimeters had been secured you ready asked freeman on the bullhorn there was a roar that for a second could be heard above that of the plane dumb question right hollered freeman right freeman was walking down the center of the deck holding onto the webbing net no need to tell you he told the paratroopers over the bullhorn how important this is those fs from salt lake cityll keep the bastards heads down then we go in and whip their ass i can assure you gentlemen that will send novosibirsk a very clear message back off before you all lose your ass there was a chorus of approval and the stamping of para boots which annoyed the air force jumpmaster intensely the stomping was creating a minor dust storm inside the starlifter well brentwood well have snow to contend with but least we wont have the press they arent gonna vietnam me captain all those goddamn liberal lap dogs in the press running around saying they didnt lose us vietnam that the army did goddamn it no one seems to realize we could have ended that war in half an hour two abombs on hanoi would have done it but we didnt we get any marks for that restraint not on your life you know what would have happened though if those squealing bastards had been taken prisoner by the commies they would have wanted the us air force to turn that place into a parking lot well theyre not going to be allowed to do a baghdad pete on us ive told the co of that patriot battery on little diomede to send that cbn sonofabitch reporter and his arctic fox headgear packing back to the mainland they can all get pissed in anchorage while were setting these commie bastards straight yes sir said david brentwood remembering how a reporter once asked him a thricedecorated soldier how he got used to it you never did the first moments of a battle were always as bowel chilling as the first time yes you learned certain things sensed when a firefight was more concentrated and more dangerous in one instance than in another when there was twice as much noise as accuracy you learned to husband your strength ration it and not blow it all in the first few minutes but you never got used to it vse gotovyall done asked general dracheev da kharasho good a little surprise for the americans eh sir it was the air defense duty officer bandits looks like fs coming fast from the south no more than a thousand feet trying for the exits one more time neuzheli oh really commented dracheev with illconceived sarcasm i thought theyd be bringing the mail this got a good laugh from the spets commander so even with the snow making it difficult for the fs to use their smart bombs with their normal accuracy the americans would chop up the snow a little maybe even buckle a few of the superhardened steel plates around the exits theyre not stupid said the air defense officer trying to regain his bruised dignity i mean this freeman he will realize that some of the exits have probably not been used that the pilots wont see them so said dracheev hell send his men looking for them with that the siberian general looked up from the dull red light of ratmanov control a hundred feet of solid rock above him all the better then the air defense officer was even more offended resentment growing by the second dracheev had obviously confided his plan only to the spets although this was normal procedure spets always insisted their operations be kept as secret as possible it still rubbed the wrong way who in hell do they think they are the air defense officer asked his subaltern the elite in his sod house in little diomedes inalik village the hunter the high cheekbones of his eskimo forebears catching the light of the golden hurricane lamp civil twilight before daybreak still an hour away puffed heavily on his walrusbone pipeits a lot of trouble its a lot of money countered the cbn reporter the hunter took another pull of salmon jerky the silence was broken only by the unsettling groaning of the pack ice off frozen lopp lagoon north of cape prince of wales they could see the navigation light right on the point the westernmost point of the cape the wind coming straight off the flat ice of the lagoon in a soulful wail well said the reporter impatiently holding his hands over the sanyo kerosene radiator its heat waves rising like a mirage in the hunters sod hut i havent got all day cash said the hunter hey you think i carry that kind of money round with me yes said the hunter a professional smile creased the reporters face howd you know i can smell it shit you can yes i smell shit but i smell money too up here you dont smell right you the what you see is important too when the hey interjected the reporter impatiently times racing jack have we got a deal or not five grand now five when we get back the hunter was thinking it had been a bad year the walrus had come south in a heavy fog and gone past the islands before they knew it so they hadnt got the usual number to cut up and store with the murre birds for flavor in the frozen earth you wont be able to show any light said the hunter those guys in the patriot bunkers they could pick you up on infrared he thought for a moment course therell still be a lot of heat coming up from the rest of the huts after they evacuate us so youd be all right in here for a while anyways they wouldnt be able to see the moving about in this snowfall said the reporter cuts down the infrared signature maybe said the hunter caught out theres another way said the reporter no said the hunter what you dont even know the fucking question yes i do you want to know if we could hike across to big diomede its only two and a half three miles said the reporter we could get killed everybody gets killed you ever do it asked the reporter fixing the hunter with a challenging stare sure used to do it a lot after gorbachev for a while so its not a walk on an ice rink said the hunter pressure ridges push up against one another he used his hands pushing hard against one another to demonstrate ice as big as buildings yeah and it can be flat too and how about the infrared i told you not if we go when its snowing jack its not a hike you know you can get you scared that it yes so am i said the reporter pulling out a wad of hundreds id bury this stuff here if i were you he started counting how long will it take us not right up on the island but off the ice floe close enough in so we can hunker down close enough to get some zoom shots of the airborne going in off the southern tip four to five hours that long its only two and a half miles for christs sakes the hunter smiled here was an ignorant man what did he think it was a walk in some park hey he said to the reporter you the guy who was in baghdad nope but im gonna be just as famous jack how you gonna send your stuff this little baby said the reporter patting a fourwire direct satellitelink phone even if i cant get a video because of the friggin snow ill be in by voice live lets go the hunter agreed because he doubted that the white man could hack it even with all the special thermal gear out there on the ice with the wind it would be in the minus fifties if the ice gets too jumbled we get a sheer cliff well have to turn back i get half five grand all right said the reporter all right lets get there before its fucking over how do you know therell be an airborne attack asked the hunter pulling on his sealskin boots hey jack look at the map doesnt take a friggin genius to work that out sides freemans the gungho type know what i mean impatient yeah thats right like you as the c turned north then westward having gained halo height the men made final weapon checks the inchlong heckler and koch mpk submachine guns were coveted by the sas with its ninehundredroundperminute ninemillimeter parabellum bullets the gun was referred to by the troopers as a room broomideally suited for the anticipated tunnel fighting the weapon was also capable of a high eightyyard lineofsight accuracy if used in the open for the men of delta force the weapon of choice was the ma colt caliber submachine gun some of its massproduced parts honed down or replaced by handtooled mechanisms for greater accuracy as a general rule freeman told brentwood he didnt like the idea of two different ammunition sizes preferring one that could be used by both sas or delta force weapons thats why the brits lost crete freeman told him above the steady thunder of the c freyberg had troops from five different countries running around with everything from point three oh three to nine millimeter quartermasters nightmare a lot of troops aussies and new zealanders ran out of ammo handtohand fighting a lot of it could see the nazis floating down sky was black with enemy chutes clear blue sky damn what a waste of fine paratroopers even with the ammo screwup it was a near thing a turkey shoot lot of germans dead before they hit the ground germans almost lost it until maleme was taken convinced the german hq never to put their money on an airborne offensive christ said aussie picking up the generals comment and turning to choir williams what the fuck are we doing here then ah said choir with more bravado than he actually felt not to worry laddie rat islands not crete is it siberians are hiding dug in oh thats bloody nice thanks for reminding me i d almost forgotten and then before the aussies fear could like most of the men force him to bear the rest of the flight in silence he was seized by the habit that had made him famous throughout the sas and after the moscow raid throughout the entire british army odds on he announced loudly that sasll be first in in where came a voice shouting above the eardrumming noise in the fucking tunnels you twit ahead of us challenged a delta force sergeant from brooklyngimme a break well have coffee on fore you even find your hole aussie knows where his hole is shouted an sas dont be so fucking rude said aussie welsh bastards come on you lot he was looking across at delta force wheres your fuckin esprit de corps how about it boys as you yanks say pay up or shut up two to one were down first on the drop asked brooklyn no in the fucking tunnels youre on aussie aussie whipped a stubbly indelible pencil from under his helmet and began taking the bets on a palmsized notebook right mate thats the ticket pounds asked choir williams pounds dollars us not canadian yen deutsche marks but and now aussie watched by freeman adopted a mexican drawl showing his teeth i don wan no stinking rubles there was a patter of laughter quickly lost in the planes huge interior the jumpmaster landing his boot with a mud on the decking to get everyones attention as he stood up and announced get ready automatically every paratrooper despite his heavy pack slid forward seemingly effortlessly to the edge of the folded metal seats some making lastminute adjustments to their chin straps who is that joker freeman asked brentwood nodding toward aussie australian called lewis brentwood answered hed make book on the sun not rising took a lot of bets before the moscow raid before the target was known we were doing practice jumps over scotland aussie was convinced we were rehearsing for korea not europe must have lost a bundle said freeman no how come asked freeman realizing the moment hed asked the question what the answer was after the moscow raid thered been hardly anyone left to collect across from brentwood the delta force commander was looking down his line though the sas stick would be first out he was making sure that every sixth man assigned the mm m squad automatic weapon was strapping it tightly to the equipment pack the saws would be fed by the new transparent plastic magazines of two hundred rounds so the shooter could see at a glance how much ammunition remained in addition several of the delta force men carried m dual purpose riflegrenade launchers with fets flare explosives tear gas and smoke grenade packs normally the jumpers would have been wearing the tried and trusted t generalpurpose drop chute but the big twentyeightfootdiameter umbrella chutes couldnt be maneuvered as well as the arching rectangular mcb chutes the latter could be steered by pulling down the leftright riser bars above the jumpers head causing more air to spill on one side than the other allowing the jumper to shoot forward at over four meters a second in all the mcbs would make it aerodynamically a much more controllable drop of the kind made by sports jumpers the latter however as sasd instructors frequently pointed out were unencumbered by to pound battle packs the red light was on stand up yelled the jumpmaster stand up came the shouted response followed by a sound like a herd of elephants rising with planking strapped to their flanks normally with the pound pack it would have been a lot louder but even with the qap quick attack pack of pounds mostly ammunition emergency rations radio and grenades it was still an effort for the paratroopers hookup there was sudden tensionsplitting laughter punctuated with a few catcalls the huge rear ramp went down and had it not been for the dimly lit interior the jumpmasters face would have appeared as bright as a dayglo buoy so used to the massed jumps of the st airborne and the static line used during most drops he had forgotten for a split second that it was a halo jump free fall each paratrooper would dive head first falling at feet per second until no more than two and a half minutes from jumpoff each man would pull a rip cord at two and half thousand feet above the island steering the doubleply nylon air foil canopy to the snowcovered target the green light was on go the shock of the cold hit brentwoods face with the force of a body blow and for a split second it was déjà vu going down over moscow only this time the scream of the wind was louder the cold already penetrating the double thermal suit the oxygen mask fogging the infrared goggles momentarily his arms were hard against his sides his feet up behind him forcing his head down to counter the tendency to spin the air screamed like a banshee around the bulbous headgear it was a third larger than the usual helmet in order to accommodate the starlight goggles creating more resistance than usual now he was pulling his left arm and leg in unison in tighter to his center line the maneuver giving him left drift far below him he spotted a flash of light through the goggles light which he took to be the last of the tomcats bombs and used it as an aiming point several seconds later he felt the shock wave of the explosion hitting him a fierce crackling invaded the echo chamber of his helmet as radio silence was broken by the c general freeman shouting mission aborted mission aborted field the rest was a surge of static what the hell brentwood knew that by now most of the sas stick would be out of the plane possibly even one or two of the delta force he looked at the altimeter couldnt make it out for a second then saw he was less than a minute away from two and a half thousand feet then he glimpsed a bluish white dot two of them flitting by a thousand feet below him like tiny fireflies and guessed correctly that it was one of the twinengined tomcats probably on afterburner it was splitsecond timing by the navy but cutting it a bit fine all the same then the unfinished part of the message hed received from the c made sense hitting him with the force of a high explosive shock wave as he saw orange pinpoints of light like flashlights switching quickly on and off beneath the dim blanket of snow racing up at him from the northern part of the island the field in the radio transmit must be minefield set off by the tomcats bombs the c had broken radio silence to tell brentwood and the other sas already speeding down toward the island that ratmanov had been seeded with mines the whole island was a minefield more splotches of light white swellings on the infrareds green background confirmed it worse by now the snow would have covered any footprints giving no clue to the pattern of mines laid if there was any nor indicating the positions of the rat holes the siberians had had at least an hour to there was another surge of static in his helmet from the c but now all he could pick up was abort abort and all he could see was the snow field becoming wider and wider as he neared touchdown had the mines been scattered willynilly or were they in spets fashion laid so as to funnel attackers into deadly triangulated cofcones of fire but no matter how the mines had been laid david knew the allied paratroopers mostly if not all sas would find themselves unable to move forced to fight and the where they landed for a split second david thought of increasing the leftward drift and heading out over the cliffs for the relative safety of the ice floe hed save himself but hed be no use to anyone else the altimeter showed he was at three thousand feet two thousand nine hundred in three and a half seconds hed be at twentyfive hundred pull the cord or drift eastward away from the island he pulled the rip cord heard the snap felt the sudden deceleration and tugged hard on the right toggle feeling that side of the chute curl and brake as he went into a tight controlled spiral the sky around him alive now with lazy arcs of red and white tracer the air exploding with the rattle and bang of aa fire the screams as men died in the harness and the pop of flares adding to the cacophony of sound suddenly all was bright a moment of civil twilight then the flare dropped away from him he could hear bursts of machinegun fire like paper tearing quickly he paid out the fifteenfootlong tether line attached to his equipment bundle evening the pull on both toggles his heart threatening to burst out of his chest below he could see long black shadows piercing a white flarelit circle of snow chapter twelve the fax traffic preferred by many mvd offices over the regular military channels was informing novosibirsk hq that at this very moment at am thursday morning that is am wednesday on little diomede only two and a half miles across the dateboundary line between the us and ussr with a half hour to go before the bering strait passed out of utter darkness into civil twilight an allied airborne attack was underway against ratmanov island another fax classified as tayna secret but momentarily considered less important to novosibirsk hq than the american generals attack on ratmanov came through with the information that the submarine that had attacked the two supertankers off americas northwest coast had reported that one of the torpedoes it had fired had not exploded a commonenough complaint from the far eastern tvd hq at khabarovsk normally this would merely have been entered as a nerazorvavshiysya snaryad dud but it was seen by an alert intelligence officer at novosibirsk who realized that it was opening up an old sore for khabarovsk tvd hq the suspected sabotage of munitions by jews living in one of the yaos or jewish autonomous regions in this case a lamb chopshaped jewish enclave miles at its widest around birobidzhan a hundred and fifteen miles west of khabarovsk the jewish region was near the manchurian border in khabarovsk kgb chief colonel nefski had just returned from the bear restaurant having downed an enormous plate of pigs feet fresh bread and wine served by an elderly waiter whose atrocious french lent an air of sophistication whenever nefski and other senior officers patronized the restaurant but if nefski could be fooled by pretensions of french cuisine there wasnt much anyone could tell him about the best way to deal with suspected saboteurs gorbachev of course had vsyo isportilballsed everything upso that even after he had gone and things started to return to something like normal around khabarovsk there were still idiosyncratic pockets of bureaucracy so that for example before he could have absolute authority to deal with the jews it was necessary to get novosibirsks approval no one would have questioned him had he gone ahead with his own plan but nefski knew how pieces of paper not obtained could be used later against one by unscrupulous political opponents gorbachev and that other fool yeltsin god rot them had actually encouraged the jews for a time to believe they had the same rights as any other soviet citizen as nefski waited impatiently by the window of his thirdfloor office for confirmation that his fax had gotten through to novosibirsk he took another sobraine from his cigarette tin and lit it pouring the acrid bluishgray smoke against the frosted windows through which he could faintly see the redandyellow tram cars making their way in the blizzard along khabarovsks wide avenues ones position he ruminated to his subaltern was all a matter of distance from the capital first moscow now novosibirsk like the americans who lived in alaska and the american northwest who were never understood by washingtons bureaucrats nefski had ample evidence that novosibirsk never understood the tyranny of distance never fully appreciated the enormous implications of the fact that the lifeline of the transsiberian railway passed barely fifty miles from the chinese border out here should the americans now that they held korea decide to cross the yalu river that separated chinas manchurian provinces from korea then wheel westward onto the great northern plain of china the jews would seize their chance and cut the rail line thus effectively cutting off khabarovsk and vladivostok farther south on the coast disaster would follow khabarovsk and vladivostok were the linchpins of the entire siberian offensive against the americans on the eastern flank this was true not only for the entire far eastern tvd in the war against the americans but for any air war against japan should the japanese less than two hundred miles east of the coast decide to attack as a military down payment on the oil they would have to get from the american north slope if their industry was not to grind to a halt personally nefski confided to his subaltern a kgb lieutenant he doubted the americans would risk incurring the wrath of the chinese by striking through north korea but with korea in their possession it was a temptation a left hook from najin in north korea northeastward less than two hundred miles around the coast on the sea of japan to attack vladivostok the military consequences of vladivostok being cut off were too horrendous to contemplate but it was precisely that that nefski had to think about losing the icefree port would mean the entire soviet pacific fleet would be cast adrift with no home base no supplies and if this wasnt enough to fire nefskis determination to root out the jewish saboteurs whom he believed were responsible for the local attacks on the transsiberian railway link then his humiliation during the shortlived minsk treaty was he and other kgb officers had been required to make public apologies to the jews for certain irregularities during the war indeed nefski and his aide had been imprisoned for fortyeight hours by the jewish underground destined to face charges in what the jews called open court open court well everything had changed very suddenly with novosibirsks rejection of chernkos cowardly minsk treaty the following day the jews had fought sporadic actions along the rail line kilometers between khavarovsk and birobidzhan cutting it in several places but with siberias decision to continue throwing its vast resources and armies against the allies and military reinforcements being rushed out from western siberia the jews were on the run again the hunted not the hunter kings for a day eh nefski remarked to his subaltern without taking his eyes off the tram cars that had fascinated him ever since he was a child and afforded him the warm secure feeling of someone safe looking out at a hostile world then nefski with a full stomach to stoke his confidence explained to his subaltern that even if ratmanov fell which he doubted an attack by aircraft from american carrierbased fleets that might steam toward the sea of japan from the americans aleutian bases was highly unlikely first there would be the blizzard facing them as well as the zhelezny zjanavesiron curtain of antiaircraft missiles and gunfire that would be thrown up at them by the formidable defense network of the kuril island screen four hundred miles off the coast and even if they got past the kuril islands the americans would then be met by swarms of soviet fighters rising to meet them north of japan from bases dotted along the sixhundredmilelong shield of sakhalin island just off the soviet coast and this quite apart from the koltsa ringsof aa missile and gun emplacements around vladivostok and inland around khabarovsk itself nefski glanced at his watch frowned and pushed the button for cells what are they doing down there he asked sharply the sour stench of his kumiss the fermented mares milk so beloved by the yakuts filling the overheated stuffy kgb office his subaltern tried to hold his breath as nefski spoke surmising that the colonels breath was so foul that if they could pipe it down the narrow winding stone staircase to the cells four stories below the jews would agree instantly to tell nefski whatever he wanted to know about who was who in the jewish resistance they had some trouble with the woman the subaltern explained pulling a file after we brought her and those three brothers of hers in he was reminding nefski of the time they had pretended to shoot the youngest to get her to talk she apparently went bonkers when we picked her up again after novosibirsk rejected the minsk treaty he laughed they all thought they were about to be liberated when chernko signed at minsk next year in jerusalem if shes crazy said nefski shes no use to us this time we wont be generous to her or her gangster brothers no more blanks to frighten them this time well use no sir interjected the subaltern i dont mean crazy mad sir i mean violent then for gods sake give her an injection thats what theyre doing sir answered the subaltern trying to hide his anxiety he prayed nothing had gone wrong downstairs if he helped nefski break the jews it would mean a promotion from lieutenant to captain nefski lit another sobraine off the first the lieutenant grateful for the infusion of the thick tobacco smoke to counter the foul smell of sour cheese nefski had completely misunderstood his subalterns anxiety about the woman mistakenly interpreting it as concern if youre going to be an old woman about this ilya i dont want you here these vermin pose as great a threat to our supply line as did the czechs nefski was referring to the bizarre incident of the czech legion in world war i who ironically on their way home and fed up with delays had held most of the transsiberian railway during the bloody civil war between the reds and the whites canadian and us forces in murmansk were trying even then to hamper the revolution the lieutenant didnt comment the analogy between a few score of zhidyyids and the czech legion being a monstrous exaggeration still he knew nefski had a point despite the fact that they would not know what part of the line was under infrared surveillance hidden in the birch taiga or monitored by the vibration meters of the kind perfected by the americans in vietnam to detect even foot traffic along the ho chi minh trail a rail line could be uprooted by a child with a fistful of plastique and the guts to try anyway with or without the dangers posed by the jews the subaltern was certainly not an old woman didnt feel squeamish at all in fact and this he did not mention or even hint at to nefski the prospect of torturing the jewess alexsandra malof a pretty darkeyed and wellendowed nineteenyearold excited him compared with the usual run of ugly stodgy peasants they had to deal with it would be a pleasant change sometimes nefski let his men do an iraqiwhich meant the most diligent and loyal interrogators were given an hour or so alone with the woman in the cell the thought of the jewess naked tied to the bare birch bunk breasts rising quickly up and down with her fear thrilled him long before he heard them dragging her up the narrow staircase he had an erection and so busied himself by the records cabinet going over her file so that his back was turned to nefski who if he saw the subalterns condition would make a great joke of it turning his head slightly to look out at the top of the stairwell he glimpsed her and saw that after only several days of solitary shed lost weight but starvation initially gave some prisoners a more determined alive look separating them as comrade nefski often said into the quick and the dead and made the ones who wanted to live more exciting yet their stubbornness was in the end a death sentence when you took them back to cells after the initial interrogation and held out food as a reward there was almost nothing they wouldnt do as they hauled her through the door he turned holding the file low in front of him he heard a high buzzing sound and saw the fax light come on nefski was standing by the window gazing out his usual disinterested ploy and so the lieutenant tore off the fax as the two guards pushed her into the chair she was one of those women whose long dark hair looked beautiful no matter what you did to them he glanced down at the fax it would make nefski very happy novosibirsk fully concurred with comrade nefskis assessment of the jewish problem indeed novosibirsk hq pointed out it was partly because of sabotage in the baltic states that many russian gunners had found themselves firing dud rounds during the battle for minsk comrade nefski was instructed to take all measures necessary for the solution of this problem in your sector of the tvd she wasnt wearing a bra this was normal procedure of course some of the jews had even tried to use shoelaces tied together to hang themselves rather than face kgb interrogation and because she had done nothing to help the guards on the way up resisting them as they dragged her full weight over every step she was perspiring heavily the faded thin blue cotton prison tunic was clinging to her body like a wet sheet nefski didnt bother turning from the window as he spoke ilya grinned the colonel always pulling this lidery bigshotbullshit not deigning to look at the prisoner that was fine it gave ilya more time to look at her already shed responded by not responding her lucid brown eyes focussing on some distant point beyond him jerusalem perhaps he could feel the resistance in her like electricity in the air he knew she wasnt going to cooperate not yet this was a waste of time still they always did this part by the book and he opened the file moving to the left of nefskis brutish wooden desk to take notes but now nefski unexpectedly turned and shook his head no notes ilya slipped the file away and closed the drawer with a satisfying click no record of the interrogation it was a good sign theyd have a bit of fun with her after all novosibirsk had given them carte blanche chapter thirteen the snick david brentwood heard off to his right about twenty yards was no file cabinet shutting but a spets akms butt stock unfolding extending the millimeter submachine guns length from twentyeight to thirtyfive inches not as heavy as the ak the kalashnikov didnt have the heavier hitting power of the ak but with less recoil gained greater accuracy the burst hit an sas trooper before he touched ground and although brentwood couldnt see the barrel flashes he heard the heavy thump of the spets burst hitting the man his body dangling its radiant heat a shiver in davids starlight goggles in which green snow enveloped the man as he fell dead into the soft powder the troopers chute its flapping audible still invisible to david was dragging the man along through the snow in a tug of war with the anchor of his equipment pack fifty yards away brentwood landed softly shucked off his chute and within seconds was crawling sweat turning to ice about his collar using his boot knife to quickly probe the snowy ground in front of him for mines he saw then heard a ragged series of orange flashes off to his left the air reeking of cordite a bouncing betty a siberian ma antipersonnel mine had jumped disintegrating five feet above the orangeflickering snow the mines shrapnel whistling through the snowcurtained air he heard an agonized scream somewhere behind him and saw a flare illuminating another chute coming down the sas soldier kicking frantically in pain hands clutching raspberrycolored goo that had been his face in the same light brentwood glimpsed spets three of them forming a defensive triangle no more than twenty yards away at ten oclock mentally he marked the spot but could do nothing for now until he reached his pack and unhitched the ninemillimeter mpk submachine gun in any case it wouldnt be any good until he knew which way he could roll to avoid the return bursts feeling the icecold outline of the gun in its plastic wrap and its thirtyround banana magazine he flicked the safety on the lefthand side to the threeround burst position a machine guns rip sounded left of him grenades exploded and there was a steady low bumpbumpbump as spets triangles continued to pour deadly fire through flare light into the white forest of descending sas troops farther behind brentwood he could see at least two troopers dead in their chutes and another torso the white blur in brentwoods infrared goggles the mans blood bubbling from the headless body jesus jesus brentwood said two others hit mines as they landed snow erupting covering the troopers like icing sugar deeper granular snow peppering the collapsing chutes like hail brentwood saw the black blob of a grenade coming his way followed by an obscenity but it crashed ten feet beyond him and he lay deathly still as the uprooted snow peppered him the grenades purplishblue flash a jagged cross that lit up one of the spets it killed giving brentwood a start that he was so close to them another two were momentarily visible in the flash and he fired two bursts one spets flew backward like a puppet jerked off his feet taking the full shock of the burst in his chest the other man managed to get off a wild burst as he slipped on the snow that had instantaneously turned to ice in the heat of the explosion now another trooper his body sagged in harness hit the snow the chute collapsing around him when suddenly having faked it the trooper came alive announcing his arrival with a long burst that ended with fucker in an australian accent figuring the dead spets must be within a safety moat around a rat hole theyd hardly put themselves in the middle of a minefield but rather would have sown the area around the rat holes david made a splitsecond decision if sas had screwed up not bringing any mic lics the footlong mineclearing line or hose charges cables packed with explosive charges to clear an eightyardwide swath through minefields during an infantry advance then hed just have to improvise taking off his gloves he quickly reeled in the tether line that had been attached to the equipment pack he froze as a chute flare popped high to his right it wasnt shapes theyd be looking for as much as movement as the light waned the flare drifting east over the high cliffs only a hundred yards or so in front of him david lined up the six he grenades the first three had sevensecond fuses the other three designated for room service by the sas only threesecond ones he waited for the next spets flare theyd been coming at fairly regular intervals near where he and aussie had hit ground but now that david wanted to see one none came and he realized that his and aussies drop and possibly a few others marked the southern extremity of the drop over the northern half of the island then a flare mushroomed a quarter mile north of them its fierce incandescent light macabrely beautiful the snow acting like a million tiny strobe mirrors turning night to bluish white day the dazzling effect belying the lifeanddeath struggle most of the sas stick further north were now engaged in having bailed out only seconds before the abort command from freeman david knew hed have to make as calmly and accurately as he could six throws in as many seconds before the first grenade exploded six arcs each shorter than the one before it using his seventypound pack as a shield for the one that should explode nearest him the overpressure from its vshaped detonation as well as its shrapnel hopefully setting off any antipersonnel mines it occurred to him he might not even be in a minefield at all but in a minefree zone used by the spets as theyd backwalked to the rat hole entrances after having sown the mines but if he was in a minefield and took one step forward he slipped off his gloves flexing his fingers quickly to keep the circulation up long enough ten yards or so back of him aussie lewis picked up a rush of movement on his goggles green background his trigger finger slipped off the guard at the same instant that he saw the top of a diamond another sas trooper at one oclock thirty feet away ten to one he told himself it was brentwood no clear image to go by of course just the infrared blur of helmet and white thermal jump suit but brentwood as leader of the seventyman sas stick had been the first out of the c you beaut you little aussie whispered his voice drowned by an earsplitting roar and earthshattering crump of heavy millimeter soviet mortars david brentwood took a deep breath exhaled half of it held the rest and tossed the grenades one two three four five the fifth one going off as he let go of the sixth dropping to the snow and pulling his equipment pack against his helmet as cascades of powder snow and fragments of rock pebbles fell on him and a sliver of whitehot metal passed through the thermal suit gashing his right thigh a second later he felt a burning sensation on his back hot or freezing cold he couldnt tell it was lumps of snow now ice fused by the grenades heat using the pack as a rest he fired two long bursts tattooing the ground along the twentytothirtyyard line of the grenades explosion only one more mine went off with an almost disappointing pop but it was loud enough for aussie who though further back had his face pockmarked by splinters his goggles scratched so badly they were no longer of any use to him david clipped on a fresh magazine and was up and running straight into the rough canallike fissure cleared through the snow by the grenades firing from the hip aussie covering him two spets rising out of fucking nowhere as aussie would later recount off to their left the telltale stutter and flame of their two aks silenced in a long angry burst from the australian the siberian commandos fell face first while fucking brentwood no fucking apology for my face does a fucking babe ruth for the home plate lucky bastards first one to see a ventilator shaft then a sealedoff rat hole crafty buggers had it protected under an overhanging rock ledge it wasnt as easy as aussie made out the truth being that when david tried to fire into the ventilation mesh a ricochet from the titaniumhardened grate its apertures too small for a bullet to pass through almost took off his knee while aussie covered him david ran ahead snatched two grenades from the dead spets hed cut down their faces so black with camouflage paint that he could only make out their eyes put the grenades against the mesh and then shoved one of the spets hard up against the grenades and ventilator grate before he pulled the pins the concertinaed explosion blew a grapefruitsized hole in the mesh and had one of the spets carotid arteries spurting blood like a hose making it slippery on the now snowfree rock thanks for shovelling my driveway mate said aussie as he and david dropped two tear gas grenades into the ventilator shaft it was of no use for the exit had been sealed off at the sixtyfoot level besides which the ventilator shafts being of saddam design and built in the halcyon days of gorbachevgerman friendship had no difficulty filtering out the tear gas aussie and brentwood looked around for the rest of the sas stick but there werent any at least fiftysix of the seventy had landed farther north of them in another minefield into which spets were pouring machinegun and mortar fire from rocky enclaves on high ground the spets were calling it the boynya butcher shop and it was still dark come civil twilight in another fifteen minutes the spets would have an even easier time of it no longer inhibited by inferior nightvision goggles surrounded by mines the sas would systematically be cut to pieces as they were too near the spets for any close air support to help any strafing or bombing run would kill them as well as the spets the terrible irony was that those sas dropped farther north than aussie brentwood and a few others had made a textbook descent right on target having been guided by the heatemission patterns seen through their pvss but of those fiftysixodd sas troopers there were now only thirtyseven they were no more than two hundred yards from an exit one of the two hitherto unseen by allied reconnaissance and designated by dracheev as rl and r but with the minefield between them and the spets they might as well have been two hundred miles away a few had tried brentwoods method and had cleared a path but here the spets heavy vladimirov millimeter fire was so concentrated and overwhelming coming from over two hundred spets that it seemed come civil twilight the sas and thus the allied offensive on ratmanov island was doomed south of the main body of sas aussie brentwood and two other troopers began placing c charges about the doublearmored cover of the sealedoff rat hole with only ten minutes till civil twilight they knew their only chance of survival let alone of doing any damage to the spets was to penetrate the tunnel system to make matters worse the tear gas albeit in weakened form after having been processed by the subterranean filter system was being vented through the snow around them adding to the eeriness of the place for in the bitter windswept blue of the cold predawn light it seemed as if sulfurous fumaroles were leaching up poisons from the earths violent interior aboard the c general douglas freeman was about to make one of the toughest decisions of his or any other military career twelve minutes to the first rays of civil twilight and freeman didnt hesitate but the pentagon and the president had advising him to call the ratmanov operation off but craftily leaving the final decision to him as the man on the ground he wasnt on the ground but he knew what they meant you decide you take the rap the press specifically cbn how the hell did they know freeman wondered had somehow gotten wind of the minefield catastrophe and sniffing disaster in the air reporters were collecting like jackals around the carcass of the white house its authority bleaklooking beneath the low leaden sky its rose bushes forlornly naked but for traces of snow on the thorn press secretary trainor was swearing to get whomever was responsible for the minefield leak by the balls he wanted a list of everyone who knew from the white house ops room to c in c alaska air command had anyone used plain language instead of the scrambler for gods sake no he was told some cbn bastard was doing a baghdad pete on them you mean hes actually on big diomede either that or close enough maybe little diomede i thought freeman ordered that son of a bitch off the aide a bright young masters degree from princetons international relations program was redfaced ah bit of a screwup there mr trainor spill it simpson spill it ah one of the eskimos that came out on little diomedes evac chopper simpson was looking down at some hurriedly scribbled notes couple of hours before the attack well far as we can tell so far someone apparently saw the press credentials hanging around someones neck and figured it was the cbn guy but it wasnt snapped trainor doesnt look like it sir uh all rigged up in winter gear snow flying everywhere around the chopper they said hard to see i guess jesus jesus jesus who said uh nome control is it hard to count barked trainor why didnt the son of a bitch in charge count the fuckers maybe they did mr trainor guess no one was sure exactly how many were in inalik inawhat inalik village west side of little diomede theyd already moved everyone down from the village on little diomedes northern trainor was so upset pacing back and forth in the operations room young simpson thought hed have a stroke right then and there in the basement beneath the map of siberia and the strait trainor raised his left hand in a fist flattened it as if to strike the map then suddenly pulled back quietly fuming holding his hand over his eyes like a tennis shade all right so this son of a bitch is close enough to know freeman fucked up close enough to see the minefields hows he getting the info out by phone mr trainor a fourwire direct satellite hookup portable pocketsized dish unfolds to umbrella size apparently the aide paused gulped and continued were only getting sound bites no pics oh thats terrific simpson thats a big help whole friggin worlds hearing we screwed upfreeman screwed up but no pics beautiful its worse with radio peoples imaginations run riot think weve already lost it simpson had always been told by trainor that you couldnt hold back the truth if you had any hope of effective damage control so he put it on the line well we have lost it havent we the island yes but not the whole shebang i mean trainor for the first time in the white house was at a loss for words young simpsons truth like poisoned air was quickly filling the whole room young princeton had it right if theyd lost rat island the first game the whole series could be lost aboard the cthree siberian sams had been taken out by the patriots as theyd raced toward the big transport general of the army douglas freeman had other ideas but he had only ten minutes till civil twilight till in the undressed phrase of dick norton slaughter time it was to be the most controversial decision in american military history the kind of controversy that had followed his career from the night drop on pyongyang to take out in freemans words kim il suck to the minsk front where hed insulted the entire soviet high command by insisting that they salute the stars and stripes before negotiations could begingive the alaska air command he shouted above the combined thunder of the cs engines general riley rileys voice was crackling with static even the most sophisticated electronics were prey to the vicissitudes of solar flaredriven northern atmospherics riley here general colin i want immediate fae strikes coordinates one six niner zero threeas freeman was speaking the mauvish brown screen display in the norad regional combat command at elmendorf was flashing the status of all aircraft aloft in alaska command the smaller green grids to the right listed in descending order weapon status fighter reconnaissance and airlift mission schedules in front of riley the duty officer was bringing up the buffer zone signified by the map grids covering the bering strait from latitude sixtysix north to sixtyfive south on the five magnification riley saw the position freeman had given them for the fae strike was on a midline running across ratmanov island near the eastern cliffs thats too close to our own men he told freeman whole islands too close to our own men general i want fae strikes now youve got nine minutes i dont know whether any im taking full responsibility riley had to gather spittle to talk the terrible risk having made his mouth dry i know you are douglas what i mean is that itll take five minutes or so to load up faes weve got nothing up there carrying then dont waste time start loading damn it i want those airstrikes colin now freeman was off the air and relaying orders to maj harold e morgan leader of the delta force stick goddamn it even from subsonic from galena its less than a minute to rat island what the hells the matter with him all right now listen harry were going to keep circling in this big bird till we see the faes soon as the flames the down which wont be long in this blizzard you boys go dont bother looking for sas theyll link up with you soon as they can go for that exit the tomcatsve reported he pointed to the circled position on the map it wasnt on the photo recon must be one they had up their sleeve yes sir said morgan knowing what the general had meant by not looking for sas it wouldnt only be a waste of time there might not be many left if the fuel air explosive the deadlier cousin of napalm spewed out anywhere near them in any case morgan wasnt about to judge freeman for using the tremendously high overpressure created by an fae to detonate mines so close to his own men the court of public opinion would put him in the dock soon enough sir said the starlifters pilot calling out to freeman elmendorfs reporting bogeys rising from east cape it was the siberian side look like fulcrums the mikoyangurevich fs were the piece de resistance of the siberian air arm as major frank shirer now held prisoner by the spets had found out over the aleutians the eighteenthousandpound thrust of the twin tumansky rdspowered mach fighter could put the fulcrum into a nearvertical climb position attain a hammerhead stalltail slide evade enemy radar and come out of nowhere with six deadly pylonmounted alamo airtoair missiles and a drumfed thirtymillimeter machine gun sheathed beneath the left wing then by god said freeman novosibirsk must be worried to risk their air force is galena intercepting freeman asked the pilot affirmative fs and tomcatsfingers four from salt lake city theyve been refueled midair flying protective screen for the carrier good commented freeman the starlifters engineer didnt agree gonna be like the fourth of july up here no one answered he was right and there was the danger of collision with everyone flying on instruments in the bad weather and on radio silence as much as possible the chances of slamming into someone else were high even so it was nothing compared to the risk the sas on the ground faced if the pilots dropping the faes werent on the ball you reached anybody down there yet shouted freeman no sir replied the copilot siberians are jamming everything youd need land lines to evade that lot freeman said nothing he didnt have to if the sas werent informed of the impending fae drops the risk to them was even higher if the faes missed them and he secured the island with delta force hed be a hero but he knew that while victory would have many parents defeat would be an orphan his the president and the chiefs of staff were right it was his responsibility it came with a generals pay the spets were no longer interested in shirer any information he could give them now was null and void with the sas trapped and about to be wiped out in the dawns early light nevertheless the spets resented the americans stubbornness in refusing to tell them anything but name rank and serial number it transcended all common sense everyone broke sooner or later and if you didnt then you outraged your captors assumption of omnipotence the spets had orders from dracheev not to kill the american ace shirer and they saw the sense in this for when the allied commandos failed to take ratmanov shirer whose nickname in the western press was oneeyed jack might be useful in a prisoner exchange americans were soft always willing to trade five of yours for one of theirs last chance the spets corporal told shirer who was tied to a metal chair near the base of one of the ventilator shafts why do they call you a oneeyed jack the corporals english was impeccable the other spets looked at the corporal switching to russian why are you asking him that you know he used to be one of their air force one pilots they wear the black patch on one eye so if theres a nuclear airburst and everybody else on the plane is blinded the pilot still has one good eye to fly the instruments we know that what the hell are you wasting time for i didnt know the corporal answered him in russian bastards think theyre tougher than we are need a lesson so give it to him but lets hurry eh itll soon be twilight i dont want to miss out on the fun you wont here hold him steady the corporal unslung his ak rested it against the far side of the ventilator and pinned shirers arms even tighter against the chair thats it said the other spets and took shirer by the hair pushing his head back hard on the top of the chair so that shirer was forced to look up at the heavy steelreinforced roof of the ventilator tunnel look at me he commanded shirer shirer his face contorted by his previous beating and bruised from the scrape against the canopy when hed ejected glanced defiantly at the spets he wasnt going to tell them squat about air force one in one quick movement the spets slipped the ballpoint pen from his pocket and drove it into shirers eye shirer was screaming but the spets voice was louder reverberating around the ventilator shaft thats why youre called oneeyed jacks grinning the spets looked across at the corporal who was slinging on the kalashnikov his flying days are over comrade cmon said the corporal impatiently youll miss the party the party had already started in the blizzard over ratmanov island as fs their litton inertial navigation system and martin marietta anasq laser spot tracker and forwardlooking infrared giving the hornets the edge above the blizzard level where the fulcrums had to pursue them if they wanted to engage below in the blizzard itself fc eagles on afterburner went into the furball as other migs tried to take out the big starlifter which was now opening its ramp once more freeman the first man in the delta force stick cinched the straps holding the winchester modified riot gun to his pack its perforated heat shield already frosting under the plastic freeman quickly wrapped another layer of waterproof camouflage sheet about it to prevent the four flechette cartridges and the slugging shell in the chamber from getting too cold if the faes did the job properly he wouldnt need the flechettes until he got inside the tunnels but a slugging shell which could go through an engine block at three hundred yards might come in handy on the already bombrattled rat hole covers general harry morgan advised him the majors voice whipped away by the slipstream youre not supposed to be leading general you have any objections harry freeman shouted one hand on the webbing net by the door as they hit unstable air the other hand busy tightening the oxygen mask before the helmet came down hell no general glad to have you along but dick norton told the that i should remind you that general grey general grey ordered the not to lead the drop freeman shouted against the wind and roaring crescendo of the starlifter now did i lead the drop harry well not technically i guess the sas right major brentwood led the drop hell im just followin up the rear besides what kind of commander would i be sending men down into that without going myself yeah a delta force corporal told his buddy down the line but he wont be the one at the fucking barbecue dont worry his buddy told him jumpmaster tells the tomcats are coming in with those faes they can land on an angled deck in the middle of the fucking night man they can drop those fae babies just where they want em like in iraq iraq those mothers were dug in miles from us these fuckers are only a coupla hundred yards from those limeys dont worry our carrier guys are used to putting those birds down on a postage stamp theyre not gonna screw up the tomcats didnt screw up coming in low wings fully extended for maximum stability they risked lower speed and more vulnerability to the siberians missile and gun aa fire the snow was now falling only lightly and the predawn darkness above the island was filled with what seemed to be the crazed patterns of contrails from wing tips and missile stabilizers in a cacophony of sound that made it all but impossible for the tomcats rios and pilots to hear one another though lighter the snow still segmented laser designator beams so that the paveway conversion nose assemblies attached to the fae pods of jellied fuel could not be taken advantage of the pilots had to rely as best they could on windvector corrections to aid the computer in making the lowlevel drop wind shears always unpredictable around carriers as much as above airports were especially so around the island where constantly shifting pressure ridges changed gusting north winds by the millisecond the first two fae pods tumbled textbook perfect close to the cliffs the great rolling vomit of blackedged flame consuming at least halfadozen spets heavy machinegun positions roughly twentyfive men in all and drowning several elevator shafts in a river of flame dracheevs northern complex could no longer be garrisoned more than five hundred spets beneath were now directed south to the midline where most of the sas had landed and were now in imminent danger of being wiped out by spets clustered in the rocky enclaves about the hitherto unknown r exit despite increasing almost hysterical aa fire the second tomcat released its single pound big blue fuel air explosive mixture of gelled ammonium nitrate aluminum powder and polystyrene soap the canards afforded it some stability in the fierce wind gusting about the cliff tops but not much a hundred feet above the minefields its cloud detonators released allowing the slurry of gelled explosive to blow out of the casing it became a vast aerosol or chemical mist over the snow at twentythree feet above the ground the cloud detonators ignited the now lethal explosiveair mix wind gusts having pushed it sharply westward the vast incurling flame over two hundred yards long and over a hundred yards wide immediately killed over forty of the fiftysix sas it was not the faes ferocious heat or terrible overpressure or the detonation of all the mines in the area in one cataclysmic upwelling of black rockstreaked snow that killed the sas commandos but asphyxiation the flames instantly consumed all oxygen in the area and in the process sucked every last bit of air from the trapped mens lungs over seventythree spets suffered the same fate the heat and shock wave felt through the canopy of the following tomcat that dropping its big blue killed another eleven sas troopers leaving only sixteen scattered further inland and several like brentwood and aussie to the south the second fae did not kill any more spets but flooded ventilator shafts with fire so that now more than a thousand spets were assembling beneath the rl shaft their imminent exit was due not only to the befouled ventilation system but to their desire to combat the troops that were certain to be aboard the more than one hundred specks now showing up on ratmanov radar apache gunships preceding a larger armada of over chinook ch troop transport choppers dracheev was in a rage not only had this freeman had the courage to call in faes near his own men so destroying spets minefields but had used the faes to clear landing space for a helicopter assault well it wasnt over yet flames still visible reported the starlifters copilot okay acknowledged the pilot we go around again tell freeman roger there was an explosion at two oclock high either a fulcrum or an eagle it was impossible to tell the next time around the flames had abated partially because of the snow and the arrival of a bevy of rainheavy squalls coming in over the pressure ridges in excess of a hundred miles an hour freeman was first out diving toward the nowblackened drop zone the rest of the delta stick came behind him hoping that the squalls would pass well over the island otherwise theyd have one hell of a job steering into the cleared area two delta men were already dead one sucked into the starboard engine of a mig going down the other man struck seconds later by the same planes canopy his skull crumpling the cockpits perspex momentarily turning it cherry red before the froth of brain was consumed by the blizzard another mig having broken radar silence in the final moments of his attack and frustrated by not having found the big starlifter glimpsed the unmistakable wing sweep of a tomcat but the tomcat vanished before he could fire an alamo or apex freeman was pulling hard lowering the left toggle going into a spiral the drop point he had picked up in the eerie blue of civil twilight held three charred bodies sas or spets he didnt know but at least it would be clear of mines there were several bright orange flashes a mile or so east of the cliffs and then a roll of explosions echoing off the cliff face three chinook choppers hit by rat aa fire freemans landing was softer than hed braced for his right foot passed through the black crackle of one of the corpses the only solids left by the blaze were bone ammunition clips their rounds set off by the fire a partially melted kevlar helmet that told him it had been a special air service trooper and a heckler and koch submachine gun nearby the air was pungent with the sickeningsweet odor of burnt flesh freeman saw his equipment pack in a black oily pool where sas and others he guessed spets lay charred beyond recognition one tightly stretched leatherlike face staring eyeless at the sky already freeman was under fire the pyrotechnics of intercutting red and white tracer against the prussian blue of a now spectacularly clear arctic morning mixing with orange streaks from the marine expeditionary units assault apache as inchdiameter rockets fired in salvos exploded against the high dugin cliff guns followed by the skittering orangered detonations of the ninetyfivepound antiradar hellfire missiles in the distance writhing smoking umbilical trails of redhot spent casings spun down from the apaches roundaminute bellymounted hughes gun adding to the deadly kaleidoscope of colors passing through and blending with one another against the vast bluishwhite tumble of the icebound strait the thin squiggle of siberias mountainous coast just visible twentyfive miles westward the cbn reporter on the southern tip of the island two miles south of where the faes had scoured out a safe landing zone for delta force was on a high getting pics now as well as the clearest sound bites hed ever heard better than anything hed gotten in the iraqi war a wounded spets snapped off a burst in freeman and morgans direction having shucked his chute freeman instinctively went on his belly reaching in the black ashes of one of the corpses for the dead mans mpk the gun fired and the spets rolled into morgans burst shuddered and lay dead even before the white flecks of his overlay torn out by the ninemillimeter parabellum had fallen to the ground freeman the mpk cradled in his elbows began a fast belly crawl toward his pack ten yards in front of him when he saw two spets one hauling a light machine gun its bipod swinging momentarily silhouetted against the azure sky at the cliffs edge the latters sharp black thrust of rock clearly visible now the snow had been melted by the faes explosion freeman fired again now morgan was close in beside him the spets made it across the gap in the rock splinters of basalt flying high catching the sun freeman patted the mpk hed dug out from the ashes by god those krauts make em good harry but now the guns magazine he knew was nearly empty and only a yard or two from the pack he used the tether line to bump it over a pile of shale tearing out the winchester knowing he had the lead slug in the spout he told morgan to lead the submachine gun was better able to sweep the spets position than freemans lead slug which was intended for steel doors and the like the delta major clipped in a new mag having seen the delta force landing brentwood and aussie and two other sas had intended to join them but with a sprawling half mile of snow no doubt mined between them and the delta drop zone the best the three sas men could do was to try to work their way up along the line of the cliff where there were no mines but plenty of spets the idea was quickly abandoned however upon their sighting the meus choppers coming straight for the cliffs albeit on a vector a hundred feet or so below the top of the seventeenhundredfoothigh cliffs once they saw the choppers ah apaches out front the cliff taking a lot of hits much of the shrapnel whizzing above them the sas men knew the chopper force despite all the best intentions in the world could not avoid overshoots of friendly fire the choppers were forcing the spets aboveground to keep their heads down likewise the few survivors of the sas the air now literally singing with warhead fragments the whole idea had been for norton and the marines to come in and secure the island after the sasdelta force had cleared the rats nest in freemans happy phrase little ahead of schedule said aussie wryly keeping his head well down waiting for the marines to sweep in hope to christ those leathernecks dont blast away at us aussie wasnt alone in his estimation of the operation a quartermile north in freemans drop zone brooklyn another trooper declared the operation fubarfucked up beyond all recognition as he hunkered down by an iceveined rock a hundred yards from the rl exit that freeman and morgan were now moving toward morgan calmly ejecting one mag and inserting the other in a smooth threesecond change that would have done any drill instructor proud the approaching choppers were no longer the size of gnats but footballsized as they began to rise for the final hop stop over the jagged lip of the cliff tops into the big faecleared strip now occupied by delta and being fiercely contested by spets who were oozing out of the r exit at an alarming rate in fact thanks to the faes ancillary benefit of having overwhelmed the ventilator filters there were still over a thousand spets filling the tunnels leading to the bottom of the r shaft eager to join their comrades above but the spets heading for r were now the victims of their own ingenuity for to use r would be to split their forces the southern contingent boxed in by the minefields they had sown on the lower half of the island to help trap the enemy paratroops general dracheev although surprised by freemans coldblooded daring in ordering the fae drops though it risked the lives of his own men now almost wished that freeman had ordered in more fae strikes to the south to clear a wider defense area for his own men now that r was so overcrowded spets were pouring out into the thirtyfootdiameter rock basin that bulged protectively from the exit on the landward side of the cliff a delta force spotter fifty yards to freemans left and on slightly higher ground saw the spets come streaming out and tried to get a radio man to tell freeman hed seen at least thirty of the enemy exit in just over a minute the spotter killed three of them before hed been forced back from higher ground by fire from an rpk millimeter light machine gun too far away to toss his grenades but the spets jamming was still effective and the radio man couldnt get the message through to freeman instead a runner was dispatched and cut down before hed gone five paces the frustration of the seventyplus sasdelta force survivors of men trained for lightningfast iko inkillout action but who because of the minefields had been bottled up forced into openground warfare without the assist of heavy mortars and the like manifested itself in freeman he now saw the choppers getting smaller norton having presumably seen that despite all the noise and thunder of ordnance being thrown at the cliff face most of the dugin aa batteries were still intact putting up a wall of lead that had already created seven gaping holes in the chopper line of attack norton had obviously decided that to take the marines in would have been nothing less than suicidal it was a call hed have to square with freeman if freeman survived but it was his call two oh three yelled freeman his shout immediately attracting ak fire albeit inaccurate the spets probably on the move deploying a defensive line morgan and others responded to their fire immediately in an enfilade of semiautomatic fire erupting from the cshaped delta force line whose northern and southern arcs spread out left and right of freeman this time the sustained firing of delta force successfully covered the tenyard dash by one of the two delta men equipped with an m in effect an elevenpound ma rifle with a circularribbed fortymillimeterdiameter grenade launcher a replacement for the old mas forestock with the millimeter mag serving as the handgrip when pulling the trigger of the launcher you figure that basin of theirs is about thirty fifty yards from here freeman asked the commando split the difference general forty suits me son lob six of those babies right in there start with he and alternate with smoke and tear gas canisters one after the other son quick as you can and well have a fuckin rat trap soonern you can fart freeman turned to morgan who was firing another burst on the other side of the m henry get your flank ready hand signals gas masks on we go on ten go on ten got it a loud bang stunned freeman the spets bracketing them with heavy mortar and even as he was signalling the crescent of delta men on his right to ready for an attack on ten he couldnt hear anything but buzzing in his ears as if they were covered by a mass of wasps then he lost sight of his men a thick cloud of tear gas enveloping both delta flanks from where he couldnt tell through the buzz he heard the crash of the first grenade in the basin said good shooting but couldnt hear himself and was struck by the terrible thought that the spets many of whom he knew were trained in english might have picked up his shouted commands whether the tear gas fired at them had been a coincidence or was their own backblasted by a change in the wind he couldnt tell either way he knew he had no choice he heard a second explosion this one clanging the he grenade shrapnel ringing in the rock basin there were screams of men hit his or theirs he couldnt tell another grenade went off then more coming from the spets he tried to look through the smoke but could see nothing next moment it cleared morgan fired and there was a soft red explosion blood no more than twenty feet away the spets shooter slumped not making a sound his nose and right cheek missing freeman brought his wristwatch close to his face nine seconds grasping the winchester tightly he yelled go the sound of his voice coming to him as if in the distance through a long pipe la bataille du bassinthe battle of the basin as the french papers were later to describe it was not as the headline suggested some vast sprawling engagement in the arctic but it was fierce and unyielding to the seventyplus deltasas men who charged following freeman through the tear gas screen to engage the enemy in a swirling smokefilled cauldron of firefights the sounds of the battle reverberated off the rocky amphitheater as americans british and siberians closed handtohand after exhausting their magazines and when the attacking deltasas force was so near the siberians that further fire endangered their own men morgan and freeman were side by side as they reached the rocky basins rim freeman had no option but to fire the lead slug a metal projectile punching through three spets in the congested basin blowing holes the size of sledgehammers and sending flesh and bone flying as if they themselves had exploded before the third spets fell freeman a formidable sight coming through the haze of battle with his shotgun had already pumped delta hands eschewing semiautomatic shotguns because of their proneness to jam one of the four flechette cartridges into the barrel and fired then another then another in all sending out grek or polyethylenebedded steel darts in an expanding cone that killed at least six spets outright injuring another half dozen or more seven delta force fell under sustained ak fire from the spets who a moment before freeman fired had been a compact mass about the r exit a shouted order from among the spets preceded the closing or rather the attempted closing of the r manhole but by now another delta commando had fired his leadslugloaded shotgun from only ten feet away and with a deafening ring akin to the sound of some enormous bell being hammered the steel manhole cover once cold and therefore undetected and untouched by the allied infrared guided aerial bombardment was now billowing smoke like some fumarole the warmer air of the hundredfootdeep tunnels streaming through the ragged baseballsized perforation blown out by the winchesters slug immediately created a fog as it hit the arctic air adding to the confusion of the smokefilled basin freeman went down the victim of a spets stun grenade concussion the winchester clattering on the r cover brentwoods small band of sas survivors breached the basins rim to the right medic morgan shouted and then died lungs pulped to a pink mass by an ak burst at nearpointblank range brentwood evened the score emptying a mag into the spets punching him back into other comrades falling about him not pausing for a second brentwood popped one two three grenades down through the hole in the r cover the thumps and clanging of the explosions sending ricocheting metal zinging about amid the screaming and choking tear gas adding to the general confusion and making it impossible to know friend from foe for at least seven seconds it was a relative silence in the roar of noise and noticed only by the final group of four sas and one delta paratrooper who like brentwood and aussie before them had had to work more slowly than freemans cavalry through a grenadeshovelled path in the minefield in order to reach the basin no one except dracheev in his saddam bunker a hundred feet down and a mile away realized what the immediate implications of the allied grenade attack in the shaft were one moment the siberian commander had been watching his men moving toward the r shaft the next they stopped within seconds he could detect the unmistakable reek of cordite and throatsearing whiffs of tear gas streaming back through the tunnels he knew immediately that the top section of rl must now be penetrated in fact the whole of r had been penetrated insofar as the sheer mass of bodies some barely alive writhing in the hellish cauldron of the top fifty feet of the r shaft was preventing the steel trapdoor hatch at the sixtyfoot level from being closed thus risking the integrity of the entire system the shaft jammed with dead and dying at the top of the shaft david brentwood was yelling half with me half stay topside watch the other exits brentwood knew that most of these rat holes would already be warped even if theyd not been actually penetrated by the air strikes and would therefore be effectively unopenable by the spets still the siberians would need only one or two exits to enable them to swarm up again even now the tenman delta squad deployed on the rim were readying to stave off any counterattack by ad hoc teams of spets who having made their way along the cliff tops north and south of the rocky depression were now attempting to head back to try and retake the r basin in the basin a medic readying to give freeman a shot of antitetanus almost finished what the siberians had begun barely seeing freemans tetanus allergy bracelet in time as the general groggily regained consciousness long enough to give brentwood an order yes sir responded brentwood looking around yelling radio he had to call again before he saw a whip aerial swinging wildly like a fishing rod through the clearing smoke and fumes that were still issuing from r they still have us jammed he asked the radio operator yes sir all static all right get to the cliff top aussie you cover him take two more with you brentwood turned to the radio man use your lamp if you cant get a frequency signal little diomede for the meu to come in theyll pass it on four apaches attacking first the transports to follow fifteen minutes later coming down on the other exits but no spreading out just secure the exits there are still minefields on our flanks brentwood tossed down two more threesecond sas specialsstun grenades of the kind sas had used to clear the iranian embassy in london of terrorists in stepping back quickly from the cover he heard aussie telling him cliff aas are still active theyll blow the meu apaches to pieces do what i tell you shouted brentwood take another two men with you within seconds two more delta commandos were moving with aussie up toward the rim to cover the rear right and left flanks of the signal operator whose lamp was blinking eastward where anyone but the siberians could see it dick nortons scopes on cape prince of wales spotted it the second it began winking the radio relay from little diomedes patriot battery not needed as the four ahs were taking off and heading out over the jagged twentyfivemile ice flow toward ratmanov their hughes gunbelts fully loaded and rocket pods resupplied delta force and sas were in their element doing what they had trained months in some cases years to do every man of them was highly trained in a cross section of skills and every one was in top physical shape eighteen headed north of the basin to carry out freemans order twentyseven headed south where the aa fire from the recessed railmounted batteries had been heaviest map references from the fighter aircrafts largely futile attacks on the recessed aa positions were of some help but the references couldnt be relied upon to any high degree clever bastard quipped aussie to the radio man but the latter didnt answer his concentration eastward lips moving with his morse message when hed received the acknowledgment blink from across the pristine air of the strait he noticed shadows scattered clouds sliding ominously across the ice pack whos a clever bastard he asked aussie aussie fired a long burst at a spets who looking the worse for wear was dodging between rocky outcrops thirty yards down from the basins rim the spets stopped then fell twisting about trying to reach his backpack he slithered down into a pocket of dirty ice streaked by fae detritus whos a clever bastard repeated the radio man brentwood what oh yeah him too but i meant the old man von freeman grunted one of the delta men whod lost two of his best buddies when the general had called in the fae strike okay said aussie hes a rough customer but this is a smart move boyo you hope aussie thought he saw the spets move in the snow or was it a sense of movement created by passing cloud five to one on it works he whispered clipping in another mag not taking his eyes off the spets but not wanting to waste ammunition either you mean what he told brentwood said the delta man yeah whats five to one on asked the american to his right he means said the radio man you bet ten bucks to win one fuck you said the other delta man matteroffactly hey hey said aussie adopting a quiet yet schoolmasterish tone still not taking his eyes off the spets watch your language three to one on done there was an explosion so violent that it shook ice from the cliff top sending it on a sheer fell sixteen hundred feet straight down where it shattered like glass on the floe christ what was that said aussie there was a towering pall of smoke above r seventy yards behind them and the stink of human ordure cfour the radio man said quietly his dull monotone suppressing his fear so determined not to overreact he hardly seemed to react at all brentwood must have dropped a whole he stopped and the others knew why for it might well have been a spetsinduced explosion taking his eyes off the spets aussie glanced back toward the middle of the basin the towering black column of smoke now hundreds of feet in the air because joe mells skidoo conked out hed had to clean the plugs and tinker with the carburetor to get it going again it was civil twilight when he reached the snake mumbling that he should have used the dogs instead he cinched the belt charge securely about the fourfootdiameter pipe took another swig of southern comfort and pushed the button they found bits of him as far as two hundred yards away untouched by the inferno that followed the explosion the charge had not ignited the oil until it raised the temperature of the crude gushing out of the pipe to its flash point forensic analysis of the molecular structure of dimesized pieces from the charges casing recovered by disc metal detectors confirmed what anchorage fbi had been quick to surmise namely that the material was of soviet manufacture and that there had been no timer a guarantee that joe mell identified by dental records would never be able to identify chernkos alaskan sleeper only twelve minutes elapsed between joe mells attack and the two other points of sabotage one on the north slope itself the third at valdez depot where the crude was now afire and fouling the pristine beauty of prince william sound huge globular tarballs of unrefined mousse crude suffocating every sea creature in their path the fire at the spills periphery was so fierce that it split the icecold fir trees lining the sound their sharp cracks heard for miles along the frozen shore the environmental catastrophe that was fouling the waters and killing thousands of animals from seabirds who had become trapped upon landing in the sludge to marmots hibernating in the brooks range enraged environmentalists from nome to washington what would cause the lights of congress to burn late into the winter night however was the stunning realization that the united states its consumption of fuel in the war five times normal usage now had its vital oil artery cut the pipeline could be mended within a week but with the middle east wells afire the awful vulnerability of the pipeline and of the tankers shipping the oil from valdez meant that most of the pacific fleets submarines would have to be deployed to protect the milelong tanker route from valdez to cherry point washington to point conception in california this meant drastically reducing the number of submarines available to the pacific fleet for action in and about the aleutians and in americas ability to interdict the siberian resupply routes from vladivostok sakhalin and the kuril island bases the only positive thing about the situation as far as the pentagon was concerned was that the few peace protesters around the white house now dried to a trickle even those who advocated the united states should let the siberians have their way could not stomach what the siberians had done to the pipeline you could kill a marine but not a marmot commander in chief pacific immediately requested alaska air command to increase chopper patrols over the pipeline and ordered all available subs from bangor washington to the testing range at beck island in behm canal twentyfour miles north of ketchikan on the alaskan panhandle they were to make ready for increased patrols up and down the west coast the chief of naval operations now convinced that with the pipeline under tighter surveillance the weak points in the vital supply link would be the natural attack lanes between the offshore islands all down the coast particularly those from valdez to vancouver island in british columbia to the san juans off washington state cincpacs orders sent another of the brentwood brothersrobert the eldest into action his dual purpose icbmattack sub a sea wolf ii the uss reagan dipped her moorings at bangor washington within hours of the alaska pipeline having been severed heading out for another seventyday war patrol off the west coast of north america her blue crew was not happy being submariners men who in order to accommodate all the gadgetry of modem warfare were forced to live in confined spaces that would have driven landlubbers into a neurotic frenzy in two weeks they were not whiners but during their refit and testing runs on the range they had been within a week of being relieved by the subs gold crew the nuclear reactor of the reagan produced so much power so much fresh water that the overflow had to be jettisoned every day it was the men who wore out first not ships supplies one deck below the control room the missile warfare officer was moving slowly through the red light of blood alley batteries of computers on either side of him winking green red and amber in response to his testing his earphones trailing cord as he and petty officer patrick went through a dry run the captain like most of his annapolisbred ilk was wont to give orders for a launch any time during the long night of a patrol you never knew the officer informed the newcomer patrick whether it was for real or not until the last thirty seconds keeps us on our toes said the mwo the petty officer had another phrase for it but he was a petty officer because along with his efficiency he knew when to keep quiet in the silent service besides he had learned that brentwood was considered a fair man by the crew the quiet shy type though lord help the crewman who screwed up in the world of the soviet alfa ii not as quiet but faster than the sea wolf a split second either way meant life or death the cliff face erupted in gun and surfacetoair missile fire the apaches flew in zigzagging attack pattern but it didnt help them twothirds of the way across the twentyfivemile floe one of them erupted in flame then disintegrated the sam on the retractable launcher took only thirty seconds to slide to the cliff opening a pinhole from where the choppers were and unleash the missile that even the nimble fireflyevasive tactics of the apaches couldnt shake but the rolling smoke from the cliff base as freeman had anticipated in his order to david brentwood told the men whom brentwood had deployed south and north of r along the cliff face precisely where the sam opening was as well as that of the medley of other aa weapons whose assorted fire the remaining three apaches were drawing david brentwood and aussie lewis strapped their ice cleats onto their vapor barrier boots preparing to visit in the sas lexicon the aa position nearest r a sam hole had surprised aussie and the delta radio man when it opened up seemingly only yards away but in fact a hundred feet almost directly below them aussie quickly staked the piton for his white nylon ply line took the strain in his left hand glove and abseiled in a controlled hopfall down the wall of the cliff another delta man having taken his place to guard the radio man from any landward attack by the spets for a moment brentwood was worried that his ice cleats would be heard cutting into the cliff face but just as quickly forgot about it as he went over the lip into the sustained roar of the siberians zsu quads throwing out their tracer and the din of the sams flashback in its manmade cave aussie was abseiling down the cliff on the other side of the sam hole thirty feet from brentwood from his vantage point on the islands southernmost end the cbn reporter could see the dots of the three apache helicopters and the cliff coming alive through the smoke but because there was so much smoke particularly the exhausts from the sams whose breath immediately turned the frigid air to fog the zoom on his sony video camera was useless weve got to get closer he told the hunter urgently through minefields no way youd better signal a chopper ride if those troop whirlybirds make it back again youve got an sos flare havent you shot back the newsman so thats for emergencies what the hell do you call this moment you see those troop chinooks going in you pull that tab you divert a chopper just so you can get pictures man youre gonna be in a lot of shit ill take the rap its worth another grand okay agreed the hunter ill fire the flare but im staying here i dont like those whirlybirds id rather walk back to all right all right said the cbn reporter anxiously looking through the eyepiece again damn that smoke now and then he could see white dots moving against the black cliff where one of the earlier and unsuccessful air attacks had blasted the ice off exposing the black basalt beneath had it not been for the smoke the reporter would have seen at least twenty dots seven twoman teams and six individuals abseiling down the cliff face apache fire killed half a dozen of the deltasas commandos as shrapnel ricocheted across the race it killed two commandos outright others lost their footing or had their lines severed and fell down on the floe aussie brentwood and the other teams ignored everything else focusing only on the particular rat hole below them on the cliff face at ninetyfive feet which had taken them less than a minute to reach brentwood and aussie were above the sam site either side of it none of the twenty commandos had used grenades but rather lumps of c plastique with threesecond detonatorfuses they didnt want to simply snuff out the operating crews but knock the aa batteries and sam transoms right off their rails hopefully bringing down the rock ceiling as well two commandos were spotted by spets loaders who had gone forward right to the sheer dropoff of their caves ledge in order to clear rock and ice debris shaken loose by the vibration of their own firing it was also the only place to get a draft of fresh icecool air now that the ventilators that had kept the weapon bays clear of smoke werent up to capacity due to freemans and brentwoods attack on the r basin but the remaining eighteen allied commandos did the job each man in the seven twoman teams tossing in the c simultaneously only one missed falling the charge exploding at the sevenhundredfoot level sending up ice shards some over six feet long that caught the cloudfiltered sun before they shattered killing two of the remaining six individual line commandos as the deltasas team hauled themselves back up the cliff dracheevs force however paid a much heavier price seventeen of the eighteen holes or caves were hit wiped out aa quad mountings and sam launchers blown off their rail mounts inclining roofward or pointing at the ice floes at ridiculously inoperable angles they were too heavy to manhandle back onto the rails the latter buried in any case by collapsing rock piles and scaffolding from a distance it looked like a dust storm was issuing forth from the cliff the rush of black and white rock now gravelpouring down the cliffs like molten waterfalls plunging to the ice floe fifteen hundred feet below the air steaming up as if volcanic vents had been unzipped all along the cliffs base the bodies of some of the more than fiftythree spets aa and missile crews momentarily visible in the alliedmade avalanche let the up goddamn it ordered freeman getting up off the litter im all right general you took a bad fall concussion sometimes doesnt let the up it delayed the takeoff of the apache chopper which had been turned into an air ambulance heading back to cape prince of wales it was now sprouting two litters for wounded on either side at the moment when his control room shivered photographs splintering from the enormous shock waves of the allied charges on the cliff major general dracheev knew his garrison was defeated his spets would fight to the death if asked but it would be nothing more he told his duty officer than apodpolnaya boynya underground abattoir it was impossible to get a message through the jammed hub of wounded up to r and so tearing off a piece of his bed sheet sticking it on the bayonet of an ak he personally made his way through the choking dust of the tunnel leading out to the nearest aa gun emplacement weaving his way carefully through the burning remnants of what had been a zsu quad he saw the bodies of its crew or rather what was left of them cast about the tunnel so violently that it only added to his resolve the stench of human ordure mixed with the sulfurous stench of the cs aftermath and incinerated guano hitherto frozen by the ice almost overwhelmed him dracheev saw two apaches now alarmingly big passing up then out of sight above the cliff hello he called from the tunnel his voice echoing out from the cliff as he disgustedly thrust out the ak the white sheet slapping stiffly in the breeze the surrender formally took place eleven minutes later at hours though there was sporadic fighting by groups of spets along the island until dracheev was taken aboard one of the apaches and using a booster hailer to overcome the noise of the chopper told his troops below it was all over brentwood it was freeman congratulating him good job son damn good job thank you sir said brentwood but his mind was clearly on something else behind him aussie lewis choir williams and others were steering the spets to the ad hoc weapons dump in the basin there aks s even hk mpk and rounds of ninemillimeter parabellum along with grenades clattered on the heap many of the spets had to come up so fast theyd not had time to put on their white overlays they were already shivering but no one suspected for a moment that it was from fear a strange air of equality between the two forces even in the spets defeat ah general began brentwood his tone betraying his unwillingness to go on ah weve got a bit of a problem here sir what sir that cbn reporter you ordered off little diomede at the beginning what about him wheres morgan freeman was looking about morgan bought it sir said brentwood freeman hands on hips stared at the pile of weapons son of a bitch he turned to brentwood the news guy too no sir replied brentwood hes still with us well cant kill those bastards someone thought he said unfortunately but this was pure speculation the men around freeman waiting for the general to explode on hearing that the reporter hadnt followed orders deliberate shot back freemanor couldnt they get him off in time ah deliberate im afraid sir send him to me the cluster of sas men looked at one another normally there might have been a wink or two relishing the reaming out of one of the news nits as the sas called them all of them hated the press but none of the brits were in the mood for entertainment just yet too many of their closest friends were charred lumps wasted by the fae that the american general had called in whats your name freeman asked the cbn reporter lamonte general rick lamonte he indicated his press card pinned to the arctic fox collar cbn that the communist broadcasting network no general freeman grunted you send all your equipment to major brentwood here understand general im listen lamonte im not having you invading americas dinner hour with your bloodandguts footage least not before any nextofkin is notified you got that i havent got pictures of any wounded general wasnt close enough too much debris in the air the general said nothing and there was an unnerving silence broken only by the wokka wokka wokka of the rotors on the marine expeditionary units ch transports most of the leathernecks were disgusted some relieved that they were to be used only for mopup or as one sergeant put it roundup duty on the ground everyone was waiting for freeman to respond to lamonte everyone knew that ratmanov rick as hed already been dubbed must have at least the fae strikes in glorious technicolor and that the pentagons pr types would be scrambling for damage control well check your tape out freeman told lamontemake sure youve got nobodys mug shots on there i dont want the mother of some fine chipped in lamonte you got any film left in that thing freeman knew very well that it was a video camera and how to run it hed taken enough shots of his children when they were young but he enjoyed affecting ignorance about such matters in front of the press it gave him tactical advantage when they least expected it not much general said lamonte how much is that couple of minutes all right follow me lamonte visibly relieved the commandos werent going to confiscate his tape and equipment with it followed freeman toward the cliff side of the basin the general carefully made his way over bodies siberian as well as british and american till he got an angle for the video from which no faces of american dead could be seen all right he told lamonte take a shot here no further than five paces from me alright lamonte couldnt believe his luck the legendary freeman on tape surrounded by spets oily smudged air wafting across the basin from persistent pockets of fae and smaller fires still burning would have a dramatic effect before the lens and that look of freemans helmet on chin strap tight the new york anchor would flip the son of a bitch had the pose down to a t as if hed practiced it before a mirror tough face but creased with concern as moved by the enemy dead as his own the cerulean blue sky and blackandwhite jagged cliff behind him a perfect backdrop christ hed win an oscar thirtysecond clip instructed freeman not breaking the pose when lamonte had finished freeman called brentwood and several delta men over get in the next shot men he told them big of him said choir williams sarcastically his earlier mood of high optimism now gone wiped out when the fae had burned the rest of his mates alive e doesnt realize it chimed in another brit but es putting himself on trial theyll have to weigh this glory bullshit against the shots of the jelly he meant the fae freeman knows that said brentwood thats the point do we want to win or not well jocko posited choir his familiarity with an officer nearing contempt a tone that only the closeness of commandos could tolerateyou werent one of those who was cooked were you now brentwood didnt reply refusing to be drawn into it any further it wasnt for him to judge the american people the pentagon every barroom expert would do that all david brentwood knew was that they were running up the stars and stripes and the union jack over rat island you bastards it was one of the marine medics shouting at the spets prisoners while helping another marine steer shirer toward a medevac chopper the firstaid bandage theyd put about his eye already soaked with blood chapter fourteen the president of the united states was not as forgiving of his general as david brentwood thought he would be mayne didnt question freemans decision to use fae after all the white house and the chiefs of staff had given him the authority and mayne knew the burden of such responsibility my congratulations general on your victory said mayne tersely over the satellite hookup between the white house and freemans cape prince of wales hq now what in hell were you doing disobeying an order by your commander in chief mr president i didnt lead the attack i went in when i thought the situation warranted it dont dance with me general you may have thought the situation warranted it but i thought i made it clear to you what we need is your strategy not your bravado mr president i understand but if youll forgive me we didnt have time for a cabinet meeting on that starlifter sometimes you have to know all the rules in order to break one of them he paused when necessary president mayne conceded the point but then with trainor and che joint chiefs of staff listening in he told general freeman of the pipeline sabotage and how this meant an increased surveillance responsibility for the navy on the west coast and substantially less naval force to protect freemans flank outside the white house the sleet was turning to rain splattering against the windows sweeping torrentially across the forlorn patio youve done the job douglas youve knocked out ratmanov and secured the shortest route to siberia but i have to tell you that intelligence he paused and freeman could hear him conferring momentarily with trainor and the joint chiefs of staff including general grey douglas signal intelligence as well as human intelligence confirm the siberians have moved the fifth army eastward spearheaded by their thirtyfirst motorized division he was referring to the famed thirtyfirst stalingrad motorized division whose forebears had crushed the best the wermacht had causing von paulus to surrender the entire german sixth army freeman knew that what the president was telling him was that ratmanov had been the easy part the hard part was about to begin the criticism of freemans use of fae on his own troops was savage editorial writers across the country lost no time in pointing out that he had lost percent casualties the highest in any one action since the tet offensive and the marines fighting retreat from chosin reservoir in korea well dick said freeman philosophically running the fingers of one hand through his thinning gray hair while he held the offending editorials in his other its a short step from hosanna to hoot yes sir by god said freeman his ire rising slapping the editorial in europe they said the attack on minsk was the most brilliant since sherman wheeled and drove through to the sea now theyre pillorying me those sons of bitches always root out the negative and those powdered pricks hiding behind their goddamn cameras criticizing us with a fivesecond clip if they cant find anything to bitch about they make it up he looked angrily across at norton i dont read anything here about that pilot of ours shirer put in norton yes shirer thats it remember him from korea brave man went in on the deck to try and protect us no editorials about what those animals the siberian elitedid to him what they would have done to all of our boys if wed lost that godforsaken rock he picked up his reading glasses and walked over to the map shaking his head stopping taking off his glasses and tapping ratmanovthey dont think i bleed for those boys but damn it seventyfour casualties dick seventyfour we lose more than that on the roads every day his glasses were tapping the bunch of editorials in his other hand criticism like this its its disproportionate fecal diatribe first operation in history where we went in outnumbered ten to one yes yes the meu followed but we got em by the balls dick and norton said nothing part of being freemans aide was the ability to let the general vent his spleen against rancid reporters whose ego thundered freeman is ten times as big as any generals i know he paused including mine norton risked a smile but knew that for the time being silence was the most prudent policy it was still touch and go for crying out loud schwarzkopf lost more than that norton thought it inadvisable to point out that stormin norman had fielded over half a million men that freemans percent casualty rate for schwarzkopf would have meant a quarter of a million casualties but he knew the general was right too it was comparing apples and oranges it wasnt simply a numbers game and he suspected that in the supposedly cool objective halls of the pentagon there was sheer envy of freemans grandstand style well general hazarded norton youre going to have a chance to prove them wrong about you it was a sobering thought and it stopped freemans outrage against the newspapers and tv editors dead in its tracks the opportunity he knew was siberia siberia to ratmanov was as a sea to an island its danger far more widespread and unknown the tooth to taillogistical problem alone would be the greatest military undertaking in history freeman held the editorials over the waste bin one of these he indicated a los angeles times column calls the profligate with my troops as if i dont the clipping fell from his hand and snatching his parka he went out into the arctic night swearing at a zipper that took too long to engage when the cold air hit him it took his breath away and in the sheen of twilight filled with the heavy drumming of transport planes overhead escorting the airborne sapper and engineer battalions who were clearing any remaining minefields and the ice crust off ratmanovs summertime airfield he saw a squiggle of water between the ice floes and reached for his field glasses in the binoculars circle he saw a seabird covered with oil flapping and slipping helplessly on the ice in a futile effort to get airborne exhausting itself on the floe another oilsoaked bird watched helplessly nearby he thought of doreen and how he had not thought of her at all during the battle of how he might never see her again and of how many american mothers and sweethearts would think of him as a butcher but he could not cry not because at that moment he did not want to or would have been ashamed of it but because he felt himself constrained by a sense of destiny of mission he couldnt explain it to others but he knew it was true and would not afford him the luxury of selfpity calling instead to his side churchills stirring rendition of the ancient psalm arm yourselves and be ye men of valor and be in readiness for the conflict for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altars as the will of god is in heaven even so let it do the brief daylight of the strait was gone and across the darkness that at that moment seemed impenetrable yet across which he knew he must lead the great invasion lay sibir ethereally silent and waiting a land so vast so used to consuming her own that he knew she would not be loath to devour an enemy back inside there were more faxes of editorial criticism armchair strategists freeman harrumphedtheyre all suffering from iraqi fever dick the conviction that you can go in against a dugin enemy and suffer next to no casualties based on the erroneous assumption that every enemy commander will be as incompetent as saddam insane freeman held up his hand as if to forestall any objection im taking nothing from schwarzkopf didnt know what theyd be up against had every right to expect major resistance and by god what those pilots did our boys and those british tornadoes going in on the deck like that magnificent brave as the argentine flyers when they went for the warships instead of the transports in the falklands course the iraqis most of em dont want to the for a madman but the sibirs dick freeman shook his head different breed altogether general i dont mean to interrupt but ive got a marine captain medical corps wants to see you oh hell i told them im fine no aftereffects just got a bump on my head thats all he insists on seeing you sir all right dick send him in meanwhile i want you to get the invasion book it was a sixinchthick computer printout of everything from guns to gum that american forces would need for the siberian campaign i dont want to give novosibirsk any more time man i have to landings have to be made simultaneously and within three weeks whats the sitrep on the european front thats where the siberiansll expect our major push youre right general thats why its a stalemate theyve thrown in another ten divisions a hundred and thirty thousand fresh troops and theyre keeping our boys and the brits stalled were still over a hundred miles west of the urals but already norton could see freeman was thinking of the east siberian offensive the general telling him were going to have to make up for a falloff in navy protection sir the marine captain what oh yes all right send him in meantime you can get a progress report for the on that kommandorsky battle group of ours i want the missouri and wisconsin pounding the bejaysus out of the air field and the sub bases mere after ratmanov thats the one forward bastion we have to knock off otherwise the bastardsll harass our supply lines right across the north pacific salt lake citys giving them air cover right yes general and find out what the japanese are doing whether the presidents got them off their ass to help us or whether theyre doing another gulf sitonyourass routine ill get on to it right away sir capt michael devine was a small stocky man with an md that had given him his captains bars it struck freeman though he hadnt noticed it while he was on the choppers stretcher litter that the captain must have barely made the marine height requirement captain said freeman smiling now i appreciate your concern for your commanding officer commendable but i feel just dandy so thank you for coming but general thats not why im here oh the diminutive captain looked even smaller as freeman cocked his head back in surprise can i speak plainly sir only way captain shoot sir you requested ordered my medics to take you off the stretcher i did i understand they you argued with them freeman was scowling i told them captain to unstrap the from that goddamn contraption so i could get back to killing russians thats what im paid for freeman glowered down at devine whats your beef general it took at least fortyfive seconds to get you out of that air safety harness it takes an enemy mortar crew only thirty seconds to bracket us from the moment we land that means from the point of touchdown to takeoff my men have thirty seconds to load four stretchers litters and to be clear for the choppers takeoff the kind of delay you caused us could cost the a chopper crew and wounded freeman was reddening by the second he walked to within a foot of the captains face his voice filling the room ive never been spoken to like that in my life captain i suppose youre one of those jokers who thinks talking back to the old man gets you kudos no sir but im responsible for my men out there i cant run a must if half my men are killed devine was pastyfaced from the effort devane i think youd better leave dismissed sir said devine stepping back saluting smartly but turning about shakily for a moment freeman was speechless then he kicked the wastebasket so violently that editorials exploded from it putting his glasses on he tried to concentrate on the map of siberia the railway that was the key in russkies had surprised the japanese by being able to shift four entire armies from the western front to the far eastern theater in just eight weeks utilizing rail cars on the transsiberian the gall of that pipsqueak captain walking in where the hell did he think he was goddamn ama convention he snatched the phone dick yes general that runt of a captain you sent the tore a goddamn strip off me me said i was endangering his chopper crew how dyou like that all i wanted to do was get back in the fighting said i could have cost him his whole crew medics and all insolent son of a bitch told the enemy only took thirty seconds to bracket yes sir yes sir what demanded freeman hes correct general no he isnt roared freeman its twentyfive seconds to bracket not thirty dick general second that son of a bitch from meu to my hq so goddamned smart he can run all the musts beg pardon general but not as captain you have to be at least a colonel all right make him a colonel field commission no i dont want to hear any flak about normal channels remember what von runstedt said about normal channels dick have an idea im about to find out general a trap for officers without initiative that devane hes read devine sir names devine well hell dick with a name like that well have to make him bishop walked right up to the and told the id screwed up we need men like that but dick sir not too many no sir freeman was now studying the enlarged satellite pictures of the kamchatka peninsula in particular the region about petropavlovsk where the enemy had built bombproof sub pens in the nineteeneighties for forward naval defense for a moment he couldnt find his glasses and cursing patted his pockets making a mental note to have one of his aides drill a hole in the magnifying glass handle as he was shortsighted in only one eye it would save him forever searching no way would he wear one of those chains he grabbed his parka and told the duty officer hed be outside after the pipeline sabotage two guards had been ordered by norton to accompany the general wherever he went just to be on the safe side with the stipulation however that they must stay well back and make as little noise as possible pulling his forage cap down tightly beneath the parka hood the general walked through snow flurries head down against the wind and thwacking his thermal overlays with a swagger stick given him by cinclant commander in chief atlantic at norwood uk before hed left europe trudging through the snow he was doing what norton and other aides referred to as his moses in the desertmeditating upon the forthcoming campaign recalling as was his wont the great commanders of history not their virtues everyone knew those but their defects their mistakes at such moments he was lost in a kind of reverie of anticipation and awesome responsibility and now in the flurries of snow that soon gave way to a steady wind the thought that stole quietly upon him then possessed him and would fuel all his tactics was a conviction that wherever possible he must choose the battleground not the siberians he must force them to come to him though it was their country to fight on the ground of his choosing the trick of course was how to do it it would involve doing precisely the opposite of what they would anticipate the master plan excited him but then like the mournful cry of an arctic wolf the sound of the ice pressure ridges crushing carried the warning that the unfrozen sea to the south was both his way and his impediment to siberia now that ratmanov had been secured marine expeditionary forces could be transported by air and air bases secured on the sparsely populated northern tundra of siberia across the strait bases from which us air strikes could be made down the shield of kamchatka peninsula but then what he stopped suddenly in the snow the two marine guards looking nonplussed at one another snow now having been replaced by rain old von freeman was seemingly oblivious to the fact he had seen the burning bush the pentagon would think him mad as they had thought macarthur mad when he had decided to hit inchonthe worst possible choice the experts had told him as they had thought hannibal mad for crossing the alps extending his supply line against all common sense and so too schwarzkopfs commanders had been shocked by the idea of an outflanking left hook around the republican guard and there had been the great failures too which as the chiefs of staff had said were doomed and which had ruined many a career when freeman showed it to dick norton the only officer privy to his plan so far norton immediately saw the potential for a debacle in the middle of winter general remember frederick the great dick laudace laudace toujours laudace it was one of the generals favorite sayings perhaps general said norton but he wont be with us yes he will said freeman and there wasnt a trace of frivolity in the generals tone nor in his eyes his eyes were fixed on the map you know what a steeplechase rider does before the jumps dick no idea general walks the course freeman said indicating the map ive walked the course dick he flashed a smile metaphorically speaking of course but ive been with them all right his hand swept out over the western front the german campaigns napoleons but i must confess no ones been here far eastern tvd and right now dick those commies in novosibirsk are thinking how can they outfox me he turned to norton once more you think they have any surprises dick be surprised if they didnt general so would i but what are they freeman and norton together with the rest of his hq staff pored over the myriad details for three possible amphibious landings south of the bering strait everything was considered special forces that might be required for beach clearance amphibious hovercraft going in over the icebreakercleared channels in the thicker coastal ice assault ships cargocarrying choppers airlift hercules attack helicopters landing vehicles air cover and close ground support from subsonic to mach aircraft then there were engineer and sapper battalions supertough plastic piping fascinetubes that could be dumped to fill a trench and across which a sixtyton m tank could pass as well as flail and grader tanks to clear mines and fiberglasshulled mine clearers for the sea lanes one armored division alone would need thousand gallons of fuel thousand gallons of water thousand meals and thousand tons of ammunition a day all had to be assigned integrated into the overall attack plans freeman made it his personal responsibility to talk to the catering corps commanders eliciting individual guarantees that each man in action would receive the required calories a day for troops in arctic battle kick ass do what you have to freeman told them but remember napoleon an army marches on its stomach if any of you forget it ill have your hide plus a thousanddollar fine hes got no authority to fine us least not that much complained a cook you want to find out asked a quartermaster the offended man was shaking his head pleased to see freeman was moving on to breathe fire over some other poor bastard those sas guys were right its von freeman the general had already heard a rumor about the von appellation and asked norton if it was true uh yes general fraid so freeman made no comment and seemingly turning to a completely different subject informed norton that hed seen some of the canadian forces personnel assigned with his command wearing beards hadnt noticed general well i have i want them off today general canadian navy sort of follows royal navy tradition allows i dont give a goddamn what the royal navy allows i want those beards off and if you dont know why dick youre not doing your goddamn homework no sir sometimes norton wrote in his diary that evening douglas freeman could be as ornery as a cut pig the general he figured knew that like dracheev novosibirsk in the person of marshal yesov c in c siberian forces had its own surprises as yet he had no idea what they were though she was thoroughly familiar with the sights and smells of a military hospital lana was still unprepared its not as bad as it looks said shirer gamely his head completely swathed in bandages that held the compress against his left eye i m began lana having to compose herself after having heard from the doctor upon her arrival in anchorage that it was possible that the optic nerve had been partially severed she smiled bravely spoke softly im a nurse remember right said frank there was no point kidding one another if the optic nerve was severely damaged then it would be the end of franks career as a fighter pilot the fact that it was the same eye that had been injured during his time as a presidential pilot didnt make it any easier for him to accept he knew that lana could live with it preferring that he never go back into combat but like most of his ilk he lived for flying take away that he told her and lana said there was no point talking about it till they knew for certain and she immediately felt guilty if it had been any other patient she would have listened knowing it was part of the therapy but with the man she loved she found herself instead falling back on the bland cliches of reassurance and then just as quickly putting forth the most optimistic prognosis they can do wonders now lasers you know at one time when a retina became detached remember the rumpole man frank thought she meant the actor no mortimer the lawyer who wrote it his father had both retinas detached slipped a few feet one day on a ladder blind for the rest of his life well nowadays they can spot weld the retinas back with a laser overnight stay in hospital thats all maybe even day surgery frank said nothing trying not to grimace with the pain the demerol was wearing off but lana had seen too many wounded not to have some idea of what it must have been like when the eye had been gouged literally hanging by its optic nerve and later when tiny fragments of foreign material had to be scraped from the eyeball sitting down beside his bed she took his hand in hers and for a moment was transported back to her first casualty of the war young william spence and shivered despite her resolve she forced another smile well at least ill be seeing more of you when i can get leave from dutch that is she tried to make it all breezy accentuate the positive but could see that either frank hadnt heard her or was momentarily overcome with the pain or both his hand tightened involuntarily as a spasm pierced the bloody socket of the eye striking deep inside his skull somewhere what i cant figure out he began shifting position in the false belief of so many patients that movement itself would relieve the pain when it was really a shift in concentration that momentarily diverted thoughts of the pain is why did the bastard do it there was no point to it i mean frank forced himself up further in the bed lana stacking the pillows behind him staying close to him gently massaging his neck he turned to her and she could see now how swollen the purplish and dark red tissue around the eyeball was no point frank continued trying to get information from me i mean they were overrun under attack damn it what in hell did it matter what airfield or carrier i came from our guys were swarming all over them vengeance lana said simply her tone pregnant with the authority of experience she was thinking of her husband jay some people are like that doesnt make sense doesnt have to frank they get a kick out of it if youre under attack continued frank you do what you have to i guess i mean i know what its like in a furball its you or the other guy but hell why would someone come back at you like he did and its its like shooting some guy in a chute lana was moved by this streak of naïveté in frank a few years ago before shed been introduced to jay and was overcome by the poise and wealth of jays jetsetting image she had met frank briefly and gone out with him a couple of times when he was one of the oneeyed jacks of the presidents elite pilot list then she would have been was the naive one not him but with jay shed grown up quickly too quickly she thought sometimes after la roche his sick sex the beatings and the threatened tabloid smear of her parents should she even dare to leave him without his permission she had realized in a rush of growing up just how brutal life could be and now she found herself explaining sheer malice to frank a quality that was as alien to him as the thought of being grounded for the rest of his life he was a warrior a reflection of her dad in his forthrightness his assumption that bravery under fire was de rigueur and nothing exceptional he might be one of americas top aces a survivor of the mig attacks led by the celebrated soviet who had shot him down and whom frank had in turn downed over korea but about men like jay laroche he would never understand his ideal of honor like general freemans was in one sense ageless and as old for all the hightech machines he flew as the dream of camelot yet it was a vision that in the end sustained him as powerfully as the image of the shark held jay in awe of sheer power unencumbered by anything as antiquated in jays words as principle it almost pained lana more to see frank perplexed by evil than to see him in the trauma of the pain she couldnt bear to hear him wonder about the kind of cruelty she hoped she had left behind with jay she wanted to get him off the subject you hear about marchenko it worked his attention immediately arrested by the mention of the soviet top gun lana said it as if marchenko were still alive which was impossible franks rio had seen the fulcrum burst on impact over manchuria unless he felt his heart thumping he didnt get out thats the story she said course it could be siberian propaganda the rumor mill you know how they love to for a split second shirer was oblivious to his pain but anderson didnt see a silk i mean he stopped casting his mind back yes they had definitely seen the fulcrum hit a silent orange blossom against the mountainous folds of snow i remember he said i asked anderson any sign of a chutenegative could he have missed it said lana i mean was it a clear day or frank felt a stabbing beat between his eyes like someone driving a stake into his forehead above the bridge of his nose damn it lana didnt know a thing about planes when hed first talked to her about mach she thought it was someone called mac it had become a joke between them mac the knife but in her laymans ignorance of things aeronautical she had with the unwitting luck of people who like his mother chose a winner at churchill downs because the horse had a nice name instead of studying the guide to form managed to hit the bullseye with her question there had been cloud and it was quite possible anderson had missed seeing a chute the whole wing could have missed it high above the stratus everyone on a high after the shoot eyes scanning above and behind lest any more bandits should come out of the sun into their cone to even the score you should ask him when you get back proffered lana back where it wasnt said in selfpity but until the bandage came off and theyd done the tests no one would know where he was going that was the first problem the second one was that the spets had made it impossible for anderson to answer anything frank felt exhausted the hospital gown clinging to him from perspiration he couldnt bring himself to tell her about how anderson had died wondering whether theyd found his body yet on a floe finding your dead wasnt a high priority when you were on the eve of a major battle since the siberians were fully expecting freeman to attack and were probably buoyed rather man depressed by how close the americans had come to losing ratmanov it was sure to be one of the bloodier battles of the war the scuttlebutt around the hospital was that freemans convoys were underway even now frank she asked him gently deciding that they might as well hit it headon after all have you thought what you might like to do if the tests are negative if there isnt much they can do to restore your no he said brusquely i havent his sudden uncharacteristic mood change was spawned by thoughts of what hed do if he ever caught up with the spets who had maybeblinded him in the left eye for life he didnt like what he thought of doing and visibly distressed tried to evict the thoughts of sheer vengeance as swiftly as an ice hockey forward checking another but the more he tried the more persistent they became dont fight it said lana with a prescience that surprised him my dad always told the you cant help what you think its what you do that counts frank shrugged was she talking about what hed like to do to the spets or marchenkoif the soviet was still alive well he told himself he wouldnt be doing much of anything if the doc said the eye was finished it would be home and repatriation he knew he couldnt explain it to anyone who wasnt a flyer but quite calmly without a trace of selfpity frank shirer told himself that if he couldnt fly again life simply wouldnt be worm it might as well tell a man hed be impotent for life sorry hon lana said but i have to go get my ride back to dutch damn dutch i know but with freemans yeah responded frank youre going to be needed unfortunately when she kissed him she was surprised by the lack of warmth so preoccupied was he with what the future held for him his mind wasnt even on sexive asked one of the boys flying the medevac hercules she told him to call the hospital here even then i dont know when ill be able to i know he said ill get word to you soon as i can she didnt trust herself to answer without getting all teary for heavens sake lana she told herself on the army shuttle bus back to elmendorf hes not dead but shed never seen him so dispirited either more like a small boy sent to the dugout than someone dealing realistically with his situation of course it was never the same when you werent the one it was happening to everyone knew how to deal with it when they werent involved but it was because she had loved the boy in frank that made it so terrible when she left him hed looked old maybe after his pain subsided she closed her eyes gripping her shoulder bag hard as the bus wound up around the abm sites that ringed elmendorf praying for the return of the time during which she had believed absolutely in a benevolent and allloving god asking begging that franks sight not be damaged beyond repair that he might fly again as rounds began for the doctors at anchorage hospital the sun was shining off the chugash mountains turning them a creamy pink in a breathtaking backdrop to the harbor over four thousand miles to the west outside the kmk kuznetsky metallurgical kombinat factory in novokuznetsk southeast of novosibirsk it was midnight but there was to be no delay the director dismissed the argument of the works political officer that it would be better to exact punishment in daylight where more people would see it the directors point being that the offense of the worker one dimitri menisky talking about the factory work through a haze of vodka among friends was such a serious breach of security under the circumstances that novosibirsk would simply brook no procrastination in any case argued the director forcefully the execution within an hour of the mans arrest would have a salutary effect accordingly menisky fortythree father of two a boy ivan and a girl tatya was taken outside engine shop three well away from the pile of scrap metal lest there be any ricochet and despite his falling on his knees and begging for mercy was machinegunned to death while snow poured through the penumbra of the yellow yard light his crumpled body was left for one hour this being a concession to the political officer to make the point among the other workers it was superfluous for within ten minutes of the execution every man and woman in the kmk already knew about the fate of dimitri menisky from shop three and no one was going to say anything to anyone outside the factory about what was going on inside the surgeon attending frank shirer was twentynine and with his white coat wore an air of authority that his baby face undermined not surprisingly he tried to compensate by wearing a nononsense gradgrindlike countenance particularly in front of an air ace projecting a stern preoccupation with facts for this reason some of the older veterans among the patients called him detective joe fridayjust the facts maam just the facts well major fact is the tests confirm that vision in the left eye is virtually nil even with our technology theres nothing much shirer didnt hear the rest didnt want to his normally rugged handsome features took on a slategray pallor while the doctors voice seemed far off he was nevertheless acutely aware as in the rush of a dogfight of every smell and color about him a sharp smell of iodine coming from the next bed the stench of sick from several beds to his right yet he looked disbelieving his mind temporarily rejecting what he had clearly heard this despite the fact that hed been preparing for it all night it was as if they had him up past seven gs in the centrifuge his body clammy with the shock feeling like a sponge being crushed by an immense immovable weight so detective joes voice was floating about the periphery of the spinning uncontrollable world youll have to be content with flying a desk from now on fact is he couldnt bring himself to call lana the stench of defeat redolent in the hospitals pervasive and cloying antiseptic as oppressive to him as when hed first entered he felt his hatred of the siberians rising and did nothing to thwart the flood of bile sensing that if he tried to fight it now hold it back it would permanently poison him and make him something he did not want to be voodoo priests stuck pins into dolls all he could do knowing the improbability of ever meeting the spets who had gouged his eye was envisage shooting down marchenko the mig ace becoming the embodiment of all his disappointment and anger it was unreasonable he knew but you had to focus on something when the wave her soft fullbosomed perfume reminding him of lana removed the bandage to change the dressing he could see only a watery milky image of her in the country of the blind the oneeyed man was king but not in the united states air force the fact as dr joe friday had underscored with his diagnosis was that the usaf did not would not entrust a oneeyed man with seventy million dollars worth of merchandise a limey one of a handful of sas survivors from the rat raid was walking up the aisle between the beds his face a gauze mask whatcha mate have a fag he offered shirer a benson and hedges course you cant puff it in ere old muwer legreell be onto you the gauze mask nodded toward the head nurse at her station tough old bird commented the cockney rawer fight the muwerinlaw an thats sayin somethin no thanks said frank to the proffered cigarettes dont smoke he wanted the man to go away could never understand limeys properly anyhow neiver did i till the punchup started miss a drag somethin fierce when im in the sheep dip shirer didnt know what the hell the sheep dip was and he knew the limey knew he didnt know so why the hell didnt he just bug off slit trench explained the gauze maskfilled wif all kinds o muck sheep shit dead rats you name it sport its there hard to lie in it wivout movin for up to twelve hours no fuckin tea party i can tell you mat guess not said shirer disinterestedly still id rawer a sheep dip than this lot he jerked a nicotinestained thumb toward his mask fuckin phantom of the opera least you got your fuckin face avent you frank knew that jfk had been right life was unfair and in a world where thousands starved while you had the glorious privilege of flying you had no cause to moan but the limey didnt help at least not then with his wisecracking camouflaging his own terror beneath the british mask of selfdeprecation yet this wounded english soldier was to have a profound effect on what would happen to shirer you a sky jockey asked the cockney was said frank ah never say the mate never say the the brit reminded frank of eliza doolittles father get the to the church on time he thought about lana about whether theyd ever be able to get married whether the slimeball jay la roche would ever release her thinking of lana he felt himself having what the nurses called a tent the erection pressing against the sheet he wanted to tell the limey to buzz off yet he knew what the limey had said was right you should never say the but the prospects right then were as bleak as the aleutians in the winter chill and like all who are very ill no matter for how short or long a time he found it impossible at that moment to imagine he could ever be well again and that fear was his real terror chapter fifteen northern pacific quantity has a quality of its own said freeman in his address to the task force commanders gathered aboard the marines lhd amphibious assault ship the uss winston davis its a leninist dictum the russians have embraced ever since the bolshevik revolution their reasoning is simple throw enough at the enemy overwhelm him with numbers of tanks ships planes and men and some are bound to get through enough to breach our defenses your job gentlemen now and my job when we go ashore is to stop them stop them so effectively that even if a few can get through it wont be enough to impede us the attendant danger for us however is not the siberians it is that in stopping them we will adopt an overly defensive mode that would be a crucial mistake our job is to attack to take irkutsk just west of lake baikal irkutsk is the key gentlemen if we take irkutsk our air force will be able to radiate out into the industrial heart of siberia without irkutsk our bombers fighter escorts would have to have inair refueling distances are too great so our job is to attack the siberian shield to get far enough in so that our fighters dont have to refuel in air and become sitting ducks he paused eyes taking in the collective brass in the ships riggedforred situation room theres another old adage gentlemen as true now as it was for sherman offense is the best defense his fist clenched go forward to meet them engage at every possible point the entire soviet military philosophy rests upon the necessity of the quick victory before their administrative deficiencies their overcentralization constipates their lines of supply in this their navy and air force are no different from their army theyll throw everything everything theyve got at us but if you can hold and advance youll turn the tide attack gentlemen attack thats the strategy here freemans message to the noncommissioned officers and men throughout the seventh fleets task force was much more succinct nothing in history compares with this battle siberia the only country now capable of imposing its will on the rest of the world is testing our will novosibirsk had a chance for peace and chose war instead well were going to give it to him in spades now you navy boys its your job to get us there and i know you will and when you do i promise you well kick ass from kamchatka to kiev god bless you all there was a complaint from one of the female quartermasters in the task force about the exclusion of women in his address freeman was taken aback when norton so advised him what the hell does she mean he asked norton the latters grimace the first sign of seasickness as the two men made their way up from the mess deck to the open air of the ton amphibious assault ship winston davis it was one of scores of ships in the task force carrying supplies for second army including the amphibious assault vehicles attack and transport choppers and av harrier ground support fighters needed for the eighteen hundred marines aboard each ship she noted general explained norton that you didnt mention women once in your address whereas you used the expression navy boys several times oh for chrissake dick navy gals were the ones who flew the lead choppers into pyongyang yes general i know but in the interest of morale weve got over five hundred women in the twentythousandman i mean personassault force yes yes all right whats her name quartermaster sarah lee goddamn cheesecake isnt it norton could taste the bacon hed had for breakfast it was threatening to come straight up and the quicker he got out to the fresh air of the flight deck away from the combined stink of diesel oil and recycled air the better all right relax dick wont say anything to offend the he paused lady i suppose if i call them lathes ill be on a discrimination charge will i put a call through general later when we go below but dick sir they were passing through the light lock in whose chamber all illumination went out as soon as they began to spin the wheel to open the outer door leading to the deck although norton could not see the general the latters tone had changed to one of dead seriousness arent any females in the tank divisions are there i told the pentagon about that i dont want any tank crewmen killed trying to figure out how some dame is going to piss in her helmet while everybody looks the other way last i heard siberias armored dont give the enemy time off for rest stops and i no women in the armored units general far as i know support perhaps but not in the tanks themselves norton had lied it had been an ongoing fight between freeman and the pentagon since the beginning of the war there were several women norton knew qualified as gunners but he wasnt having the commander of operation arctic front suffer a coronary before any of the first three landings they were going to make on the kuril islands the opening stage of the airland battle freeman was silent for a few minutes as they stood on the flight deck cold arctic air whistling about them the salty tang at once invigorating and freezing stars showing through intermittent clouds but the sky on their westward heading thickening the sea was moderate so far but the latest meteorological report showed the state of sea deteriorating the further westward the task force steamed first few hoursll be critical dick as it always is of course in an operation of this kind but particularly here we need the kurils for air bases as well as those in japan if were going to make the landing on eastern siberia proper two of the three landings unknown to anyone but battalionlevel commanders were feints persian gulfs socalled because of the marine feint made off the beaches of kuwait during the iraqi war while the twentyfourth made their end run around the republican guards only in this case the marine feints would be to sucker siberian navy and airarm elements away from the main landing meanwhile freeman as supreme commander had designated the petropavlovsk sub base on kamchatka a toppriority air target the attacks on the sub pens to be launched from attu island at the western end of americas aleutian chain which curved like a scythe toward kamchatka siberias sparsely populated protective arm steaming out from vladivostok with admiral baku in command was the center of the soviet interdiction force the sleek footlong footwide ton kiev class carrier murmansk her deck sprouting verticalshort takeoff forger a and b fighter bombers together with ka hormone and ka helix antisubmarine helicopters the carriers four shafts spun effortlessly through the northwestern pacific under the impetus of the ships horsepower at thirty knots the carriers speed eastward to meet the american force was aided by prevailing westerlies and the eastwardflowing kuroshio current murmansk was seven knots slower than her opposite number the footlong nimitz class carrier uss acheson under the command of adm charles burke her flight deck feet her displacement tons she was twice as big as the murmansk her two nuclear reactors giving her the shaft horsepower with which to move her ninetyfour aircraft westward the aircraft were a medley as burke referred to them of f tomcats f strike eagles fg wild weasels grumman intruders and a pride of two stealth fighter bombers at first glance the core of bakus twentyfourship siberian force around the murmanskher screen including two guidedmissile cruisers fifteen missile destroyers and six fast frigates seemed to be outclassed by the thirtyoneship american battle group concentrated about the uss acheson with its screen of five ton ticonderoga class guidedmissile cruisers five ton virginia class cruisers and twenty truxtun and bainbridge class destroyers and the siberians were outclassed on the surface this despite the fact that the murmansk carried something deadly in addition to aircraft namely four twin surfacetoair launchers twelve vertical surfacetoair n launchers and eight surfacetosurface that is shiptoship nsandbox milerange missiles with eight reloads in addition to the baku task force however the siberian commander had ordered two nuclearpowered ton kirov class battle cruisers out of pacific fleet headquarters at petropavlovsk speeding eastward at thirtytwo knots the rang korablyna firstclass ratedkirov cruisers carried fiftytwo missile launchers each and ten antisubmarine torpedo launch tubes they sliced through the swells on their way to intercept the wisconsin and missouri which were en route to shell the kommandorsky islands air base off kamchatka from which freeman did not want to be harassed on his northern flank the mission of the two siberian cruisers was to dispose of the old american battle wagons thus saving the kommandorskys after which the two siberian cruisers would proceed further south to harass the american task forces northern flank and the american advantage in number of ships over the siberians was about to be drastically redressed by bakus use of a piece of equipment that the soviet admirals true to the leninist dictum of quantity producing its own quality believed would overwhelm more sophisticated weaponry baku with the formidable backing of his admirals in the red banner pacific fleet in vladivostok had got what he wanted flotillas of over three hundred relatively cheap highpowered highly efficient littoral craft small missile patrol and torpedo boats for regional defense these consisted of the sarancha class foot knot attack hydrofoils carrying milerange ssn and ssn missiles with a multibarrel thirtymillimeter gun for closein work the hydrofoil matka class boats armed with two styx antiship missiles a millimeter forward gun and a multibarrel thirtymillimeter and nanuchka class ills the latter was in effect a thirtythousandhorsepowerdriven guided missile corvette which though only feet inches long and with a draft of less than eight feet carried ssn siren antiship missiles in two triple launchers and also a surfacetoair n antiaircraft missile it was the same class of ship that sprouting a millimeter antiaircraft gun and thirtymillimeter closein multibarrel had been the spark that lit the fuse of war when it had attacked ray brentwoods uss blaine off korea the advantage the gidrosamofyot skimmer crafthad running with or without foil was that not only did their high mobility mitigate against being bit but because of their small size they could weave through the wave clutter that blocked american radar and their very presence as they attacked the americans would cause the slower us warships to expend much of their fuel and oblige the us carrier to use up vital fuel in launching sorties to deal with the small fast attack boats thus they would siphon off the us battle groups main aerial cover including those planes that would otherwise have been designated strikers as a prelude to freemans amphibious landings one missile from any of these swarms of small fast boats would be devastating against any of the modernhulled american ships in all baku had designated boats to the offshore kuril defense and to patrol in the vital kuril strait the latter was crucial for the siberians egress out of the sea of japan into the pacific the remaining fortyeight fast attack boats were assigned to guard the other main egress passage la perouse strait between japan and sakhalin island in the event that the japanese defense force turned offensive under us armtwisting but in the heavyweight division bakus major ships were not those like the kiev carrier murmansk or the two nuclearpowered kirov class cruisers which unlike the small hydrofoils would show up on the americans radar but his twentynine nuclear submarines thirteen from vladivostok sixteen from petropavlovsk on the kamchatka peninsula all converging south most of them already lying in wait on station three of these were the zoltaya nyba or golden fish because of their class revolutionary alfa iis the extraordinarily expensive liquidmetal heat exchange system of their reactor plants superior to using the pressurized water system allowed the footlong ton hunterkillers with a beam less than thirtythree feet and a titanium hull to be the best huks in the world at knots submerged they were not only the fastest nuclear submarines in the world but the deepestdiving the alfa ii s crush depth was four thousand feet its armament six twentyoneinchdiameter torpedoes fired from forward tubes and ssns which although classified as surfacetosurface missiles were in effect twentyoneinch diameter fourthousandpound torpedolaunch rocketdepth charges with a nuclear warhead having a range of twenty nautical miles the depth charge attached to the solid propellant rocket and released just above target was capable of killing an enemy sub to a depth of up to three thousand feet as opposed to the conventional depth charge warhead which could damage an enemy sub only within a hundred feet of detonation faced with the oncoming american task force and the americans fourthousandpound subroc subkilling missile capable of a longer reach than the alfa thirtythree miles rather than twentyfour the alfas safety resided in its ability to be exceptionally silent thanks to toshiba electronics having sold the kgb superior us proptooling technology years before the alfas dilemma however faced by us subs also was that the subs greatest advantage its silence was immediately forfeited upon firing any of its torpedoes or missiles once an alfa or any of the other russian subs fired the american task force with superior sonar both aboard its surface ships and aboard its submarines would know precisely where they were ranged against the siberian sub packs were the american sea wolf lis including robert brentwoods uss reagan but as yet the two task forces while within the mile range of the americans tomahawk cruise missiles were still beyond the navys outer zonemore than miles from one another this zone was the last in which satellite reconnaissance could be relied on and no task force wanted to strike and betray their exact position this was especially so while burke was taking advantage of satellite surveillance in particular to program his tomahawk missiles which needed precise target vector feedin so long as the task force was over the horizon and once any missile was fired it too showed up on the enemys radar and could be backtracked on that radar to pinpoint the position of the ship that had fired the missile thereby putting its entire battle group at risk to head off the two siberian cruisers coming down from the north admiral burke in the calming blue light of his tfcc tactical flag command center watched carefully the disposition of his forces coming in from the central battle group commanders to the battle watch station or ttable this monitored the largescreen situation display and automatic status board and through it the old battle wagons missouri and wisconsin were ordered to steam due west to intercept the two siberian cruisers as their first priority and only after if the battleships survived to resume course back north to shell the kommandorskys under whatever air cover could be provided out of shemya air force base at the tip of the aleutians despite all the high tech burke knew that with everyone on radio silence this phase of the sea battle would essentially be the same as the battle for midway who would launch first watch for the tattletale he told his air commander once he spots us hell relay it to petropavlovsk control and all our aircraft must launchlockonin unison then gentlemen well quickly have incoming missiles soviet style all at once kamikaze and remember from different directions burke also knew that if his own combat patrol scouts on radio silence but using passive radar found the oncoming siberians the latter would launch their aircraft immediately and in the aerial melee that would follow thered be no way friendly fire from the american task force would fail to take out some of his own men tattletale yet burke asked looking up at the plastic crayon situation board an oldfashioned backup should all computer power be lost during an attack the tattletale would be the lead soviet ship the scout which with air cover and on radio silence would be well out in front of the main task force probing once hed made contact with the americans he would abruptly turn about heading at full speed back toward his own fleet the ship chosen as the tattletale was so designed that it could fire the overwhelming number of its missiles from stern launchers this was not only to engage the enemy with maximum firepower while hightailing it but an insurance against being confused by the oncoming waves of siberian planes for an advance american ship stern salvos at the americans were the best insurance sir out of the rainriven darkness it was the voice of an operator manning one of the battle groups e hawkeye advance warning planes picking up a pulsating amber dot on its anaps milerange radar sweep the five crewmen aboard the e hawkeye were the first to hear radio silence broken in a squall so fierce the copilot could hear the rain that was pelting the planes radar rotodome that extended above the fuselage the contact between the slowly rotating dish and the rain producing halos of steam whipped away into the slipstream it was near the end of the hawkeyes fourhour patrol when the rio picked up the tattletale on the infrared scan and almost immediately heard master arm on centering the t centering the t bogeys eight miles eight miles centering the dot it was an f tomcat pilot talking to his rio the rios voice rising above the fish fry of static yelling excitedly get the tone get the tone got itive got it the sparrow airtoair missile was ready its coffeegrinder growl loud in the pilots ear centering the dot fox one the e hawkeye radio operator heard a rush and a few seconds later the rios excited voice again splash the bogey was down good kill outstanding they had just shot down another tomcat returning from combat patrol in the outer zone it shouldnt have happened there were investigation friend or foe procedures but with so many aircraft flying and men on the razors edge determined not to let the enemy penetrate their defenses murphys law stalked the night the two downed flyers were to be the first casualties of the impending battle of the kuril islands worse though the radar operator aboard the e hawkeye picked up a chute signal descending there was nothing they could do this far out aboard the tattletale a kashin class ton destroyer with four single rearfiring styx launchers no adjustment in heading was made whether or not the americans had spotted any or all of their owl screech peel group and basstilt radars didnt alter anything the destroyers job was not to run at the first sign of combat but to stay on a steady course until the americans were sighted so important was her function that baku had ordered her helicopter unarmed jettisoning machine guns and belt feeds so as to accommodate a big bulge surfacesearchandtargeting radar which with its mile range was now locating the exact position of the us task group the uss achesons flag data display system or fdds in the carriers tactical flag command center began to fuzz the siberians clearly dropping chaff your estimate of whats behind the clutter mr lean burke asked of his chief electronics warfare officer without taking his eyes for a moment from the bluewhite situation display id estimate forgers en masse fighter cover fulcrums top of the line cs i concur man battle stations man battle stations repeated the officer of the deck and now the roughthroated klaxon could be heard throughout the giant ship prifly launching every aircraft it had the flight deck a rough ballet of red and whitish blue exhausts drifting steam from the four catapults and huge shadows of ordnance men who having pulled the safety pins from the hardpoint bomb racks were holding the pins and ribbons aloft so the pilot could see all the bombs were armed ready to go with radio linkups secured among assault forces amphibious ships those who would be the beach masters choppers naval gunfire support and the forward air control officer douglas freeman and dick norton waited aboard the uss winston davis how far are we from the kurils dick fifteen twenty hours sir depending on the weather worst part the waiting said the general his outline now dimly recognizable by norton as they stood in the chilly buffeting wind of the lhds flight deck nortons face had freeman been able to see was tinged a light green as the davis thumped repeatedly against equally stubborn swells give me the old terra firma any day said norton it was getting cold on deck even in their thermal battle fatigues but to go back into the closed rolling ship to be assailed by a noxious combination of cooking odors and recycled air was more than norton could contemplate he jogged feebly to get bis blood warmer but the motion allied with the peculiar yaw and pitch of the big flat mother as the marines called the assault ship only made him more nauseated well dick siberiall be all the terra firma youll want the general paused for a moment or two listening to the heavy slushing of the ships wake and nearby though he could only see the phosphorescent tails of their wakes the occasional sound of the other ships plowing through a heavy swell throwing an incandescent spray of phytoplankton high above the bow that swept back in the darkness and disappeared been sleeping well he asked norton not too much sir you yes but im haunted dick by dreams of siberia maps of siberia all different scales recon photos as well all keep crowding in on me i feel his voice took on the tone of a father who though reasonably sure he had done all he could to secure his childrens safety was yet dissatisfied even fearful as much as freeman could be that he had unwittingly ignored some aspect in the planning left something out i feel as if theres something missing siberians i hope said norton though he couldnt see the general norton knew that freeman either hadnt heard him or was simply brushing his aides attempt at levity aside too preoccupied by all the concerns that assail a commander in the hours before a landing amphibious assaults well they were right up there with pilots on night carrier landings when it came to the number of things that could go wrong he was chagrined to remember how his own designation of ratmanov island as rat in an effort to raise morale had also been responsible for a logistics officer in san diego having sent several herculeshauled palettes of ammunition to the rat islands in the aleutian chain instead of alaska i wouldnt worry too much about the dreams general said nortonrubbish heap for nonsense my dad used to say did he asked the general yes sir well norton your father was wrong you ignore the subconscious at your peril remember patton he had third army poised for the final thrust into eastern europe and he knew the krauts were on their knees intelligence didnt but patton knew you remember why all norton could think of was being stupid enough to have had a cup of coffee before coming on deck wondering about his chances of keeping it down the carts said freeman dream was full of goddamned carts norton could sense the tension in freemans tone then heard the generals field holster bumping the rail nazis were out of gas dick they were using carts to take away their wounded the dream told him dick it was in the dream norton heard freemans radio crackle the general was wanted on the bridge as freeman headed through the darkness toward the bridge he heard a roaring so powerful he could feel its vibration then he saw fiery tail of a missile quickly followed by another spewing up from one of the ticonderogas fiftysix cellbox launchers in seven rows of eight directly forward of the guidedmissile cruisers bridge both he and norton were surprised by just how close the other ships in the carriers screen were they watched the bright yellow v of the gaspropelled blastoffs fading into a sideventing column of white flame that soon turned to a dryicelike fog that covered the cruisers deck now another missile erupted from the deck forming the third arc of the triple launch the arcs shooting heavenward the heat momentarily creating the illusion of a summer wind the naval battle that would last for six hours was already joined as freeman reached the bridge of the winston davis momentarily blinded by the dim red light of the ships bridge he was unable for an instant to pick up the radar relay trace of the ticonderogas three eightymile mk missiles whose onethousandpound warheads were now streaking across the night sky like fiery comets toward the siberian task force over fifty miles away six minutes later as the yellow arrowhead on the ticonderogas aegis screen and its target advanced toward one another on the middle vector of the triangular cone the calm unemotional voice of the ticonderogas ewo announced aegis evaluates kill in response the ottichnyy a sovremennyy class guidedmissile destroyer fired two solidfuel ssn mach antiship missiles killing range sixtyfive miles launched from the otlichnyys starboard quad the missiles were more than twice as fast as the american standard missile salvos but were nevertheless taken out intercepted by two fivehundredpoundwarhead harpoons in an orange slash that could be seen by the attacking ticonderogas starboard lookout and by the only radar still operational on the sinking siberian ship the top steertop plate combination radar mesh atop the forward mast one american missile hit the destroyer between the bridge and well decks and the siberians thirtymillimeter gatling guns completely disappeared a smoking crater in their place the other us standard struck the otlichnyys port side midships just aft of the front dome radars immediately knocking out most circuits and creating a fire that pinpointed the siberian fleets position for the american pilots about to engage a mass of yak forger vstol fighter bombers each of the forger as were carrying pounds of ordnance on four underwing hard points including airtoair aphid missiles and pound kerry airtosurface missiles as well as the much lighter pound tenmilerange as but there was never any doubt of the outcome in the air for even with over sixty forgers plotted by the acheson swarming toward the american task force the f pilots alone knew they would eat them alive the tomcats at mach were twice as fast their service ceiling fifty thousand feet a good ten thousand higher than what the forgers could pull and as if this wasnt enough whereas the forgers had a milelololo radius with maximum weapon load the tomcats mile range gave the american fighters that much extra time in the air a crucial element in the titanic battle between the carriers but the siberians admiral burke knew were not so naive as to believe for a second that they would all permeate the american defenses it was the leninist strategy again if only ten forgers got through they would play havoc with the american task force their targets not the american warships but the amphibious transports all the american naval firepower in the world could not make a landing without live marines in the tactical flag command center aboard the acheson burke was told that the siberian fleet had apparently stopped and was turning about no one aboard the acheson or any of the other american ships thought the siberians were withdrawing simply because their radars had lit up upon seeing the ticonderogas launch perhaps admiral burke told freeman they were withdrawing out of the americans killing range but this would only be true for the shorterrange missiles like the harpoons the two ticonderogas and other american ships had twentysevenhundredpound tomahawk cruise missiles aboard with a much greater range and the siberians surely knew this the siberian air armada was still on screen and now the night erupted over ninetythree missiles were fired by the american fleet in less than forty seconds from every kind of mount including trackswivel sixpacks and rows of armored verticallaunch egg cartons immediately below each ticonderogas bridge filling the night with a kaleidoscope of deadly pyrotechnics so impressive was it that despite the obvious dangers petty officers throughout the fleet were obliged to threaten direst punishment no shore leave in order to keep some men a number of cooks among them below deck aboard the uss acheson as two white dots moved toward one another on the blue screen became one then disappeared the voice came once twice four times in fifty seconds aegis evaluates kill there was a cheer from combat control shut up commanded the officer of the deck weve just started from the uss acheson the last tomcats f eagles and f hornets were being hurled aloft to meet the incoming bandits but now it was recognized that the forgers were being overtaken by thirty fulcrum migcs this changed everything burke however confident in his air commanders ability turned his attention to blips now indicating subfired ssns the thirtythreemilerange siberian equivalent of the american subroc missiles beginning their arcs toward the american fleet quickly he looked up at the tms track management system that was capable of processing parsing and correlating up to fiftyfive hundred images per half hour without backlog buildup when there were no glitches but readouts were going haywire and burke had to reply on the notsosophisticated backup standalone asic at sea independent control tracking and targeting system it was enough to give him the subs approximate position the sonarprop recognition giving a computer image it was a rough one but nevertheless showed a sub composite with bevelled sail sprouting a fivestick cluster park lamp directionfinding loop high frequency and radome masts with search and attack periscopes an alfa ii any change in their fleets position asked burke as antisub control with even its subroc having a range of only forty miles at best fired off two loral hycor mk decoys simultaneously playing out its slq nixie towed torpedo decoy change in their fleet position demanded burke again no sir range thirtyfive miles sir it was a strange world freeman surmised where airlocked against chemical and biological as well as conventional warfare you sat in the eerie blue combat control center never actually seeing your enemy except for a computer image burke calmly tried to refine overall strategy even as his task force threw missile for missile the siberian fleet still retreating its subs positions becoming less and less certain in the din of props churning at flank speed decoys and chaff adding to the countermeasures the latter defending the american fleet yet also making it more difficult to locate the exact positions of the deadly atlas if these twentyonefootlong tenmile range activepassive homing torpedoes with their pound warheads travelling at fortyfive knots got through the us task force would be in a lot of trouble sir announced the ood yes acknowledged burke his right hand reaching for the message his eyes not straying from the deceptively calm blue light of the console left of him where he pressed the subord key he was checking on the status of his catf commander amphibious task force admiral leahy and the clf commander landing force freeman aboard the davis the message he was holding told him that a truxtun cgm guidedmissile cruiser the uss prescott had been hit there hadnt been any trace of a prescottbound missile either on the carriers tfcc board or aboard the prescott the cgm lay foundering holed at the waterline below the forward millimeter gun turret where a twentythreefootlong eightfootwide gash was taking water through the hole dying sailors could see the flashes of the aerial battle tail exhausts seen as winks of light through the cruisers plates peppered as though by a shotgun on the starboard side the fiercely burning ship soon lit up the carrier abaft of her where a roaring cacophony of blue flames and bleeding steam catapults indicated the achesons flight deck as the last of the strike eagles took wing the prescott was sinking and fast the only ones able to leave her were those thrown into the water from the concussion the sky above them banging orangewhite burst after burst lighting up one of the ticonderogas like stuttering flashbulbs the crew of the sea king rescue chopper hovering on station a mile off the carriers stern for pickup should any of the takeoffs go awry had been impatient to go help the prescotts men in the water but only now when all planes were aloft could the chopper move toward the few men she could spot waving on the cruisers afterdeck and those yelling in the water in the penumbra of fire most of the men aboard the prescott were already dead the fires aboard her a crematorium those not killed by impact or suffocated by the toxic fumes from fires that had flashjumped throughout the ship twisted and buckled watertight doors offering no sanctuary were now dying in a flaming oil slick off the starboard quarter others were killed as the whitehot tower supporting the air search and gband navigation radars crumbled into itself like the skeleton of some enormous animal sending showers of whitehot metal hissing into the sea the enemy aircraft were now closing us fighters engaging the background a staccato of victors and vanquished fulcrums tangling with eagles and tomcats high above the eagles with the added burden of trying to stop the forgers burke ordered the furball chatter to be taken off pa so that only the air commander and those immediately concerned could hear it for fear it would interfere with the concentration of those still watching the enemy fleet none of the forgers had yet fired missiles so the question was what had gotten close enough without being picked up either by sonar or radar to take out the prescott damn it said burke so softly not even the radar operator nearby heard it patrol boats flares all quarters flares all quarters sir responded the ood and within seconds they had messages confirming burkes suspicion streaming in from every part of the fleet there were swarms of patrol boats foilborne reports of them closing difficult to hear above the cacophony erupting beyond the island of calm that was the uss achesons tfcc the sound of missiles massed machinegun and pompom aa fire reaching crescendos that drowned the mens voices forty plus the ood reported to burke the ood suddenly thrusting his headset away from him the crash of a missile hitting one of the american destroyers so loud he was deafened for several seconds and immediately ordered off the bridge replaced by one capt elias wilkes junior a man whose career although he had not come up through annapolis was about to take off realizing they were under closequarter attack wilkes now hypothesized why the siberian fleet had uncharacteristically retreated and why the subs no doubt lying quiet props stilled had thus denied the us passivemode sonar their position suddenly he knew why they hadnt turned mines sir wilkes told burke burke tried to suppress his alarm mines in choke points throughout the world that was standard drill egress points like la perouse between sakhalin and japan were no doubt already mined by the siberians this was understood the us and their allies all the worlds navies had long prepared their own egress channels for the defense of last resort but here hundreds of miles out from the nearest landfall of the kuril islands an area well mapped and frequently patrolled by natos navies if wilkes was right though the small patrol boats couldnt have done it given their alreadycrowded decksit certainly would explain the turning about of the fleet suggesting that the mines had just been laid ahead of the siberians but no mine layers had been reported by sat intelligence the subs have been seeding them said wilkes what subs laid them sir thousands of amd onethousands the subs cant lay the amd fivehundred wilkess head inclined quizzically strange that the lighter mine is more difficult for the sub probably the shape of its how does the amd work burke shot back it was no time to pretend you knew everything whats the trigger magnetic acoustic pressure he understood why magnetic wouldnt get the hydrofoils the latter consisting of plastic composites and the engine would be too far above the airsea interface to trigger an acoustic mine that left only pressure but wilkes shook his head pressure mine selfreleases when the water column above it changes but these hydrofoils probably dont spread their weight over a wide enough area proffered wilkes wilkess guess was wrong hed told the truth in part that the pressure from the hydrofoil wouldnt set some of them off though three of the fastweaving attack boats had been sunk by others in the flotilla in the melee of the wakestreaked sea few men had a chance to notice the phytoplankton lit up even more beautifully by the intertwining tracer flare light missile explosions and exhaust glare what had actually happened was that the foilborne craft had sped through a protective channel no more than half a mile wide ahead of their fleet and the tattletale then spread out in a trumpetshaped fountain like angry wasps emerging from the safe narrow channel left by the minelaying subs meanwhile the subs waited in their silence should the american task force find the channel by sheer luck the siberians and burke knew the chance of doing this was one in a million turn about burke ordered he had no choice though he knew the enemy would later make great capital from the fact that the american seventh fleet for the first time in its history had turned tail and run but to stop would imperil his ships even more making them stationary targets for the missiles already being fired by five forgers who had dived through under cover of an arrowhead formation of fulcrums in running burke had bought himself valuable time and fought off the foilborne attack craft sinking twentythree another two of them were victims of their own missile fire another was blown out of the water by an american adams class destroyer even so one of the uss wasp class lhas an amphibious landing helicopter assault ship a quartermile to the right of freemans was hit despite the pumps working overtime the fortytwothousandton vessel was reduced to three knots with marines and seamen working like navvies the smell of their sweat mixing with the burning odors of battle as they strove to shift cargo from port to starboard to even the ships trim before the pumps already overheating because of spare uniform clogged intakes gave up the ghost watching the scene through his infrared field glasses aboard the davis freeman said nothing this was the navys department and he was too astute a commander not to know when to keep quiet but norton could tell the general was worried as worried as hed ever seen him if the siberians tried hard enough to stop the american force here how much worse would it be when you tried to land on their soil and with the element of naval surprise completely lost two forgers appeared white shimmers in the rolling green sea of infrared inside yelled freeman quickly freeman saw one forger disintegrate the flash of a tomcat or was it a strike eagle streaking by the forger dropping toward the davis its odd rodsfriend or foe identification antennae forward of the armored glass windscreen glinting momentarily in the darkness its tumansky turbojet screaming in a seventeenthousandpound reverse thrust its twinbarreled cannon spitting red tracer before it crashed into the sea the slap followed by a soft explosion of phosphorescent seawater that now fell like rain but in diverting the us task force away from the kuril landing sites the siberian fleet only succeeded in forcing freeman to shift the axis of his invasion force away from the kurils south to the sea of japan for the main landing chapter sixteen khabarovsk beneath the picture of the scantily clad georgian beauty in the khabarovsk reading room the standby klaxon blared the siberian pilots including sergei marchenko looked up at the computer screen and saw a cluster of xs enemy fighters and bombers rising up from wakkanai out of japans northernmost island hokkaido miles eastsoutheast too far for their fulcrums to intercept and have enough fuel to return safely the fighters out of cape krilon on sakhalin islands southernmost tip would have to engage but if the enemy got across the tatarskiy strait between sakhalin and the mainland the khabarovsk wing would have to go up we should have hit japan with hbombs on day one marchenkos wingman said he knew he was talking rubbish any nuclear exchange would be suicidal the irony being that both sides had to fight the biggest conventional war in history but the wingman was afraid the american air force though it could never win the war by itself against an enormous power like siberia over ten times the size of iraq had nevertheless already penetrated siberias outer kurilsakhalin defenses the best siberia could hope for in the air was to slow them down knowing that the truly decisive battles would be on the groundacross the vastness of siberian mountains taiga and tundra there was another alarm more american planes rising from a carrier miles east of the far eastern tvds port of nakhodka just over fifty miles due east of vladivostok an air corridor fives miles wide and a hundred miles long from svetlaya on the coast westward toward khabarovsk was being blasted out by the largest air bombardment since the iraqi war the number of sorties in the first twelve hours launched from air bases from otaru to wakkanai on japans hokkaido surpassing by the flown by the usaf in the first twentyfour hours of the iraqi war the fighterprotected american bombers were dropping everything from smart bombs on the reinforced earlywarning coastal radar stations to faes and in particular runwaydestroying cluster bombs chapter seventeen as the uss winston davis rolled slightly in the swell norton looking the worse for wear freeman searched for his glasses couldnt find them and instead used the telescopic pointer which he normally eschewed to illustrate his project saying nothing yet to his divisional commanders gathered in the crowded helo maintenance deck he stabbed at the lower left of siberia on the steppes between the southernmost extremity of the urals and the aral sea the pointer then slid eastward along the fiftieth parallel south of novosibirsk on through the mountainous region west of lake baikal only a hundred miles now from the mongolian border then further east to the big milewide horseshoe bend in the amur river that formed the border with china from there the tip moved abruptly up to the far northeast of the map in a right hook that took in the pacific mountain barriers of siberias eastern shield he ignored the vast central siberian plateau and riverveined west siberian plain that was taiga as well as the wide crescent of treeless tundra that was northern siberia eastern siberia gentlemen he told his audience is all were interested in at the moment he moved the pointer up and down the long pacific flank think of it as a hockey stick the handle being the eastern mountain chain at the bottom of the stick in the groove as it were lies khabarovsk the gate to lake baikal and irkutsk the siberians know the taiga is the best place for armor ours as well as theirs but first they have to stop us getting through this eastern shield to khabarovsk two hundred miles in from the coast freemans knuckles tapped out an impatient tattoo over the coastal range of the sikhotealin now a lot of these mountains are five thousand feet and up and wed be nuts to try running armor through deep snow in those ravines next to no roads anyhow one siberian section with antitank rockets could hold us up for a week what we have to do gentlemen is attack khabarovsk from the south here from rudnaya pristan on the coast move a hundred and twenty miles inland then swing north for a hundred and twenty miles through the malinovka river valley road to dalnerechensk it was men the impatience of his dreams of endless snow and ice became manifest dont worry about bridges being blown drive straight over the frozen rivers theyre your roads in siberia then gentlemen a twohundredmile run north adjacent to the ussuri river on the left flank the chinesesoviet border to here his fist banged against khabarovsk where the ussuri met the amur in the lowland forests and snowcovered meadows from there its west young man along the transsiberian rail route to baikal and irkutsk norton moved uneasily in his seat when it was all added up lake baikal was over a thousand miles to the west and despite the valleys that formed the transsiberian route the last two hundred and fifty miles would be through high country like the khamar daban range but freeman as if reading nortons mind had anticipated his aides question ato air task order said freeman will be to secure total air superiority from our beachhead at rudnaya pristan to irkutsk fortyfive miles from baikals western shore freeman turned to miller general of the air forces in japan bill can your boys handle that or are they too fat from eating all that damn sushi in tokyo whats in it for me general asked miller cheekily a medal if you do replied freeman unhesitatingly a kick in the ass if you dont have you got what you need freeman asked miller well sir intelligence reports that lake baikal is surrounded by the most intense abm and aa defenses weve ever seen denser than they were around hanoi compared to what theyve got around baikal baghdad was just a bunch of firecrackers norton could see freeman was getting impatient smacking the pointer against his right leg he didnt want to hear all the problems he already knew them but norton knew that miller was building his case giving the air force some leeway how long asked freeman the levity of his earlier comments gone three weeks general two if you can secure the beachhead at rudnaya pristan so the engineers can lay enough matting for an airfield and well have to have airfield perimeter defense patriots there was a cheer the patriot still enjoying its legendary status from the iraqi war but not with freeman hed pored over the reports and understood that it was the israeli defense forces who not sticking to standard firing procedures had introduced shortcuts that were responsible for the patriots over israel taking out most of the scuds but not the warheads you could end up technically knocking out a scud but causing more carnage on the ground when an unexploded warhead came down with the rest of the scrap metal freeman had ordered in the armoredvehiclemounted oerlikonbuhrie adats the eight highvelocity adat missiles equally effective against armor and aircraft had only a commandergunner crew and were air portable by chopper or c with a twelvemile radar scan the adats had laserbeam ranging up to five miles and optical radar track with flir forwardlooking infrared tv tracking and adats could operate while the vehicle was on the move the wingless missiles shooting out from the eightcontainer turret at two thousand miles per hour target acquisition and aim taking less than one second for further perimeter air defense freeman also preferred the ninetypound british rapier eight tracked missiles on an enclosed twoman vehicle because the rapiers warhead was made to explode internally not outside the target an internal explosion meant you didnt simply knock the incoming enemy missile off trajectory but actually blew up the warhead in the air freeman sensed a current of opposition running through the american units who had been long used to the us patriot and nikehercules and the west german roland yet he understood that it wasnt simply a matter of national pride hell half the electronic components in the fs and eagles were dependent on the japanese electronics industry no what the americans objected to was that they wouldnt have time to retrain crews but freeman had thought of that too and had requested canadian units from the joint canadianus norad units for once the canadian parliament did not debate the issue ad nauseam and the canadian adats team along with a britishmanned rapier regiment was already en route taking the long flight from the us west coast to hawaii and then to okinawa skirting the stillunsecured sea lanes off the kuril islands gentlemen i want this operation ready to roll in seventytwo hours the carrier force that will make the vladivostok feint south of rudnaya pristan is already underway out of yokohama now i want to reiterate for those of you who havent already heard it that the great communist weakness is their overdependence on centralization overcentralization it grows naturally from suspicious minds gentlemen no one trusts anyone else havent done so since nineteen seventeen why the hell should they change now thats why it took them so long to shoot that kal airliner down mig pilots had to keep checking with central command so far eastern tvd wouldnt think the sons of bitches were defecting to japan there was a ripple of laughter in the audience as they watched freeman getting wound up overcentralization doesnt only play havoc with tactical decisions gentlemen it is death to any selfsustaining toothtotail logistical system youve got to understand that in a communist system and i dont give a shit where it is or whos running it goddamn stalinists marxists leninists and maoists are all the same when it comes to administration everybodys so busy covering their ass signing forms in quadruplicate that nothing ever gets done fast enough course in war things speed up but the disease gentlemen is in the body politic on occasion it administers some selfhelp medicine but they cant cure it youve all heard the stories about the factory making ten thousand left shoes and no right ones just to fulfill the fiveyear plan quota well its not much of an exaggeration i can tell you now i dont know whether you realize it or not and every one of you above the rank of colonel should but no one below a soviet sergeant is allowed to carry a goddamn map that should tell you something right there these are the telling details gentlemen norton was watching the officers watching freeman it was the general at his best he had what the troops called his george c scott look he turned and thumped the map at khabarovsk so hard that the entire far eastern tvd shook several red pins marking the positions of siberian divisions popping out toppling over the siberianchinese border into the vastness of outer and inner mongolia and then to the floor the details gentlemen such details are going to win the war for us if we stay alert to them but he hesitated thats my job yours is to remember only one thing laudace iaudace murmured a lieutenant colonel of artillery in the back row toujours iaudace speed thundered freeman i dont want to get any sitreps whining about anyone being pinned down you get yourselves unpinned and fast and get on the move again and keep moving is that clear there was the silence of assent im not going to pump sunshine up your ass and tell you that there wont be substantial opposition therell be plenty of it this is their land their home and theyll fight for it as hard as you would theyve got the numbers in equipment and men but i know we have the quality in equipment and men to stop them he paused hands on his hips looking out at the divisional and corps commanders any questions there were plenty and freeman knew it but they were the kind that could be answered only in the coming battles what do you think dick asked freeman as the last of the officers shuffled out norton said it all depended on how many troops the siberians could manage to move east to the coast freeman was searching for his glasses again patting his battle dress pockets damn it i can never find those goddamn reading things only need one of em anyway have one of the boys in med corps make the up a single lens a pincenez said norton surprised jesus no look like a goddamn fairy no just one lens with something to clip it onto so i dont lose the damn thing a monocle said norton amused by the idea fine now look here dick only way were going to get the jokers on the run is to stay mobile weve got to keep moving keep em off balance dont give em a chance to stabilize anything from their big guns and armor to their airfields bill millers boysll pound anything that looks as if its big enough for a mosquito to take off from thatll keep their pvo air force occupied meanwhile weve got to keep their ground forces off balance do the unexpected go around them freemans right hand made a sweeping movement west then south of the bam the northern baikalamur mainline loop to irkutsk just west of baikal get airborne sasdelta air mobile artillery and armored units behind them light tanks apcs ms multiple rocket launchers and some concentrated rocket artillery barrages as well scatter them to hell dickisolate them if its too sticky in one area then well do a macarthur island hop bypass the bastards attack another unit keep them so damned occupied in their rear theyll find themselves fighting on three fronts he pointed all the way west on the map four thousand miles to the northsouth spine of the urals british and american forces pressing east from minsk our boys here heading west from khabarovsk and our special forces driving them crazy in the center the general hands on his hips again was nodding satisfied with the plan you know about the fruit seller no iraq explained freeman special forces our boys and the brits an arab goes up to an iraqi hq with a basket of fresh fruit freeman looked at norton hes a brit in mufti hadnt washed for weeks son of a bitch argues dick with the iraqi commander over how many dinar for the fruit i couldnt do that hate goddamn haggling son of a bitch in carmel tried to sell the a car like that once it was beautiful fortytwo packard impeccable condition big hubcaps anyway the iraqi finally agrees on the price while hes in getting the money this brit pushes an infrared stick into the sand thirty minutes later an f attack thousandpound smart bomb not only got the commander but the whole goddamned hq freeman stood back from the map a myriad of details running through his head sow havoc behind the lines dick thats what we have to do here like those spets bastards did to us in the dortmundbielefeld pocket whether or not it was the mention of the dortmundbielefeld pocket or the long day the general had put in norton noticed freemans hands had moved from his hips to his lower back massaging it a grimace of pain in his face norton wondered if the injury the general had sustained when being thrown out of the humvee during the breakout was flaring up again but he knew better than to mention it the general picked up the pointer stick collapsed its telescoped sections to ballpointpen size and clipped it in his battle dress pocket be the biggest air drop in history dick bigger than crete bigger than arnhem and we wont make the mistake montgomery did there wont be a bridge too far in this lot he turned to norton know why every generals aide understands that part of his role is to be a constant sounding board for his commanding officers ideas but now and then it was nice to be able to outguess them youre not going to try to capture all of them proffered norton just enough to screw up their supply line here and there the tone of freemans voice changed it was quiet measured as if his public persona had fled him and he was talking to his inner self to his own memory which he absolutely believed transcended his own lifetime belonging to another time to history he turned away from the map leaning against the edge of the khabarovskbaikal model gazing over the nowvacant seats jung he told norton tells the story of the yucca moth flowers of the yucca plant open for one night only and the moth takes pollen from one of the flowers kneads it to a pellet flies to another flower slices open the pistil lays eggs between the ovules then stuffs the pellet into the funnelled opening of the pistil he turned his face barely a foot from nortons it does this dick this complicated ritual then dies norton looked back at the general utterly bewildered how do you explain it dick no learning involved yucca flowers open for only one night one night dick he looked back over the empty seats cant have been learned you see we call it intuition by which we mean it is innate already there already known in the brain of the moth we have that same kind of preknowledge dick but we dont know what to call it exactly so we take a stab at it and say its instinct he turned to norton again you see what im saying the moth has the image of the flower already in its brain before its even born remember what the poet said dick trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home weve already been there the moth already knows we know i know it was in the dream the map of siberia something missing dick he eased himself away from the model stretching his hands again kneading the small of his back it came to the at breakfast i was going over the dream damn thing had kept the awake half the night felt like id been on the rack he turned about to face the huge wall map can you see it this wheel of fortune general freeman gave a rough smile his right hand extended moving from the urals east across the west siberian plain the central plateau and then the eastern mountains all their communications all their topographical communications dick automobile enthusiast like myself should have spotted it right away different from any other map in the civilized world no roads no goddamn roads dick freeman was visibly excited you see in the south from sverdlovsk in the urals through novosibirsk irkutsk and on to khabarovsk no main roads its all goddamn rivers dick thats the secret the bridges we forget about everything else but the bridges we blow their bridges not to stop their road traffic but their river traffic their rivers are their roads their lifelines dick frozen in the winter like lake lagoda for once norton too felt victorious you mean the russians resupplying leningrad in world war two by road from murmansk and then across the frozen lake goddamn it dick you win the toyota and the trip to disneyland well ill be we collapse those bridges on them dick and itll be like the ventura freeway at peak hour nothingll move norton looked more closely at the maps freeman was right on the money it was so simple once you saw it three hundred miles or so east of chita itself three hundred miles east of baikal there was absolutely no main road into the far eastern tvd what about the transsiberian railway he asked freeman with our superiority well cut it too that night both men went to sleep more easily than at any time during the previous two weeks freeman became somnolent recalling churchills summons to buckingham palace after the munich crisis of finally called to be leader of the nation in its darkest hours after having been out in his wilderness churchill had later said he had gone to bed peacefully that night having no fears of the morrow and confident that facts are better than dreams ill take both winston said freeman switching off his bed lamp ill take both it had not occurred to the commander in chief of operation arctic front that dreams are but often one step from nightmares and that the siberians had dreams of their own and that these no less than those of the american commanders were rooted solidly in the recognition of certain indisputable facts which they would soon give him ample evidence of chapter eighteen rudnaya pristan the yak vertical takeoff fighter bomber diving on the landing helicopter assault ship winston davis got off one acrid radar homing missile before being taken out by saturation fire from the ships two pope miters the highdomed sixbarrelled twentymillimeter vulcan phalanx mark s that fired one hundred rounds a second and enveloped the siberian fighter in a dense hail of depleted uranium the fireball that a moment ago had been the yak now hit the lhd the yaks starboard wings koliesovrybinak vertical takeoff lift jets slamming into one of the fortythousandton ships five antisurface guns sending whitehot shrapnel whooshing through the air killing the bridges port lookout and raising fears among the two thousand marines below that if the twelve thousand tons of aviation fuel were hit theyd all be incinerated within a matter of minutes as the shock of the impact continued to reverberate deafeningly through the jampacked halfdeck hangars below a fully equipped battalion gathered about its palletized supplies which took up cubic feet of the ships huge interior waited anxiously for the landings that might or might not happen depending on the outcome of the great naval battle now swirling and crashing about them what admiral burke feared most was the siberian fleets two ultramodern guidedmissile cruisers now still over two hundred miles away but racing south at flank speed to intercept him on his right flank his only hope was that the two old iowa class battle wagons the missouri and the wisconsin would stop them but it was seen by burkes commander as a forlorn hope and indeed because of the two ships age despite weapons modernization most of the officers in burkes fleet had serious doubts about the behemoths of another age being of any use in the hightech war there were those like adm john brentwood who joined by others in the us dod department of defense and the british mod ministry of defence were preoccupied by an unanswered question would the tomahawk missiles aboard the iowa class battleships be more than a match going up against the kirov guidedmissile cruisers ssn threehundredmilerange fourthousandpound missile the latter as well as being over a thousand pounds heavier than the tomahawk was more than three times as fast the american cruise missiles speed at a subsonic miles per hour made it a slowpoke compared to the overmiles perhour siberian missile it was a difference that uk liaison officer brigadier soames at the white house referred to with typical british understatement as a slight advantage for the sibirs the undeniable advantage of the siberians speed allowed the kirov cruisers to wait until the missouri and wisconsin had fired two tomahawks apiece two for each of the siberian cruisers they had ample time even in the splitsecond world of overthehorizon electronic warfare to respond it was a luxurious five seconds in all after each tomahawk in a feral roar and with its peculiar assdragging motion skidded out from one of the eight armored box launchers like a huge vertical cigar moving sideways the missile arcing high enough to afford siberian radar a glimpse and to get a backtrack vector before the american missile dropped in altitude at waveskimming height the tomahawks cigartube shape began its metamorphosis its tail unfolding stubby wings extending and air intake popping up to gulp air allowing the missiles own engine to take over as the rocket booster finished looking now more like the vl buzz bomb from which it had been derived the missiles pound conventional warhead replacing a pound nuclear tip followed its preprogrammed terrainmatching contour guide which afforded the tomahawk a cep circular error of probability of only feet this was normally not critical for most large land targets but for a moving target at sea it raised the odds considerably the captain of the nuclearpowered frunze iv had personally picked up on the tomahawks firing receiving details of the tomahawks trajectory from a bear recon aircraft out of the kommandorsky islands to the north in response the frunze iv and the other siberian cruiser had each launched five ss missiles from hatches forward of the cruisers gatling gun turret and from both port and starboard stations in all ten missiles were now streaking toward the starye amerikanskie sufiold american bitchesas the missouri and wisconsin were contemptuously referred to the sinking of either one or hopefully both would only add to the impression in novosibirsk of an overwhelming american naval defeat the americans still withdrawing south one of the battle groups foamfilled minesweepers already sunk while her weight and nonmetallic fiberglass hull had not set off any pressure or magnetic mines the sound of her props had triggered acoustic mines that had literally blown her clear of the water her spine snapped her foamfilled interior giving off a thick oily and highly toxic smoke the two halves of the sweeper taking longer to go down than they would have without the foam that kept them floating about like some ancient fire ships sent among an enemy fleet to sow confusion and break up its order of battle by now the missouris two tomahawk cruise missiles were locked onto by the frunze ivs top pair threedimensional longrange radar scanner they were intercepted eleven miles out by a cluster of type and missiles fired by the frunze it was impossible to say what type had downed one of the two american missiles so many target and antitarget vectors were converging in the general area so many siberian missiles in fact that it was likely given their inferior guidance system that it had been a case of fratricidedebris and shock waves from one missile altering anothers course preventing it from making a direct hit either way one of the tomahawks was down the second tomahawk hit the frunze iv starboard midships the explosion shattering all glass on the bridge decapitating two officers on watch while a great hole over ten feet in diameter now gaped at the waterline the dark inky sea turned to a frothing cauldron as it churned into the cruiser the enormous intake of water causing the ship to roll sharply starboard and capsize sinking in less than eleven minutes all hands lost most drowned in the first five minutes or so others swam through the icecold sea of oil and flotsam to a few inflatable rafts where they hauled themselves aboard only to the shortly of pneumonia coughing unceasingly lungs coated in oil in effect drowning in their own fuel of the ten surfacetosurface sss that the cruisers had fired at the missouri and wisconsin two struck missouri and three the wisconsin three of the others were shot down by american harpoon and vulcan aa fire the remaining two exploded in the sea sending enormous spumes of white into the tracerstreaked night and now the argument that had raged for years over the advisability of keeping the old battle wagons was answered both had seen active service particularly the missouri in the iraqi war but not shiptoship confrontations and the moment the two battleships were struck there was in the pentagon an almost unseemly rush to hear what had happened what happened was that of the two missiles that hit the missouri one exploded starboard side against the bridge the other made a wideangle hit on the stern deck that took out two of the battleships four shlamps helos the other two helicopters were aloft on antisub watch when the first missile hit the bridge it killed two men in number two turret from sheer concussion its fireball so intense that the explosion took out four of the fiveinch guns on that side killing twentysix men while engulfing one of the sternfacing fiveinch guns sending a sheet of dense curdling fire rushing along the starboard side as if some enormous flamethrower had belched the smoke and flame spilling over the sterns triple sixteeninch turret it did not destroy it but because of the heat made the turret even with its air conditioning uninhabitable for the next half hour as fire hoses crisscrossed in dense smoke to get the deck fire under control but the main concern was the missile that had hit the starboard side of the bridge nearer the ships combat control center it was known that no airtosurface missile such as the exocet which could smash through any of the lighterarmored modern ships could penetrate the battleships armor belt but now the surfacetosurface siberian missile striking the seventeen and a half inches of thick class a steel that girded the bridge failed to penetrate inside the bridge two officers would lose their hearing forever from the impact and several others would also be repatriated suffering permanent innerear damage but no one in combat control was killed and while the navigation electronics were knocked out the standalone fire control for the two forward turrets with three guns apiece and the fire control for the three guns in the lone stern turret were unaffected despite the fact that the latter was still not visible because of the thick choking white smoke that had replaced the black as the fires were being doused the urgent thump thump thump of the pumps was audible to the wisconsin several miles off the missouris starboard quarter the wisconsin sustained damage to two of her four shafts from the missile that had hit the sterns solid inchthick steel armor belt causing spider fractures but here as aboard the missouri bulkheads had held the old battle wagons once so disparaged by the bottom line accounting experts as outmoded floating nostalgia had more than once proved their resilience to enemy missiles their armor belts far thicker than the thinly skinned highertech cruisers and destroyers of more recent years as if this werent enough they were now about to do what no other ship in the fleet could in addition to its array of tomahawk missiles vulcan twentymillimeter gatling guns and fiveinch dualpurpose guns the old lathes nine sixteeninch guns administered the coup de grace to the usafs bombing assault out of attu against the kommandorsky islands each of the eighteen inch guns of the two battleships hurled a pound shell the equivalent of throwing a volkswagen beetle twentythree miles and they did it thirtysix times a minute the crews of the twentyfour smaller fiveinch guns had to wait until the battle wagons got closer to the islands the fiveinch guns were only able to throw seventypound shells fourteen miles by which time missouris harpoon missiles had dealt with three of the hydrofoils sent out from the kommandorskys the wisconsin took out six the siberians mistake in having concentrated all their available air power from kamchatka south against the american battle carrier group and losing the fight for air superiority was now compounded by the terrible punishment the two american battleships were meting out to the kommandorsky airfields killing any hope in novosibirsk of using the kommandorsky islands as an advance carrier for the migs the inferior vstol forgers in bakus fleet unable to stop burkes task force from protecting freemans landing worse still for the siberian tvd far eastern military district hq in khabarovsk was the dilemma now confronting them should they concentrate their forces south nearer the sea of japan japan being the americans carrier in the far east particularly the island of hokkaido or should they move those forces already in the south north to reinforce the kuril garrisons but this would be in vain if freeman decided in light of the terrible air offensive now underway against sakhalin to bypass the kurils and sakhalin and actually invade the mainland splitting their forces violated fundamental military doctrine and particularly soviet military doctrine of concentrating all your forces of amassing overwhelming strength before attacking even now novosibirsk was receiving information from the four kuril island strait monitoring stations that the enemymost likely the american navys seals was probing the straits possibly readying to detonate the mines in one or all of the vital gateway channels between the pacific and the sea of okhotsk but in novosibirsk marshal yesov knew that if the americans activity around the straits was a feint and they kept moving south the siberian garrisons on the kurils and sakhalin might simply be bypassed yet if the garrisons werent maintained the americans might decide to land there as a springboard for an attack on the mainland general dya stavkin c in c fifth armys shock artillery division on the pacific border which included regiments of tactical missiles selfpropelled artillery and massed katyusha mobile barrage rockets approved of yesovs strategy favoring scorched earth from the coast inland as far as it took to make what the americans called their lots logistics over the shore supply problems as critical as possible it had worked against napoleon and the wermacht why not against freeman better to obmanut amerikantsev suck the americans inand give them what their whole national psyche was worst prepared for not a quick campaign but a long drawnout one soviets could wait the usually somber yesov told his staff a joke to illustrate the point you wont be able to get your new car for ten years the moscow salesman tells a buyer when will it be delivered asks the buyer morning or afternoon are you crazy says the salesman you have to wait ten years for your car and you want to know whether it will be delivered in the morning or afternoon whats the difference well the plumbers coming in the morning the americans couldnt wait for anything yesov told them they like drivein driveout wars no the strategy was let their bombers out of japan and the seventh fleet level the docks and sub pens of vladivostok let their troops land where they wanted now that baku had failed to stop them besides novosibirsk didnt know where they were headed and so couldnt do much about it suck them in and let the russian winter and chernkos surprise do their job and harass them all the time as giap did in vietnam the siberian army had many more soldiers and much better equipment that giap ever had and he won it was during this conference of yesovs that the siberian fifths stavkin a man not easily excited was first told of chernkos secret bozhe may my god stavkin said leaning toward his colleague a general who commanded the chinghan sixth guards tank army the arctic foxesll be well fed this winter he meant fat with american dead da agreed the chinghan commander whose titaniumcapped teeth looked as tough as his ts this chernko business will finish them stavkin listened to yesov outline his plans for the withdrawal in detail stressing the importance to khabarovsk and chita hq further west of khabarovsk of coordinating the tactical withdrawals but stavkin had difficulty concentrating on the details his excitement at being one of those who would defeat the legendary freeman the freeman of minsk and ratmanov fame making it difficult for him to sit still yesov a thickset bullishlooking man his face as the saying went always the color of the party was now pounding it into them that the americans had an obsession with high ground if the americans do not gain the high ground he said they immediately become depressed and need tranquilizers this was cause for great laughter throughout the siberian officer corps unopposed unopposed sir reported norton his face flushed with the effort of having run up the stairs to the lhas bridge to confirm what the marines had been reporting from the lcts as they went into rudnaya pristan nortons face was slack from the sense of relief no fire at all pressed freeman oh a little norton conceded but small arms general looks like buryat militia local units and our uav unmanned air reconnaissance vehicle has spotted only six millimeter howitzers theyre in firing position high on their swivel trailer mounts but no trucks anywhere and theyre not selfpropelled firings sporadic too by god said freeman his mood suddenly the opposite of all those around him on the lhas bridge his eyes narrowing as he took off his helmet running his hand through the gray shock of hair i smell a big fat commie rat here dick whats yesov up to he turned around to the lhas captain and the marine commanderyesovs a crafty son of a bitch saw some of his work in western europe before he joined siberian command general said dick norton has it occurred to you that after ratmanov and the beating theyve taken trying to stop burkes task force that they might be having second thoughts freeman glowered at him as a coach might a player whod opined that the other team looked like theyd had enough what the hells the matter with you dick some of those goddamned aphids hitting us softened your brain if this is a retreat its tactical freeman took up his field glasses scanning the shoreline the one thing i want to make damn sure of is that there are no more mines around here we wasted enough time on that bullshit already talking to some of those seals who went in off of a sea wolf sub when we thought we might try the kuril straits they told me the siberians had every mine down there you could think of magnetic pressure acoustic one of the guys told the he figures the sons of bitches have probably got hamburgersniffing mines they got any general sniffers down there sir it was an inappropriate remark and norton knew it the moment hed said it but it was too late out before he could stop himself so buoyant was his mood at the news of the landings being virtually unopposed so whats a general sniffer asked freeman still scanning the shoreline with his binoculars there was an awkward silence the marine battalion commander winking at his second in command to ease the tension everyone was relieved it was the kind of reverie that overtakes men who one minute are convinced theyre feeing death and the next find out they are not or at least that it has been postponed well pressed freeman turning the binoculars further down the beachhead how do you sniff a general ah hot air sir norton replied sheepishly barely lowering the binoculars freeman glanced down at the map yesov could have mined the road leading inland pretty deserted beach out here general unless they knew your exact plans they wouldnt have time for that first theyd have to get the mines down here your point about centralization and yes yes said freeman impatiently still unnerved by the lack of opposition subs he said suddenly still outside sir thats one thing were sure of mad overflights from the ps have shown theyre still outside no way they want to get trapped up in here with us commanding the kuril entrances and our air force ready to hit them if they try to run through the japanese strait no sir theyre outside waiting to hit our supply lines especially the alaskacalifornia oil runs what are our pol reserves in nippon dick norton fortunately had the petrol oil and lubricant figures in his head three months with severe rationing in japan and depending on our rate of advance well the japsve done a good job of burying their oil reserves less o course the siberians have another sorge who knows where they are norton was alarmed richard sorge had been the german communist agent who posing as a nazi newspaper man in tokyo during the second world war had thrown flamboyant parties for the japanese vips on his yacht in tokyo bay while down below he was sending messages to moscow the most important one being that he had discovered that the japanese werent going to attack siberias flank after all but were heading south to take hong kong malaya and on to australia this single piece of information allowed the siberian reserves a million fresh troops to be withdrawn from siberia and sent into stalingrad where they turned the tide against von pauluss sixth army even so it wasnt the mention of sorge that worried norton but the generals lackadaisical use of japs instead of japanese lord if the japanese press got hold of that outrage would rain down on the americans like flechettes japanese sir norton reminded him what oh right well lets hope their depot sites are secret unfortunately the hopes of a general do not carry any more weight than those of the humblest private every single depot from the two within thirty miles of tokyos sacred bridge across to the emperors palace to the four depots on the west coast had been known to chernkos agents for years if the siberian air force could not penetrate the eagles and falcons of the us in japan then spetsrecruited communist agents from the japanese underground red army could and did penetrate the pol dumps defenses within the next seventysix hours as freemans troops poured ashore virtually unopposed at rudnaya pristan already stretching their supply line four of the six japanese pol depots were hit only two of the attacks succeeded due to a vigorous some said fanatical defense by the japanese defense force which paid the price with twentynine dead and another sixteen wounded even so the spets attacks reduced freemans pol supply to six weeks in new york oil prices set an alltime high with a tendollar increase per barrel also fears that the siberians might use chemical weapons as a last resort drove up the price of fullers earth used in decontamination field hospitals while shares in mediclean watersprayvacuum decontamination mash units and in activated charcoal dressings rose dramatically many of the companies owned by jay la roche pharmaceuticals abcs nightline charged that the rumors of impending use of cbw chemical biological warfare by the siberians were false planted by unscrupulous war profiteers to drive up their shares not only in america but abroad the allegations were false however and because of this subsequent rumors that nervegasresistant bromide pills had been laced with cyanide by kgb sleepers were vigorously denied they were proven true however freemans first casualties on the beachhead at rudnaya pristan being a marine platoon who mistaking colored tear gas fired by the yakut militia as a possible cbw attack swallowed the bromide pills and died agonizing deaths as their central nervous systems went into spasm their ordeal ends with defecation and suffocation bromide company shares collapsed but for jay la roche it was like a shark sniffing blood through conduits on the shanghai free trading area stock exchange he bought all available shares of chinese companies licensed by the chinese government seventeen in all concentrating only on those who made cherry food coloring used for everything from cherry candy to cherryflavored fruit pies for export the cherry flavoring also contained an essential ingredient for the making of lethal bz gas which the soviets had already used to kill many of the rioters in dissident republics the news report in the morning was followed by an fbi announcement that invoking the presidents suspension of civil rights a full counterintelligence investigation was being made of the bromide scandal by breakfast time the following morning now pm in eastern siberia the bromide pill incident had been overshadowed by the shock that a general dynamics factory in california manufacturing the f had been attacked no guards were killed but in the sheds on which the mortars had landed eleven damaged fs were writeoffs the cost of testing even marginally damaged planes and the intricate microchip circuitry of the war planes was considered to be both ethically and financially unacceptable meanwhile the la roche tabloids had hit the streets screaming bromide barrage kills our boys jay la roche loved the headline circulation of his tabloids would skyrocket in every supermarket in the country and he was making a killing on the stock market both from toxic chemicals used in the war and their antidotes freeman had been badly shaken by the poisonedpill disaster and although pressing on leading the marine column in his humvee along the road from rudnaya pristan he was waiting for the siberian tiger to bite but so far second armys spearhead column of thirty m a sixtyton battle tanks rolled unmolested then approaching dalnegorsk twenty miles inland and northwest of the beachhead the men in able company second battalion of the seventeenthousandman mef first division heard five or six muffled explosions on the mountains on either side of the rudnaya river road the steepest mountain on their left then they saw the mountainsides begin to move as thousands of tons of snow avalanched down smashing into and covering the middle of the column burying over fifty marines freeman immediately ordered air strikes in from the carriers standing off in the sea of japan but the pilots could not bomb for fear of setting off more avalanches one of the first lessons of the siberian campaign besides which there were no targets if there had been any siberian sappers around left behind to detonate the avalanches they were now gone it took four hours to dig all the men out marine corps tradition demanding that they try as far as humanly possible to bring out their own dead but not all could be recovered and freeman ordered the column on to dalnegorsk which the pilots found easy to locate using the thousandfoot smokestacks as a reference point by now engineering corps officers had radioed freeman that there had apparently been no enemy units on the mountainsides the charges having been set off by pressuretriggered circuits when the m tanks rolled over them by the time dalnegorsk and the road to krasnorechensk and zavetnoye on the way to bikin and khabarovsk had been secured it was discovered by the advance marine patrols covered by lowflying falcons and tankkilling as that the towns had been abandoned not a living soul was left all livestock had been butchered and the towns set afire in the last few hours freeman looked at norton worriedly in normandy twenty miles in six hours would have been a miracle here with these distances its nothing its worse than nothing dick its disastrous norton remained silent this isnt a siberian feint declared freeman pulling his collar up against the bitter cold steam rising from the lead tank behind his humveethis is our fuckup a monumental grade a megasized fuckup and damn it freeman was standing up in the back of the humvee left hand resting on the caliber machine gun right hand crunching and flinging ice disgustedly away its my damn fault the cold was so intense that it made nortons throat sore just to try to speak but in all fairness he felt he should point out that much of it the weather for example was beyond any generals control behind the humvee the stationary m was idling keeping up the revs the gas turbines purring remarkably low for such a powerful engine even so it was eerily unsettling in the great white valley the high ground far above them norton unable to shake the conviction that the mountains were waiting biding their time to fall in on them once more at this rate said freeman well be old as canadians in florida before we get to bikin goddamn it dick weve got to get out of this hole were not on first base yet and were huffing and puffing like it was then that the apache strike choppers appeared over thirty of them swarming up the valley like angry gnats going on ahead to secure the road as far as possible while engineers sent a remotecontrolled sniffer vehicle ahead the sniffer slowed the advance further but was safer and then freeman got his surprise it came from a marine intelligence officer in the advance patrol who was bright enough to note the sight of hastily left meals and some livestock not slaughtered but peering out dolefully from the elaborately carved white window shutters of their barns which looked better than most of the ramshackle houses nearby what this told the marine and thus freeman was that the siberian withdrawal had been so rushed that even the traditional siberian scorchedearth policy had been abandoned in their flight a few militia men probably being the only ones who had had time to rig up a set of avalanche charges even so freeman sent demolition teams ahead suspecting that the hurried evacuation itself might be a siberian bluff though he also had a hunch that the marine lieutenants observation given that theyd landed in such a sparsely populated area was correct there were no more demolition charges found for several hours and as suddenly as theyd been halted earlier the marine tank column and mobile infantry leading second army picked up the pace freeman the bit between his teeth ordered full speed the armored personnel carriers and supply trucks finding themselves on hard tankpacked snow the ms cruising at thirtyfive miles per hour freeman holding them back from their maximum of fifty miles per hour only in order to get maximum mileage for minimum fuel spent when demolition charges were sniffed out the engineers quickly laid pipe charges and the column had only to stop for a matter of minutes before speeding on again within four days while he had not equalled the rapid advance attained by mccaffreys twentyfourth mechanized infantry division in iraq or got anywhere near equaling rommels armored run in france of two hundred miles in one day he was in bikin pausing only to refuel a blizzard swirling about him making for an anxious time but giving the us pilots with their more sophisticated electronics the edge in instrument flying though if the siberians nightfighting equipment wasnt as good as the americans there was nothing lacking in their courage while the refueling was in process the armored column could hear a distant thunder high overhead massive b raids out of okinawa the planes still within khabarovsks aa missile envelope but protected by eagles and falcons as they pounded the city with more ordnance including smart bombs from lowerflying fs preceding them and dumb bombs than was dropped on baghdad in the opening hours of the iraqi war however warned freeman in his first press conference since the landing khabarovsk could be a major battle when he got to khabarovsk there was no major battle the military was gone only the population confused and worried left behind for the americans to feed only some of them mostly jews were happy to see the americans the regular army had vanished and only the militia remained they were no match for the american marines the civilians who hid in terror for the first few hours were now venturing out soon forming a sea around the tank columns the tanks were warm and all heat and electricity to the city and the sparsely populated coast had been cut off by the retreating regulars the american pilots commented on how it reminded them of flying over alaska and the canadian north utter darkness not even lights of outlying settlements visible norton was already looking exhausted theyd been on the road for almost twentyfour hours without a break sir far as we can make out no civilians were allowed to leave shops were stripped bare by the army the crowds left for us to feed yes confirmed the marine commander only civilians to get out were prisoners apparently they were taken out by the kgb on the transsiberian within twenty minutes of the americans having entered khabarovsk there was a series of enormous explosions in a rough semicircle east of the city center as far out as seventeen miles soon there was the glow of fires everywhere over the frozen salt marsh as fuel depots blew along with ammunition dumps anything the siberians could not take with them they had destroyed including the citys four airfields the brutish smokestacks most of them in the northern sector of the city stood in the flickering light visible only to the fourhundredfoot level they came in and out of view amid the choking sootcolored smoke that rained black on the snow wheres the battle general asked a cbn reporter freeman grumpily ignored him turning to norton instead how about the transsiberian g says its ripped up from here to birobidzhan blown up asked freeman irritably or ripped up norton didnt know goddamn it shouted freeman find out yes sir from khabarovsk west over the hundred miles of frozen salt marshes to birobidzhan then three hundred miles to belogorsk all the while following the transsiberian railway around the big milewide righttoleft horseshoe bend in the amur river at times less than twenty miles from the manchurian border the us air force having taken out zavitinsk airfield fourteen hours before the tooth of freemans second army its m as gulping even at cruise speed three gallons per mile was fast outrunning the tail of its supply line the quartermilewide ribbon of ice of the southnorth zeya river took on the look of burnished gold at svobodnyy before more snow began falling and was freeman predicted the perfect place for the siberians to have blown the bridges a few miles on and he found he was right the enormous twisted steel of the railroad span was caught in the ice a crippled skeleton of steel the bridges pylons left standing naked the fresh snow pillows atop them affording the pylons a symmetry and beauty amid the collapsed spans but the siberians scorchedearth policy at least here was of little account holding freeman up only for as long as it took his m as with plough blades and the engineers rocketpropelled pipeline charges to clear the ice of mines most mine positions were immediately obvious from the frozen mounds of scraped ice that stood out like pimples of broken glass amid the new snow that was not yet deep enough to obscure the detritus selfpropelled howitzers could be seen here and there in the forest intact their crews blue and bloated if they could be picked out at all from the shattered timber and decapitated trees that marked where infrared smart bomb attacks by the us air force had been made from the captured airfields where tarmacs had been blown up the us engineers simply hosed in hot water under pressure from the water trucks the waterfilled craters instantly freezing after which the graders topped them off as one would level off a filledin posthole and the marsden matting was laid us planes were using the fields within an hour of their completion the railway was another story the siberians having sacrificed much of their heavy fighter cover mainly migs to protect sacrificial mig floggerd ground attack aircraft had dropped each floggers pound ordnance on the multiple track west of the zeya river between shimanovsk and mukhino this meant that the peacolored rossiya or train number one which ran from vladivostok to moscow was unable to proceed because of the downed transmission lines the siberians however quickly hitched the carriages carrying evacuees from khabarovsk to three steam engines drawn into service from the dozens of such locomotives which had previously been disbanded beside the line with the coming of the electric engines moving slowly through the dense foggedin and snowdraped taiga of larch pine and fir the train approached the top of the horseshoe hump of the amur instead of the usual caboose the train dragged an enormous hookshaped stumpjump plough behind it ripping up the ties like matchsticks the splayed rail now pushed uselessly to the side on this eastern section of the fortyeighthundredmile railway the guards at each tunnel entrance and bridge gratefully hopped aboard the last passenger carriage the carriages alternating with aa quads mounted on flatbeds every fourth flatbed in the car train sprouting sa aa missiles the mukhino express as it had been wryly described by the american pilots who had come down through the heavy cloud layer only to have their infrared signature detectors thwarted for a time by the thick bonechilling fog was finally stopped in a river of high explosives before it could reach the station at mukhino the pale blue station disintegrated in a spectacular explosion that sent ancient pine planks black earth and firestreaked snow together with iron heatingstove plates and the woodpile whirling in a minitornado a quarter mile high before it came down in a crashing hail meanwhile freeman and his commanders welcomed the pause necessitated by having to clear the minefields across the zeya for it gave the vitally needed tank and pol resupply trucks time to catch up freeman was asked by his chief of logistics gen malcolm wain whether they should go to blivets wain had been impressed by the way in which the blivets or flexiplastic bags containing thousands of gallons of fuel had proved so useful in the iraqi desert to store gas but here he didnt have in mind the huge depotsized bags that could be buried out of sight of aerial reconnaissance by the roadside but rather the tanksized bags which providing a tank was not in action but in transit could be carried piggyback an extra jerry can as it were one which could be jettisoned before getting the call to go into action or at the first sign of second armys spearhead being attacked freeman spread out the map slipping in the singlelens monocle that had caused the name von freeman to stick among those who bore him ill will for his decision to use the fuel air explosive bombs to break the ratmanov deadlock the monocle was impatiently tapping sector twentyone northwest of mukhino and beyond twentyone to sectors thirtythree and thirtyseven where the amur reached the apogee of the hump i like it he told wain our rate of progress soon be doing better than erwin wain looked across at norton without the general seeing whenever freeman was making good time the heroes of his military pantheon were referred to by their first names if he got held up it would quickly be that bastard rommel but freeman sighed i dont like it scorchedearth policy is one thing i understand that but this is this is a turkey shoot after ratmanov i expected a fight wain disagreed i dont see it that way general after ratmanov theyre going to avoid a closein fight if they can especially with our air superiority maybe said freeman unconvinced but theyre not going to give up the whole damn country theyve got to stop stand and fight somewhere theyve got to counterattack freeman folded the map case and slipped it into the humvees back seat smacking his gloves together god its cold he looked about unhappily at the column stopped for refueling it was against everything in freemans book to halt hed built a career on movement movement movement movement as against the siberians obsession with refusing to attack until they had overwhelming numbers in men and materiel if freeman stopped norton knew it would make everyone down the line happy give them a chance to catch their breath and allow the supply tail to thicken but freeman was asking himself as well as norton and wain what was that crafty son of a bitch yesov up to freeman was nodding to himself concluding that yesov would be gambling on his freemans lifelong commitment to movement the siberians sucking him in deeper and deeper the american supply line becoming ever more overextended mal sir well pause here twentyfour hours dick give the order to establish defensive perimeter air task order saturation fighter cover and attack gunships ready to go yes sir were in overreach with our fighters i realize that were already heavily committed to inair refueling it was as if he was trying to justify his uncharacteristic decision to stop but we need to consolidate here get another airstrip going must remember the aim gentlemen to capture irkutsk from there our fighterbomber radius can hit the industrial underbelly were now at a critical stage however we cant pause for too long for resupply ill bet thats what yesovs counting on hoping his scorchedearth policyll force us to drag our ass but gentlemen his scorchedearth policy is outmoded takes no account of the american genius for resupply he obviously hasnt learned anything from iraq well let him withdraw by the time hes got his big battalions ready on the ramparts well be knocking the ramparts out from under him freeman held up his hand to silence any protest that his stopping was perhaps unwise for the same reasons that he was criticizing his siberian counterpart for stopping created a stationary target and it was a maxim of freemans military strategy that a stationary target in modern warfare has no chance but neither norton nor wain had been about to protest and freeman holding up his hand seemed to them more a gesture of doubt than confidence something theyd not seen in him before perhaps the terrible casualty rate on ratmanov had affected the general more than they thought at odd moments norton had seen freeman when he thought no one was looking leaning back his hands massaging his lower back still in pain but for norton there was no doubt freeman had made a sound military decision right from the textbook to go on without having consolidated your supply line was always a risky proposition chapter nineteen marshal yesovs aide was in a hurry his chauffeurdriven zil swishing past the great snowcrowned dome of novosibirsks opera and ballet theater the statue of lenin his noble vision fixed on the future was even more impressive in the strange pinkishbrown light of the pollutioncolored dusk the soldier sailor and airman on lenins right flanked him proudly the heroic worker and torchbearer to his left were dusted by snow but looked equally heroic it added to the aides excitement when arriving at the akademgorodok or science city apartment block he ran up the six flights the elevator wasnt working to the apartment of professor leonid grigorenko the head of the kmk project but when the door opened it was to marshal yesov that the aide blurted out on ostanovilsya hes stopped the american has stopped yesov showed no emotion his blunt facial features unmoved as he walked back to the apartments window looking out on the frozen expanse that was the ob sea where the river ob had been dammed and which in summer provided excellent sailing for the privileged ones in akademgorodok and the party elite he saw two guards in greatcoats and fur caps trudging as smartly as the snow would allow them along the icesheathed concrete slabs that inclined down to the frozen ob which in summer by which time he would beat the american would serve as a beach for those sunbathing to watch the colorful sailboat races he was not so worried about the allied armies to the westtired and busy administering moscow and its environs they had not yet breached the urals he turned from the window and now that the lights in the city were coming on pulled the blackout curtains shut though there was little danger of air raids to the east freemans forces were further away than those in the west over fifteen hundred miles from novosibirsk still it was freemans forces that marshal yesov was most concerned about for while the english channel across which the allies in the west had been resupplied had effectively been closed by siberian submarines in the arctic freemans supply line from japan was uninterrupted freemans troops fresher and freeman himself more daring than the more conservative threat faced to the west on upryamyhe is a tractor said yesov looking out toward where the transsiberian crossed the frozen expanse of the ob he keeps on this pause of his will not last long we will stop him said grigorenko calmly smoking his thin cigar as he went over the final plans of chernkos kmk project i hope there have been no more security leaks however none yesov assured him explaining that even the man from engine shop three who had been shot knew only part of the project yesov was as confident as grigorenko that chernkos plan would work but he yesov had had more experience than the scientist who had overseen the design and manufacturing process and said nothing scientists could afford to say what they wanted they were important to the state particularly in a modern war but the general had to be more circumspect and when the americans were defeated yesov had aspirations to be the president of the united siberian soviet republics grigorenko however mistook yesovs silence for undue concern you mustnt worry general everything is in place i assure you the americans will be demolished utterly as he said this grigorenko sat back stroking his goatee his piercing gray eyes looking first at the general then his aide you know of course the supreme irony of the situation the aide guessed it was the iraqis who had been training in poland before the iraqi war for just such a project as chernkos but he wasnt going to do anything to steal the akademicians thunder the iraqis proclaimed grigorenko pleased with himself leaning back and taking a bottle of smirnoff vodka the best something that the average russian hadnt seen for months the aide thought everything from nylon stockings to toy production had been conscripted for war materials yes grigorenko said pouring the three vodkas a little extra for himself the aide noticed it will add insult to injury for the americans comrades that half of the attacking force will be iraqi the aide was trying to look surprised a difficult thing to do when he knew by heart the story of how hussein had sent iraqis to the eastern bloc to train for just such a project in the gulf war but how because of gorbachevs stupid bungling and against the advice of his military the iraqis were not permitted to carry out such an attack in the iraqi war unable to get back home because of the un boycott and us intelligence on the lookout for them the iraqis all members of husseins dreaded mukhabarathis secret police were still in siberia and as expert as their russian instructors grigorenko passed around the glasses and proposed a toast za porazhenie amerikantsev to the american defeat yesov rifted the shot glass and allowed a thin smile to crease his otherwise bullish face za unizhenie amerikantsevto the americans humiliation na mnogo luchshemuch better added grigorenko the aide was not a believer in psychic phenomena or anything else he called mind rubbish but he could not deny the fact that within seconds of the general having proposed the toast the call came in from kultuk miles east of them at the southwestern end of lake baikal and only miles from the mongolian border that everything for chernkos kmk project was gotovready to go grigorenko looked across at the commander in chief of all united siberian soviet republic forces like an expectant father waiting for the general to give the word the american freeman had stopped at mukhino and though it was almost a thousand miles further east of kultuk well away from novosibirsk the scientists expression of pained expectation said it all that every day yesov waited every hour the americans got closer to reaching lake baikal and irkutsk and from irkutsk their aircraft could strike novosibirsk but yesov refused to be hurried holding his glass out for another drink using it as a pointer he moved it east to baikal to the hump of the amur that formed the siberianchinese border let him reach the very top of the hump comrades then were in the clear the aide nodded and glanced knowingly at the general his look clearly saying that while grigorenko might be one of the worlds greatest scientists and engineers his political urn savvywas about as sophisticated as a yaks chita hq halfway in the crescent of mountains and forest between baikal and the top of the hump had repeatedly advised novosibirsk yesov specifically not to act too close to the chinese border particularly not anywhere along the amur where there had been border clashes since time immemorial between the two countries no said yesov in answer to grigorenkos silent plea not yet the chinese dont like the americans any more than we do doctor but they are very touchy about their border no we cannot fire across the hump for fear we may drop short into chinese territory he meant inside the hump no well wait until he is at the top yesov used the rim of the oily vodka glass to indicate the area where he would spring his trap here between never and the general required his reading glasses skovorodino the sevenandahalfmile road between the two towns was miles west of where freeman had stopped hell be reassured resupplied said yesov tanks topped up da said grigorenko approvingly all the better his humiliation will be all the worse the cruise missiles came in so low that neither freeman in his advance command humvee nor the radars of the helicopters flying cover saw them the eight pound missiles visible only five miles from target along the neverskovorodino road the first thing that the fifty m tanks and six m bradley fighting vehicles and six mobile heavy mortars that formed the spearhead of second armys ii corps lead tank battalion saw was the sudden appearance of the lowflying lead missile making a tight righthand turn before roaring overhead and exploding further down the line at the angle they saw it from it appeared to have detonated over the trees but the cbn reporter with a tripod and zoom lens saw that it was exploding right over the midsection of the fourmilelong spearhead even as second army advance reconnaissance units looked back disbelievingly at the missile as it veered through the clear blue sky over the tip of the spearhead toward the center of the column the cbn cameraman too was in awe transfixed by the abrupt turn that another of the subsonic missiles made to avoid power lines rising no more than ten feet above them before descending again its belly opening even as aa fire stuttered toward it the missile exuded a hail of smaller missiles that buzzed in the air antipersonnel flechettes and antitank bomblets american tanks the best in the world were disintegrating most of them still moving as if driven by ghosts the screams of their dying crews soon lost amid the technicolor phantasm of light as the tanks spewed fountains of red and white rain as if being welded from the inside a rain of sparks and flame oozing from the penetrated seals over the sloping glacis plate heat rounds exploded through the cupolas with a jetlike roar and several tanks slewed broadside ramming others which were in turn struck by tanks coming from behind the series of explosions from the fuel bladders sent sheets of orangeblack flame billowing over the armored personnel carriers behind the tanks the apcs crews and the twelve troopers inside each died agonizingly the apcs becoming nothing more than ovens those who made a run for it from the apcs rear doors were cut down by the buzzing bees of the flechettes the darts not killing all but inflicting such terrible wounds that the medics and as the cbn reporter would soon see the mash units to the rear were overwhelmed chopper accidents added to the chaos as two airsea rescue blackhawks collided with four cobra and apache gunships in the thick battlefield smoke one chopper a bell ohc scout slammed into one of the last incoming missiles chips of the heavy millimeter blocklike chobham armor packs from the tanks whistled through the air still intact their resinsandwiched steel ceramic and aluminum layers impenetrated but blown in toto away from the tanks when the ms fifty apfds armorpiercing finstabilized discarding sabot rounds reached their flash points and exploded internally ripping the tank cupolas apart the mechanized battalions tanks and the apcs of freemans h corps were further victims of the bolt from the blue siberian attack against freemans sevencorps man second army in addition to the sixtysix tanks destroyed the siberian cruise missiles had laid waste to andor incapacitated over forty twelveton m armored personnel carriers and twentythree marine corps expeditionary force aava armed amphibious troop carriers and seventeen fourteenton light armored assault vehicles of the marines second expeditionary brigade the vehicles now either gutted completely or burning in all men were killed over wounded freemans second army spearhead was not much more than a smoking ruin as suddenly as it had begun the siberian attack ceased but not the suffering as men tearing open their cfa combat first aid kits sprinkled sporecontaminated antiseptic powder on wounds which immediately turned the blood septic in fact only a few of the hundreds of the cfa kits were so contaminated but the fear instigated by the certain knowledge that some had been tampered with meant that hundreds of men were loathe to use the packs consequently dozens more died despite the exemplary efforts of medics and medevac choppers the cbn reporter had not seen anything like it since the american a thunderbolts had come in with their cannon and chopped up the retreating iraqi columns in the gulf war though not immediately evident it soon became clear at least to freemans g that the siberian cruise missiles tercom terrain contour mapping computers had been finely tuned and programmed not only to hit the tanks in the second army spearhead but to avoid the most forward and hence far more lightly armed humvee scout cars freeman was shattered his hopes of a home run dashed but he had no time to feel sorry for himself even if he had felt disposed to it for now the adats and quickly deployed patriot batteries were in position or at least in the best position they could manage given that some could not get out of the rubble of gutted vehicles burning bodies and equipment the antimissile patriots box launchers were left where they were their crews sent out to put the pole radar on higher ground now freeman was receiving reports that there were massive troop movements heading east from baikal toward chita to the east the troops identified as the thirtyfirst stalingrad motorized division it was the army of stalingrad fame son of a bitch said jesus valdez called juan by the other marines in his tenman squad thats all we need man fucking thirtyfirst another marine hunkered down in the foxhole of ice made so by the snow having been instantly melted in the heat of the missile attack after which the melt had refrozen looked disbelievingly at the junkyard of burning tires drooping guns shattered armor smoldering hulks of apcs and the high thick black smoke churning from burning tires red flames licking softly in the eerie blue twilight some of the marines gathered around the flames warming themselves until a marine lieutenant told them to douse the fires yeah said jesus valdez they might see where we are hed lost three buddies in the missile onslaught and hadnt found a trace of them it was so terrible it didnt seem real the attack had lasted less than seven minutes hardly a shot fired back the patriot launcher support units not then deployed with the column being on the move the marine lieutenant didnt chew out valdez for his sarcasm the lieutenant too was still reeling inside at the carnage he too had lost friends and it took all his willpower to deploy the remaining seventeen of what only minutes before had been his thirtyman platoon to defensive positions off the road to take the radar aerials to the summit of the twothousandfoothigh hills that ringed the death road between never and skovorodino freemans first order after the attack was to keep out of the townships attractive to tired cold troops but a perfect setup he believed for another cruise attack a townsite was perfect for terrain contour imaging sticking out in his words like a nun in a whorehouse forward patrols reported that the railway had been ripped up from never on and the pipeline running parallel to the transsiberian shut down how far away is their thirtyfirst freeman asked dick norton momentarily too ashamed to look his aide in the face a thing he normally detested in a man instead he was gazing at the wreckage the acrid stench of defeat burning his nostrils mixed in with the oily reek of destroyed equipment and vehicles there came the sweet sickly smell of burnt bodies theyre coming from chita said norton now as the crow flies its about never mind the goddamn crow how long till they can attack stunned by the generals outburst norton stepped back ah theyre motorized five four days if they travel at night maybe three fortyeight hours declared freeman his left hand pulling so hard on the cuff of his right glove that norton could see the generals fingers straining against the white goretex toughest outfit in their army except for the spets theyll attack in fortyeight hours he was staring at the clump of smoking debris and a bloody bonepierced stump that had once been a mans head freemans voice was tremulous he coughed swore his tone steadier now but heavy with anger can you tell me he turned to norton can anyone in this godforsaken place tell the why i lost so many fine young men why those satellite intelligence outfits can tell me the siberian thirtyfirst a whole goddamn army is on the move and yet they cant give us any warning of a multiple cruise launch even if radar contact missed em because the bastards were coming in so low how was it that our satellites didnt see launch plumes or are their infrared spotters on goddamn holiday a major his head in a bloodsplattered bandage handed freeman the updated casualty report those killed now numbered over five hundred several of the most recent having died of flechette wounds either on the way to the mash unit at mukhino or after arriving norton relayed the generals question keeping his voice low from force of habit the speaker close to his ear general he told freeman marine g says the siberians started a whole bunch of fires in the forests around the suspected launch area satint cant distinguish between natural hot spots and exhaust plumes both give off heat signatures freeman was walking away from the ruins of his advanced armored column so they lit fires to confuse satellite ir pickups but they must have spotted trajectories no sir weve still got a big low thats come down from the kara sea well have to wait until it clears a bit before freeman was pulling out the map before we can use the k norton continued referring to the intelligence satellite but it has to be in the right orbit when they take pics my god dick if there is a next time were going to be ready where the hell are those starstreaks starstreak was the stateoftheart threedartheaded successor to stinger an intercept missile that could if necessary be mounted on the back of a humvee and which provided mach six blanket target protection against air tactical missiles in transit sir siberian backfire bomber out of sakhalin before we took out its airfield got lucky over one of the convoys from japan you sure more are coming freeman asked his face flushed despite the cold yes sir well thats something meantime i want adats up ahead patriots have the box launchers down here stick the pole radars high im doing that now sir good the general looked up at the cloudshrouded summits visible for a moment then gone to others in the column the deployment of what aa batteries had not been taken out by the missiles would afford a measure of security a circling of the aa wagons as it were until the road was cleared for the column to move anywhere but where they were but norton knew how bad it was for the general freeman had never exulted over the patriot as others had after the iraqi war it bothered him that a patriot had missed the scud that killed the marines in riyadh during the iraqi war and that if the body of an incoming missile was hit but not the actual warhead the missile could end up wreaking the same kind of damage as occurred in riyadh dick norton was making a quick call to malcolm wain to order in as many batteries of starstreaks from japan from anywhere as they could lay their hands on how many are coming across now asked wain none said norton just get em on choppers cs anything but get them here any way you can by christ said freeman coming up behind him i d like to find the son of a bitch who engineered this to do this however as he would soon discover for himself would be impossible unless he was prepared to visit an italian graveyard but if he was not to meet the genius behind the siberian missile assault he soon experienced another assault a cruise bombardment patriots adats and finally some starstreaks were able to thin it out nevertheless it continued to pound second army so that freeman was trapped at the top of the amur hump unable to go either forward or back for fear of risking the disassembling of his aa defensive ring he remained hemmed in by the high snowcovered ridges as he waited for clear weather so that the trajectories of the siberian missiles could be more accurately traced casualties after the second attack were over two and a half thousand killed sixteen hundred wounded to the public back home the mess from the siberian front was bad enough but they sought solace in the fact that the us navy thanks to the effectiveness of battlewise skippers such as robert brentwood commander of the nuclear sub uss reagan had been punishing the siberian navy at an everincreasing rate protecting the vital sea lift resupply route from the american west coast to japan freeman prayed for good weather with all the energy his belief could muster the bad weather didnt clear only a few gaps opened up as a new front howled malevolently down from the laptev sea over the tundra into the taiga as if determined to take up where the previous front left off and continue making life as miserable as possible for second army meanwhile news had come in via japan that the britishamerican force approaching the urals in much calmer conditions had come under fierce siberian armored attack and was reeling southwest of sverdlovsk there were rumors of the siberians having used sarin a nerve gas whose persistence rating in cold calm weather was high when norton suggested to the general that he should carry his atropine injector a selfcontained hypodermic whose jab would penetrate a cbw suit freeman pretended not to hear him he didnt believe in doctors or any other medical assistance until he was hurt the general was more preoccupied with the report received moments before that yet another siberian cruise missile attack was underway this time satint and sigint would hopefully get much better trajectories freemans aa defenses opened fire the roar of patriots and the high scream of starstreaks filling the hills about neverskovorodino causing minor avalanches one of these burying a scissorfolding mobile bridge span the general was receiving satint from a fighterprotected ea sentry early warning radar and control rotodome aircraft that the enemy cruise trajectories were definitely originating from around the lake baikal area what in hell do they mean pressed freeman pulling out the hershey bar from the mre meal ready to eat tray ignoring the rest from lake baikal frozen lakes make as good a launch area as any other i suppose said norton sure as heck not many trees around yes well said freeman chomping on the hershey bar as if it were a cigar theyre about to get an education get out an ato and tell them we want as many aircraft as possible flying against the siberian cruise missile launch positions around or on lake baikal they wont be able to hide under cloud cover now he was correct about the cloud cover but there werent any launch sites on the ice instead satint was suggesting that trajectories indicated mobile sites in the heavily forested areas around the northwestern edge of the milelong lake the f and f pilots after passing through the heaviest antiaircraft gun and missile fire any of them had seen since the war began including ratmanov island lost fifteen american planes only six pilots bailed out the remaining american fighters mixed it with a swarm of fulcrums coming out of the superhardened concrete shelters hidden in the taiga the bases circling the lake from ulanude in the southeast barely a hundred miles north of the mongolian border to kalakan northeast of the lake back down through the zima pipeline and rail junction on the transsiberian west of the lake to irkutsk on the angara river the lakes only outflowing river for the next two days the americans despite increasing air losses dropped more bombs on the infraredspotted cruciformshaped cruise missile launch site clearings while a thunderbolts covered freemans column with their deadly thirtymillimeter antitank cannon as second army refueled and resupplied got on the move again through the taiga to urusha and yerofey pavlovich two towns over a hundred miles west with the thunderbolts looking for targets of opportunity and finding them the lead air controller broke radio silence only once to give the grid reference of massed armor twentyfive miles west of yerofey pavlovich the tanks he reported were in camouflaged revetments but detectable because the snowweighted netting created unusual shadow patterns more upgunned ts were reported lying in wait to ambush second armys spearhead around chichatka station just a little further west the tanks detectable through id signature heat given off by motors kept idling in the cold their exhaust was piped through flexihoses into snow berms antitank ditches whose walls of ice were ten feet thick but still heat patches showed up on infrared the resulting air bombardment a combination of as eagles falcons and ffs refueled midair from the coast was as formidable an air strike as freeman had ever seen unloading more ordnance on the enemys newfound positions than was dropped on husseins republican guard units in the first six days of that war even so freeman while exhorting his men nevertheless cautioned them not to be damned foolhardy adding when you attack you are to assume that not one i repeat not one of the enemys ts or any other of his tanks has been destroyed by the aerial bombardment and i dont give a damn about what reports we get from air command theyre doing a great job absolutely superb but theyre not on the ground we are i dont want you taking your tank platoons in there thinking that all weve got to do is mop up the russians taught the iraqis how to revet their armor remember dug em in so deep even our bombers couldnt get at them until they decided to come out and make a run for it well i can tell you one thing those siberian sons of bitches arent working for hussein theyre working for themselves when they come out if theyre not coming at us already theyre not going to run away that you can bank on another thing you cant expect our air superiority to help much once we engage youve seen it enough at fort hood and the fact that this is snow not sand doesnt make one whit of difference once the fighting starts itll all be weasel shit and pebbles flying identification friend or foe hard enough for us let alone for our boys in the air theyll have enough work cut out looking after themselves but remember each of your tanks has infraredvisible id marks last thing freeman paused taking off his battlefield kevlar infantry helmet putting it squarely on the briefing table pulling a tank commanders helmet to him remember a la the israelites he expected an answer for it wasnt a biblical injunction but one passed down by the israeli tank commanders in the arab wars the men roared in unison keep moving didnt hear you keep moving right now remember your buddies you left back there on that nevernever road cream these jokers with that freeman put on the new helmet adjusting the throat mike and slicking his hair down under the rim the interior of an abrams m a was a hightech marvel but it was so cramped that a strand of hair loose over a laser sight could cost you the battle norton told freeman straight if the general insisted on leading one of the front two command tanks of the twentytwotank battalion spearhead then the colonel was going to make his protest official bravery was fine but damn foolhardiness to use freemans own words was something else what would happen if freeman was general waind take over responded freeman he turned the front of the wide firingcontrol helmet almost touching nortons his voice lowered goddamn it dick i appreciate your position respect it but after that his thumb jerked back to the bloodied road whence theyd come or rather inched over in the last few hours several marine companies had been decimated other americans were dead their bodies vanished vaporized in the horror of modern explosives the only memorial to them now bloodstained snow and a small white cross hammered into the hard siberian soil i couldnt live with myself after that if i didnt lead he told norton my god dick skovorodino he was looking into the distance not into siberia or any other place hed known but to his field of glory skovorodino god what a beautiful name even sounds victorious his mood suddenly darkened it should have been our victory he turned and climbed aboard the first of the two command m tanks of the twentytwotank echelon that would lead the twohundredtank spearhead no secret to the strategy dick if anything happens to me just keep pressing west whichever wayll get you to the east bank of baikal and irkutsk then wed be far enough in to bomb the shit out of anything we like far as the kara sea if we have to remember the carriers cant do it despite what the public thought the flat tops accounted for less than five percent of all sorties flown in iraq we have to have land bases in deep yes general dont look so worried colonel said freeman grinning down at him were going to make ground round of em can i quote you general it was the cbn reporter hopping out of a humvee its driver looking apologetically nonplussed at freeman sure said freeman and still standing up in the cupola rapped on the tank radio silence lets go norton turned to the cbn newsman i thought it was made clear to you people that were running this by media pool and that none of you were allowed forward of skovorodino the reporter was shooting off the end of a roll of four hundred asa at the general snow flying up in clumps from the ms tracks the tanks aerial leaning back as the war machine for all of its sixty tons shot forward from zero to twentyfive miles an hour in less than seven seconds still nowhere near its fortyfivemilesperhour cruising speed it looked great freeman brought up his binoculars marvelous said the reporter he should be in the movies listen insisted norton i asked you what the hell are you doing up got urgent news for the general said the reporter without even turning around his wife died the reporter was switching to another camera voightlander vito b older simpler but with a good lens didnt think i should let him know before he goes into battle norton jerked the reporter around by the voightlanders strap you quote him you set him up before this things settled and ill shoot you you son of a bitch youll be out of the pool dan friendly fire got it hey hey what the shut up listen big shot while youre beaming your videos back home hes carrying over a thousand dead on his conscience nothing he could do about it then but now he can so dont you report anything until the things done you get it we dont want any baghdad pete shit from you swinging your goddamned camera around so any commie intelligence asshole can hey easy man you got it norton was still holding him by the collar an mp moved in to lend a hand wait until were done repeated norton the mp had never seen the colonel so mad the reporter put up his hands and backed away toward the humvee the cameras bashing against one another the clouds were parting now the sun turning the snow and endless taiga blindingly white surface snow turning to ice till you win huh said the reporter sneeringly christ ill be an old man norton was moving menacingly toward the humvee get him out of here he yelled at the driver the humvee spun around in its own axis splattering norton head to foot with freezing oilstained slush freemans tanks though their gas turbines were the quietest of any main battle tank in the world were still emitting a deep rumble through the taiga as arrowhead formations of as came up to support highflying bs navy carriers and cruisers in the sea of japan had already fired tomahawk cruise missiles programmed to hit the launch sites reported to be in the taiga around lake baikal far to the west the boss runs over that siberian armor up ahead and our cruise missiles flatten those launch sites colonel said wain the generalll sweep a double header dick norton looked at his watch he figured they wouldnt have long to wait he was half right the us cruisemissile strike against satintidentified launch sites would take one hour and fiftytwo minutes to reach the targets in the baikal area the us cruises traveling at a groundhugging five hundred miles per hour freemans armor should engage the enemy around chichatka station at about the same time it would be a decisive battle norton believed because while there were thousands of siberian main battle tanks and over fifty divisions within the far eastern tvd freemans master stroke had been in landing like macarthur had at inchon where no one thought he should or ought to land on a remote part of the southern tvd coastline but like most master strokes it would be recognized as such only if freeman won despite the heavy armor reported to be concentrating around chichatka which freeman was about to engage us air superiority meant that it was taking time for the siberians to bring up troops and more tanks from the flatlands of the siberian plain the siberians had few roads to do it relying on relatively few rail lines together with the multiple track of the transsiberian if freeman could inflict a decisive defeat here at chichatka and move forward quickly he might be able to take irkutsk before the full weight of the siberian divisions could be brought to bear on second army back further in the marine expeditionary unit jesus valdez was getting the news passed up from the coast quicker than a blizzard that back home the pounding they had taken on the neverskovorodino road was being reported by the la roche tabloid chain as the second army stuck in neverland the more respectable media it was said had begun its reporting of the effect of the siberian missile attacks in a more dignified manner but once the la roche papers had taken the low road market forces as they were saying on washington week in review had moved even the more responsible papers to follow la roches sensationalism the cruel truth for freemans troops was that second army was becoming something of a joke already there were notsosubtle suggestions in congress that freeman ought to be replaced valdez was flicking the safety catch of his squad automatic weapon back and forth until private first class joe kim told him to knock it off i was just thinkin said valdez that if i saw that cbn son of a bitch i d blow his friggin head off easy juan cautioned kim who in the past had been the butt himself of jokes about his surname it being the same as general kim of the north korean army whom freeman had defeated decisively in the raid on pyongyang dont get all het up about it man save it for the thirtyfirst yeah said valdez where the hell are they don worry said pirelli who hailed from brooklyn theyll get here i guarantee not if freeman takes out those wagons up ahead said another marine his msll own the road thats right man said kim who as a boy before his family emigrated to the united states had fed himself on movies from the sixties and still put man at the end of everything he said believing it made him as american as baseball hey hey he said excitedly looking overhead you see that man an american cruise missile was passing over them just above the top of the hills that spread north of the amur its white speckle camouflage making it difficult to spot but its stubby squarish wings cutting the cold arctic air and making a sound like cars whipping past one another the subdued growl of its motor coming to them only after it had passed overhead then there was another and another holy cow said valdez aint that somethin the effect on morale of finally striking back now that the siberian trajectories had been backtracked was electric sending a surge of badly needed confidence through the forward units of second army chapter twenty apache and cobra gunships flying noe nap of the earth missions following the contours of the taiga ahead of freemans armored column were so close to the treetops it was regarded as inevitable that some would be lost to wind sheer the gunships skimmed the up and down of air currents over the white rolling sea of forest a sudden unexpected drop of a few feet and the trees would reach up and take you down but none were lost at least not on the way in the pilots long used to such tactics in western europe the steady stream of information needed to assist in noe fed back from the twentyfiveinchdiameter combination thermal imaging sensor laser tv and boresight system through ainchdiameter tube to video displays in the cockpit each pilot in symbiotic relationship with the cyclic control column was ready to touchalter forward backward blade pitch and yaw controls in response to the main computer display the cockpit of the lead chopper of the thirty sharpnosed mileperhour ahs cobras was suddenly invaded by a loud buzzing noise and flashing red light the rate of climb had fallen precipitously in a downdraft the crafts pod load of eight tow or tubelaunched optically tracked wireguided antitank missiles and two pods of nineteen inch rockets for softer targets should infantry be sighted were abnormally buffeted in addition there was the weight of the universalswivel turretmounted thirtymillimeter machine gun and its ammunition belt under the nose with which to contend the pilot instantly altered the pitch the rotors responding quickly in the colder siberian air giving more lift than in the warmer climes of western europe and southeast asia still it was hairraising flying heartbeat and blade beat alarmingly out of synch at times the first tanks in sight either ts or s it was difficult to tell because of the camouflage netting adding to his anxiety the pilot was already depressed after having received the news that morning that his brother in the navy had been killed sucked overboard by the enormous vacuum created when the missouri had fired one of its salvoes against the kommandorsky islands but in the split second of sighting the target a half mile away and racing toward him the pilot forgot all the questions he wanted answered about his brothers death such as why the hell he was out on deck when the guns were fired he felt the adrenaline taking over as he shot off a tow missile equipped with the latest warhead upgraded to penetrate he hoped the layered reactive armor of the siberian tanks the armor that could explode an incoming round diffusing its impact the cobras now joined by apaches made a force of sixty choppers in all they swarmed over the taiga that erupted beneath them with streaks of orange light pale against the snow but thunderous in their explosions shrapnel screamed as camouflaged coldtherefore not infrareddetectable antiaircraft quads of rapid machinegun fire opened up for all their sophistication and versatility in the air an aspect constantly celebrated by hollywood the truth as every chopper pilot knew was that his craft flying at plus or minus miles per hour was a slow combatant in the modern world of highsubsonic and supersonic warfare and low to the trees they were terribly vulnerable the siberian quads continued to unleash a terrible and concentrated fire by means of the single most important anantihelicopter defense of modern warfare the sovietdeveloped highvelocity airdem or air defense mines the weapon was really misnamed as it was not strictly speaking an antiaircraft mine at all having no effect on faster fixedwing aircraft rather it was specifically an antihelicopter weapon but misnamed or not the siberian radarandheatsensorequipped mines exploded in vshaped cones of shrapnel four hundred feet high and over a hundred yards in diameter the mine triggered either by the approaching rotor slap or engine heat proved devastating to the us helicopter strike force knocking out fifteen of the sixty choppers three of these lost in midair collisions as a direct result of confusion and equipment gone awry in an air whistling with fuselagesmashing metal bits at first the younger reporters assigned to second armys media pool back in khabarovsk had difficulty understanding the seriousness of what had happened to their inexperienced eyes while fifteen downed out of sixty was bad news it still left fortyfive choppers fully operational but older hands pointed out that if freeman had lost percent of all his choppers in one action very soon hed have none left and as serious as the loss of million dollars of sophisticated technology was the loss of thirty pilots was far more serious the remaining fortyfive us choppers did not flinch despite the losses most of their pilots were veterans of noe flying in europe and iraq and they exhibited all the deftness that was required in hugging rolling terrain at treetop level the instant a target was spotted the chopper would dip down in the nearest fold hovering its mast sight extended high above the rotors the sights small tv invisible to the enemy providing a clear video of the enemy tank or gun position then with the target fix gained within seconds the chopper would pop up fire pop down wait for the explosion and move on the apaches had an advantage over the cobras as the latter because of logistical priorities had been assigned tow missiles whose pound electronic firing control box was much heavier man the hellfire antitank control box used aboard the apaches the difference in controlbox weight allowed the heavier apaches to carry much more ordnance than the smaller tenthousandpound cobras it was not only the siberian airdems that plagued the apachecobra strike force but the mobile remotecontrolled zsu sixtyfiveroundperminute aa quads that had already gained a reputation in the air defense of ratmanov island at chichatka it wasnt freeman in the lead m a who realized what had happened but one of the modelairplanesized pioneer uavs unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicleslaunched from the columns midsection heading into the cacophony of fire snowladen trees shattering and splitting on either side of it snow fire and dirt sweeping across the road from the airdems explosions freemans tank in the first fourtank platoon was a thousand yards from the summit of the hill before chichatka station sitting higher behind the gunner who was encased by solid steel beneath the base of the millimeter cannon freeman moved his right thumb and depressed the m a cupolas traverse and laying control his eyes flicking over the nine observation periscopes he had available to him ready in an instant to go to override control should he glimpse the hull or any other part of an enemy tank or its camouflage net on either side of the road fire breaks ran through the taiga but as yet he saw neither tank tracks though these would have been covered by the recent snowfall nor any other sign of troop concentrations though he could see nothing of the enemy freeman like the loader on his left and the gunner and driver in front of him was sweating with concentration the sour odor filling the tank and despite the fact that the abrams superb torsionbar suspension made it the smoothest tank ride in the world allowing the gun to traverse and remain stabilized regardless of the degree of buck and yaw even at full speed over rough ground the fact was that a tank was still a tank not a convertible the sheer volume of noise within the tank an echo chamber for the fifteenhundredhorsepower gas turbine the nerverasping whine of the turret moving and the heavy thumping of treadcompressed clumps of snow thrown up against the tanks belly all combined together with the four mens intercom phone added to the tension made worse by the knowledge that snow seeping back was reducing the infrared and laserranging sight capability like every other tank commander freeman knew he would have only a split second to get a bead through the sighting scope the watch was split between freeman taking the front degree traverse the loader responsible for left flank to rear and the gunner right flank to rear all the while freeman was ready to plug into the intertank bradley infantry fighting vehicle and armored personnel carrier radio network in the event that any of the tank crews spotted infantry that he suspected even now could be moving through the trees on either flank waiting until enough tanks had passed before launching antitank rockets against the american armor a rock hit the glacis the frontsloped armor and freeman saw the loader start mindful of the beating hed taken on the neverskovorodino road freeman wondered for a second whether it might have been better to wait for the selfpropelled elevenmilerange millimeter howitzers and seventeenmilerange m a artillery but everything was a judgment call and by the time the neverskovorodino road behind him would be cleared of the burnedout hulks caused by the siberian cruise missile attack and so clear enough for the howitzers to pass through the siberian armor would have time to position itself dolly patton three oclock shouted the gunner and in the half second it took freeman to spot the outline of the busty armor of what looked to be a fourhundredmillimeterthick t turret the gunner having seen the target hidden down a firebreak on the right flank had already got off a hesh highexplosive squash head round the cold clean air in the tank immediately replaced by a gush of hot acridsmelling smoke the rush of the air conditioners antigas overpressure system automatically cutting in freeman immediately spotted another angular shape its hull down but just visible above a snow berm about a thousand meters down the road going to override he got the fix and hearing the roar of a gunship overhead squeezed the trigger sending off another hesh round at over a thousand meters a second to the target and saw another m tank right aft of him firing he fired again the muffled crump he heard octane exploding the first target already burned fiercely nothing visible but a wall of orange flame licking into the whitegreen forest on either side of the firebreak snow from previously heavily laden branches sliding to the ground like sugar in minutes freemans m a fired ten rounds at this rate he knew theyd be out of ammunition in just under ten minutes it was well within the m s rate of fire the midbarrel fume extractor capable of handling the rapid passage of the fiftysixpound heat round down the smooth bore but it also meant the logistics of resupply quickly loomed as a major consideration so far no ms had been hit to freemans knowledge though in the confusion of battle including the noise of choppers overhead no one would really know what had happened until after his m still advancing the low hum of the computers making constant adjustments for barrel bend wind drift and outside temperature audible between the heavy thumps of other ms firing freeman broke into the intertank radio circuit ordering any tank with more than thirty of its fifty rounds expended to withdraw for rearming tanks further back were told to go to battle speed and to close the gap wherever the more open ground around chichatka station would allow freeman hated ordering any kind of withdrawal of tanks who still had ten rounds but he was suspicious now because of the apparent absence of infantry the forests beyond the clear area were ideal for infantry antitank positions he didnt want to be the man who led his armor into a trap but he already had for the gunships it had been an unmitigated disaster and freemans realization that albeit unwittingly hed delivered his air cavalry into the snare of quads and airdem mines set by yesov came via a radio message from his g it was short and blunt and immediately explained to the gunner in freemans tank and in many other ms how it was that freemans armor had been so successful so far the only casualty being a bad eject of a spent shell that seriously burned a loader the message sent in plain language from freemans g its conclusion verified by the unmanned reconnaissance aircraft was enemy tanks fake worse was to come with his choppers withdrawing his tank crews knowing theyd been had even if the helicopters had taken out some of the remote control quads in the forest freeman the recon pics now rushed to him by dispatch rider stood there in the cupola looking at the blowups the caption over them bore the euphemistic title simulated armored vehicles french made the hastily typed g report added the french manufacturers name lancelinbarracuda misspelled with a single r the fake tanks that had deceived the aerial reconnaissance were of fiberglassplywood construction their hollow interior containing a tengallon drum of gasoline a fourcubicfoot box of junk metal ample supplies of this available from the many disbanded old steam engines along the transsiberian and a clearburning japanesemade kerosene lamp the lamp produced the heat source for if sensors aboard either the uav reconnaissance craft or helicopters such as those that had been flown by the thirty american helicopter pilots who were now dead g also informed freeman that a pentagon file matchup just received indicated that the cost to the siberians of just one t equalled the purchase price of at least sixty fake tanks to add insult to injury it was less subtly pointed out that c in c second army should also be advised that allied intelligence has known for some time that zsu quads could be tripped by the pulse of approaching aircraft engines which would clearly explain the lack of troops heavy casualties in second army was the headline of the new york times the la roche paper in funereal tones that belied its brutally flippant headline freeman foiled again suggested it was time to ask serious questions about general freemans leadership this time there was not even a reference to the pyongyang raid or the breakout of the dortmundbielefeld pocket and only an ambivalent reference to the heavily won victory on ratmanov dick norton and everyone else in second army now knew that freeman had not swept a double header what he had instead was a double humiliation how yesov must be laughing in novosibirsk no one but norton had the courage when freeman returned through the pallof stillburning helicopters to tell freeman the news of his wifes death and at this moment on the worst day of his life general douglas freeman was also informed by the ea sentry advance warning reconnaissance that another siberian cruise missile offensive was on its way from baikal freeman wanted to be alone with his grief for the one person who had shared his innermost ambitions and fears and all the joys and disappointments of their life together and so did many others who had seen their closest friends literally torn asunder but mourning was a luxury no war indulged and the stars he wore on his collar dictated unequivocally that he give all his attention to and husband whatever energy he had for the welfare of his men in second armys most perilous hours though second army moved forward through chichatka its pace was sullen the air of defeat heavy as skunk cabbage on one level the problem was as simple as it was critical the us tomahawk cruise missiles had reached baikal and taken out their designated targets but more siberian cruise missiles kept coming of course the launch sites had to be fake only convincing enough like the fake ts in heat emission size and shape to sucker the americans into wasting precious cruise missiles of their own in the same way freeman had lost fifteen of his prime antitank weapons in the downed apaches and cobras it was evident now g had told him that the siberians must be using mobile sites somehow covering their tracks which the satellites werent picking up maybe theyre dragging a bush behind them said a junior officer jokingly but no one was laughing especially not the commander of the marine expeditionary force who had lost another fiftysix men and fortythree wounded to the latest siberian cruise attack freeman norton and the g colonel were poring over the latest satellite reconnaissance pictures of the baikal area the colonel having circled the four ushkanyi islands jutting up like pimples in the photograph next to the satellite pics he put four tatty amateur photographs of the islands slightly out of focus the islands looking like tiny white stones encrusted by the ice what are these splotches asked freeman in as desultory a tone as norton had ever heard the general was putting on his long white camouflage winter coat preparing to go for one of his walks and norton couldnt blame him it was bad enough to lose a game without having to suffer replays in the dugout splotches said the colonel well most of it i think is overexposure especially on these amateur shots we were sent some of it of course is varying thicknesses in the ice he tapped the amateur photographs brought to them by one of the buryat underground whod nearly got shot by a jittery marine and who claimed the colonel said suspiciously that hed gotten them from some jewish underground freeman grunted picked up his helmet and as he always did before he went out checked that his belt revolver was fully loaded ready to go want the to come along general asked norton no thanks all the same dick he forced a grin trying to belie his mood to the others have to nut a few things out he said and was gone flurries of snow bursting in unceremoniously just before the door closed outside the wind was moaning through the taiga some congressmen said one of the g officers are pressing for his recall where the hell are they coming from asked norton refusing to be drawn into any speculation about freemans fitness for command but his interjection was taken by the others as one that any dutybound aide would have to make when his superior had his back against the wall but if they thought that freeman was venturing out alone to lick his wounds they were wrong as the general moved along the edge of the road trucks rolling by him in the darkness the drivers wearing infrared goggles and guided by mps stamping their feet in the bitter cold as they kept a convoy of second army inching along wherever the roads shoulder was too narrow freeman asked himself one question would he have replaced any commander who had experienced the defeats he had in the last few days the answer was an unequivocal yesif the commander had had sound intelligence about a possible sucker ploy and no if he hadnt had reliable information of what the siberians were up to for the remainder of his walk hands behind his back head down against the bitter cold freeman thought of his index files of all the notes hed made about all the possible campaigns he might be called upon to fight just as schwarzkopf had predicted and readied himself for a desert war he recalled the history of the russias of the transbaikal which he had read as assiduously as the chronicles of sherman and grant and he thought too of nolan ryan of the texas rangers on that unforgettable day in when before the game against toronto ryan confessed to his coach my back hurts my heel hurts and ive been pounding advil all day i dont feel good i feel old today watch me they had watched him and after he performed the miracle he proclaimed i never had command of all three pitches like i did tonight it was my most overpowering nohitter by god freeman told himself watch me you bastards he walked for another half hour and on the way back to the g hut availed himself of the mefs satellite hookup ordering a call to the pentagon on scrambler after which without a word he put down the phone and made his way back to the g in the intelligence hut the colonel in charge was alarmed when he saw freeman the ice crust on the generals eyebrows making him appear particularly despondent and grim the colonel rose forcing a smile being as cheery as you could be with a man who had just lost his wife and who was now in the blackest hole of his career coffee sir asked a corporal potemkin said freeman norton whod been hunched over a pile of sitreps that chronicled the disastrous days action pushed himself away from the foldup desk and walked over to where the general snowflakes now melting and dripping from his coat was taking off his gloves rubbing his hands vigorously and nodding his thanks he took the coffee gratefully cupping it with both hands letting the steam clear his sinuses sibir know what it means colonel he asked the intelligence chief without taking his eyes off the laidout satellite photos sleeping land freeman answered for him thats what weve been doing goddamn sleepwalking well ive had enough other officers in the hut stopped what they were doing and watched him potemkin repeated freeman prince in the time of catherine the great whenever he heard she was leaving the winter palace to have a looksee among her subjects potemkin would have fake villages built all along her route neat facades so she wouldnt know what the real situation was he looked around at the assembled officers fake tanks gentlemen fake launch sites all of em but responded the intelligence colonel those cruise missiles they fired were real yes but not from there freeman was using the monocle to circle the lake not around baikal or from the islands too obvious in it it was said so calmly matteroffactly yet almost casually that for a second no one saw it and when they did there were a few unsettling looks among the intelligence group it wasnt the first commander some of them had seen crack up one of the junior officers laughed perhaps it was the generals idea of light relief ah yes put in a major only one problem with that sir the officer was astounded that no one saw the objection it was so obvious the ice said freeman anticipating him still looking at the photographs these photographs something bothered the about them earlier this evening the monocle was moving from one of the satellite photos to the amateur pictures reportedly taken by a member of the jewish undergroundhow thick is the ice on the lake two to four feet shrugged the colonel exactly said freeman and why is that one of the junior officers toward the back turned to whisper to his colleague because its friggin winter freeman surprised and alarmed the young lieutenant by having overheard the remark as the general turned the monocle caught a glint of light giving him an unbalanced even mad look even as he concurred precisely lieutenant winter but why does the ice cover vary thats the question the monocle popped out into von freemans hand and he garnered the men in closer look here the monocle was tapping the photos again these amateur shots which you got from the jewish underground fuzzy bit out of focus and then he turned to the k satellite pictures these were much sharper but they had one thing in common apart from being in black and white the monocle moved from the southwestern end near port baikal to the far north of the milelong lake some of the ice is whiterlooking than the rest the amateur shots taken from the southern shore show the same thing the officers crowding around the table saw the splotchy effect easily enough you said colonel continued freeman that the ice thickness varies from two to four feet yes sir the colonel saw the generals point that would explain why some areas are whiter more dense than others but why freeman asked and again answered his own question spring water escaping from fissures in the bottom of the lake happens in all lakes gentlemen im something of an authority on ice jesus the junior lieutenant said but this time he spoke so softly that freeman didnt hear it met boys call it upwelling continued freeman common enough same thing happens at sea springs bubble up and spread out reflects the light differently freeman let them wait he wasnt the most flamboyant general in the us army for nothing substance yes but he knew the value of style and this is where the training the reading the pattonlike attention to detail paid off subs he said theyre using subs gentlemen lake is more than twice the size of the grand canyon and deeper over six thousand feet theyve been doing a potemkin on us gentlemen fake launch sites like fake tanks weve been firing off cruise missiles at over a million bucks a pop for sweet fuck all theyre imitating the nerpa norton thought it was the name of a ship seal explained freeman i remember it because it was mentioned in the chronicles of genghis khan freemans monocle slid southeast of baikalgenghis khan was born here ruled from vladivostok to moscow freeman was shaking his head in admiration magnificent son of a bitch then his descendants were swept out by the cossacks cossack cavalry was like our ms went through em like crap through a goose but even then the mongols they thought baikal was holy knew about the nerpa only freshwater seal in the world the g was looking across at norton visibly alarmed the generals rambling seemingly unconnected soliloquy a symptom of crackup but the g officer was mistaken and norton knew they were in the midst of a freeman brainstorm for the life of me said freeman while i was out there tonight walking i couldnt understand why that damn seal was on my mind he turned to norton like the rivers dick kept at me soon as i heard our tomahawks had hit their marks but the missiles kept coming there was only one answer missiles were there but they werent submarines but how could they transport something as big as a submarine to baikal and theres no shipbuilding on baikal nothing anyway you need an enormous infrastructure freeman looked about his audience the nerpa seal gentlemen the monocle in his right hand was tapping his temple the seal has to breathe spends its winter in the water using a dozen or so air holes has to keep them open so he picks the thin ice thats how the subs do it gentlemen pop up through the thin ice fire and go back down there was a stunned silence of admiration broken by freeman problem is gentlemen what to do hit the ice said the junior lieutenant eagerly with our cruise missiles or have our subs launch icbms conventional warheads freeman shook his head thinking in the right direction son but youre missing a few things no good hitting the ice warhead explodes expends all its energy on impact remember how far baikal is from the coast from here weve been dropping them by air from our subs even one close to the coast a cruise missile travelling at five hundred miles per hour even if it could reach the lake from the coast which it cant would take hours by that time their sub would be long gone from its firing position but cut in the colonel general you just finished saying you cant transport a submarine to a lake and their very length midgets said freeman thats all i can think of it has to be he turned to norton dick young david brentwood sas yes his brother crackerjack sub skipper pacific fleet sir yes where the hell is he havent got a clue general find out immediately i need expert advice and dick sir david brentwood wheres he norton shrugged far as i know hes still on ratmanov or at one of the alaskan get him too no reason why we cant make this a family affair sir proffered norton if its information about midget subs i suggest we save time and call the pentagon theyll no no ive already done that said freeman his irritability rising in direct proportion to his excitement the men around him watching with the awe of beginning violinists realizing they were watching a maestro conducting and composing at the same time ive already got the information on that he seemed grumpy that norton hadnt made the connection goddamn it nerpas a small seal you see only four and a half feet long a midget most likely candidate the pentagon says freeman announced is this thing a gst standing for gaseous storage in a toroidal hull he flattened a crumpled fax the gst was an ugly thing to look at designed freeman informed his listeners by some italian joker called guinio santi the picture of the sub looked like what the pentagon and others had described as a michelin tire man lying on his side this was before the outer more streamlined hull was added on it made the gst look like a huge egg the multiple bicycletube ring effect under the superstructure created by threeinchdiameter piping that wound around and around the hull allowed engineers to overcome the problems of making a simple relatively cheap nonnuclear quiet submarine this also meant it was a much less detectable submarine because of the wraparound piping the gst unlike the other nonnuclear subs did not have to come up for air so often and risk disclosing its position either by showing a snorkel or by creating thermal patching which put regular nuclear and dieselelectric subs in danger from aerial and satellite surveillance and so ironically its plans stolen from the italian designer by chernkos agents the fat eggshaped gst using a constantly reusable nonnuclear chemicalexchangepowered engine originally scheduled by its manufacturer the kuznetsky metallurgical kombinat or kmk works in novokuznetsk miles southeast of novosibirsk to create chaos among the allied blue water fleets was now following the loss of vladivostok and other siberian naval bases on the coast being used not in the pacific or atlantic but in the inland sea of baikal but if this much was known about the midget sub it took captain robert brentwood usn after a gruelling tenhour flight by chopper and jet to hokkaido and second army hq to fully explain to freeman and the rest of the officers in g exactly why the toroidal hull was so dangerous with a total displacement of only tons against the sovietmade alfas tons and the us sea wolfs tons the toroidalshaped hull would occupy less than percent of regular attacksize submarines only fifty feet long it was designed specifically to defeat the superior sounddetection technology of the united states and her allies its exhaust gases being constantly stored and scrubbed rather than being expelled into the water with a burst speed of twentyfive knots submerged faster than most fullsize dieselelectric subs and a cruising speed of plus or minus fifteen knots it could range miles without coming to the surface except as brentwood pointed out to fire its missiles and even these would be fired subsurface after its pic andor small floatdrum charges had blown a hole in the thinner ice its a formidable weapon conceded brentwood compared to our subs a gst of this type would look like a speck of fly dirt the iraqis were being trained for midget subs in poland but when the gulf war came hussein never got a chance to use them couldnt get them through the embargo why the hell didnt we go for it asked freeman because said brentwood with elegant simplicity we thought we had the best how big a crew freeman asked six to eight sir replied brentwood essentially same controls as for any submarine long shifts probably twelve hours on twelve off three to four men each shift minimum would be captain engineer electronics warfare officer and cpo or enlisted man on the rudder control general asked brentwood do we have any wreckage of the cruise missiles used against second army any that didnt go off they all went off said freeman grimly why well id guess they were using ssds subaunched converted landattack missiles twentyone feet long twothousandmile range its so much like our tomahawk we call it the tomahawski the junior lieutenant thought it was amusing freeman didnt he was figuring that with each salvo fired on second army being a minimum of twenty missiles there wasnt just one gst out there that they had entrained to port baikal from wherever the hell they were making them there were more he put it to brentwood once clear of the water said brentwood missiles jackknife fins extend reach mach in two minutes and id say with ripple launch general and given their length were looking at maybe four missiles apiece whats this ripple launch well sir you fire one missile from your starboard forward tube the second port aft to counteract the rocking effect of the first missile then you fire port forward then port aft how long would you say to launch freeman put to him two minutes four minutes and theyre loafing holy dooly said the young lieutenant with a high whistle freeman glowered at him then looked at brentwood so how many subs do they have i think were looking at five general if im right about four missiles apiece that we cant be sure of but if were talking twenty missiles a salvo then thats just about yes yes said freeman impatiently i should add general it depends on the thickness of the ice or if theres an open space due to upwelling they could probably launch in less time same thing happens when youre in the polar ice you can get wafer thickness or yes yes cut in freeman again impatiently his mood reflecting his and gs realization that if he could not take out the subs and he couldnt by air or missile attack because of the ice roof hed lose the war they have to be taken out he said looking steadily at brentwood who felt his stomach roll over like an iceencrusted ship capsizing topheavy in the polar pack when freeman outlined his plan he didnt make it an order but a request adding besides your brothers experienced in these matters hell be a great help freeman pausedyoure the oldest arent you freeman made his question about brentwood being the eldest sound like small talk at a cocktail party yes sir said brentwood evenly im the oldest i hope i dont embarrass you captain but damn your father must be proud of you boys i wouldnt know brentwood parriedi havent seen him in over a year ive been at sea for so long good good said freeman slapping brentwood affectionately on the back as he steered him over to the map table and when this is over well see you two get special leave fair enough robert brentwood looked across at general freemanfairest thing ive heard all day general by god brentwood thats the spirit he turned to norton i wish that old limey fart he paused whats his name dick at the white house soames sir brigadier soames yes well i wish he was here wed show him american knowhow eh dick general that lake is heavily defended now that railhead at port baikal is bound to be heavily defended only place in the south where they could have slid a midget down slips direct from the rail tracks defended by aa batteries yes responded freeman but theyre expecting fighters bombers dick not a commando raid norton was confused but sir the risk of a drop through all that aa drop said freeman surprised who the hell said anything about a drop he thrust his monocle at the map im not going to send brave men to drop on top of aa fire youve got it ass backwards dick well fly them in can leave in the dark but itll have to be a daylight raid given our scanty intelligence on the layout of port baikal he was talking to brentwood now your brotherll lead an sasdelta troop twelve men without a pause he told norton to make the preparations now brentwood you tell the what you need i suggest seven more men from our navy base in hokkaido to bring your strength to eight or do you want to pick your own outfit my own crew sir freeman his left hand pressed hard against his forehead like a sunshade right hand with the monocle pumping time was walking back and forth in the g hut giving orders left and right including the minutiae of equipment needed by the small out mobile force norton and the g officers took notes looking like overworked waiters at a fastfood takeout how long to get them here dick took the ten hours said brentwood not quite yet believing that he was actually volunteering for the mission outstanding said freeman he looked at his watch to put the missions etd on zulu time oh three hundred hours tomorrow freeman was now talking to his logistics officer malcolm wain mal i want you to oversee chopper preparation suggestions wain took the rollrule and punched in the numbers on his calculator five hundred miles with extra tanks yes sir noe flying itll be risky general theyll be under the radar screen of course travelling that low but theres always the unexpected and freeman swung about from the map what the hells the matter with you i picked you because you were a man with initiative you cant handle it mal ill get someone who can there was silence in the g hut broken only by the steady hum of the computers yes sir all right said freeman can you get them there yes sir four hours flying reach there by dawn return after dark two cobras riding shotgun for two super sea stallion choppers carrying the strike team six sasdelta troops four of brentwoods crew and four collapsible snowcat arrow vehicles in each stallion with a stallion crew of three that makes thirteen men apiece one chopper goes down we still have one team albeit a skeleton one intact anyone superstitious about thirteen asked freeman he gave no one an opportunity to answer im not he paused hands on his hips shaking his head and looking up at the man hed chosen because he was reputedly the best of the finest in the service whose promise was venio non videor come unseen by god brentwood i envy you i wish i was going with you but i dont know beans about driving a submersible too bad sir said brentwood in as neutral a tone as he could manage norton coughed turning away the g duty officer was handing freeman an urgent decode after reading the message the general shook hands with robert brentwood you and dick work out the finetuning here with wain with that the general turned abruptly and walked over to the far corner of the hut where a terrain map had been spread out on one of the large folding tables brentwood looked across at norton feeling as if hed just been through a squall suddenly realizing that the finetuning would have to include some way of getting back after theyd got to port baikal and highjacked a gst maybe he said to dick norton theyll all be asleep its very sparsely populated said norton it was the only thing he could think of that might be remotely comfortingport baikal from the aerials is just a bit of a village i dont think youll have trouble getting in there our chopper guys are the best in the world flew special operations in the iraqi desert bit colder i guess said brentwood minus thirty good for the choppers though gives em more lift great said brentwood who though facing the hazards of the deep every day of a submarine patrol had always been of the mind unlike his kid brother that anything that flew was inherently unsafe he was still watching the general who had now it seemed turned his attention to some other matter the g duty officer came up and gave norton a copy of the decode sure would like to talk to him about some of those finer details he mentioned said robert brentwood like what the sasdelta boysll do if we make it to port baikal they spend a few days hiking in the woods waiting for us oh said norton moving under the light to better read the message theyre trained to survive for days even weeks in he didnt finish what he was going to say falling silent jaws clenched realizing now why freeman had abruptly ended the conversation with brentwood to go to the maps norton showed the message to brentwood the thirtyfirst stalingrad motorized division leading the fifth siberian army was only two hundred miles away robert brentwood was a naval not a military tactician but it was as obvious as the nose on his face that if he couldnt kill the cruise threat from baikal freeman wouldnt stand a chance two hours later as they were going over the supplies needed from every piece of winter clothing to the handheld magellan gps global positioning system that gives a soldier his position within fifteen meters anywhere in the world the young g lieutenant came in with full kit for brentwood which included a small capsule called the l pill its optional explained the lieutenant with an apologetic smile weve had reports that in the urals when our boys from ten corps were cut off well siberians dont take prisoners said norton they figure looking after pows is a drain on resources there was an awkward silence which brentwood himself broke by a game attempt at humori take it l isnt for love lethal said the lieutenant norton said nothing there was absolutely no point in telling brentwood that the siberians wouldnt even waste a bullet on prisoners in the urals theyd used their rifle butts on a company of ten corps pows it saved ammunition even if it took a little longer youd better get some sleep the lieutenant ingenuously suggested then looked about conspiratorially i can get you a fifth of sake not as good as whiskey but sakell be fine thanks lieutenant brentwood was a stickler for running a dry submarine and rarely drank even when he was ashore last time he could remember having done so was having a beer with rosemary on his last leave but right now a fifth of anything would suit him just fine chapter twentyone colonel nefski recently of khabarovsk had already learned that marshal yesov had arrived in irkutsk forty miles west of lake baikal yesov had come not simply to finalize the attack but to use the cruise missiles aboard the miniaturnye podvodnye lodkimidget submarinesto produce a total ognevoy udarfire shockand udar voisk troop shock against the american second army before freeman could reach beyond the amur hump and split his forces in a twopronged offensive one southwest to irkutsk the other swinging north to yakutsk if either or worse both was ever captured by the americans it would afford them nonairrefueling radii to pound the siberian armys arsenals and factories the political officer the zampolit of the siberian thirtyfirst was screaming at nefski advance spets scouts dropped ahead of the thirtyfirst with their bmd fighting vehicles at the tip of the stalingrad divisions spearhead had rounded up several civilians near kultuk at the southernmost end of lake baikal one of the prisoners a jew suspected of working for the yevreyskoe podpolie jewish undergroundhad been persuaded after his fingernails had been torn out to reveal that the camera he possessed had indeed been used for sabotage that photographs of the lake had been passed on via the rossiya express to contacts at irkutsk further west the kgb knew there was an active jewish underground working from irkutsk all along the transsiberian to krasnoyarsk railhead miles west of baikal then northeast on the bam the baikalamur mainline loop from which it could find its way through to allied lines nevertheless despite what might be the seriousness of the situation nefski refused to be cowed who did this zampolit think he was chernko nefski asked him coolly how it was that he assumed it was one of nefskis prisoners who had received the photos of the lake or whatever from the old jew i told you shouted the political officer the old man confessed he gave it to someone on the rossiya by the time the spets got the old fool to talk the photos had already been passed to whom the old jew had no names its a rule they never give one another their real names all the spets got from him was that it was a jewess on the khabarovsk carriage was she pretty enquired nefski the zampolits face was creased with worry if the americans suspect were slipping the midgets under the ice from port baikal at the southern end of the lake theyll try to bomb the rail line and why said nefski not minding his insolent tone what good would bombing port baikal do the submarines are already safe deep in the lake yes but they must come in for armament resupply ah said nefski trying to reduce the consequences for both of them because he had suddenly realized who it might be i dont think the americans know comrade and if they did try to bomb port baikal and got through the heavy antiaircraft ring we have all about the lake so what if they hit one or two subs in the dock that were in for ammunition resupply the other subs would still be at large in the lake plus they would be warned off by the explosions ah said the zampolit mocking nefskis own tone you dont understand the americans comrade havent you heard they can be ingenious they will try something then shrugged nefski put everyone around the lake on extra alert the political officer conceded the point nevertheless you must try to find this woman and stop any other messages that might be oh said nefski lighting a cigarette there is no mystery there comrade theres only one pretty jewess that was sent from khabarovsk to irkutsk i have interrogated her before her whole family is rotten then i suggest you question her again get as much information from her as you can before you get rid of her nefski took a long drag on his cigarette a winston the zampolit noted enviously imported from japan no doubt that might be difficult nefski was sayingto eliminate her the political officer looked angrily at the kgb colonel why you shoot people every day its your job a pilot said nefski transferred to irkutsk pvo with all the others from khabarovsk station he fancies her i dont care what some pilot fancies began the political officer this pilot is the son of a high party official comrade kiril marchenko hes in moscow said the zampolit defiantly ah yes but who knows who else is in moscow perhaps hes helping us i dont care interrogate her then have her shot moscows finished novosibirsk is what counts now comrade the pilot is one of our aces nefski informed him the zampolit sneered contemptuouslynever heard of him eliminate her nefski rose and saluted as you wish comrade nefski told himself he wasnt afraid of the political officer but nor was he a fool you did what political officers told you or you would be eliminated chapter twentytwo christ its coldern a fishs tit these were the first words that aussie lewis said as he stepped off the c after the long haul from alaska via japan to the neverskovorodino road there a whorehouse round here yank the marine assigned to drive the twelve sasdelta force troops to freemans hq was busy chipping ice from the humvee tracks windscreen nearest cathouse around here buddy is japan thataway oh lovely said aussie you hear that davey boy youre gonna have to play with yourself for the duration better than being on rat responded david brentwood saluting and shaking hands with the marine colonel who though senior in rank to david brentwood was awed by the presence of a congressional medal of honor winner take no notice of him sir david told the colonel hes an aussie they all talk like that good man in a firefight though the colonel grinned yes i knew a few in nam around da nan the humvees radio crackled loudly in the frigid air incoming incoming aussie lewis hadnt heard any heavy artillery where were the russian guns the commies didnt fire any artillery unless they had at least a hundred of them cruise missiles yelled a marine lets get outta here beautiful said aussie heaving his eightypound pack into the back of the humvee hear that choir he called out to williams no fucking class these sibirs cant wait till a mans unpacked williams the last man in pulled the door shut well with you yabbering away aussie theyll have no trouble knowing where we are now dont get shirty said aussie and either oblivious to or uncaring of a colonel of marines being present adopted choir williamss accent explaining to all in the truck hes a fucking welshman take him out of the estedford and he gets terrible cranky hed rather be singing in chapel you see tenormen of harlech and all that shit david brentwood in the front with the colonel and driver turned around you pack those norsheets he was anxious that the norwegian tent segments which could be used to make various sizes of small tents had been brought along planning on using them are you asked aussie did you pack them yeah course i did but we wont need em with our coldweather garb he added beneath each mans goretex parka and overpants there were three other layers fiber pile quilted jacket and pants and polypropylene underwear shell be right mate thought you were cold said choir goodnaturedly not for long choir not for long girls all say that im one hot there was a scream of air an enormous flash of light over the next rise they saw a humvee thrown at least forty feet into the air its doors flying off the black silhouettes of the marines flung from it the colonel and the sasdelta troopers felt the sudden jerk of acceleration as the driver put his foot down and while aussie might have been one of the toughest of the twelve commandos he had never been under cruise salvo fire before and wondered what the hell the driver was doing but the marine wasnt listening to advice his helmet hard up against the windscreen he peered through a tiny hole in the ice picking up the infrared headlight beam they land a quartermile apart explained the marine colonel like running a traffic light provided you can suddenly he stopped night was day and they felt a warm wind actually push the humvee forward as the vehicle hit fiftyfive miles an hour on the hard snow road started to skid and righted in a rain of dirt snow and god knew what else falling on the vehicles roof as it continued on to freemans hq no one said anything until the vehicle came to a shuddering stop an mp swearing and jumping out of the way just in time his weapon raised momentarily fearing it was some kind of terrorist attack the driver sat there shaking the mp bawling him out the colonel toned everything down and while the sasdelta team moved into freemans hq to be briefed on what the general called the game plan choir williams tongue in cheek blithely asked you making book on this mission aussie aussie didnt answer until after the briefing which lasted a half hour well asked choir williams what odds are you giving now aussie was checking his ammo pack why dont you take a flying fuck at a doughnut oh how kind said choir turning to david brentwood you hear that captain is that any way to talk to a tenor i ask you now aussie saw ice was already forming on his magazine pouches and as he replied to choir williams his breath looked like a fiery dragons why dont you take a flying all right cut in brentwood six hours sleep then its off to the lake resort resort oh spare me moaned aussie two fucking comedians i cant stand it dont worry aussie said oreilly one of the four americans including david brentwood in the teamleast you dont have to hoof it i dont like those friggin snowcat arrows said aussie make more noisen a bloody chopper not to worry responded choir snowll muffle the sound aussie id still rather hike in not enough time commented david brentwood you heard the general too bad said aussie shifting his attention to his nose one of the most insidious dangers of a winter campaign being that the flesh could freeze so fast you didnt even notice itleast my prick is still warm youre hopeless proclaimed choir get in the truck you horrible man david brentwood was glad of the repartee among members of the team without high spirits not even the best equipment in the world would be enough on such a mission as this as the humvee drove away david brentwood went back in the hq to see his eldest brother the briefing of the mission had been so detailed and required so much attention that apart from a handshake theyd not had the opportunity to say much to one another david felt badly about it but the fact was he hesitated going in to see his brother theyd never been that close the age gap between them much wider than it was between robert and ray the second oldest besides having stayed alive during the war so far without having seen that much of one another david harbored what he knew was an irrational but powerful conviction that seeing one another now and being on the same mission would be well just plain bad luck he had no idea that robert now opening the door holding up a fifth of vodka felt exactly the same chapter twentythree nefski drew the blackout curtains but not because of any imminent threat of an air raid on port baikal the blizzard sweeping down the milelong lake though abating was still wrapping irkutsk further west from port baikal at the mouth of the outflowing angara river in thick protective sheets of white it would make even instrument flying for the americans difficult if they were so foolhardy as to try anything particularly over the heavily defended eastern perimeter of the lake in any event nefski welcomed the overcast for another reason the room assigned him by the local authorities for the interrogation was on the ground floor of the old port baikal library and as such anyone passing by could see in unless the drapes were closed and the room was stuffy overheated the result of the ample electricity produced by the hydroelectric dam further up the icefree stretch of river that flowed westward toward irkutsk he wanted a cold room for cold hunger isolation had in nefskis long experience of interrogating prisoners been the most reliable trinity when it came to extracting information given his choice hed choose isolation above everything else and for this reason hed regretted having put her among the other prisoners during the withdrawal from khabarovsk it had broken her weeks of solitary while she hadnt been allowed to speak to the other prisoners on the train their very presence and the fact that the siberians were retreating from khabarovsk had given her new hope her wild defiant eyes fiercer than ever on the edge of starvation stoking her fire of resistance nefski pushed away the gooseneck lamp the corporal here at port baikal had turned on alexsandra in his usual inept attempt to equal nefskis record for confessions not wanting to show she was grateful in any way she shifted her head only slightly as if the bright light had not been at all uncomfortable nefski waited he had no intention of hurrying it that was the problem with so many interrogators like the buffoon of a corporal who was now ogling the jewess from his post by the closed door the younger kgb recruits wanted everything done yesterday all the information to come at once in a torrent on the other hand the zampolit had a point time was pressing though he knew she didnt smoke nefski offered her a cigarette to demonstrate goodwill the fact that he was willing to be civil about it or else he was determined not to let a woman a jew at that put it over him for though he was a full colonel having distinguished himself in the regular armys maskirovka or camouflage units from which hed gone on to kgb bordertroop rank and then to khabarovsk he was laughed at behind his back because of his wife he knew the corporal and other junior ncos enjoyed their jokes at his expense around their samovar of a morning they called her the t there was no such tank the eightyfive centimeters or thirtyfour inches said to be the size of her neck with a neck like that it was said that she was worth two millimeter howitzers just let her loose in the thirtyfirsts spearhead and let her run at tanks it would be the end of the americans it wasnt funny to nefski in his late fifties his sexual appetite hadnt abated but his wifes had she had become more interested it seemed in the japanese and chinese delicacies that he had been able to acquire from ships captains whose vessels had docked at vladivostok he had thought of using the promise of the expensive clothes and other bricabrac he could weasel or threaten from the merchantmen of the ports in his old jurisdiction and it might have bought him her favor but she was so enormous so offputting he had ceased trying encouraging the worst of the rumors hed overheard namely that he couldnt do it anymore because hed lost it that search parties had failed to find it in her taiga nefskis face reddened at the very thought of the humiliation he was suffering no one of course would dare hint at his nickname of limp dick to his face if they had he would have had them shot on corruption charges he had enough evidence among his forbidden imports or he could have sent them to one of the perms the farflung siberian labor camps that had been reopened after gorbachevs idiot regime he drew heavily on his winston the thought of having his detractors put in a shizo the fourbyeight punishment cell more and more appealing no blankets with a hard fir plank for a bed and the steelgrated light that was left on twentyfour hours a day if they broke the fortywatt bulb another month then let them joke about colonel limp dick he felt his erection throbbing like him and the corporal the jewess was perspiring heavily in the overheated room her sackcloth prison dress sticking to her like wet brown paper her nipples tantalizingly outlined but not clearly visible sweat trickling down the alabaster whiteness of her throat disappearing between her breasts her dress also clinging to her thighs the comparison between her and his wife was like that between two entirely different species whom he asked her quietly did you give the photographs to at irkutsk he was staring at her the bluishgray cigarette smoke wafting idly above him before being caught in the sultry currents of the stuffy room what photos she shot back innocently not their actual name he said amicably i dont expect that a description of who it was man woman how old i dont know anything about photographs nefski indicated the small narrow black bench by the door where overdue borrowers of stateapproved books had once sat obediently before being summoned by the librarian to give good reasons why they should not be fined tie her down he told the corporal on her back she sat up rigidly the hatred in her eyes shot through with fear nefski called in two more guards it was astonishing how strong even halfstarved prisoners were when their fear overtook them besides his subaltern needing help nefski reasoned that with three other men as witnesses it would put an end to colonel limp dick talk she fought violently as they tussled with her she didnt scream not once but was huffing and puffing like a dumb animal who knew instinctively it was destined for the chopping block no said nefski leave her head free he would pull her long black hair down behind her with one hand kissing her neck and squeezing her breasts with the other suck them after they tied her down her breathing became even more rapid as she made futile attempts to loosen the binding tape nefski took the long pair of scissors from a plastic stand on the blotter and walking over straddled the bench looking down at her he took the scissors and slit the dress open the three other kgb men were fixed where they stood by her saturnine beauty the subaltern so aroused he was squeezing his tongue hard between his nicotineblackened teeth nefski tossed the scissors back on the desk spat into his right hand and wiped his hand between her legs then did it again and again until he thought she would be wet enough he undid his belt and unzipped his fly letting his trousers fall down to the bench as he lowered himself onto her she started to whimper and he slapped her hard snapped his fingers for one of the mens handkerchiefs and stuffed it in her mouth as he entered her they saw her stiffen but nefski only pushed harder and the subaltern trembling with envy saw his chiefs eyes close in ecstasy one hand clasping one of her breasts the other wrapped in her hair jerking her head down hard on the bench after breathless exhausted he stepped back almost stumbling telling the others it was their turn for sverkhurochnye chasy overtime it was a good joke he thought and more importantly it would assure their silence none of them knew the rape would change the course of the war chapter twentyfour pulling on siberian uniforms taken by freemans forces from siberian militiamen captured in khabarovsk the twelvemember sd as the sasdelta team was designated in freemans hq were lost in clouds of steam rising from the longnozzled deicing hoses spraying the rotors of the two super sea stallion choppers the stallions their crews also in siberian uniforms would carry the team seven hundred miles skimming over the vast taiga in a napoftheearth flying mission that would take them to tankhoy on the southeastern shore of the lake twentyseven miles across from port baikal the latter situated on the icefree outflow of the angara river the rotors of the two escorting cobra attack helicoptersdwarfed by the super stallions much larger at feet long were already cutting into the softly falling snow david brentwood would have preferred a smallersilhouette chopper but the big stallions had a range of nautical miles each powered by three tge turboshaft engines strong enough to lift a millimeter howitzer and the guns fiveton truck each of them could certainly carry four of the threeman arrow vehicles freeman had insisted on for the mission above all the big choppers could carry hefty extra fuel tanks as important as any of its other attributes the stallion could be refueled in flight from a kc tanker so that by using additional drop tanks for the sevenhundredmile run in and partway out it would be able to be refueled in the air on its way back beyond the deadly aa missile and gun batteries around the lake in addition the chopper had a remarkable foot ceiling and also had two caliber machine guns mounted starboard and port beneath the engines cowling which two of the sd could handle if necessary though it wasnt snowing heavily the snow was bothering the pilots of the two attack cobras more than the sea stallion crews who had already done a lot of badweather flying in pickup and deposit rescue missions after and sometimes during the baikallaunched missile attacks taking litters of wounded to mash units and in some cases flying them as far back east as khabarovsk one of the cobra pilots in particular seemed spooked grumpily ordering his weapons officercopilot to doublecheck that all red tapers had been taken from the sixteen hellfire antitank missiles the copilot had already done so but the pilot thought the deicing steam had momentarily obscured the ground crew who in turn might not have seen his thumbsup signal meanwhile the seven crew members flown in from the uss reagan to join robert brentwood bringing the team up to twenty men were adjusting their sdissued extremelycoldweather gear freeman shook hands with every man including the four chopper crews who were going on the mission remember now engineers have assured us that the noise of the snowcat arrows is similar to the kind of engines the sibirs use on their snowmobiles so the noise in itself shouldnt draw undue attention and as you can see weve spent all night painting your transport in snowgray siberian camouflage pattern so what more could you want if anyone laughed no one could hear it over the rotors of the sea stallion coughing to life if for any reason freeman continued his voice in competition with the choppers you cant rendezvous after he meant if the choppers were unable to fly remember just keep heading northeast once youre in the taiga on the east side of the lake well lock on to your location transmitters thatll tell us where you are within a thousand meters and if god forbid you should go down going in or coming out deploy away from the craft well home in on the bipper as fast as we can but i repeat dont stay with the chopper no matter how tempting freeman looked up into the falling snowand as i told you last night your pilots will exit our area by flying due south then east toward tankhoy on the east side of the lake in order to avoid any more antichopper mines the bastards might have sown directly ahead of second army were sweeping and grading for them now but itll take twentyfour hours the general paused anyway all this is purely academic at this stage gentlemen ive every confidence youre not going to be spotted good luck aussie lewiss tone was easy typical of sasdelta veterans who while not contemptuous of authority were certainly not intimidated by it general you think this newly painted red starll get us in more trouble than its worth he gestured toward the nearest sea stallion attract friendly fire all forward observers including air and ground unitshave been ordered not to fire on any chopper in our area for the next half hour youll be out of our fire zone after that siberians dont have anything that looks like a sea stallion do they asked aussie no admitted freeman but the cobrasll be out front and their silhouettes are second cousin to the siberians havoc attack helos by the time any of em spot you the cobras will already have spotted them right said aussie enigmatically as he grasped the cold stiff handle of the haskins m sniper rifle case and boarded the first sea stallion duck hunting is it aussie asked choir as they buckled up yeah answered lewis his mood more buoyant after a nights sleep and reassured by the fact that the falling snow would help screw up the enemy radar david brentwood and his brother were silent both knowing they were sharing responsibility not only for the men under their command but for a mission that like freeman they understood could turn the tide for the us second army and win the siberian war from now on the choppers were on radio silence struth said aussie his mood changing abruptly these bloody things make a racket no one among the other five sd men aboard stallion onedavid brentwood choir and the three delta men oreilly lawson and salvini or the four submariners including robert brentwood said anything all occupied by their own thoughts jesus said aussie were not going to a bloody funeral you blokes lighten up anybody want a fag he asked he offered a packet of filterless cigarettes bad for your lungs said choir disinterestedly oh spare me rejoined aussie where the hell you think youre he stopped nudging david brentwood and nodding toward one of the four submariners the sonarman called rogers from the reagan the man had his eyes closed tightly head down lips moving in prayer say one for me sport said aussie hush said choir with an edge that david brentwood hadnt heard in a long time sd volunteers being chosen for their ability to get on with one another in situations that would have other men at one anothers throats sorry mate said lewis lighting his cigarette sure you dont want a fag rogers smiled and said something but beneath the rumbling roar of the sea stallions three engines aussie couldnt hear him after flying thirty miles southsouthwest of the second army for a distance of seventy miles above the frozen shilka river where the outside temperature was minus forty degrees centigrade the four choppers swung southeast for the fivehour run over the vast white landscape of birch pine and beech taiga to tankhoy on the southeastern side of the milelong bananashaped lake here they would deplane for the final fortyfivemile eastwest run from the southernmost tip of the lake around to port baikal situated on the southwestern end they were two hours into the flight the taiga a whitish blur beneath the haze of the falling snow when choir heard the hightoned alarm sounding the weapons officer saying something that ended with locked on stallion one pitched so violently that aussie almost lost his grip on the sniper rifle case one of the submariners walking back from having relieved himself was thrown to the floor sliding as the stallion yawed hard to port they heard a soft thump barely discernible beneath the roar of the turboshaft splash one havoc said the copilot on the internal radio way to go whats going on asked a sicklyfaced rogers robert brentwood handed him another brown paper bag one of our cobras got the bastard announced the stallions copilot excitedly hey hey two of the four submariners said celebrating as if suddenly brought to life by the information their hands meeting in high fives brilliant said aussie lighting another cigarette his tone killing any excitement in the cabin as surely as any missile so much for our fucking camouflage they dont know where were going said david brentwood trying to reassure the submariners we could be reconnaissance choppers out looking for the forward units of their thirtyfirst anyway targets a long way off thats what worries me sport said aussie electing to take the most negative implication of davids observation not like you aussie is it said choir surprised to be fretting so hey why dont you take a flying knock it off said david well be okay were all a bit edgy only natural like allbran said aussie winking at robert brentwood and rogers you blokes got all the russia stuff down pat he meant the instructions above the various dials in the midget subs that would be written in the cyrillic alphabet yes answered rogers head back hard against the fuselage now eyes half open a drooling seasick look about him more than we need said another submariner you get us to one of those gsts and well take her down no problem said aussie easily his mood swing uncharacteristic of him and something david brentwood didnt like hey brentwood aussie shouted across at robert you know russki some said robert enough to make sense of an intelligence report technical specs that sort of thing we began rogers finding it difficult to get enough spittle to talk if you can get us to one we can take her down yeah yeah said aussie so you told me but now the phrase take her had shifted aussies attention he was thinking of a bird he said hed had once in wales yelling at them through the trembling of stallion one as it dipped and rose over the contours of the taiga more like a frigate in a rough sea he was describing his good fortune to the submariners jugs on her like this his palms cupped as he made an upanddown motion i swear biggest nungas you ever saw choir shook his head at the submariners back at second army headquarters east of yerofey pavlovich an eager young pr lieutenant came in and requested he be allowed to speak to gen douglas freeman on an important matter refusing to tell dick norton what it was about freeman had come out exhausted from giving his undivided attention to the minutiae of logistics that would be required to break out southwest toward irkutsk and north to yakutsk if the brentwood boys succeeded whats on your mind son asked freeman norton sensing the generals mood made a tactical retreat toward the coffee urn at the far end of the hq hut sir im lieutenant simpson sir and im responsible for your pr in the media pool in khaba dont waste time freeman ordered spit it out this with astonishing courage the lieutenant proceeded to do sir the la roche papers are murdering you not only back home but in japan the uk all over the world sir and the lieutenant paused but then got right to it and the monocle doesnt help sir what the monocle sir well sir it it looks ridiculous general he hurried on theyre calling you von freeman the la roche papers and the siberian propaganda radio is calling you a nazi norton seeing the generals hand drop to his waist thought that freeman fatigued from having been on his feet for over fortyeight hours without a break might actually draw his revolver and put an end to the lieutenant freeman stared at the lieutenant who having said his piece was leaning back at an impossible angle as freeman advanced on him you cheeky sonofabitch i oughta have younorton general is he correct ah well thats what theyre telling me general who the press goddamn fairies freeman exploded rounding on norton its your goddamned fault with that freeman tore the monocle from its cord and threw it to the ground crunching it under his boot you see that he bellowed at the lieutenant yes sir tell those fairies that thats what im going to do to the siberian thirtyfirst he turned about to get the attention of everyone in the hut he already had it or they will do it to us we beat them or we the here in siberia every one of us the us second army does not retreat is that clear there was silence norton get the a wam here immediately it was an xm widearea mine yes general said norton when freeman had disappeared through the green curtains that separated his war room from the rest of the hut someone manning the radar said in low tones is he going to blow us all up shut up commanded norton if i hear any more smartass the cruise alarm began its familiar howl incoming came the warning over the pa incoming there was a shuffling noise outside the headquarters hut for even though the cruise was still miles seventeen minutes away many of the men were already heading for the sandbagged shelters mine clearance was still going on up ahead so that soon the second army would be on the move again but so long as the missiles kept coming from baikal freeman knew he couldnt advance in any meaningful military sense of the word and yet retreat would not only mean a triple humiliation for second army but the siberians smelling blood their supplies building up along the transbaikal for yesovs attack would be content with nothing less than the destruction of the entire army chapter twentyfive the snow had stopped falling beyond them under the steady roar of the choppers engines lay the enormous folds of snowcovered siberian cedar larch black spruce and pine broken here and there by clear lowlying areas of oleniy mokh reindeer mossin reality flat areas of snowcovered lichens and beyond this the fivethousandfoot barrier of the khamar daban range the effect of their sudden exit from the falling snow of the predawn light caused ambivalent feelings for the two cobras crews clear weather meant good tankkilling conditions but the sd strike force and pilots aboard stallions one and two following the cobras were not so joyful the choppers might very well be like needles in a haystack against the vastness of the taiga but even needles caught reflective sunlight that could be seen for miles beneath patches in the overcast but clear subarctic sky oh isnt this nice yelled out aussie jerking his head toward the panorama of forest and sky just what the doctor ordered david brentwood mustered as tough a look as he could for even though he knew lewis was one of the hardest men hed ever served with he doubted whether the newcomers aboard would be able to ignore the australians inverted sense of humor his brother and the other submariners though david wouldnt have had their job for the world must he thought feel particularly vulnerable quite literally fish out of water there was a white out it was a phenomenon the pilots knew about but contrary to widespread belief the condition wasnt something that occurred in a roaring blizzard rather the sudden and for those who had never experienced it terrifying loss of perception could only be likened to that lightninglike anxiety suffered by panic attack victims it occurred most often in clear albeit overcast conditions because of the contrast between the different whites of old and fresh snow the mistake of stallion twos pilot was that in the moment of exhilarated relief during the exit from the falling snow to clear weather he went off instrument flying to visual assist too quickly in that split second he lost all depth perception thinking he was far too high above the taiga when in fact he was far too close only sixty feet above the blur of spearshaped firs his copilot realized it the moment the nose went down and pulled the stick his feet jabbing the rudder control for uplift but a rotor caught and they were gone in a single somersault rotors still spinning but upside down cutting and slashing into the timber the selfclosing gas tank built to absorb fiftymillimeter armorpiercing shells imploded like a collapsed drum spewing gas over redhot bearings the chopper disappeared below cobra two in a silent ball of saffron flame and snow the latter rising like talc coming down in a fine shower of rain that did nothing to extinguish the twentyfoothigh flame now licking the pines there was a bang that everyone on the remaining stallion and two cobras heard holy mother of began choir but then like the rest he fell silent beneath the high whine of their sea stallions three general electric turboshaft engines its pilot instinctively going for height after the crash of the other stallion before settling down again to the dangerous noe flying the submariners grimlipped sonarman rogers was sweating praying again do as i tell you damn it barked cobra ones pilot at his copilotweapons officer we cant go back endangers the whole mission you know the fucking rules the pilot was back on instrument flying and put on his sunglasses not that this would be any protection against white out but it might reduce the equally hazardous risk of ice blink once they negotiated the passes of the range in ice blink mirages of something twenty or more miles away across a vast sheet of ice could loom up with stunning clarity as if they were only a few hundred yards ahead relax fellas it was aussie not as bad as you think it helped us in a way what the shit dyou mean asked rogers uncharacteristic anger momentarily overcoming his air sickness and fear aussie was lighting another cigarette wont be able to tell what it was wreckagell look like a scrap yard and same paint as their own red star and all and the guys in siberian uniforms aussie looked at his watch freeman had even taken care to make sure they were of russian make what are we davey aussie asked brentwood bout a hundred miles from the lake twenty minutes from touchdown hell itd take em fifteen minutes or so just to send out a search party even if anyone did see the explosion by then well be down or close enough what weve gotta do now is head south for a while out of sight of any painintheass search party yeah said one of the submariners but what if theyve already spotted us aussie smiled choir and davey had already seen it choir explaining it to the submariner well laddie if anyone sees us theyll think were part of the rescue party same paint job from any distance at all itd be hard to tell were too far inside enemy territory for them to think we might be you hope said the submariner ah thats not all said aussie confidently you see mate when we start up those noisy arrows anyone within cooee distancell think its one of their damned snowmobiles joining the search for the downed chopper david brentwood clicked on his throat mike captain go ahead this is captain brentwood suggest we divert south for a while avoid any search party coming out of port baikal no problem it took two minutes for the stallion pilot to signal the two cobras intercraft radio silence being strictly enforced and requiring either hand or craft maneuver signalling before the three remaining choppers swung south on the last leg through or if necessary up over the sixthousandfoot khamar daban range before they could take a fix on tankhoy twentyseven miles across the ice from port baikal fifteen miles from where the stallion had gone down an argument was building between the ten members of a spets squad standing by a hind helo idite za nimil say follow them in said the spets leader referring to the three dots they could see heading for the khamar daban range zachem why asked the serzhant theyre probably ours big ones probably a hind like ours other two are probably havocs hinds havocs shouted the spets leaderyou cant tell from here even with binoculars they were more than a mile off whatever you say comrade replied the sergeant but i say were wasting time lets go on to ulanude our orders are to relieve one of the sections at the head of the thirtyfirsts spearhead there are already two thousand of us at the thirtyfirsts spearhead said the leaderi say lets follow those three choppers make up your mind comrades advised the hind captain assigned to transport the ten spets personally i think we should go on to ulanude as the sergeant says were getting low on gas anyway did you see them snapped the spets leader a big man well over six feet and broad but not an ounce of flab on him no admitted the hind pilot you the leader asked the gunner too far off sir said the gunner and quickly trying for compromise added why dont we call irkutsk leave it up to them the nine other spets waited for their captain to bawl out the air force pilot for forgetting they were on strict spets operational procedure no radio contact allowed in the event it might be picked up by distant american awacs tightening the sling of his ak the spets leader then lifted his right fist waving it in a circular motion the hind coughed sputtered and snow swirled about the spets as they clambered aboard the hinds nose gunner immediately in front of and beneath the pilot was cursing strapping himself in behind the twin millimeter machine guns in his armorplated cubbyhole he had a girl a buryat waiting for him in ulanude polnym khodomdash speed ordered the spets captain this should take it to miles per hour but a few miles would be lost because of the extra weight of the ten spets and the helos four swatter antitank missiles the pilot went visual as he could not put on his radar otherwise he would run the risk of setting off every aa gun and missile battery that was strung along baikals lakeshore camouflaged in the forests he barely managed to get a fix on the three distant helos they looked like dots of pepper against the white pallet of the western sky he was watching the gas needle soon theyd have to be refueled the nearest pol depot at port baikal damn the spets they should have gone on to ulanude he banked the gunship in the direction of the dots doubting hed catch them unless they suddenly jinxed due west and he could take the hypotenuse vector between them if it was a hind and two havocs on patrol out of port baikal or irkutsk further west it would make him and the spets look real idioty well it was the spets leaders decision not his the pilot swung the hinds gunsprouting nose up climbing going for high ground from which he could see better across the taiga even so he lost sight of them for a moment the three dots heading into one of the passes through the mountain range toward the frozen inland sea of baikal by now the lead cobra was looking for muskeg hoping for an open patch in the forest no more than a mile or two from the shore using tankhoy as a general heading but keeping well away from any sign of habitation it was the copilot who spotted a promising site and within seconds the cobra began a sway signalling the super stallion and the other cobra that hed found a landing the air was so clear now he could see a thin wisp of smoke from what had to be port baikal across the lake the smoke rising to the right of creamy white cliffs of the transsiberian railways spur line from kultuk at the southern end of the lake to port baikal he told his copilot he didnt know which was best for the commandos clear weather which would make it much easier and therefore quicker for them to reach their target or snowy conditions which while slowing them down would have provided them with more cover they got clear weather man said the copilotweapons officer you can see for miles they aint got no choice true the snowcat arrow technical designation uhp was based on another american aircushion vehicle speed recordholder the uh like the uh hovercraft the snowcat was triangular or as seen from above arrowheadshaped a midplaced cockpit seating three the military version placing the driver slightly higher and behind the other two nineteen feet long and seven and a half feet wide the triangular snowcat with an eightinch clearance was powered by an cc toyota car engine its speed the same as the old recordsetting uh eighty miles per hour over water ninety miles per hour over ice or snow with a maximum gradient tolerance of thirty to forty degrees depending on the condition of snow or ice pack its payload was a thousand pounds which could easily handle three commandos and their equipment in the lead arrow this included a heavy swivelmounted fortymillimeter m machine gun in front of the cockpit as well as the guns boxcontained belt feed ammunition the guns fortyinch barrel having a theoretical degree traverse in practice as aussie had discovered on a dryrun assembly the safest maximum arc of fire was degrees consisting of a degree swing left or right the noise that bothered him was ironically not the main thrust engine but the air cushions lift system powered by an horsepower cc briggs and stratton verticalshaft lawnmower engine which drove an axial fan the latters sixfootdiameter blade mounted at the back or widest part of the arrowhead delivery of the threeman crafts ordered much earlier in the campaign by freeman had been delayed not because of any mechanical malfunction but because of the generals insistence that the usual black skirting for the air cushion be painted white the delay in delivery meant that the eight designated drivers as david brentwood had called them had had only an hour or so to practice the previous evening now with one stallion gone he had only four drivers but the controls were simple even if aussie complained of their bloody sunday lawnmower noise and the rough ride which frankly had surprised all of them except robert brentwood who as part of his naval training in combined ops amphibious training was already familiar with the gutshuddering motion of acvs in particular the monstrous bargesized marine hovercrafts as the four craft from the remaining stallion slid effortlessly down the rollers of the stallions ramp door guided by the sixman sd and fourman sub crew team the crews of the three choppers zipping up their thick thermal jackets were already busy spreading out the camouflage nets over the lone stallion and two cobras did you know the men on the stallion well robert brentwood asked his younger brother in an effort to share his loss of the four submariners no it was said almost rudely but david as commander of the land part of the mission was too preoccupied with its details for any sentiment to intrude besides there was a nagging albeit childish determination on his part not to show any weakness to his older brother as if reading his mind robert immediately deferred to his younger brothers authority on the timing of the mission now that there had been the complication of the havoc attack wait till nightfall no answered david adjusting his ammo pouch pack we go now you worried about that havoc yes maybe theyll send out a search party better we push off soon as the birds are covered aussie looked around at the mention of birds obviously thinking of making a crack but he didnt there was too much to do helping choir who with david and aussie would man the lead arrow the sub crew of four and the other three delta men would spread out in the other three arrows some weapons including a stinger a law antitank tube and aussies long sniper rifle had to be strapped to the fuselage before they left choir was checking the front of the arrow making sure the protective plastic barrel cap was tight enough to withstand the rapid vibration of the air cushion robert brentwood called the other three submariners over he would be driving one of the arrows rogers another remember well go in single file sd one leading sd two covering our rear literally a couple of men smiledtheyre the ones with experience in this kind of operation rogers sir youll be right behind their lead arrow ill be behind you remember single line formation for as long as we can hopefully the whole way but if anything goes wrong and were fired on from the flanks then we move to abreast position whose breast interjected aussie nearby the submariners ignored him robert reassured them your partll start on the sub they all knew he meant if they reached port baikal and could take a gst without being killed first but brentwood knew it wasnt time to kindle the doubt in everyones mind what are they going to do after asked rogers he meant what would happen to the sd team theyll come back to the choppers wait till darkness or a snowstorm whichever comes first and take off with the cobras and the stallion look dont worry once we get a sub well be the safest of all only rogers understood immediately the point being that once they were below the sub would be the same as any other of the three or four gsts they figured were operating in the lake itll be a lookalike masked ball robert brentwood joked all look the same nobodyll be able to see us anyway all done by sound remember fellas quiet it was aussie lewis and through the earringing silence of the forest they could hear the distant chopping sound of helicopters sure as hells not ours pronounced one of the cobra pilots get those arrows out of the open ordered aussie with everyone but aussie lewis lending a hand the four arrows were pushed back up the rollers into the stallion beneath the camouflage net aussie broke off into the cover of the forest whipping off the canvas cover from the haskins rifle and without flipping open the bipod rested the icecold twentythreepound weapon against a fir turning the scopes bullet impact screw withdrawing the bolt this being necessary before loading each ounce bullet whose combination incendiaryhehigh temperature superhardened penetrator head was capable of smashing through a plane engine or passing through an apc he waited either way lewis figured if the siberians spotted something and hovered over them even for a second hed cost them a pilot gunner or the whole mother as the three delta men called an enemy chopper the noise was louder now the rotor slap while not overhead was coming much closer he glimpsed rogers the submariner only about ten feet from him under one of the cobras nets eyes closed another prayer aussie preferred to trust in his kevlar bulletproof vest he saw movement choir williams kneeling beneath the camouflage net of the stallion ready with his squad automatic weapon and salvini one of the delta men his m resting on his knee right hand on the grip in port baikal the overtime midnighttoeight shift over nefskis subaltern came home to his small drab apartment block one of the largest buildings in the town taking off his greatcoat he kissed his wife her buryat face lined with the travail of being a garrison wife he told her that she looked tired kak vsegdalike always she replied surprised by the kiss hanging up his coat in their apartments tiny hallway he glanced at the laundry bag that hung from the knob on their bedroom door and announced generously that hed take it down the hallway to the communal laundry for her ill do it she said she always had rest he said rest she hadnt heard him tell her to rest in twentytwo years not even when their second child now a kgb border guard like his father had been born did he tell her to rest whenever he was off guard duty she was expected to be his servant the only thing hed do would be to take his boots off then it was you have the samovar going and always like this evening it was going except tonight there was no question about the samovar his royal highness had become comrade highness peeling one of the onions shed had in the line of glass jars she kept in the window to catch what winter sun she could tanyas eyes began to water and taking the kitchen rag from its rack by the old ageveined porcelain sink she wiped her eyes seeing the rag was ready for washing she took it out into the hallway ivan she called the moment he looked back at her from the front door he was a picture of guilt a thief running away with the laundry bag another peculiar thing hed changed into his best weekend trousers whats the matter with you she asked nothing cant a man offer to help his wife now and then he shot back defensively all the time we hear about siberian women complaining they are slaves you never get help well im giving you help woman in your sunday clothes ah i spilled coffee on them he said meaning his uniform it was a dim sickly thirtywatt bulb in the hallway but even so she could see he was blushing immediately she suspected another woman and grabbed the bag from him ah he uttered disgustedly snatching his greatcoat from the hallway and jerking open the door where are you going ivan where out it meant he was going to the port baikal hotel to get blind drunk tanya was convinced it was another woman now and when her heart beating in panic she inspected the trousers she found the evidence hed tried to sponge it off but the edge of the stain was stiff as if it had been starched she sat in the hallway for half an hour without moving but all that time a volcanic rage was welling within finally she made her way to the kitchen the soup nearly burnt dry where she took one of the onions from the jars laid it on the countertop and sat waiting for him the moment he came in she screamed and threw the jar aiming for his head he recoiled getting an arm up in time the jar hitting him below the left eye closing raining blows against him she told him shed never let him touch her again shouting that he was to get out and never come back she didnt care if he died in the snow touch you he shouted back drunkenly whod want to touch you you fat slob she threw another onion bottle at him the onions long shoot trailing like a taper but all her strength had gone in her rage and the jar missed hitting her anorak instead falling harmlessly to the floor rolling along the worn linoleum he stuck his head back inside to say that it was his apartment too she tried to throw the laundry bag at him but fell the kgb duty officer told him there was no way he could come in on his shift tomorrow afternoon looking like that he could lie and tell nefski hed fallen or something but nefski would never believe such a story and suspect hed been drunk and fighting again for which nefski would give him a punishment youd better stay here the duty officer told him take guard duty at the dock easy work but dont go taking a snooze ivan didnt like the idea of guard duty at thirty below in port baikal or anywhere else but in truth he rather relished having told his comrades just what had happened a man whose wife suspected him of seeing another woman well his reputation rose among the boys colonel nefskis back on duty later today warned the duty officer in case he visits the dock youd better have a good explanation ready tell him you were hit by an icicle or something it was a good story ivan having seen a number of soldiers who had been injured some of them seriously when a huge icicle having built up after successive snowstorms thawed a little and fell from a roofs eave like a club the pilot of the spets chopper that had been following the three flysize specks had now lost sight of his quarry they had disappeared somewhere in the taiga but the taiga was a sea of snowcovered forest clearings like those hed already flown over as numerous as troughs in a sea and all looking more or less the same he could spend weeks in a futile search turnback he asked the spets captain no go around to the end of the lake see if they came down there maintain radio silence in case they are enemy choppers tak tochnoyes sir answered the pilot taking the hind out over the edge of the forest the hind was now above the southern end of the mirrorfinish expanse of ice that was twentyfive miles wide and almost four hundred miles long david brentwood saw the blob of the spets chopper looking for them passing within a quarter mile and glanced at his watch the stallion pilot told him the hind would probably be doing around knots so estimated david they should be across the lake in fifteen to twenty minutes yeah do we still go across in daylight asked robert brentwood affirmative said david if they do report any possible enemy activity to irkutsk or port baikal men we might as well hit em sooner rather than later give them less time to prepare theres another consideration put in robert you dont load on your torpedoes and missiles at night if you can help it good thinking bob said aussie approvingly robert brentwood more surprised than offended by the australians easy familiarity with rank okay said david then we go now synchronize oh eight one zero hours now we leave at eightthirty he glanced across at aussie hope you and choir made sure that these jobs he indicated the four arrows are properly winterized yes sir said aussie with exaggerated bonhomie oil in those suckersd lubricate a desert whore one of the submariners asked aussie you ever think of anything but sex sure oh yeah what beer lordy what id give for a schooner of fosters right now freeze your guts out said choiri cant feel my toes then wriggle them sweetheart said one of the delta men you never have winter training what for asked aussie facetiously despite the fact that the sas winter training had been a top priority thats only for ski bums keep quiet said david from then on all they could hear was the soft moaning of the taiga as lonely a sound as any of them had ever heard for the next twenty minutes it was time for every soldier in the tenman team and the stallions and cobras crews who would stay behind to be with himself to go over what he had to do to meditate upon the need for speed and surprise david smelled the clean fragrance of winter pine that not even deep snow could suffocate and momentarily he thought of georgina of what she was doing at this very moment in england it would be in the evening a clump of snow fell from a branch jolting him back to the taiga he went over the satellite pics again noting that what looked like it could be a slipway was left of the town near one of the railway tunnels theyd had to build on the cliffs coming around the lakes southwestern end at they started the four arrows the rattling roar of the engines alarming christ said choir usually the quietest of the three sas men theyll hear us clear to the pole ah rats said aussie climbing into the front seat strapping himself in next to choirdont sweat it mate he patted the spets shoulder patch on the otherwise allwhite winter garb theyll just think its a few comrades coming across choir said something about aussie being the one whod been going on so much about the noise but it was lost to the roar of the four engines aussie and choir found it a squeeze although normally there was plenty of room for two they were both in bulky winter uniforms and while the case containing aussies sniper rifle was lashed to the fuselage aussie on david brentwoods order had to hold the stingers aa tube like a cylindrical map case between his legs eliciting an obscene comment from the delta man with the m light machine gun in the fourth and last arrow choir checked the first few exposed rounds of the fortymillimeter boxbelt ammo feed for the m heavy machine gun mounted on the front of the lead arrow each sixounce round both ends looking like round lollipops was in effect a sixounce grenade capable of piercing sixty millimeters of armor plate at three miles the rate of fire in cooler barrel arctic conditions being rather than rounds a minute though it could be either electrically or mechanically operated choir didnt like the beast the m for all its firepower had a bad habit of jamming every twentynine hundred rounds or so not to worry sport yelled aussie if you cant kill what you gotta kill in nine minutes choir you aint never gonna do it as they moved off throttles closed down to just above stall the heavy snow and trees absorbing the noise much more than they had anticipated they made their way cautiously through the trees and light underbrush to the lakes edge choir was still tugging the fortymillimeter belt worriedly dont worry mate aussie told him hopefully you wont have to use it right you mean bullshit laughed aussie right the lake hurt their eyes though overcast the glare was intense and within seconds every one of the ten men in the sd sub team had pulled down his sunglasses which again on freemans insistence were all soviet issue captured on the way to khabarovsk the spets chopper saw them following david brentwoods lead in the first arrow the drivers in the other three arrows behind opened up the throttles so wide their wrists ached the midpoint between the railway tunnel up left a hundred yards or so above the lakeshore and the towns small library and hotel a few hundred yards to the right sonarman rogers driving the second arrow with delta trooper oreilly swung left to avoid the exhaust from the first vehicle his arrow shuddering over small swollen ice ridges on the otherwise mirrorglasssmooth lake rogers glanced ahead for a second to get a quick bearing on the terrain someone yelled then someone else but it was too late they hit a ridgeonly a foot high the arrow upended skittering across the ice leaving at first a thin but then everwidening wake of frothing arterial blood in the third arrow the delta driver lou salvini caught a glance but despite what he saw he didnt hesitate and closed the gap the three of them now heading straight for port baikal the submariner in robert brentwoods arrow the man who would have to take over rogerss sonar job if they made it did all he could not to throw up when he spotted what looked like a sodden blackred mop rogerss head rolling obscenely across the ice a gray spaghettilike substance trailing it oreilly was still his neck broken david was waving to the hind coming to investigate its bug eyes growing by the second they were all waving the hind made a low pass and went into a left turn for another looksee smile you welsh bastard aussie yelled at choir above the roar of the arrow smile at the fucking comrades choir waved forcing a dour welsh grin into something more gregarious looking while flipping the safety off the m that he didnt like whats the bloody vertical on this he shouted at aussie his smile widening bout thirty degrees said david thats a lot of he waved at the comrades again as the chopper passed overhead port baikal now six miles away was clearly visible a mirage of it looming out on the ice far to their right they were bucking a head wind now flowing southward in advance of the forecasted blizzard over four hundred miles due north david brentwood glanced at his watch the speedometer needle quivering between fiftyfive and sixty the port baikal old dock was clearly visible but they wouldnt reach it for another seven to ten minutes the most important thing was to go straight to the railway tunnel that was two hundred yards to the left of the hotel and library aussie tried to get a bead on the tunnel and dock but the vibration against the stinger tube was giving him a headache he passed it to choir who had spotted the slipway a concave smooth but definitely gutterlike depression about ten to fifteen feet wide that led like a gradual slide from the mouth of the tunnel to the spread of icefree water by the dock where the angara river began its exit from the lake nefskis subordinate wasnt the first to see the approaching snow vehicles which he thought were some kind of snegovoy traktor snowmobilebut rather he was the one the guard called over wondering what they were ivan went to the big stand holding schneider x power binoculars by the tunnels entrance morosely pulled the canvas cover up and bent forward to adjust the focus a blur of dots snapped into sharp relief against the ice ours i guess he said disinterestedly without taking a second look still nursing the bitter fight hed had with his wife and generally feeling pretty sorry for himself havent seen snowmobiles like that before though then again he told the other guard they certainly made as much racket it wasnt until another three minutes had passed that his mind off his wife for a moment he told his comrade grumpily better tell the duty officer whos on nefski shit you tell im i dont want him to see this he pointed to his black eye bastardll put the on punishment the other man slung his rifle and walked over the hardcrusted snow his breath going before him like steam as he made his way toward nefskis office in the old library colonel sir there looks like a patrol coming in nefski was alarmed despite the fact that they were hundreds of miles from the most forward troops of the us second army he was immediately suspicious he didnt know of any patrols supposed to be coming in call out the squad yes sir said the guard walking outside to start the siren begi run ordered nefski there are two subs in you idiot before the klaxon began its long wail nefski had grabbed the phone from its cradle and was pushing the red button for the dock how long till you leave were almost ready now colonel be about another get them into the water now move shouted nefski but sir some of the men are over in the hotel i dont care we dont have the time get the winches moving ill call the ho the library wall was disappearing in front of his eyes fortymillimeter grenades ripping tearing it open like a pulltab on a beer carton debris flying everywhere bogomater mother of god he fell to the floor the phone banging beside him its bakelite cracked beyond repair his nose bleeding luckily through the dangling earpiece he could hear the phone in the hotel ringing three times hotel colonel nefski tell all the submariners to get back to the tunnel immediately you understand whats going on tell them he screamed the next moment the line was hissing like a samovar in the tunnel a skeleton crew of four men worked like navvies at the winches that would let down one of the fiftyfootlong by fifteenfootwide toroidal subs its eight antilakeaccess torpedoes looking for all the world like stovepipes attached to its superstructure the bulges of the four cruise missiles wider but shorter on the outer casing the first sub was a quarter of the way down the hundredyard ice slipway retractable wing vanes extended from either side of the black eggshaped sub like the outriggers of a canoe to stop the midget from rolling before it reached the water the four siberians working the winch not realizing that it wasnt the sub that was under fire but rather the library and hotel frantically redoubled their efforts a line of twenty to thirty kgb border guards racing toward the slipway behind them came the squeak of a tank heading down from its defilade position on the steep forested slope along the narrow road leading westward from the town there were screams of men hit one flung backward like a rag doll under the impact of the fortymillimeter while at the far end of the tunnel the twoman goryonov millimeter machinegun crew were dead one slumped over the gun the other his face missing flung back over the sandbags by the rail tracks that had carried the midget submarines the last few miles to the slipway there was more screaming now mixed with a sound like wasps swarming as the three arrows surged up the incline from the lake stopping about twenty yards abreast close to a heavy ice bank that formed the eastern wall of the slipway the line of border guards fifty yards ahead across the slipway and now slightly above them poured fire in their general direction david brentwood hard up against the ice wall smacked choirs shoulder hard so that hed feel it through the kevlar vest get the m off the arrow and on its bipod aussie three oclock high aussie lewis looked up squinting despite the shades and saw the twin bubble nose of the hind rising from behind the hotel into the sun its pilot now realizing it had been an enemy force theyd seen on the lake the chopper relying on the glare to blind its opponents was in aussies line of sight for only three seconds the time it took him to fire the stinger from two hundred yards which was virtually pointblank range the explosion was crimson spilling fiery fuel down around the hotel some of the gasoline sweeping across four or five of its defenders sending them screaming rolling into the trench behind the border guards ice wall distracting their comrades and kicking up so much ice and snow in their efforts to douse themselves that two of the three delta men had no difficulty lobbing six grenades in as many seconds the grenades flashes lost in the sunlight but going off deep in the trench killing at least another three defenders the sub passing down the slipway between them and the defenders was nearing the water stop those bastards yelled aussie swinging the stinger to his left at the men working the winch and executing his own command before any of the other sd men needed to two of the winchmen simply disappeared under the rockets impact what was left of them splattered over the remaining submarine aussie reloaded got a bead on the second sub in the tunnel and heard robert brentwood shouting no lets be sure of the first one before we roger said aussie and turning right fired the stinger round into the hotel a hundred yards front right just to keep things moving the next instant he heard a thwack and one of the delta men a moment before spreadeagled atop the ice wall for a better shot was tumbling backward grabbing at his throat but there was no hope the jugular severed he was spurting blood in jets tumbling into the slipway sliding all the way down smashing into the midget subs keel but by now the defenders thoroughly demoralized were retreating to the library as david brentwood attaching three bread rollsballs of plastique on the cable leading from the winch to the sub pushed in a pencilsize detonator and flicked the fuse selector to three minutes off you go he told robert and without a look backward robert brentwood and the two remaining submariners slithered down the guttershaped slipway using their boots to brake themselves against the keel one of them already with a hand on the right side vane to haul himself up to the sixfoot oildrumshaped conning tower not yet robert brentwood ordered the seaman not till the charge goes get forward of midships otherwise when that cable blows itll it blew the sudden release of tension recoiling one half of the wire back to the winch making a high singing noise the other half whipping toward the sub but catching lawson one of the delta men and almost severing his right foot for a second or so he felt absolutely no pain only astonishment realizing that in breaking the impact of the wire hed saved the life of one of the two submariners with robert brentwood the cable smacked the keel flopping to the icy slipway and finally lying still like a dead snake the sub was now afloat with robert brentwood and the two submariners already down the conning tower the powerful whiff of sweat assaulted brentwoods nose and for a split second he thought one of the winchmen was hiding in the sub but there was no one the sub simply not having had enough time to be aerated by the cold pine smell of the taiga by now choir and the remaining delta man salvini had the m on its stand and were pouring a terrible fire into the library and hotel aussie rested the stinger tube across the arrows cockpit for a good shot at the second sub there was a swoosh of back blast from the stinger a crimson explosion in the tunnel and a ringing of scrap metal that gst was gone once inside the midget submarine it was easier than robert brentwood and his two crewmen thought it would be they didnt need to know anything about the cyrillic alphabet the dials selfexplanatory to any submariner the three men moved automatically to the stations theyd have to operate as a skeleton crew for them the sensation was very much like moving from a fully automatic automobile to a vw beetle with standard shift it was all more or less clear at a glance the only real difference being the pipes that went round and round the toroidal hull which allowed for the storage of recycled gaseous oxygen for them to breathe it also ran the gsts closedcircuit diesel engine the immediate concern was to submerge as quickly as possible hatch closed said johnson one of the two remaining submariners the other man lopez stood by the diesel motor control and steerage levers that would allow him to work the relatively primitive yet effective horizontal hydroplanes that would govern their up and down angles and the vertical rudder half above half below the horizontal plane to control the yaw or leftright movement very well brentwood responded to johnson turning to lopez he ordered stand by to discharge stand by to discharge sir brentwood switched on the small sonar screen by the narrow twin day and nighttime periscopes column no bigger than six inches in diameter and checked there was no obstruction ahead or below registered by the passive radar sensors that were built into the gsts hull dive dive dive open all vents he commanded opening all vents aye sir responded johnson and they could hear the water rushing and gurgling in its noise transmitted through the pressure hull lopez immediately put her nose into a sharp dive brentwood wrapping an arm around the scope column as the gst went down on a twentydegree incline twenty feet thirty feet forty feet announced johnson unhurriedly rhythmically multiplying the readout in meters by three already getting the feel of her level at one hundred ordered brentwood level at one hundred aye sir forty feet fortyfive they could hear the icy growl above them as huge plates shifted the slight movement was unnoticeable to the naked eye but it was in part a response to the enormous struggle the pulling apart of tectonic plates far below the fivethousandfoot lake which caused fissures that accounted for the temperature inversions throughout the lake and gave rise often to the fast warm upstreaming currents that created thin ice here and there seventy feet eighty feet stand by to declutch stand by to began lopez declutch ordered brentwood and within three seconds lopez had levelled the tiny sub though it was rocking slightly and disengaged the generating power from the diesel that had been charging up the batteries shifting the power to propulsion charge all three of them were surprised by the lack of any forward sensation other than levelling out it was an extraordinarily quiet vessel steer one one two ordered brentwood one one two sir half ahead ordered brentwood half ahead sir within five seconds they were running at eight knots brentwood for the first time in the mission relaxed slightly nodding his head in admiration at the other two his mood taken up by johnson who watching the pressure gauges announced that old italian santi designed it good eh captain the siberians built it said brentwood but youre right we have us a good craft gentlemen even so fraid its going to be hard going with only three of us at the most only one of us can catch a nap now and then no sweat sir answered johnson lopez gave a diplomatic smile how deeps this lake again sir asked johnson goes to six thousand answered brentwood eight thousand square miles of ice above us gentlemen eight thousand square miles of mud accumulated silt beneath us they could hear a popping and then a crackling sound the battle not abating still going on at dockside the noises of the odd grenade or round striking the icefree entrance the outflow of the angara river sped through the frigid water at over four times the speed they would in the air sir it was johnson up forward what is it ive just noticed theres a second hatch here we were in such a hurry getting down i just automatically thats all right said brentwood but he was puzzled even as he told johnson to secure the second hatch before it closed however he spied a small pressure gauge the size of an alarm clock on the side of the fivefootwide sixfoothigh conning tower and realized it was an airlock that could be flooded and pumped out if need be well good old santi said johnson escape hatch and all eh skipper yes said brentwood about to bring up the painfully obvious fact that in his opinion at least building an escape hatch taking up extra space in the alreadycrowded midget had been a waste of good material if a torpedo hit the midget submarine anywhere he doubted thered be enough time for anyone to make the airlock besides which it would take awhile once the bottom hatch was secured to bleed in water through the top hatch allowing the escaping submariner to pop out and close the hatch so that it could then be pumped empty for the next man providing you had at least one of the three pumps working after a torpedo attack by that time the sub would be below its crush depth of around two thousand feet the slightest hairline fracture then would create an aerosol inside the sub coming in at over a thousand pounds per square inch such a force imploding the sub flatter than a sumo wrestler sitting on a paper cup the passive sonar sensors were operating at full strength their nine green lights on without a flicker it was the first moment of silence that theyd had in the mission johnson only now had time to look around for the toilet after the sheer fright of the firelight on the shore he felt like his bladder was going to burst wheres the head right under me said lopez pointing to the waste chamber they thought of everything captain guy on steerage doesnt have to go far to take a leak no one has far to go in here said johnson looking about the instrumentcluttered sub so jampacked with equipment that it was virtually impossible for two men to pass at once there were only two sixfootlong twofootwide folddown plank bunks whose mattresses were made up of two spreadout scuba arctic escape diving suits the two scuba helmets and relatively small champagnebottlesize oxygen tanks fixed to the bulkhead only four inches from the nose of whoever used the top bunk for a nap everything in this damn things so small complained johnson looking at the small tanks well dont worry said brentwood hopefully we wont have to use them the temperature in the sub was sixty degrees fahrenheit but with each man wearing four layers of winterbattle uniform it felt like a sauna bath brentwood set the lead by stripping down to his long johns the problem was where to stow even the tightly rolled sleepingbagsize bundles of uniform lopez sat on one and they juryrigged the other two forward and aft of the scope column brentwood inspecting the lashings to make sure there was no possibility that the sixinchdiameter day scope or smaller threeinch night scope would have any chance of being snagged the first thing they found out was that while the heat exchange and scrubbing system above the gst took good care of the oxygen it did what johnson called sweet fa for human sweat he only hoped it would deal better with the human waste tank under lopez they couldnt risk venting it for fear the sound might give their position away as they began their search for the three other submarines whose four cruise missile salvos had brought freemans second army to a standstill one of the nine thimblesize sonar sensor lights was blinking amber and on the screen they could see a little dancing as rogers would have called it johnson turned up the magnification giving brentwood the scale but even on maximum enlarge the dancing was too small to signify any threat and brentwood guessed they were getting tiny flits of sound from the gobmianka fishthat were indigenous to the lake and whose eyes taking up a third of their nineinch body could give off a signal each female gave birth to around seventeen hundred small ones each fall and their schools were capable of giving off a boatsize echo the dancing had disappeared wonder how the boys are doin up there asked johnson hope theyre out by now said lopez i sure as hell wouldnt he stopped in deference to robert brentwood brentwood looked at his watch if they can get back in the taiga around there around port baikal and wait it out till dark which should be around three pm at this latitude theyll have a good chance i think yeah said lopez nodding in agreement but it was more wishful thinking than conviction theyll be fine said johnson yeah it was a small thing robert brentwood hardly ever saying yeah but in the close confines of the midget submarine such informality came much more naturally and was almost necessary in his view if they were to work well as a team one of us should take an hours nap at a time he told johnson and lopez so that on the sonar screen there was a large blip that had appeared very suddenly the magnification showing that it was moving at over thirty knots it was heading straight for the gst bearing asked brentwood zero three three sir answered johnson it was on their left quarter range added johnson three thousand yards and closing lopez was tense at the steerage position keeping an eye on the sonar screen which he couldnt see clearly for brentwood speed announced johnson we got jesus thirtytwo knots robert brentwood glanced at the knot meter the gst had a maximum of only sixteen knots submerged it couldnt be one of the three gsts had to be a torpedo the sonar lights were blinking red two thousand yards and closing time to impact johnson began bring the ship to zero zero niner ordered brentwood adding firing point procedures master zero one four tube one firing point procedures master one four tube one came johnsons confirmation immediately followed by solution ready sir weapon ready ship ready there was no panic this was their line of country brentwood watched the bearing corrected the heading and announced final bearing and shoot master one five chapter twentysix the t squeaking its way noisily on the narrow road that crossed the tracks leading to the dock couldnt see the americans firing from beneath the high ice bank that led up sharply from the shoreline one second there was a burst of submachine gun fire far left at the tank then at ten yards farther right the tank gunner saw the fiery tongue of the heavy american m machine gun it was the m that the t driver took a precise bead on meters just over two hundred yards away but the next moment the tanks laser sight was knocked out by a burst of the bulletgrenades from the american m the t emitted a cantankerous bearlike growl its turret slewing as it backed up a few feet for a better defilade position lowering its bulk for a slighter silhouette the laser sighting gone but at two hundred yards the siberians in the tank manning the millimeter and millimeter machine guns and the main millimeter cannon knew that if they couldnt knock out the american weapon they ought to be sent back to novosibirsk gunnery school the tank belched the shells explosion throwing earthrooted ice blocks high into the air creating a wide jagged ushaped gap in the ice wall but aussie choir and david brentwood knowing what would happen the moment the ts turret had stopped and hearing the whine of the barrel depressing had abandoned the heavy m machine gun they had rejoined salvini who was fighting by the three parked arrows the latters noses hidden by the ice bank the other wounded delta commando lawson had dragged himself into the cockpit of one of the arrows where salvini was now hurriedly giving him a second shot of morphine not realizing aussie had already given him one a few seconds after the wire had sliced into his ankle lawsons leg elevated to help staunch the bleeding was now sticking out of the arrows open cockpit the plastic bubble having been detached to accommodate him the leg looking like a short log with the four layers of thermal clothing and the ankle now swollen to three times its size as they looked down at the gap in the ice wall the five remaining members of the sasdelta team saw that the m and the arrow it had been mounted on were no more the crash of a millimeter shell from the t was still smoking and remnants of the m were still skittering across the ice near the frozen lakes edge the arrow was completely gone except for its skirting which was wobbling across the ice like a drunken punctured tire from some enormous bicycle by now salvini had lined up his law light antitank launcher and fired it the round hitting the tanks sloped composite armor a glancing blow nevertheless the relatively slowvelocity heat round did damage its molten jet of whitehot steel squirting a tadpoleshape inside the tank they could hear one of the siberians screaming inside saw the slewing turret suddenly stop and waited for the explosions from the rounds stored by the gunner even as they kept the remainder of the port baikal kgb border troops from raising their heads or taking too much comfort from the arrival of the t salvini was loading another law round as david ordered the withdrawal sure now that the midget sub under his brothers command must be well and truly away under the protection of the thick ice choir you drive the first arrow with lawson aboard we cant get anyone in next to him with that leg of his aussie you and salvini in the second arrow with me ill they ducked the whistle of mortars going overhead crashing on the lake splinters of ice shrapnel raining down on their helmets a shard slicing through three layers of aussies winter uniform barely missing his carotid artery ill drive continued david you ride shotgun he told salvini aussie bring the stinger yes maam shouted salvini he fired off another law round this time it hit the glacis plate in front of the driver penetrating the armor at first there was only a short jet of flame from the hole but then with david yelling for salvini to run david already in the cockpit starting the arrow the tank resounded with a cacophony of smallarms fire its machine gun ammunition exploding like firecrackers this time they heard murderous screams from the tank crew and saw the cupola flung open a cloud of thick white smoke issuing forth as a gunner trying to escape was engulfed in flame the bulging earpieces of his sovietstyle leather tank helmet melting even as he struggled to get free david fired a long burst from his hk submachine gun the man was flung back david dropped the hk into the arrows cockpit beside him his shoulder bruised and aching from the punishing recoil of the gun having been on full automatic but it kept the siberians heads down aussie scrambled into the front of davids arrow as choir heading for the second arrow tossed his last two grenades toward the siberian trench give em a goodbye shot david called to salvini who having dumped the m light machine gun into the arrow snatched up the law and fired a round at the siberian trench it hit the far side of the trench but in doing so threw up a thunderous exploding wall of powder snow and ice over the entire trench the americans used the curtain of falling debris to head for the lake the two arrows hitting fortyfive miles an hour as they reached its shore one skidded slightly before righting itself in their race away from port baikal the two vehicles already executing a medley of zigzags two hundred yards apart the crack of smallarms fire and hastily ranged mortars chipping and denting the ice behind them the torpedo robert brentwood had fired had hit nothing running its twomile maximum range then losing speed sinking disappearing into the black abyss of the lake renowned for its clarity the lake gave up all light after a hundred meters or so the torpedo soon gained momentum under the accumulating psi the pressure on it soon so great that it was speeding aided by its streamlined shape deeper and deeper imploding at four thousand meters it was still heading for the bottom at over eighty miles an hour to be lost forever somewhere in the five thousand feet of accumulated silt robert brentwood had made a mistake one that might be excused by others as an error made under stress but a mistake nevertheless in firing at what he now believed must have been some kind of fish or mammal it would have to be a seal given its speed its curiosity aroused and coming straight for the gst like an enemy torpedo damn itll mean our torpedos launch will have shown up on the other three gsts sonar yeah said johnson but sir theres been no voice communication in the sound channel we wouldve seen that on sonar at least theyre not contacting one another whether they heard it or not besides theyd have to go to the surface to trail an aerial for all they know it could have been an ice charge pack you know one of the charges we figure they must be using to expand the thin ice patches before they launch the missiles so asked lopez theyll still know where we are no way their sonar couldve missed picking up our launch robert brentwood now had hold of a new possibility born of johnsons suggestion could have been an ice charge i suppose he said trying to think like the other captains aboard the three enemy gsts anyway theres no reason to think it was aimed at them i mean seeing theres been no voice communication they probably dont know were in the lake at least not yet well soon find out said johnson pointing to the sonar scope a blip larger than the one that had been made by what robert brentwood was sure must have been a seal was snowing up five thousand yards off just over two miles away might be coming to see if we need help said robert brentwoodfiring point procedures but even as he gave the order he knew that should he fire this second torpedo and it hit the oncoming sub the other two probably much farther away in the northern sector of the lake would pick up the explosions on their sonar unless they were so far away that their sonar mikes were being blanketed by ice growl what worried him was the possibility that port baikal might have gotten the message out on its radio about a sub being taken in fact port baikal even had it not been totally preoccupied with its selfdefense had been incapable of sending out any radio messages the microwave dish on the top of the twostory library having shattered crashing to the ground following one of aussies stinger rounds the demolition had so alarmed nefski that afraid he might lose his prisoners before he had a chance to interrogate them hed ordered them removed quickly from the library across to the hotel however in the murderous fire that the americans were pouring toward the library and hotel as well as at the kgb border troop defenders several guards and prisoners had been hit some like alexsandra malof were not injured at all as prisoners and several guards broke and ran toward the woods to avoid the commandos fire shouting through the linoleumripping sound of machinegun fire the crash of grenades and the crack of halfadozen different kinds of small arms the pilot of a hind that had been parked behind the hotel out of view of the sd team was now shouting at nefski asking that he be allowed to take off immediately to alert irkutsk hq from where just possibly some ad hoc underwater communication link might be rigged somewhere along the western shore of baikal seeing that port baikals communications had literally been shot to pieces maybe they can get the message to the subs trailing aerials the pilot could see nefski didnt have a clue what he meant the subs trail vlf very low frequency aerials its one way to stop them nefski screamed pointing out at the ice his finger trembling in the direction of the escaping commandos stop them you fool before they reach the other side of the lake its them or irkutsk pressed the pilot resolutely impatient with nefskis vengeful streak i cant do both colonel yes you can nefski shouted back itll only take you a few minutes to get them then go to irkutsk for all i care get them and then break radio silence raged nefski so what if you draw us fighters to you through our aa screen their awacsll jam my message said the pilot angrily seeing nefski wouldnt give way come on then the pilot shouted to one of the ground crew members havent you finished there you are sir said the ground crew foreman hastily extracting the hose and snapping the armored lid shut on the selfseal tank its full about time lifting off he was only fifteen feet above the ground behind the kgb troop trench at least eleven kgb were dead or wounded one sitting difficult to tell whether he was actually dead or merely stunned from the concussion not moving as the hind passed over him nosing higher the pilot could now clearly see the two white triangles twelve to fourteen miles away heading for the other side of the lake nine miles beyond them ota wnmtsytheyre crafty he told his weapons officer below seeing that the two arrows the bruised sky of the approaching blizzard racing southward had separated well abreast of one another there was at least a mile between them virtually making an attack on both at precisely the same time an impossibility well we wont play cat and mouse oleg the pilot told his weapons officer weve got lots of time well take them one by one on the ice aussie saw a fine foglike vapor streaming behind them but since the temperature was well below freezing he knew it couldnt be fog then he got a whiff of it hell were leaking fuel i know shouted david his eyebrows and the edges of his sunglasses caked in ice whatre our chances of the arrow reaching the other side called out aussie his voice quickly whipped away in the slipstream bout fiftyfifty said david ill try to take her on as straight a line as i can use less there was a flapping noise then the vapor became a cloud the engine coughing for chrissakes yelled salvini gimme a break the arrows speedometer needle quavered between fifty and fortyfive then fell to twenty ten then the arrow conked out only the air cushion sustaining it the arrow slid a hundred yards farther with a snuffling noise under the residual momentum of the nowdead fan as they came to a stop david brentwood aussie and salvini saw choirs arrow with the wounded lawson aboard slowly pulling away from them off to their far left whether or not choir or the delta commando looked back they couldnt tell but it didnt matter for there was only one rule in this situation and that was that choir had to keep going he couldnt break radio silence to call for help either from the cobras or the stallion who as wain had pointed out before the mission wouldnt take off before nightfall blizzard might help us said david as he saw the purplishblack sky gathering power and moving rapidly southward toward them as they alighted from the arrow salvini out of habit took out his footlong sawedged ranger knife and did a proper job on the fuel tank so the gasoline could be dispersed away from them by the wind whipping up in front of the blizzard i dunno said aussie breathing hard on his gloved fingers swearing at the frozen zipper of the haskins case breathing on it then quickly extracting the rifle and flicking out its bipod legs hes gonna get one pass over us at least he moved left of the arrow salvini using the vehicle as a rest for the m light machine gun which he swivelled so that the arrow would give him as much protection as possible david had already moved out to the right south of the arrow but turned west now in the direction of the oncoming blip of the hind the stinger in hand his hk submachine gun slung across his shoulder he prayed for a hover shot if he got it it would be the fourth of july the chopper however didnt come at them at all nose down skimming the ice like an unstoppable bird of prey it was heading instead toward the other arrow farther on smart fucker aussie called out across the icehes leaving us for friggin seconds david had a bead on the chopper anticipating the track moving the stingers barrel with the missile he fired missing the chopper by a good one hundred yards the round landing farther up the lake with the sound of a brown paper bag exploding the sudden boomp registered on the sonar screens of robert brentwoods gst and the three other submarines two in the far north one closing in to investigate the first sonar blip caused by robert brentwood firing at the seal minutes earlier the sub now closed on brentwoods gst its skipper assuming that the second chrysanthemum pattern on his screencoming from close to the surface might mean that some american armored force had reached the eastern shore of the lake alarmed by such a possibility but unable to find out without going to the surface for a thin ice hole after which hed have to trail the long vlf aerial the captain warned the other gsts by reverting to one of the oldest methods of communication in the world tapping out a morse message through the hull the sound racing through the sound channel thank you thank you thank you johnson said in celebration the message itself unintelligible but the sine waves of the message and its source clearly identified on the sonar screen when the other two subs answered johnson transferred the sonar blips onto the superimposed e onc operation navigation chart two were in the northern section of the lake in the southwestern corner of the navigation charts grid one of the subs at latitude degrees minutes north longitude degrees minutes west the other twenty miles farther north but there was still a serious problem for brentwood while he now knew the exact position of the two northern subs as well as the one heading for him the information narrowing his search area by over percent he knew that if he fired the torpedo at the oncoming gst the two northern subs could break out of their quadrant on battery power silent running and come looking for him then it was pure mathematics one would fire and in order to protect himself he would have to fire back and the second would immediately have the vector its torpedo getting him in the cross fire johnson yes captain were not going to fire the fish we arent sir said johnson looking painfully confused no we wait how far away is our snoop ten minutes choir waited till he saw the hind spitting orange then he turned hard right and hard right again and applied the brakes a mistake the arrow spun uncontrollably on the skatingrink surface of the ice so fast that it threatened to throw the wounded lawson out of the cockpit had it not been for the fact that he was strapped in but it did throw the choppers aim off as the hind swept low a twin path of machinegun bullets chopping up the ice to choirs left the chopper went into a sharp climb banking hard left in a tight turn to come back at choir it was only in semihover for two seconds but it gave aussie the time he needed the chopper centered perfectly in the haskins tenpower scope its belly filling the cross hairs as aussie squeezed off the armorpiercing heincendiary bullet toward the hind over a mile away the noise of the sniper rifle was a there pop in choirs ear as he pulled the throttle wide open again heading for the tree line growing bigger by the second the haskins could hit a tengallon drum at over a mile with the tenpower scope but the hind was a much bigger target the heincendiary tore into the choppers starboard gas tank like a poker through foil the explosion barely visible to any of the sasdelta crew the first squall of the blizzard had enveloped the southern end of the lake completely swallowing choirs arrow and with the downed hind any hope of irkutsk finding out about the americancrewed sub in the lake once in the cover of the taiga choir immediately reduced speed even so he almost wiped out the arrow against a snowcovered stump driving more slowly now the noise much decreased absorbed by the snowthick forest he stopped the engine and listened for the other arrow there was no sound but the mounting fury of the blizzard this was where choir knew their sasdelta training paid off a regular soldiers forced march merely a morning run for them choir took off his sunglasses and looked at his compass six miles to the choppers he said how you holdin up boyo lawson didnt answer hey said choir you all right there was still no answer choir unbuckled leaned forward over the drivers column and felt for the delta mans carotid artery it was beating slowly but steadily lawson had a babylike expression on his face you bastard said the normally polite choir with aussies second morphine shot in him lawson had been blissfully out of it all the way across the ice it didnt take him long but by the time robert brentwood got into the scuba suit that was the folddown bunks mattress his face was glistening with perspiration and the approaching blip of the other sub was much larger on the screen now being only nine hundred yards a half mile away brentwood spat into the scuba helmets face mask rubbing the spittle around on it so as to prevent condensation nice shooting david told aussie watching the faint glimmer of the hinds debris burning as he helped salvini lift the m from the arrows nose thanks mate aussie told david wasnt a bad shot at that now all we have to do is walk to the choppers what dyou say asked salvini must be eleven to twelve miles nearer eleven said aussie as the crow flies everybody up to it no worries mate said salvini borrowing the aussies accent sat a fact mate a dozen fosters youre the first to beg beg for tiffin is she any good tea break responded aussie tiffins a tea break fuck a duck dont you yanks know anything aussie zipped up the haskins case and gave his boot to the stingers sight rendering it virtually useless they could carry only so much hey said salvini youre travelin light this m weighs a ton man plus ive got the two oh three he added slapping the grenadelauncher barrel on his personnel m oh tell the about it salvini said aussie shouldering the sniper rifle case knock it off you two said david brentwood were not into the woods yet and weve got shush it was aussie you hear that all brentwood and salvini could hear was the blizzard its cold dropping the temperature another ten degrees to minus forty turning their perspiration to ice a major danger even to the arctictrained commandos you had to keep moving cool off gradually otherwise the perspiration could encase you despite the layers in a sheath of ice hypothermia could set in without you knowing it youd start to feel peculiarly warm slow and comfortable the agony of frost nip passing through frostbite and then to nothingness cant be anything said david to aussies inquiry though he was conscious his ears were still ringing from the battle a motor proffered salvini still hearing only the blizzard nah said aussie s gone now they started off aussie pulling back his parkas velcro mouth guard then ripping the wrapper from a hershey bar as far as he was concerned it was the only good part of the rations thought i heard a dog sure you didnt fart asked salvini oh very droll very fucking shut up ordered david save your energy they had a minimum of eleven miles with heavy pack they should make it in less than two hours providing they kept a strict eastnortheast heading david slipped the compass string about his neck not standard marching procedure but he didnt want to veer off the degree heading by even a few yards he would need to glance at the compass often without having to dig into his pockets letting in the frigid air as robert brentwood sat in the pitch darkness of the fivefootdiameter sixfoothigh escape hatch the luminescent glow of the pressure gauge became visible only when the escape chamber was already half full of water the surge was less violent now than the initial rush of water but he was still uncomfortable compared to his last semiannual submarine survival update course in the norfolk virginia water tank the claustrophobia he was suffering now was markedly more severe he hadnt suffered from it when he first joined the navy it had crept up on him over the years the fear kept at bay in the much larger nuclear subs but even there it had become exacerbated after he had lost the uss roosevelt off iceland now six hundred feet below the twotofourfeetthick ice roof the sense of claustrophobia was pressing in on him the temperature of the water swirling about his neck was only two degrees or so above freezing shocking his system until the microslim water layer between the arctic scuba suit and his skin could steady the heat exchange ratio his bodys thermostat adjusted as he kept clenching and unclenching his fingers in the tight yet spongy rubber gloves he told himself forced himself to be calm feeling only an inch or so away from sheer terror as the water level reached the base of the scuba helmet and began creeping up covering the visor he counted slowly as he had habitually done during the yearly prostate examination the naval doctor impatiently ordering otherwise imperturbably calm officers not to stiffen up relax the sphincter man relax damn it then the gauge as well as the cessation of the rushing water told him he could now open the top hatch the moment hed done so he felt his body rising effortlessly the flippers grazing the hatch edge his breathing still too fast the visor despite the spittle precaution suddenly misting at the shock of seeing the other gst only sixty feet away while stilled in neutral buoyancy its bow had a slight up angle its fat teardrop shape outlined in the blackness by beads of phosphorescent freshwater plankton first cousins of the kind that gave sea waves their luminescence even on the darkest night unhesitatingly looping the basket hed made from his tshirt under the knife scabbard so as to prevent its sinking should he be buffeted by an upwelling he swam arms by his side straight for the gst struck by the irony that though he would show up on the enemys sonar as a very discernible blip his shape like the seal hed fired upon they would be as confused as he had been it was only then that he saw what could only be a raft its outline for some inexplicable reason only partially delineated here and there by phytoplankton it looked to be about thirty feet square half as long as the gst itself its neutral buoyancy assured by what must obviously be depthsensitive floats exhilarated by the discovery of how it was that the midget subs were in effect hauling their own torpedo and cruise missile resupply the raft probably holding eight missiles at least two salvos worth in addition to the four already on the gst it took him only a minute to swim to the raft about to place a lump of c plastique from the tshirt basket he felt a u shackle about fiveeighths inch in diameter he guessed connecting the cables between the enemy gst and its raft using the handle spike on the end of his knife he unscrewed it and immediately felt the raft moving away from him now it could not act as a flotation platform for the gst next brentwood turned his attention to the gst within ten feet of the sub he noticed the curved phosphorescent outline of the gst break as if a string of pearls had been cut most of the microscopic creatures disappearing as quickly as they must have alighted on the midget submarine without their guiding light he slowed not wanting to bump into the hull but rather stand off it feeling the long horizontal stovepipe shape of one of the cruise missiles he looped the tshirt basket about its twentyoneinchdiameter mouth tying the basket tightly next he pushed the baskets goodies as johnson had referred to the centrex plastique hard between the mouth of the cruise and the algaeslicked metal of the vweld that connected the cruise tube to the pressure hull making sure purely by feel that the sixinchlong detonator was firmly embedded in the plastique he turned the timer knob sharply counterclockwise feeling the soft click glancing back he saw his own sub clearly outlined by the phosphorescent phytoplankton he turned and kicking hard started back to the sub then felt a vibration behind him to his right he turned to see a spume of luminescent bubbles erupting behind him from the hatch of the enemy gst the trail of bubbles then abruptly changed from the vertical to the horizontal as the attacker his knife trailing a secondary stream of bubbles came straight at him it was all confusion but instinctively brentwoods left arm shot for the thinner trail to grab the knife arm somehow he missed and felt a warm sensation deep in his left shoulder where the blade had sliced open his scuba suit cutting him deeply quickly he thrust his left hand forward again felt something solid and drove his knife forward feeling it go into something soft then hard the blade rebounding on bone he gripped his knifes handle harder ripping hard left opening the attackers stomach brentwood felt himself being dragged down the attackers body limp jerking spasmodically now and then the grasp on brentwoods left arm was like steel with nine minutes left on the tenminute detonator his minds eye filled with a vision of being pulled down into the countless layers of diarrheaike mud he pulled his knife back and thrust forward again but there was no need as suddenly as it had taken hold the siberians grip relaxed the life drained out of him breaststroking and kicking with all his might brentwood made his way back to his gsts hatch and three minutes later was inside the escape chamber rapping the top of the bottom hatch with his right hand as he began turning the wheel of the top hatch with his left but now his left hand cramped as he squatted there his body crouched monkeylike he switched to the right hand to close the top hatch his left arm simply refusing to obey his brain the nerves of the shoulder numb he heard and felt the quiet whirr of the gsts battery going for burst speed of seventeen knots which in the next five minutes would have them just over a mile and a half away brentwood had to stay cramped in the waterfilled cubbyhole of the conning tower as any siphoning of power from the battery to pump out the water would be power taken from the prop he would have to wait until johnson figured they were far enough away from the impending explosion before he could start the pump to vent the water in the escape hatch in severe pain now brentwood remained crouched sincerely hoping that neither lopez nor johnson would accidentally bump the up scope switch as the gst slowed and the venting of the escape chamber began the water level dropped rapidly and brentwood almost drowned knocked unconscious for a moment his head lolling dangerously as the midget sub itself trembled violently from he shock wave of the detonation over a mile away the explosion as brentwood hoped it would had set off a cruise warhead on the enemy sub the resulting varoomph heard for miles sending an enormous spume of ice shards skyward above the broken surface of the lake as well as shattering the siberian gst into thousands of pieces the noise reaching brentwoods gst two seconds later it stunned the three men lopez though hed plugged his ears was unable to hear johnsons order for him to disengage battery power and go to diesel heading at knots for the northern quadrant a hundred and ninety miles away their eta depending on the currents and the time taken to intercept the loose raft the latter clearly visible on the sonar screen having deflected some of the explosions sound waves why do we need it sir asked johnson who believed correctly that now his skipper was wounded he johnson would have to be the one to go out through the hole and attach the raft to them we can reload our empty torpedo tubes explained brentwood his voice heavy slow still groggy from his ordeal now and men grimacing from lopezs inexpert dressing of his wound easy enough to do with two of you continued brentwood lopez looked alarmed subsurface float buoys added brentwood on the raft just push her over to our sub and shackle her to the ring bolt at one point brentwood almost passed out from the pain and only then albeit reluctantly agreed to lie down on the lower bunk you think the other two gsts up northll still be there asked johnson no reason why they shouldnt be answered brentwood all theyve seen is an explosion on their sonar screen he explained theyll figure one of their gsts has fallen victim to a malfunction internally caused explosion therell be no sign of an external attack anyway even if they suspect there was and come looking for us all the better for us either way well find one another chapter twentyseven though he knew precisely where they were by virtue of his gps unit choir couldnt help the wounded lawson get any closer to the chopper camp unless he was willing to go the last mile by arrow something that david brentwood had forbidden anyone to do for fear that no matter how small the possibility it might draw an enemy patrol to the hidden choppers as a safety precaution the last mile was to be on foot this being impossible for lawson despite the lingering effect of the morphine shots he and choir decided it would be quicker and safer for choir to go on ahead to the choppers and on the way out the stallion on infrared could lower a harness for lawson brentwood aussie and salvini would if theyd made it across the ice find their own way through the taiga to the helos before choir left he slit open lawsons vaporbarrier boot the delta commandos foot was in bad shape from the deep slash of the cable a piece of rusted grotesquely twisted wire that had passed through the soft calf into his ankle still in place scraping against the bone with the morphine wearing off choir knew that what the doctors and nurses back in dutch harbor would call discomfort would soon set in with a vengeance it meant that without another shot of morphine lawson despite his delta training and all the will in the world would be unable to keep quiet let alone put any weight on the foot choir pulled out the whitegreen winter camouflage net from beneath the arrows seat and tossed it over the vehicle propping lawson up so that the butt of the m rested in his lap with another shot of morphine by his side and an mre with its regulation calories for winter conditions also within easy reach enjoy your picnic joked choir tapping lawson encouragingly on the shoulder and remember boyo drink your four liters howll i piss aim high said choir smiling for the first time that day listen boyo if i dont make it back to you take the chance and go active with your finder beeper but give the two hours dont want the sibirs homing in on the beep if we can help it ill wait said lawson youll be back choir with one last glance at his gps started off for the choppers which he knew were now a mile away he didnt go in a straight line using instead sas rabbit zigzags and back tracks crouching absolutely still listening to detect the slightest untoward noise within the rushingriver sound of the blizzard in the high timber as fresh powder snow started to fall passing down through the heavy drifts on the bank of a snaking frozen river choir scanned left to right for signs of any footprints or vehicle tracks and took another gps fix the choppers should now be no more than a hundred yards ahead but damned if he could see them his vision obliterated by either trees or the camouflage nets or then he spotted the nose of one of the cobras and as he got nearer experienced the pleasant fright of recognition as the bigger almost brutish shape of the super stallion became distinguishable under the snowdusted net at twenty yards he stopped and knelt down to make sure no one was following him nothing stirred but the blizzard he waited a full five minutes watching something was wrong he couldnt smell it or see it but his sixth sense told him as sure as a mother detects the slightest change of rhythm in her babys sleep in an otherwise noisy house he knew that something was amiss for a start there should have been some sign of movement around the choppers their crews surely as anxious hearing the distant gunfire to see the returning sasdelta men as they would be to see the chopper crews yet peculiarly he didnt sense a trap silently his slow movements completely muffled by the blizzard he eased forward a few yards and stopped again noticing what looked like a patch of oil its coloration and form different from the folds of snow about him then he saw it was a canteen shape he was in a minefield without moving an inch without blinking he stared at the choppers knowing that everyone inside had either been taken prisoner or killed whatever an enemy patrol had done securing the open area by circling it with a ring of antipersonnel mines they had now gone not staying with the choppers when they had heard the firing down by the lake and obviously not having blown the choppers up for fear of drawing attention to themselves turning retracing his footsteps precisely choir made his way back through the trees his earlier footsteps still visible enough that he could avoid stamping on any new ground after a quarter mile or so he paused waited and sensing no danger moved on till to his immense relief he spotted the arrow lawsons throat had been cut his snowveiled stare silent testimony to the utter surprise and horror with which it had happened so much blood around the arrow that it looked like a spill of pink algae the snowfall diluting the dark red his jaw tight with anger senses bristling choir saw the footsteps of the siberian patrol there had been three possibly four no doubt coming round in a circle from the choppers after hearing the arrow making its way through the woods the arrows gas tank was punctured in three or four places the gas gone choir switched the safety off his hk then began the lope run the kind that because of the high adrenaline energy it consumed eyes ears trigger finger on the edge could exhaust even the fittest commando in half an hour in the heavy snow he heard a dog its panting downwind of him as it turned one man in the group of four turned with it but by then choir had fired three long rattling bursts downing the dog and the two spets nearest it the other two quickly dashing behind tall firs choir still running suddenly tripped on hidden roots his vest taking the brunt of the fall bullets whistling above where a moment before hed stood now rolling over he performed the minimum requirement of the sas its calling card changing the magazine in midroll returning fire within three seconds not hitting either of the spets but keeping them behind the trees as he also took cover behind an icecreamdomed stump one spets was firing only the barrel of his ak visible choir could hear the other moving twenty feet to his right going down on his knees choir was lifting his weapon when as if in slow motion he glimpsed the other mans face and the white toque he was wearing becoming one suddenly blurring the mans face and scalp separating from him like torn paper as david brentwoods heckler and koch ninemillimeter parabellum punched into him from behind bark flying everywhere there was another shot this in its singularity was much louder more of a thwack than the outraged chatter of david brentwoods machine gun aussies haskins firmly braced by the best siberian pine spoke only once its heincendiary literally blowing the remaining spets head off salvini covering the rear no one spoke for several minutes all frozen in attitude braced for the counterattack if there was to be one making sure that absolutely nothing else was moving softly aussie told salvini told you i heard a fucking mutt they took lawsons dog tags but had no time to bury him it was hardest on choir but it was necessary and with only one backward glance he moved off with the other three telling them briefly about the choppers and the vanished crew who were no doubt dead inside them it was up to david whether to go on and destroy the choppers but there would be the mines to negotiate too timeconsuming in itself and besides any noise would only attract further enemy patrols plus the spets patrol could have already reported the position of the chopper to an hq we hike he said simply to choir aussie and salvini eastnoreast just what i felt like said aussie somberly bloody fourhundredmile walk they never doubted theyd make it if an sasdelta man couldnt make fifty miles a day he was loafing it would be eight days to the forward units of second army who given the gst the team had taken out in the tunnel and the explosions from the lake must be mightily relieved at having at least the cruise salvos already cut by more than half besides the four men had their weapons two mres apiece and after what theyd been through during winter survival course at brecon beacons for the sas the high sierras for salvini they had no fears except how cold it might become already minus forty as it was growing dark but here too they had two outstanding allies their physical condition the ability to go beyond fifty miles a day with their muchlightened packs and just as important the small nuwick hour candle in their kit weighing fourteen ounces looking like a can of tuna the lightheat candle came with six small and according to aussie obscenelooking movable candles one candle for light two for cooking and as two troopers slept under their norway flap tents two on guard three candles for heat the deaths of lawson and the others on the mission weighed heavily on david during the next seventytwo hours more so as there was no opportunity to talk each man refraining from speaking unless it was absolutely necessary they were conserving energy all communication done by hand signal tire four of them moving in a diamond firefight pattern just far enough from one another to have arcs of interlocking fire should it be required david had to force himself especially when he was on the point to stop thinking about the choppers theyd had to abandon it irked him that even some of their equipment would fall into enemy hands as they got closer to the north end of the lake his mood began to improve however with the expectation of meeting up with freemans advance forces the mood was shattered when they heard though they couldnt see another salvo of four cruise missiles passing overhead toward second army davids anxiety increased too for his brothers safety but then on their satellite bounce shortwave radio they picked up a staticriven bbc overseas service broadcast announcing reduced enemy cruise activity and a substantial victory for second army east of yerofey pavlovich which meant freeman was on the march though it was a cause for celebration they still couldnt make any noise and indeed the news only alerted them to another danger namely that in their spets uniform any advance american patrols probing southwestward to baikal would shoot first and ask questions later they ripped off the spets shoulder insignia but even so the siberian white coveralls had a baggy form with a distinctive belt unlike the americans white overlays chapter twentyeight robert finally had to sleep but it wasnt for long and waking from his turn on the plank one of the gsts folddown bunks he felt sick from the suffocating smell of diesel he was in a hellish red light johnson informing him triumphantly that hed found the rigged for red switch while he brentwood was asleep in the event that they might have to go topside through thin ice into the pitchblack arctic night the ruby glow would be easier on their eyes allowing them to adjust to the darkness do we still have them brentwood almost passed out with the pain a persistent hammer blow radiating from his shoulder through his neck and head muscles down into his lower back and buttocks do we still have them in the northern quadrant yes sir answered johnson one of em moved a few hundred yards or so but not far theyve come up close to the surface just fired off another salvo means theyre still pretty close to the ice hole only about a hundred feet below guess theyre going to pop off another few i figure they must be near some upwelling thin crust so why move probably dont even have to use any chargepick through the thinner ice now theyve fired robert brentwood didnt respond for as he sat up he felt his head was literally going to fall off consciousness having torn him brutally from a dream hed been with rosemary and his little boy would it be a boy or would it be a girl in a sylvan glade in oxshott the embracing cool calm of a huge oak tree above them as theyd picnicked chicken with one of those wicker baskets so beloved by the english with everything in its right place and his child smiling at him eyes wide with wonder and then david and lana were there with her pilot boyfriend the one she wanted to have as a fiancé if la roche ever condescended to agree to a divorce and the pilots head which had somehow become robert was bandaged sore eyes covered as lana had described in a letter were going to fire our missiles he told johnson and lopez easing himself off the bunk convince em were still one of them he paused then pointed at the onc e chart the position of the two subs from which they hadnt moved marked with red crosses theyll think were hitting second army he tried to smile at his own brilliance but even the effort emitted a fiery pain deep inside his skull all right said johnson his enthusiasm echoing throughout the tiny sub pummeling brentwoods head some more such enthusiasm was something that robert brentwood himself hadnt been able to regain however much he wished after the shock of the knife wound at fortythree he was still a relatively young man but he was growing old for submarines way to go skipper echoed lopez you okay brentwood asked squinting in the reddedout light you look like hell a bit whacked sir after we shoot off the missiles you hit that bunk sir ill be all do as i say yes sir to lopezs utter amazement robert brentwood chewed two aspirin without water as he punched in the coordinate vectors for the attack arcs doublechecking the distances and remembering the fortymileanhour winds expected in the blizzard theyd seen racing south down the lake as theyd egressed port baikal in any event brentwood knew that with the two enemy subs exact quadrant position known and the two subs being close to the surface a direct hit wouldnt be necessary a half mile either way even across the line into nearby or quadrants would do the job id say that after that last salvo at second army theyre either into quadrant six five or just moving into five six here southeast of he couldnt pronounce it and spelled it sbega kowd you say that johnson asshole country sir then lopez had a suggestion sir yes sir could we pop one on irkutsk pop one in the fatigue that gives rise to silly laughter even in the most introverted souls during moments of high tension johnson and robert brentwood a world apart in rank broke up in common cause brentwood shaking his head johnson tears in his eyes looking across at lopez pop one you dork well im telling you lopez said robert brentwood right hand holding his head as if it were a basket of eggs im not gunning for civilians nor is freeman but i like your idea matter of fact i like it so much if we get out of this im gonna see you get promoted hell no sir only lets spread the good news around a little lopez said brentwood on behalf of second army and a stab of needlelike pain forced brentwood to sit down abruptly on the bunk you okay sir asked johnson anxiously no son of a the pain passed but left him nauseated and dizzy for a few minutes johnson was trying not to look worried but he was scared as a sea wolf captain brentwood had all the soviet firing procedures down pat without him johnson doubted he could handle itknew he couldnt handle it brentwood had lopez strap his left arm against his chest moved to the computer triplechecked the coordinates then stopped without looking around he announced lopez im gonna promote you whether you damn well like it or not he looked around at lopez on steerage then forward a few feet to johnson we are going to spread it around boys johnson how many cruise missiles on that raft eight sir right with the four we already have that makes twelve well clobber the stalingrad division from behind with six wont know what the hell hit them confusionll be worth as much to us as the casualties we inflict and gentlemen lets not be mean about this well split the other six with two for the kmk factory at novokuznetsk which well fire first and two well donate to akademgorodok near novosibirsk the kmk factory he explained to lopez who hadnt picked up on the name is where they make their tanks as well as these gsts and that leaves two for our two friends up north seeing they stole our technology lets demonstrate its accuracy gentlemen all right all right okay lets have a sonar ping ordered brentwood and the easy tone of a second ago was now replaced by his professional demeanor come on hurry it up yes sir now they were on active sonar brentwood explaining might as well be brazen about it whats that old man freeman always says laudace iaudace toujours iaudace he stole it from patton said johnson who stole it from frederick the great said brentwood well its ours now the actives pings were now bouncing or bonging back telling them that they had a relatively thin ice roof no more than half a mile three degrees starboard no problem sir johnson pronounced looks as thin as a virgins yes yes all right said robert brentwood notoriously prudish about such matters even in front of his sister lana who is a nurse had seen it all and had done time as young david put it with scumbag la roche reaching the area of the thin ice brentwood ordered johnson to take the sub to a depth of two thousand feet approaching the subs crush depth and at an off angle to the targeted ice patch he then pulled the lever to release float charge two minutes later there was a gutwrenching thud and brentwood immediately ordered the gst to fifty feet fifty feet aye sir came johnsons confirmation at fifty feet he levelled the sub out still surprised at how quickly the tiny gst a seal compared to a whale in size responded the problem was not to let it get ahead of you and slam into the ice half speed brentwood instructed lopez then to johnson twentyfive feet twentyfive feet sir levelling at twentyfive very well man battle stations missile set condition one condition one aye sir responded johnson departments ready asked brentwood there were only two departments lopezs and johnsons but brentwood knew that this was a time for tried and true procedures to steady their nerves steerage ready sir reported lopez followed by johnsons sonar ready very well acknowledged brentwood neutral trim johnson made a slight adjustment to starboardneutral trim sir stand by to flood tubes one and two ordered brentwood it being standard procedure on any missile submarine to be ready to fire torpedoes in defense of the ship should an enemy vessel try to interfere with the missile launch completing spin up brentwood advised them as he entered the final salinity and current corrections that would affect the missiles trajectories spin up complete prepare for ripple fire prepare for ripple fire responded johnson fire one ordered brentwood fire one one fired there was a hiss of compressed air and a rasping noise the sub rolling ten degrees port before regaining neutral trim fire two fire two two fired in less than three and half minutes all four cruise missiles had passed through their nose cones protective membranes exited the icefree hole booster rockets engaged and were en route to their targets lopez and johnson exited the sub for the reloads while brentwood made copious notes on the gsts performance as he prepared a course to take the sub toward thinner ice at the eastern shore after all salvos had been fired in the spring general said professor leonid grigorenko looking out on the frozen ob sea that was akademgorodoks private lake i hope youll find time to come out sailing with me and lrena the gruff heavybrowed yesov shook his head nyet thank you all the same professor i am no sailor besides there will still be ice in the spring oh come now comrade it adds to the adventure yes nyet yesov looked about so that none of his aides at the professors cocktail party to celebrate the success of the gst offensive heard that he was leery of anything to do with waterincluding bathing some had said i get sick in the jacuzzi professor ah marshal said chernko his familiarity claiming yesov marshal of all siberian forces as if he were a longlost friend how goes the thirtyfirst well said yesov curtly he didnt like chernko even if he was hailed in novosibirsk for his gst plan yesov was willing to accept the generals help but to yesov it had been too conditional altogether chernko telling them insisting on what pleasures and luxuries including dachas he would get in return yesov despised him here was the russian a former kgb chief now sucking up to the western alliance in moscow while slipping novosibirsk vital information via his spies information chat yesov had to grudgingly admit had served them well in stopping the allies at the urals pummeling the allies in fact still he disliked the mans opportunism as far as he was concerned chernko was little more than the old bourgeois communistas ideologically unsound and at root as uncommitted to the military as gorbachev had been im well satisfied said chernko if the thirtyfirst does as well in the east against this freeman as we have in the west eh itll be over soon a ceasefire and then we go for american aid the americans are suckers once the thirtyfirst mauls freemans soft second ar the apartment building shook everyone thinking it was an earthquake broken glass whole windows popping out and whizzing through the air expensive dresses of the elite slashed many of the generals wives screaming from the minor cuts and abrasions created by the first shock wave yesov had moved under the mahogany dining table with all the finesse of a charging t sending two colonels wives splaying on the plush persian carpet as people were getting up off the floor his beeper was set off by the pressure of his folding gut machinastop that thing one of the women screamed hysterically tishe be quiet yesov replied redfaced lumbering up with the help of an aide whom he quickly shook off like an offending mullet the marshal was in the throes of regaining his ruffled dignity it was seven minutes the phone lines being down before he heard that the kmk works in novokuznetsk had been badly hit as well as the institute of defense science in akademgorodok the damage over killed several hundred wounded was not of particular concern to the marshal even though it abruptly ended the cocktail party whatever his faults might be yesov had been the first in that room or in novosibirsks central committee to realize that the americans had suddenly and dramatically demonstrated that they had the ability to reach deep into sibir it could only mean that the americans must now have established forward air bases despite the thirtyfirsts advance from which to fire off their airlaunch cruise missiles which skimming at tree level across the taiga and steppe had hit both the political heart and a vital industrial organ of siberia it was clearly a warning of the terrible danger that the vital siberian oil fields at mirnyy in the very center of siberia and without which she could not continue the war were at immediate risk the same would then be true of siberias vital defense industries all the way from mirnyy believed to be invulnerable to all us tactical missiles to the oil field barely two hundred miles north of novosibirsk at belyy yar everything was now within freemans reach you know what this means professor grigorenko demanded rather than informing yesov but the marshal already knew he might be slow afoot but his brain was in excellent condition still the professor shakily pouring himself a large vodka and ignoring the generals glass went on its brutally simple marshal if they want to they can turn this into another kuwait on fire do you really believe theyd do that asked an aide are you senile growled yesov theyre not playing baseball comrade no sir in fact sonarman first class johnson aboard the gst was thinking in precisely those terms they had stolen first base the kmk works at novokuznetsk the second akademgorodok near novosibirsk and the third he looked at his watch right about now five hundred miles east of them the six onethousandpound cruise warheads came shuffling through the air over train tracks and a pipeline only yards apart in quadrant just west of sbega when he heard them coming in a praporschika a warrant officer in the siberian thirtyfirst knew as well as anyone else in the stalingrad division that if the explosions of the incoming subsonic missiles loaded with armorpiercing bomblets blew out the pipe or rail tracks percent of the thirtyfirsts supplies would be cut off only percent able to make it on the poor road system they simply did not have the kind of airlift capacity of the americans the first missile took out a copse of snowladen birch trees and did no harm to speak of the second missile however tore up more than thirty feet of track the remaining four missiles tore up even more and their rain of armorpiercing bomblets sliced through the thirtyfirst stalingrad division trucks in showers of whitehot steel hitting over fifty fully loaded troop trucks in the vehicle convoy most of the casualties over nine hundred caused not only from the detonation but from the hornetlike swarms of flechettes far more serious was the severing of the pipeline by the thousands of bomblets from missiles four and five the oil line running adjacent to the road erupted in flame the fire speeding along the ruptured pipe like a quick fuse the oil already under pressure jetted out like water from a long punctured hose along a snaking fortymile section that like the rest of the line ran close to the road the long spurting tongues of fire set trucks armor troops and selfpropelled millimeter howitzer haulers ablaze and consumed another hundred vehicles including bmds armored personnel carriers in the most devastating single loss over four thousand killed or injured suffered by russian arms in the past year the fire alone attracted american fighters in the overcast although they paid heavily losing over twentythree to the fulcrums they had such overwhelming numerical and instrumentflying superiority they delivered what the thirtyfirst commanders and those few still alive in the column were calling a kuwaiti highway massacre a thunderbolts were coming in their sevenbarrelled thirtymillimeter avenger cannons blazing picking off the siberians t tanks at will streams of tracer poured down so fast that they created the illusion that the tanks were actually sucking the fire from the planes the tanks exploding providing more target identification for the american air force they created such a massive traffic jam on the secondrate road hemmed in by the taiga and snow banks that freeman seeing his chance issued orders that the carnage continue unabated and that he would personally courtmartial anyone who let up attacking in the next twentyfour hours for any other reason than to refuel and rearm the thirtyfirst stalingrad was taking a terrible pummelling its morale as savaged by the belief that it was now surrounded as by the actual punishment it was taking so savage was the american counterattack that despite the thick white overlay of cumulonimbus the battle became visible as a pulsating red vein to satellite reconnaissance as suddenly as it had seemed an overwhelming threat the thirtyfirst was now in full retreat freeman the baikal threat against him now removed ordered his armored divisions into the fishhook configuration hed been waiting for one column of over a thousand tanks with close air support arced left southward heading for irkutsk on any side roads and rivers they could find some roads had been literally bombed and napalmed out of the taiga by us engineers the right curve of the fishhook turned northward heading for yakutsk freemans shermanlike breakout around the flanks of the smashedthirtyfirst became a rout the siberian division finally pocketed unable to move its gst backup as freeman announced in a message to the president no longer in service the greatest strain on the american supply line was surrendering siberians most of them wounded us medevac facilities were stretched to the limit for the crews aboard the two gsts in quadrant there was no warning no gradual foreboding of ice growl or increase in subsurface turbidity there was only the world coming to an end the explosions of the two cruise missiles hitting them so cataclysmic as to shock each mans nervous system into instant irreparable crisis as surely as the subs hatches were buckled preventing escape the two gsts squashed like molten bottles plummeted to over five thousand feet below into the primeval silt of the boreal forest what can we do asked civilian members of the novosibirsk central committee in panic yesov looked at each one of them in turn then at all of them contemptuously arrange a ceasefire you fools he was a soldier first he told them but also a realist the american public led by la roches tabloids were overwhelmingly in favor freeman was appalled dick norton handing him a faxed copy of the new york times editorial which like the la roche papers joined in heartily for an immediate ceasefire as offered by the siberians warning only that a ceasefire should not extract unreasonable demands and sacrifices from the siberian people as did the treaty of versailles of the german nation thereby assuring continued bitterness in the rebuilding that would have to be done outside his victorious forward headquarters at sbega west of the chinesesiberian hump freeman strode up a snowdazzling embankment the sky the bluest hed ever seen smacking the new york times headline he thrust the newspaper back at norton by god this is this is treachery norton norton looked stunned they talk about the treaty of versailles thundered freeman frightening a bird from a nearby perch the bird startling norton who reached for his sidearm remember what churchill said about the treaty of versailles said freeman it was an armistice he said for twenty years its the same here goddamn it dick if we dont run with the bit while we have it between our teeth well have to fight these jokers again didnt we learn anything from that bastard hussein freeman was beside himself right glove smashing into his left why dont they let the do it dick what the hells the matter with them back there at the white house presidents under an awful lot of pressure general for this ceasefire nobody wants any more fighting neither do i damn it but cant you see cant anybody see that if we dont finish it now well have to finish it somewhere else forced into a rematch at a time and place of their choosing norton quite frankly didnt have the courage to show the general the copies of the other newspapers headlines bring our boys home the la roche papers cried enough is enough theyre praising you a lot general saying if it hadnt been for your brilliance your planning freeman wasnt listening they must be made to understand dick i want you to send a message to the president immediate strongly suggest we finish the job do not trust siberian offer which i see as merely an opportunity to regroup especially given their strong position on the western front please let my views be known to the joint chiefs sincerely general douglas freeman it was of no avail president mayne agreed with the american public it was time to bring the boys home you are ordered president maynes reply message read to cease all military operations at a mutually agreedupon time within the next twentyfour hours repeat twentyfour hours the nation is grateful for your brilliant leadership now is the time to lead the peace norton received the response from the white house and immediately went out to give it to the general freeman read it crumpled it and thrust it deep into his greatcoat pocket he looked down the snow bank on the gaggle of press types trying to negotiate the slope in their frantic eagerness to interview dogged doug a sobriquet he abhorred as much as he disliked the unwillingness of the press pool to go back to khabarovsk now and interview some of the individuals everyone from supply officers to grunts who had made it possible no now they all wanted to be up at the front now that it was all quiet look at em freeman told norton by god id like to bulldoze all of them into baikal you see dick thats how short a step it is from hosanna to hoot general if you dont feel up to it perhaps we can arrange another dont fret dick i wont disgrace second army let the bastards come up and take their pretty pictures look good against the skyline dont i yes sir its terrific all right then send em up the first of the press corps to make it was a woman reporter from detroit who barely able to get her breath asked the general its said general you wanted to drive on once youd turned the battle is that true i did norton looked skyward in exasperation however continued freeman looking as happy as a father whos been told his daughter has just become engaged to a parolee the us second army is an instrument of national policy i do what i am told that is all but general freeman walked through the rapturous acclaim back into his headquarters urgent messages already coming through from the joint chiefs that he was as soon as it could be arranged after the ceasefire to make himself available to return to washington for consultation ah he told norton disgustedlyclear as the nose on my face far as the white house is concerned the war is over by god they think its finished dick at the signing of the ceasefire at irkutsk a dour freeman shook hands with a dour yesov both flashing a smile for the cameras norton careful to keep freeman out of mike range which was just as well i tell you norton theres not one of them he said smiling icily across the table at the siberians you can stand near breath stinks like a goddamn general yesov was smiling again this time for the french press i dont trust those frogs either said freeman they let us down when we wanted to overfly france get that son of a bitch khaddafy they helped us in the iraqi war general norton whispered at the last goddamn minute not like the brits its over general in a few days well be flying back to khabarovsk and he was interrupted by applause as yesov was acclaimed by the siberian press the marshals grin at the camera so transparently insincere norton thought that it would need drastic touching up if the siberian propaganda ministry was going to use it its over lana told frank shirer i know he said holding her trying to feel good again you know that young cockney guy all the facial burns and yes she said trying to hold her impatience wanting to put any talk of wounds and hospitals her work behind her it was time to celebrate he says continued shirer stroking her hair but his mind clearly elsewhere that i should try for a transplant she knew he could one grisly fact about the war and the abilities of the americans to get their wounded back more quickly than anyone else was that organ donor banks and most servicemen were donors were full of spare parts well tell him you dont want to not now your fighting days are over mister everyones fighting days are over thank god she said her hand holding his guiding it to where she wanted it it was the only magic that could overcome his depression at the prospect of no longer being a pilot god i love you he said you too problem is not everyones compatible for an instant she thought he was talking about them but then realized his preoccupation about losing the eye and a transplant was still with him all depends she said on whether youre a candidate in the first place priorities she hesitated then thought she might as well say it some people cant even see honey but for all shirers maturity it was about as effective as telling a child to eat his broccoli because thousands were starving in ethiopia but for the moment with the help of her professional knowledge of anatomy the admonition was working and soon she felt the hardness growing nothing wrong with this she said looking up giving him the sweet full smile that had first attracted him to her no he said its ready for takeoff looking for somewhere to land she asked snuggling in closer have to do some maneuvering first he answered with a grin and she knew that for the time being the horror of what they had done to him would abate god i love you he told her you too oh now sweetie we can have time for each other instead of this damn war yes he said it was almost disappointment hold me she said he took her in his arms chapter twentynine it was the sixth day salvini was on point david left of him in the diamond choir and aussie right flank when salvini gave them the freeze signal to have gone down would have kicked up the powder snow and made too much noise the patrol coming toward them through the trees about ten men hadnt seen them yet but soon would it was up to salvini he could see the most the other three had all gone off safety simultaneously salvini waved the diamond down and took a chance american there was a roar of submachine gun fire and men shouting then a white flag an overlay held aloft its bearer growing as he rose unsteadily to his feet advancing now waving the white overlay side to side all the others nine of them were walking forward now hands raised they were siberian regulars hungry tired wearing the patch showing a bear with a lightning rod in his paws the insignia of the siberian thirtyfirst stalingrad division as the clatter of their surrendered weapons seemed to fill the forest with sound aussie noticed one of their weapons was an americanissue whered you get that ivan the siberian affected ignorance signifying he didnt speak english aussie flipped open the siberians holster flap and saw the us navy stamp lieutenant rc simpson one of the stallion crew said salvini you sure asked david im sure helped him load the arrows aussie drew his boot knifewhere are they he asked the siberian coldly easy aussie cautioned david where the fuck are they repeated aussie the blade under the siberians chin a captain hands still up marched forward i speak little english yeah said aussie without taking his eyes off the man in front of him where are the helicopter soldiers the captain shrugged we find on way to front yes he said indicating the all kaput in helicopters everyone dead he imitated a machine gun so well that choir swung about and almost blew his head off sorry said the siberian quickly sorry but everyone kaput he made a slashing motion across his throat spetsnaz you understand ah we understand said david i dont believe the bastard said aussie i do said david then how come theyre heading back this way if theyre on their way to the fucking front excuse me please said the siberian captain war is all finished bullshit said aussie i oughta knock it off lewis warned david back off and thats an order aussie sheathed the knife reluctantly without taking his eye off the siberian if i find youre lying ivan ill hang you out to dry the siberian was utterly unafraidyou have radio you hear war is over when was it over aussie shot back this last night it was three hours before they could pick up the bbc overseas broadcast a mood of unhappy suspicion hanging over the sd team as well as the hapless prisoners their hands tied in a rope chain as they sat glumly in a circle when the sd team heard the news of the ceasefire the mood was more relief than exhilaration now they could break silence and call for pickup aussie threw the siberian captain a packet of cigarettes but he was still morose hed never know for sure but for now he believed the captains story they sure as hell werent spets no blueandwhite striped tshirts to start with and they didnt have the look he only really hated the spets david made the call for pickup and after waiting for an hour they started the purple smoke flares david seeing aussie was still grumpy embarrassed now by his outburst with the knife looked over at choir williams hey choir how long you think itll be till pickup an hour said choir salvini asked david the same i reckon answered salvini somewhat nonplussed gimme the map said aussie david let him study it for a moment or two then asked casually well aussie how long do you say fortyfive minutes maximum ah too soon said david confidently all right nostradamus challenged aussie put some money on it ten to one rubles inquired choir fuck rubles said aussie dollars us he looked around indelible pencil in hand whos in chapter thirty when colonel nefski surveyed the rubble that had been the old library and hotel at port baikal it was a wonder to him that any of them had survived the sasdelta commando attack half the prisoners had gone vanished in the taiga but he had little doubt that most if not all would be rounded up again top priority he told his subaltern was to be given to finding alexsandra malof it was possible that the jewish underground using her as exhibit a would try to reach the americans moaning again about civilrights abuses and starting some damned un investigation we wont take a chance with that nefski told the corporal shoot her on sight what about the jewish underground she can still give us information if you find her shoot her snapped nefski whered you get that bruise ah bit of wood i think ricochet better get it seen to advised nefski an unusual moment of concern for the wellbeing of the junior ranks he felt more magnanimous now hed cheated death and more emboldened determined to root out the undesirable elements now his efforts could turn away from what had been the wartime concerns to those of the ceasefire to getting back to his old haunts in khabarovsk as he walked toward the entrance to the hotel its fairytale dome of snow sparkling in the sunlike sugar icing he glanced at its ruined facade shot through by sasdelta force smallarms fire and the odd law round but even among the ruins the golden glints of sunlight off the ice along the eaves gave beauty to the place he took it as a good omen already he was thinking about hopes of promotion in the spring though he would have to greatly increase the estimated number of american commandos that had attacked port baikal so as to further enhance the report of his vigorous defense his first step on the snowladen steps of the hotel crunched in the warm winter sunshine it was the vibration of his second step that proved too much for the fiftypound icicle its stem snapped and its long needle plummeted smashing nefskis skull like an eggshell as he lay crumpled on the snow bez priznakovzhiznidead as a doornail as his subaltern said everybody was already blaming everyone else for not having cleared the icicles all and sundry later telling novosibirsk hq that under attack theyd had better things to do than look after the eaves aussie lost sixty dollars us because the chinook helo having spotted three figures moving north along the edge of the lake robert brentwood and his two crewmen had gone out to pick them up it made the chinook over an hour late aussie argued that crook helicopters rendered the bets null and void but he was howled down by his three compatriots whom he delicately called fucking ned kellys after the infamous australian highwayman chapter thirtyone two weeks later georgina had chosen lake louise in the canadian rockies because as a child she had fallen in love with the grand unabashed magnificence of the canadian pacific hotel the stolid imposing holdout of what was commonly if erroneously thought to have been an easier and gentler age david to be truthful didnt care where they got married it was the marriage that counted as it turned out the small and cozy snowcovered episcopalian or as georgina called it anglican church of st georges in the pines in banff was perfect and if georginas parents were prevented from attending because of the combination of cost and uneasy skies between europe and north america then at least davids mother and father were able to attend standing ramrod straight as became his rank admiral john brentwood retired said little during the ceremony except to advise his wife for heavens sake catherine its not a funeral keep on like this and well have to start the bilge pumps catherine took no notice and was smiling beneath the intermittent tears the admiral snuffled a lot complaining later that the air was too damn dry up here plays hell with my sinuses when he shook davids hand he mumbled an advisoryno one knew exactly what except it had something to do with decks and heading into the wind to georgina he was positively grandfatherly and endearing having decided in their brief meeting that her being a student of the london school of economics and political science did not pose any immediate threat to the north american alliance what made his day complete however was the news broadcast to his great satisfaction by the cbn network which he detested that his youngest son along with several others had been awarded the silver star for action above and beyond the call of duty around lake baikal during the fiftymile drive from the small private reception at the banff springs hotel to lake louise for their honeymoon they were as moved as a million tourists before them had been by the majestic sweep of blue sky and towering snowcovered mountains mount eisenhower was particularly impressive with its ramparts thrusting heavenward from the forests girding it around the frozen course of the bow river another medal georgina said it to david in that insouciant english way that admires the very thing it pretends to be mocking david shrugged bashfully folding his pants neatly sas inspectionstyle knifelike edges carefully aligned before he draped them over the plush recliner set before a window that looked out on the dazzling turquoise edge of the victoria glacier astonishingly beautiful in the twilight georgina fully clothed keeping her coat on despite the heat of the room watched him against the rocky mountain vista stunning isnt it she said sure is thats why i chose it must have cost your dad a packet said david shaking his head in awe i chose the right fatherinlaw he turned from the awesome glacier intent now on another view and just as impressed it was going to take some time longer than the brief wedding ceremony in banff or could he wait he reached for the cord to close the drapesleave them open said georgina cheekily im sure the glacier wont mind tourists will there are none silly not this time of year its not exactly spring yet id rather them closed he said pulling the cord walking toward her unbuttoning his shirt im going to do terrible things to you david you promise yes maam apart from the obligatory wedding peck in banffhe didnt like making it a public spectacle it was the first time theyd kissed really kissed since hed left for the ratmanov mission that now seemed so long ago they lingered as long as breath would allow and then some his hand slipping beneath her dress sliding along the firmness of her thigh pulling down the panty hose slowly she pressed against him his arm sliding between her legs then his hand cupping lifting her up and onto the bed her soft murmur enticing him her rose perfume washing over him the tight smooth v of her panties now moist she feeling for him squeezing him her nipples engorged he could restrain himself no longer her sudden gasp one of pleasure the feel of her gripping him pulling him engulfing him filling him with a happiness hed dreamt of in the past few months but doubted hed ever experience again she arched her head moving from side to side lips insistent auburn hair a sheen in the soft peach glow she stopped dead still waiting whats wrong asked david alarmed she was trying to speak her throat parched her smile the most beautiful hed ever seen i want to start all over again holy dooley he said the cornseed expression making her chuckle making her even more desirable they began again and all he could hear was her whispering with terrible loving urgency harder david harder and he wanting to make it last to draw out the ecstasy switched his thoughts to something distant to lake baikal and the men who were gone and would never feel the pleasure he was feeling away from her for a moment when he returned it was as if they were together for the first time ready now to let go utterly chapter thirtytwo oh thats lovely that is proclaimed aussie to the british liaison officer in freemans khabarovsk hq very bloody nice you mean weve gotta stay in this burg for another six weeks bloody brentwood hes home probably dippin his wick for all i know your papers havent come through said the british liaison office sergeant coolly thats all thats all this bloody welshman here he turned his thumb jerking at an

a fax saying that enough american artillery uniforms had been stolen to equip a whole battery of howitzers someone said the uniforms had probably ended up being flogged on the black market south of the siberianouter mongolian border in ulan bator the mongolian party officials always much closer to the soviets than the chinese whom they hated were apparently allowing a lot of free enterprise these days or at least what they thought was a lot of it hell one sergeant said looking at the fax were selling army surplus stuff all the time anyway yeah but not stolen stuff anyway its the wrong time of year to be flogging off winter gear soon be spring strange an hour before he was to leave irkutsk after three days of having to perform what he called one of the most distasteful duties of my career shaking hands with siberians and officers from the outer mongolian garrisons freeman took time off sightseeing with norton accompanying him from the frozen onion dome of irkutsks church of the crucifixion they gazed out over the ancient city of the transbaikal city the church from which they were admiring the sight freeman informed norton had been the administrative center for all the russian orthodox churches in russkaya amerikarussiaamerica irkutsk he told norton was also the most important trading center on baikal on the way to russiaamericaalaska that is before some congressman who everyone thought was nuts bought alaska freeman was squinting against the brilliant white light of the snowcovered chimneys idly issuing curlicues of smoke into the pristine winter air you know where the alaskans would be if we hadnt bought it freeman answered his own question in the silver mines of nerchinsk slaves of the tsar huh tsars were almost as bad as stalin when it came to slave labor in the mines usual flogging was a hundred strokes with the pletthreestrand rawhide you had to walk there from here irkutsk and if you faltered and fell you died where you fell hell in the mines they didnt even note a prisoners death in world war two we sent wallace the vice president over to magadan in the northeast to have a look at their gold mines there well of course they did a potemkin village on him all the prisoners were well fed looking great they should have been bastards were members of the nkvd secret police before they changed the name to kgb freeman shook his head disbelievingly unbeknown to the vice president it was the head thug of the camp the director and his wife as much a thug as he was who had shown them around it was pathetic the vps sidekick a professor went back to washington said the head of the camp theyd toured was a man who had a deep sense of civic responsibility thug had another job peoples representative of birobidzhan jewish autonomous region some of the jews figured it was time to leave freeman turned eastward and from the tower looked over the taiga beyond the city in the direction of lake baikal cant imagine why can you you see freemans voice echoed as he walked down the steeples stairwell thats what continues to amaze me dick they send over intellectuals with the naïveté of a fouryearold to assess the situation no wonder we have to end up fighting them its the fouryearolds who are dictating the ceasefire norton didnt answer politics was deep water in the army something the general was blindly naive about for all his sophistication in matters military it wasnt until they were out of the church walking toward the generals staff car four us outriders starting up their motorcycles that freeman seeing trucks of the siberian fifth army rolling past the cathedral said to think we came so far dick over a thousand miles in from the siberian coast damned near past baikal which he added we wouldnt have if i hadnt authorized that fae strike on ratmanov norton nodded his assent and continued freeman had it not been for those brentwoods and other menit was then that norton saw tears in freemans eyes freedom he told norton sometimes exacts a terrible price but in my heart of hearts in this freeman that only freeman sees dick i believe that ultimately we have to pay for it buy it in blood he exhaled wearily so that bloodless gentlemen can call the a warmonger without the shooting the sons of bitches on the way out to the airport us mps flanking him their motorcycles throwing up fine trails of snow freeman glanced back and pointed out the frozen fountain in front of the angara hotel in spring they tell the they swim in that fountain he turned back to norton i was struck by that fact because it shows how they use everything they have tough too swimming so early in the thaw the general fell into a deep reflective mood finally when he spoke his tone was one of mellow speculation laced with warning come spring i dont know where the hell ill be those clowns in foggy bottom are regrouping to get the home as soon as they can well home is where my war is dick and i want to know the moment the first lake cracks the moment the melt starts norton was jolted by the implication you think theyll try something general spring thaws very bad for armor dick floods mud if i was that son of a bitch yesov thats when id counterattack catch us with our pants down lord general i hope youre wrong its a ceasefire dick not a surrender well said norton confidently weve got the russian president chernko on our side he should keep them in line did good work for us in moscow well see said freeman watching a hawk hovering high toward lake baikal in anchorage lana sitting and talking with frank earlier had now been overtaken by a combination of exhaustion and relief at the news of the ceasefire and was dozing resting her head on the edge of the bed gingerly not wanting to wake her frank reached for the newspaper cutting the limey had left him on the bedside table it was a clipping from a sixmonthold stars and stripes backgrounder column talking about how soviet air ace sergei marchenko before he had gone missing over north korea had clashed with soviet air officialdom apparently his vision had been deficient in one eye below the standard required by the air force academy and he had tried unsuccessfully to invoke the case of general adolf galland germanys top air ace and head of the luftwaffe fighter command who had flown not only the propdriven messerschmitt but also the first jet fighter the messerschmitt he had done it with only one eye the other being glass quickly shirer flipped over the clipping for more details but all he saw was an ad for coca colathe real thing he waited for the limey to reappear but it was a full twenty minutes before he showed up ambling through the ward lana sighed in her sleep and snuggled further into frank who was anxiously waving the limey over whats up mate shirer spoke softly but urgently howd he pull it off who shirer indicated the news clipping galland the limey shrugged dunno mate mightve memorized the old eye chart ive thought of that said shirer his voice low but they make you close one eye yah said the limey guess youre right i dunno youre a great help said frank he mustve thought of some tell you what sunshine said the cockney his tone markedly at odds with the grotesque burn mask he was obliged to wearill ask the professor mate o mine when i get ome thatll be months said frank not meaning to be unkind but clearly anxious yeah but whats the big urry ceasefire mate yes responded frank well if you find out let the know not to worry sport ta ta frank asked hana looking drowsy yes whats up i am
