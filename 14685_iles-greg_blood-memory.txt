greg iles blood memory this novel is dedicated to those women who realize in the dead of night that something is wrong and has been for a long time more than most they know that faulkners words are true there is no such thing as was only is if was existed there would be no grief or sorrow you are not alone memory is the guardian of all things cicero evil being the root of mystery pain is the root of knowledge erasmus chapter when does murder begin with the pull of a trigger with the formation of a motive or does it begin long before when a child swallows more pain than love and is forever changed perhaps it doesnt matter or perhaps it matters more than everything else we judge and punish based on facts but facts are not truth facts are like a buried skeleton uncovered long after death truth is fluid truth is alive to know the truth requires understanding the most difficult human art it requires seeing all things at once forward and backward the way god sees forward and backward so we begin in the middle with a telephone ringing in a dark bedroom on the shore of lake pontchartrain in new orleans louisiana theres a woman lying on the bed mouth open in the mindless gape of sleep she seems not to hear the phone then suddenly the harsh ring breaks through like defibrillator paddles shocking a comatose patient the womans hand shoots from beneath the covers groping for the phone not finding it she gasps and rises onto one elbow then she groans and picks up the receiver from the bedside table the woman is me dr ferry i croak are you sleeping the voice is male taut with anger no my denial is automatic but my mouth is dry as a cotton ball and my alarm clock reads pm ive been out for nine hours the first decent sleep ive had in days he hit another one something sparks in my drowsy brain what this is the fourth time ive called in the past half hour cat the voice brings up a well of anger longing and guilt it belongs to the detective ive been sleeping with for the past eighteen months sean regan an insightful fascinating man with a wife and three kids what did you say before i ask ready to bite off seans head if he asks me to meet him somewhere i said he hit another one i blink and try to orient myself in the darkness its early august and the purple glow of dusk filters through my curtains god my mouth is dry where the garden district owner of a printing company male caucasian bite marks worse than the others how old was he sixtynine jesus it is him im already getting out of bed this makes no sense at all nope sexual predators kill women sean or children not old men weve had this conversation how fast can you get here piazzas hovering over me and the chief himself may be coming down for a look i lift yesterdays jeans off the chair and slip them over my panties victoria s secret seans favorite pair but he wont be seeing them tonight maybe not for a long time maybe never again any gay angle on this victim did he use male prostitutes anything like that not even a tickle sean replies looks as clean as the others if hes got a home computer confiscate it he might i know my job cat i know but cat the single syllable is a probing finger are you sober a column of heat rises up my spine i havent had a sip of vodka for nearly fortyeight hours but im not going to give sean the satisfaction of answering his interrogation whats the victims name arthur legendre his voice drops are you sober darlin the craving is already awake in my blood like little teeth gnawing at the walls of my veins i need the anesthetic burn of a shot of grey goose only i cant have that anymore ive been using valium to fight the physical withdrawal symptoms but nothing can truly replace the alcohol that has kept me together for so long i shift the phone from shoulder to shoulder and pull a silk blouse from my closet where are the bite marks torso nipples face penis i freeze face are they deep deep enough for you to take impressions i think excitement blunts the edge of my craving im on my way have you taken your meds sean knows me too well no one else in new orleans is even aware that i take anything lexapro for depression depakote for impulse control i stopped taking both drugs three days ago but i dont want to get into that with sean stop worrying about me is the fbi there half the task force is here and they want to know what you think about these bite marks the bureau guy is photographing them but you have that ultraviolet rigand when it comes to teeth youre the man seans admiring misstatement of my gender is typical cop talk and it tells me hes speaking for the benefit of others whats the address twentyseven twentyseven prytania sounds like an address with a security system switched off just like the first one moreland our first victimone month agowas a retired army colonel highly decorated in vietnam just like that seans voice drops to a whisper get your lovely ass down here okay today his irish intimacy makes me want to jab him no i love you i ask with feigned sweetness his reply is barely audible you know im surrounded as usual yeah ill see you in fifteen minutes night falls fast as i drive my audi from my house on lake pontchartrain to the garden district the fragrant heart of new orleans i spent two minutes in the bathroom trying to make myself presentable but my face is still swollen from sleep i need caffeine in five minutes ill be surrounded by cops fbi agents forensic techs the chief of robbery homicide and possibly the chief of the nopd im accustomed to that kind of attention but seven days agothe last time this predator hiti had a problem at the crime scene nothing too bad a gardenvariety panic attack according to the emt who checked me out but panic attacks dont exactly inspire confidence in the hard men and women who work serial murder cases the last thing they want is a consulting expert who cant hold her mud the word got around about my little episode too sean told me that nobody could really believe it why did the woman that some homicide detectives call the ice queen suddenly lose her composure at the scene of a notverygrisly murder id like to know that myself i have a theory but analyzing ones own mental condition is a notoriously unreliable business as for the sobriquet im no ice queen but in the macho world of law enforcement playing that role is the only thing that keeps me safefrom men and from my own rogue impulses of course sean gives the lie to that little strategy four victims now i remind myself focusing on the case four men between the ages of fortytwo and sixtynine all murdered within weeks of each other in a single thirtyday period to be exact the pace of the killings is virtually unprecedented and if the victims were women the city would be gripped by terror but because the victims are middleaged or older men a sort of fascinated curiosity has taken hold of new orleans each victim has been shot in or near the spine mutilated with human bites then finished off with a coup de gr√£ce shot to the head the bites have increased in savagery from victim to victim and theyve also provided the strongest evidence against any future suspectmitochondrial dna from the killers saliva the bite marks are the reason for my involvement with the case im a forensic odontologist an expert on human teeth and the damage they can do i acquired this knowledge in four boring years of dental school and five fascinating years of fieldwork if people ask me what i do for a living i tell them im a dentist which is true enough and all they need to know odontologist doesnt mean anything to anybody but in post csi america forensic prompts questions id just as soon not answer in a grocery store so while most acquaintances know me as a dentist whos too busy to accept new patients an assortment of government agenciesincluding the fbi and the united nations commission for the investigation of war crimesknows me as one of the leading forensic odontologists in the world which is nice i take my identity where i can find it the task force wants my expertise on bite marks tonight but sean regan wants more when he sought my help on a murder case two years ago he soon learned that i knew about a lot more than teeth i completed two years of medical school before i withdrew and that gave me a strong foundation for selfeducation in forensics anatomy hematology histology biochemistry whatever a case requires i can glean twice as much information from an autopsy report as any detective and twice as fast after sean and i became closer than the rules allowed he began using me unofficially to help with difficult cases and used is the proper word sean regan lives to catch killers and hell exploit anything and anyone to help him do it but sean isnt simply a user hes my comradeinarms my rabbi and my enabler he doesnt judge me he knows me for what i am and he gives me what i need like sean im a born hunter not of animals ive hunted animals and i hate it animals are innocent men are not i am a hunter of men but unlike sean i have no license to do this not really forensic odontology brings only tangential involvement with murder cases its my involvement with sean that puts me into the bloody thick of things by allowing me accessunethical and probably illegal accessto crime scenes witnesses and evidence he has put me in a position to solve four major murder cases one of them a serial sean took the credit every time of courseplus the attendant promotionsand i let him do it why maybe because telling the truth would have exposed our love affair gotten sean fired and freed the killers but the truth is simpler than that the truth is that i didnt care about the credit id tasted the pulsepounding rush of hunting predators and i was addicted to it as surely as i am to the vodka i need so terribly at this moment for this reason ive let our relationship run long past the point where i would usually have sabotaged it long enough in fact for me to have forgotten one of my hardestwon lessons the husband doesnt leave not the husbands i pick anyway only this time its different sean has gone a long way toward convincing me he really means to do it and im very close to believing him close enough to find myself hoping desperately for it in the most vulnerable hours of the night but nowthe situation has changed fate has taken a hand and unless sean really surprises me our relationship is over without warning a wave of nausea rolls through my stomach i try to tell myself its alcohol withdrawal but deep down i know better its panic pure terror at the idea of giving up sean and being alone dont think about it says a shaky voice inside me in two minutes youre onstage think about the case as i decelerate down the interstate ramp to the surface streets at st charles avenue my cell phone rings out the opening notes to us sunday bloody sunday i know without looking that its sean where are you he asks im still fifteen blocks from the stately victorian houses of prytania street but i need to calm sean down a few blocks from the scene good can you handle your gear okay my dental case weighs thirtyone pounds fully loaded and tonight ill also need my camera case and tripod maybe sean is hinting that i should ask him outside to help me this would give him an excuse for a private talk before we find ourselves together in front of others but a private talk is the last thing i want tonight ive got it i tell him you sound strange whats going on down there everybodys uptight you know the history i do there have been three serial murder cases in the new orleansbaton rouge area in as many years and serious investigative mistakes were made in all of them we got some sixth district detectives down here sean goes on but the task force has taken over the scene well be running our investigation out of headquarters just like the others captain piazzas already busting my balls carmen piazza is a tough fiftysomething italianamerican woman who came up through the ranks of the detective bureau and is now the homicide division commander if anyone ever fires sean for his involvement with me it will be piazza she likes seans record of arrests but she thinks hes a cowboy and shes right hes a tough devilish irish cowboy does she suspect anything about us no no rumors nothing dont think so what about joey i ask referring to seans partner detective joey guercio has he blabbed to anybody a milliseconds hesitation no way look just be cool like you always are except for last time you feeling okay about that your nerves or whatever i close my eyes i was until you asked sorry just hurry down here im going back in a rush of anxiety blindsides me you cant wait for me probably better if i dont better for you fine focus on the case i tell myself checking the house numbers on prytania to be sure where i am they expect you to know your business the facts are simple enough in the past thirty days three men have been shot by the same gun bitten by the same set of teeth andin two casesmarked by the saliva of a man whose dna shows him percent likely to be a caucasian male the nopd crime lab did the ballistics that matched the bullets the state police crime lab did the mitochondrial dna match and i matched the bite marks this is much more difficult than it appears to be on television to explain my job to homicide detectives i often tell them about the forensic researcher who used an articulated set of teeth to try to create perfectly matched bite marks on a corpse he couldnt do it the lesson is clear even to street cops if matching two bite marks known to have come from the same set of teeth can be difficult then matching marks that might have been made by any teeth among millions is next to impossible even comparing bite marks on a corpse with the teeth of a small group of suspects is more problematic than many odontologists pretend saliva left in a bite mark by a killer can simplify things enormously by providing dna to compare against that of suspects but four weeks ago when the first victim was discovered i recovered no saliva from the two bite marks on the body i figured the killer for an organized offender who washed the saliva out of his bites to prevent recovery of dna evidence but a week later when the second victim was found my theory was blown out of the water i recovered saliva from two of four bite marks left on the corpse this raised the possibility of a differentand disorganizedkiller but by using reflective ultraviolet photography and scanning electron microscopy on the bite marks i concluded that the same killer had indeed murdered both victims ballistic analysis of the recovered bullets supported my conclusion and six days later when the third victim was murdered my opinion was confirmed beyond doubt by dna recovered from the bite marks left on that body the same killer had murdered all three men the importance of this cannot be overestimated the baseline criteria for classifying a serial murderer are three victims killed by one person each victim killed in a different location and a coolingoff period between the crimes i had helped prove what id known from the moment i saw the first victim new orleans had another predator on the hunt my official responsibility ended with matching the bite marks but i wasnt about to stop there as the new orleans police department joined the fbi in the uneasy marriage of a task force i began to analyze other aspects of the case in sexual homicide the murderers selection criteria for his victims hold the key to every case and like all serial murders the nomurs killingsso dubbed by the fbi for new orleans murdersare at root sexual homicides something always links the victims in these cases even if its nothing more individual than geographic location and that link draws the predator but the nomurs victims have ranged widely in age physical type occupation social status and place of residence the only similarities are that theyre white male over forty and have families these four facts combined exclude them from the known target profiles for serial killers moreover none of the victims is known to have had habits that might draw a predator to an atypical target no victim was gay or had a known sexual paraphilia none was ever arrested for a sexual crime reported for child abuse or known to frequent strip clubs or other sleazy establishments for this reason the nomurs task force has made no progress at all in finding a suspect as i slow the audi to read a house number my skin itches with fear and anticipation the killer was on this street only hours ago he may be here now watching the progress of the investigation as serial murderers often do watching me and herein lies the thrill a predator is not prey when you hunt a predator you place yourself in a position to be hunted yourself theres no other way if you follow a lion into a thicket you step within reach of his claws and my adversary is no lion hes the deadliest creature in the world a human male driven by anger and lust yet governedat least temporarilyby logic he stalks these streets with impunity confident in his prowess meticulous in his planning arrogant in his execution the only thing i know about him is this like all his brothers before him he will kill again and again until someone unravels the riddle of his psyche or he selfdestructs from the intensity of conflict in his own mind a lot of people dont care which way it ends so long as it ends soon i do sean is standing on the sidewalk waiting hes walked a block up from the victims house to meet me he always did have guts but does he have enough to face our present situation i park behind a toyota land cruiser get out and start to unload my cases sean gives me a quick hug then unloads the cases himself hes fortysix years old but looks forty with the easy confident grace of a natural athlete his hair is mostly black his eyes green with a bit of a twinkle even after being his lover for eighteen months i half expect a lilting irish brogue to emerge when sean opens his mouth but its the familiar new orleans accent instead the brooklynesque drawl with a hint of crawfish you doin okay he asks changed your mind he shrugs i felt bad bullshit you wanted to see for yourself if i was sober i see the truth of it in his face he gives me a penetrating survey with his eyes and makes no apology for it go on i tell him what you were about to say something go ahead he sighs you look rough cat thanks for the vote of confidence sorry are you drunk anger tightens my jaw muscles im stone sober for the first time in more years than i can count i see skepticism in his face then as he studies me belief comes into his eyes jesus maybe a drink is what you need worse than you know but im not going to why not come on lets do this i still need to go in ahead of you he looks embarrassed exasperation makes me look away how long five minutes not that long i wave him off and get back into my car he steps toward my door then changes his mind and walks down the block my hands are shaking were they shaking when i woke up i grip the steering wheel and force myself to breathe deeply as my pulse steadies and my heart finds its rhythm i pull down the vanity mirror and check my face im not usually compulsive about my appearance but sean has made me nervous and when i get nervous crazy thoughts flood into my head disembodied voices old nightmares ancient slights and mistakes things therapists have said i consider putting on some eyeliner to strengthen my gaze in case i have to stare somebody down inside i dont really need it men often tell me im beautiful but men will tell any woman that my face is actually masculine in structure a vertical series of vs simple and to the point the v of my chin slants up into a strong jaw my mouth too curves upward then comes the angular bottom of my nose my prominent upwardslanting cheekbones my tilted brown eyes and sloping eyebrows and finally the dark widows peak of my hairline i see my father in all of this twenty years dead now but alive in every angle of my face i keep a picture of him in my wallet luke ferry smiling in his army uniform somewhere in vietnam i dont like the uniformnot after what the war did to himbut i like his eyes in the picture still compassionate still human its how i like to remember him a little girls idea of a father he once told me that i almost got his face but at the last minute an angel swooped down and put enough softness in mine to make me pretty sean sees the hardness in my face hes told me i look like a predator myself a hawk or an eagle tonight im glad for that hardness because as i get out of the audi and shoulder my cases and tripod something tells me that maybe sean is right to be worried about my nerves im going in naked tonight without benefit of anesthesia and without the familiar chemical barrier that shields me from the sharp edges of reality i feel more vulnerable to whatever it was that panicked me last time walking down the dusky street lined with wroughtiron fences and secondfloor galleries i sense a human gaze on my skin i stop and turn but see no one only a dog lifting its leg beside a lamppost i scan the galleries overhead but the heat has driven their owners inside christ i feel as if ive been waiting all my thirtyone years to see the corpse in the house ahead of me or maybe its been waiting for me something is waiting for me thats for sure a crystal image rises into my mind as i resume walking a sweating blue dasani bottle with three inches of grey goose sloshing in its bottom like meltwater from a divine glacier if i had that i could brazen my way through anything youve done this a hundred times i tell myself you did bosnia when you were twentyfive and didnt know shit hey you dr ferry a cop in uniform is calling to me from a high porch on my right the victims house arthur legendre lived in a large victorian typical of the garden district but the vehicles parked in the cross street around the corner are more commonly found in the desire and st thomas housing projectsthe coroners wagon an ambulance nopd squad cars and the fbi suburban that carries the bureaus forensic team i see a couple of unmarked nopd cars too one of them seans climbing the steps i think im fine ten feet inside i know im in trouble chapter a brittle air of expectancy fills the broad central hallway of the victims house and curious eyes track my movements a forensic tech moves through with an alternatelight source searching for latent fingerprints i dont know where the body is but before i have to ask the patrolman standing inside the door sean steps into the rear of the hall and beckons me toward him i go taking care to keep myself balanced with my cases i wish sean would squeeze my arm as i reach him but i know he cant and then he does and i remember why i fell in love with him sean always knows what i need sometimes even before i do how you doin he murmurs a little shaky bodys in the kitchen he takes the heavy case from my right hand this ones a little bloodier than the last but its just another stiff the bureau forensic team has done its thing all but the bite marks kaiser says those are your show that ought to make you feel pretty good kaiser is john kaiser a former fbi profiler who helped solve new orleans s biggest serial murder case in which eleven women disappeared while paintings of their corpses turned up in art galleries around the world kaiser is the bureaus point man on the nomurs task force the scenes more crowded than it should be sean says softly piazzas in there plenty of tension if youre looking but thats not your problem youre a consultant thats it im ready lets do it he opens the door to a gleaming world of granite travertine shining enamel and pickled wood kitchens like this always feel like operating rooms to me and this one actually has a patient in it somewhere a dead one i sweep my eyes over a blur of faces and nod a greeting captain carmen piazza nods back then i look down and see a blood trail on the floor someone has crawled or been dragged across the marble floor to a spot behind the island at the center of the kitchen dragged i decide behind the island sean says from my shoulder someone has set up a floodlight when i round the island i see a stunning technicolor image of a naked corpse lying on its back the details of the upper body hit me in a surreal rush livid bite marks on the chest bloody ones on the face one bullet hole in the center of the abdomen a contact gunshot wound to the forehead the superfine blood spatter of a highspeedimpact wound has dotted the marble tiles like a monochrome pollock painting behind the victims head arthur legendres face is a frozen shriek of horror and pain shocked into permanence when part of his brain was blown out through the back of his skull i force my eyes away from the bite marks on the chest the lower body has its own tale to tell arthur legendre isnt nude after all he wears black nylon socks like a man in a s porno loop his penis is a pale acorn in a nest of gray pubic hair but i can see blood and bruising there i take a step forward and my breath catches in my throat scrawled in blood across two cabinet doors on the wall of the island opposite the sink are five words my work is never done rivulets of blood have dripped down the cabinet doors giving the message an almost comical halloween look but theres nothing comical about the pool of separated blood and serum under the elbow of the dead man legendres antecubital vein was sliced to provide the blood for this macabre message the tip of his right forefinger was obviously dipped in blood did the killer write the words with his victims dead finger to avoid leaving his own fingerprint in the blood or did he force legendre to write the message prior to death freehistamine tests will answer that question i need to start working but i cant take my eyes off the message my work is never done its a common phrase so common i can hear my mothers voice saying it in my head you need any help dr ferry what john kaiser says the same voice i look over at a tall lanky man of about fifty he has a friendly face with hazel eyes that miss nothing hes left off his title special agent john kaiser you need help with your lights or anything for the uv photography feeling oddly detached i shake my head hes getting more savage kaiser observes losing control maybe the face is actually torn this time i nod again theres subcutaneous fat showing through the cheek the floor shudders as sean sets my heavy dental case beside me too late i try to conceal that i jerked when the vibration went through me i tell myself to breathe deeply but my throat is already closing and a film of sweat has coated my skin one step at a time shoot the bites with the millimeter quartz lens standard color film first then get out the filters and start on the uv after that take your alginate impressions as i bend and flip the latches on my case i feel like im moving at half speed a dozen pairs of eyes are watching me and their gazes seem to be interfering with my nerve impulses sean will notice my awkwardness but maybe no one else will its the same mouth i say softly what asks agent kaiser same killer hes got slightly pegged lateral incisors i see it on the chest bites thats not conclusive im just saying my preliminary assessment right of course you sure you dont need some help what the hell am i saying of course its the same guy everybody in this room knows that im just here to document and preserve the evidence to the highest possible degree of accuracy im opening the wrong case i need my camera not my impression kit jesus keep it together but i cant as i bend farther down to open my camera case a wave of dizziness nearly tips me onto the floor i retrieve the camera straighten up switch it on then realize ive forgotten to set up my tripod and then it happens in three seconds i go from mild anxiety to hyperventilation like an old lady about to faint in church which is unbelievable i can breathe more efficiently than percent of the human population when im not working as an odontologist im a free diver a worldclass competitor in a sport whose participants commonly dive to three hundred feet using only the air trapped in their lungs some people call free diving competitive suicide and theres some truth to that i can lie on the bottom of a swimming pool with a weight belt for over six minutes without air a feat that would kill most people yet nowstanding at sea level in the kitchen of a ritzy town housei cant even drink from the ocean of oxygen that surrounds me dr ferry says agent kaiser are you all right panic attack i tell myself vicious circle the anxiety worsens the symptoms and the symptoms rev up the anxiety you have to break the cycle arthur legendres corpse wavers in my vision as though its lying on the bottom of a shallow river sean asks kaiser is she all right dont let this happen i beg silently please but no one hears my prayer whatever is happening to me has been waiting a long time to happen a slow black train has been coming toward me for a very long time from very far away and now that its finally reached me it plows over me without pain or sound and everything goes black chapter a female emt is kneeling over me reading from a blood pressure cuff strapped to my arm the deflating cuff awakened me sean regan and special agent kaiser are standing over the emt looking worried a little low says the tech i think she fainted her ekg is normal sugars a little low but shes not hypoglycemic the tech notices that my eyes are open when was the last time you ate dr ferry i dont remember we should get some orange juice into you fix you right up i look to my left the stockinged feet of arthur legendres corpse lie beside my head its legs and torso extend away from me at a right angle down a different side of the kitchen island i glance in that direction and see the bloody message again my work is never done any oj in that fridge asks the emt crime scene says agent kaiser cant disturb that anybody got a candy bar a reluctant male voice says i got a snickers its my supper you on atkins again sean quips and nervous laughter follows cough it up everybody laughs now grateful for the release of tension as i get to my feet sean reaches out to steady me a paunchy detective steps forward and hands me his snickers bar i make a show of gratitude and accept it though i know i have no blood sugar problem this charade is witnessed by a rapt audience that includes carmen piazza commander of the homicide division im sorry i say in her direction i dont know what happened same thing as last time looks like piazza observes i guess so im okay now though im ready captain piazza leans toward me and speaks softly step out here with me for a moment dr ferry you too detective regan piazza walks into the hallway sean gives me a warning glance then turns and follows her the captain leads us into a study off the central hall where she leans back against a desk and faces us arms folded jaw set tight i can easily imagine this oliveskinned woman facing down armed street punks during her years in uniform this isnt the place to talk about complications she says so im not going to i dont know whats going on between you two and i dont want to know what i do know is that its jeopardizing this investigation so heres what were going to do dr ferry is going to go home the fbi will handle the bite marks tonight and unless the bureau objects im going to request that a new forensic odontologist be assigned to the task force i want to argue but piazza has said nothing about my episode in the kitchen shes talking about something for which i have no defense something about which sean told me not to worry but why am i angry adulterers think theyre discreet but people always find out a patrolman steps into the study and sets my tripod and dental cases on the floor when did piazza tell him to pack them while i was unconscious after he leaves piazza says sean walk dr ferry back to her car be back here in two minutes and be in my office tomorrow morning at eight sharp clear seans eyes lock with his superiors yes maam captain piazza looks at me her face not without compassion dr ferry youve done some remarkable work for us in the past i hope you get to the bottom of whatever this problem is i suggest you see a doctor if you havent already i dont think a vacations going to do it for you she walks out leaving me alone with my married lover and the latest mess i seem to have made of my life sean picks up my cases and starts for the front door we cant risk talking here warm water drips from the oak leaves as we walk down the block in silence it rained while i was inside a typical new orleans shower that did nothing to cool or cleanse the city only added more water vapor to the smothering humidity and washed more filth into lake pontchartrain the air smells of banana trees though and in the darkness the street has a deceptively romantic look what happened in there sean asks not looking at me another panic attack my hands are shaking but whether from my episode inside alcohol withdrawal or the confrontation with captain piazza i dont know i guess i dont know is it these particular murders it started with the third victim nolan i can tell by seans voice that hes worried i dont think so he looks over at me is it us cat of course its us i dont know i told you karen and i are talking about seeing a lawyer now its just the kids you know we dont start okay not tonight my throat tightens and a sour taste fills my mouth im in this situation because i put myself in it i know but please i make a fist to stop my right hand from shaking okay this time sean heeds the hysteria in my voice when we reach the audi he takes my keys unlocks the door and loads my cases into the backseat then he looks back up the block toward the legendre house probably to make sure piazza isnt watching us that he has to do this even now is like a knife in my belly tell me whats really going on he says turning back to me theres something youre not telling me yes but im not going to play that particular scene here not now not like this even i cling to some fairytale dreams and this wet street after a murder isnt part of them i cant do this i tell him its all i can manage his green eyes widen in a silent plea they have a remarkable intensity sometimes we have to talk cat tonight i dont reply ill get away as soon as i can he promises all right i say knowing its the only way to get out of here theres captain piazza seans head whips to the left where another knife thrust i thought i saw her youd better get back in there he squeezes my upper arms then opens the door of the audi and helps me inside be careful driving home dont worry about me instead of leaving he kneels in the open door clasps my left wrist and speaks with genuine urgency i am worried about you what is it i know you damn it tell me i crank the engine and pull slowly away from the curb leaving sean no choice but to let go of my wrist cat he yells but i close the door and drive on leaving him standing in the wet street staring after my taillights im pregnant i tell him far too late two miles from my house on lake pontchartrain i realize i cant go home if i do the walls will close around me like suffocating pillows and ill pace the shrinking rooms like a madwoman until sean pulls into the garage and lets down the door with his remote control every word he says after that i will hear against a ticking clock that marks the time remaining before he has to go home to his wife and kids and i absolutely cannot endure that tonight normally after working a crime scene i stop at a liquor store and buy a bottle of vodka but not tonight the little agglomeration of cells growing inside me is the only pure thing in my life right now and i will not do it injury even if it means the screaming heebiejeebies and a rubber room thats the only thing im sure of this minute i tried to go cold turkey in the beginning thinking it was best for the baby twenty hours into that particular mistake i got the shakes so bad i couldnt unzip my jeans to pee a couple of hours later i started seeing snakes in the house a small rattler in a corner of the kitchen curled into a deadly spiral a fat cottonmouth moccasin hanging from a fern planter in the living room a brilliantly hued coral snake sunning itself in the painful glare by the glass doors in the den all lethal all planning to slither up to me bury their fangs in my flesh and not let go until every drop of poison in their venom sacs had been injected into me hello delirium tremens cold turkey wasnt going to cut it i hit my medical books which told me that the first fortyeight hours of withdrawal would be the worst addiction specialists prescribe valium to blunt the physical symptoms while the psychological addiction is cured but valium can cause cleft palate in a developing fetus the risk depending on dosage and duration of use the fullblown dts on the other hand can cause seizure stroke and death in the mother this choice of evils was ultimately no choice at all i know a dozen oral surgeons who can repair a cleft palate i know no one who can bring back the dead when the coral snake began slithering toward me i climbed onto a table called the rite aid pharmacy and selfprescribed enough valium to get me through fortyeight hours the audis tires squeal as i wrench it into a uturn and stop at the base of the interstate onramp cars and trucks roar by angrily blasting their horns an hour of driving west on i would put me in baton rouge from baton rouge highway follows the mississippi river northward for ninety miles to natchez mississippi my childhood home ive begun that journey many times without completing it tonight though home i say silently the place where when you have to go there they have to let you in i cant remember who said that but its always seemed apt to me on the face of things it shouldnt my family has always begged me to visit my mother actually wants me to move back into the house where i grew up house isnt exactly accurate its an estate big enough to hold me and about twelve other families but i could never move back to that house i cant even move back to natchez and i dont know why its a beautiful city more so than new orleans in many ways certainly safer and more peaceful and its drawn back many whove tried to leave it over the years but not me you leave a place young and you dont know why only that you have to get out i graduated high school when i was sixteen left for college and never looked back the one or two interesting boys i knew wanted out as badly as i did and they made it too i returned for christmases and thanksgivings but little else and this deeply wounded my family they never understood and they never let me forget it looking back across fifteen years i think i fled my home because elsewhereanywherecat ferry was only what i could make of her in natchez she was heir to a suffocating matrix of expectations and obligations that i couldnt bear to face but now ive wrecked my carefully constructed sanctuary it was inevitable of course ive been warned by the best as predicted my troubles here now dwarf those i left behind me and my options have dwindled to one for a moment i consider going back to my house and packing a bag but if i do that ill never leave the pregnancy scene with sean will be played out and thenmaybe the end for us or perhaps only for me im not going to walk myself up to that ledge tonight my cell phone rings out sunday bloody sunday again the screen reads det sean regan im tempted to answer but sean isnt calling about the case he wants to see me to question me about my episode at the crime scene he wants to hash out what captain piazza might or might not know about our affair to decompress after the frustration of dealing with the task force he wants sex i switch the ringer to silent and drive up the ramp joining the night traffic leaving the city chapter in the south you are never far from the wild in less than ten minutes i leaps off terra firma and sweeps over a fetid marsh filled with alligators pit vipers wild hogs and panthers all through the night they will stalk and kill enacting the ritual of death that preserves their lives predators and prey an eternal dance which am i sean would say hunter and he wouldnt be wrong but he wouldnt be quite right either ive been prey in my life i carry scars sean has never seen im neither predator nor prey now but a hybrid creature who knows the minds of both i track predators to protect the most endangered species of allthe innocent a naive term these days perhaps the innocent no one who reaches adulthood with his sanity intact is innocent but none of us deserves to be prey for the truly damned the older men dying back in new orleans did something to draw their killer to them something innocuous perhapsor maybe something terrible im concerned with that only insofar as it helps me find the killer who took their lives but of course i shouldnt be concerned with it at all because captain piazza has excluded me from that hunt no you excluded yourself chides the censor in my head my cell phone lights up green on the passenger seat sean again i turn over the phone so i wont have to see the glow for the past year when anxiety or depression has become unbearable ive run to sean regan tonight im running away from him im running because im afraid when sean learns that im pregnantand that i intend to keep the babyhe will either honor the promises hes made to me or betray them and im terrified that he wont give up his family for me this fear is so tangible that the outcome seems a foregone conclusion something ive known all along and was foolish to ever lie to myself about sean has never hidden his doubts he worries about my drinking my depression my occasional manic states he worries that i cant be sexually faithful based on my history these are legitimate concerns but at some point i believe you just have to go for it to risk everything for the other person regardless of your fears besidescant sean see that if he doesnt have faith in me after coming to know me so intimately its so much harder for me to have faith in myself my hands are shaking on the wheel i need another valium but i dont want to risk falling asleep on the interstate suck it up i tell myself the mantra of my youth and the unwritten motto of my family after all its not as if my present dilemma is new i never got pregnant before but pregnancy is merely a new wrinkle in an old habit ive always chosen unattainable men in some ways my whole life has been a series of inexplicable decisions and unresolved paradoxes two therapists have thrown up their hands in despair over my ability to function at my present level despite selfdestructive behavior that keeps me dancing on the edge of disaster my relationship with my present therapist dr hannah goldman has survived only because she allows me to skip my scheduled appointments and call her whenever i feel i need her i dont require face time just an understanding voice actually its about time i gave hannah a call she doesnt know about my pregnancy she doesnt know about my panic attacks either after four years with her i still find it difficult to ask for help i come from a family that believes depression is a weakness not an illness i didnt see a therapist as a child when one might have done me some real good my grandfather a surgeon believes psychiatrists are sicker than their patients my father a vietnam vet saw several va therapists before he died but none was able to alleviate the symptoms of his posttraumatic stress disorder my mother also discouraged therapy saying shrinks had never done her older sister any good and that one had even seduced her when suicidal impulses finally convinced me to seek treatmentat the age of twentyfourneither the mds nor the psychologists were able to control my mood swings ease my nightmares or slow my drinking and occasional reckless sexual behavior for meuntil hannah goldman and her laissezfaire styletherapy was pretty much a washout and yetthough my present situation would qualify as a crisis in hannahs book i cant quite bring myself to call her as the night landscape changes from wet bottomland to hilly forests of oak and pine i sense the great river out to my left rolling southward as it has for millennia oblivious to human travail the mississippi river links the town of my birth to the city of my adulthood a great winding artery connecting the two spiritual poles of my existence infancy and independence yet how independent am i natchez the upstream cityolder than new orleans by two years versus is the source of all that i am whether i like it or not and tonight the prodigal daughter is returning home at eightyfive miles an hour forward and backward hurtling around curves in the dark forest i feel a sort of emotional gravity sucking at my bones but until the sign that reads angola penitentiary flashes out of the night im not sure why then i know just south of the razorwireenclosed fields known as angola farm a great island rises out of the river owned by my family since before the civil war this atavistic world hovers like a dark mirage between the genteel cities of new orleans and natchez i havent set foot on desalle island in more than ten years but i sense it now the way you sense a dangerous animal stirring from sleep only a dozen miles to my left it sniffs for my scent in the humid darkness i step on the gas and put the place behind me slipping into a driving trance that carries me the remainder of my journey i slip out of it not on the outskirts of natchez but on the highbanked curving drive that leads through the woods to my childhood home once surrounded by two hundred acres of virgin forest the antebellum estate where i grew up now occupies only twenty landscaped acres hedged around by st catherines hospital a residential subdivision and a stately old plantation called elms court nevertheless the tunnel of oaks that arches over the drive still gives tourists the sense of approaching a cloistered european manor a high wroughtiron gate blocks the last fifty yards of the driveway but its been unlocked for as long as i can remember i stop and press a button on the gatepost the iron bars retract as though pulled by unseen hands as though the gods themselves have opened my way home why am i here i ask myself you know why replies a chiding voice you have nowhere else to go after dryswallowing a valium i drive slowly through the gate the bars close behind me with a clang chapter in a vast clearing ahead moonlight washes over a sight that takes most peoples breath away a french palace rises like a specter out of the mist its limestone walls as pale as skin its windows like dark eyes glassy from fatigue or drink the scale of the place is heroic projecting an impression of limitless wealth and power viewed through the prism of a modern eye the mansion has a certain absurdity a french empire palace nestled in a mississippi town of twenty thousand souls yet natchez contains more than eighty antebellum homes many of them mansions and the provenance of this one perfectly suits the town a living anachronism of grand excess much of it built by the hands of slaves my family arrived in america in in the person of a paris financiers youngest son sent to the wilds of louisiana to make his fortune cursed with a cruel father henri leclerc desalle worked like a slave himself until he surpassed all paternal expectations by he owned cotton fields stretching for ten miles along the mississippi river and in that year like most of the cotton barons of the time he began building a regal mansion on the high bluff across the river in the sparkling city called natchez most cotton planters built boxy greek revival mansions but henri fiercely proud of his heritage broke tradition and constructed a perfect copy of malmaison the summer palace of napol√£on and josephine designed to humble desalles father when he visited america malmaison and its attendant buildings became the center of a cotton empire thatthanks to my familys yankee sympathiessurvived both the civil war and reconstruction without mortal damage it endured until when the mississippi overran its banks in a flood of biblical proportions the following year came crop fires and in the stock market crash completed the proverbial three bad years that even wealthy farming families dreaded the desalles lost everything the patriarch of that era shot himself through the heart leaving his descendants to scrape out a meager existence alongside the blacks and poor whites they had so recently exploited but in fortune reversed herself again a young geologist with texas backers leased a huge tract of former desalle land through a quirk in louisiana law landowners retained the mineral rights to their property for ten years after it was forfeited my greatgrandfather was ecstatic just to get the lease money but nineteen days before his mineral rights expired the young geologist struck one of the largest oil fields in louisiana christened the desalle field it produced over million barrels of crude oil my greatgrandfather eventually bought back every acre of desalle land including the island he also bought back malmaison and restored the house to its precivil war splendor its present owner my maternal grandfather keeps malmaison in pristine condition worthy of the architectural digest cover it graced ten years ago but the city that surrounds the mansion though as well preserved as charleston or savannah seems as doomed to slow decay as any other southern town bypassed by the interstate and abandoned by industry i pull around the big house and park beside one of the two brick dependencies behind it the eastern slave quartersa twostory edifice larger than some suburban houseswas my home during most of my childhood our familys maid pearlie lives in the western quarters thirty yards across the rose garden she helped rear my mother and aunt from infancy then did the same with me well over seventy now pearlie drives a baby blue cadillac the pride of her life it sits gleaming in the darkness behind her house its chrome polished more regularly than that on the cars of any white matron in the city pearlie often stays up late watching television but its past midnight now and her windows are dark my mothers car is nowhere in sight shes probably in biloxi visiting her elder sister whos embroiled in a bitter divorce my grandfathers lincoln is gone too at seventyseven grandpapa kirkland still possesses remarkable vitality but a stroke a year ago ended his driving days undeterred he hired a driver and resumed the pace hed always kept up which would exhaust a man of fifty grandpapa could be anywhere tonight but my guess is that hes on the island hes an avid hunter and desalle islandwhich teems with deer wild hogs and even bearhas been a second home to him since he married into the family a half century ago when i get out of the audi the summer heat wraps around me like a thick jacket the whine of crickets and the bellow of frogs from the nearby bayou fills the night but this soundtrack from my childhood brings mixed feelings as i glance toward the rear of malmaison proper my eyes lock onto a gnarled dogwood tree at the edge of the rose garden that separates our house from pearlies and my throat seals shut my father perished under that tree shot dead by an intruder he confronted there twentythree years ago i cant look at the dogwood without remembering that night blue police lights flashing through rain wet gray flesh glassy eyes open to the sky ive asked grandpapa many times to cut down that tree but hes always refused claiming it would be foolish to mar the beauty of our famed rose garden out of sentimentality sentimentality i stopped speaking after my father was murdered literally i didnt utter a word for over a year but in my eightyearold brain i ceaselessly pondered what the intruder had come looking for that was worth my fathers life cash the family silver grandpapas art or gun collections all were possible targets but no money or property was ever discovered missing as i grew older i wondered if it could have been my mother that drew the prowler she was scarcely thirty then and could easily have caught the attention of a rapist but since the intruder was never caught this theory couldnt be tested after my first depressive episodei was fifteena new fear crept into my mind that there had been no intruder at all my father was shot with his own rifle and the only fingerprints found on it belonged to family members i couldnt help but wonder whether my daddyscarred within and without by a war hed wanted no part ofhad chosen to end his own life whether even with a wife and daughter who loved him hed felt he had no choice but to stop his pain with a bullet id been close to that point myself by then so i knew it was possible ive reached that point again in the years since and more than once yet something has always kept me from accepting suicide as my fathers fate perhaps its my belief that the strength that kept me alive during those terrible nights was a gift from him to me the only legacy he left behind i hate the fucking rose garden patterned on the malmaison gardens tended by josephine herself where every variety of rose in the world was represented it fills the air of malmaison with scents that make tourists gasp with pleasure but for me the smell of roses will always be part of the stench of death i turn away from the garden and with paranoia born from years of urban living unload my dental cases from the backseat only when im halfway to the door of our slave quarters do i remember that in natchez i could leave my cases in the unlocked car for a month and find them just as id left them when i returned the front door is locked i have no key trudging around to the window of my old bedroom i set down my cases and slide up the pane the closedin smell that wafts through the curtains hurls me fifteen years back in time i lift the cases over the sill set them inside then climb through and make my way through the dark to the light switch on the wall its an easy journey because my bedroom looks exactly as it did in may of when i graduated high school the walls are brown s paneling the carpet the same navy blue installed the year i was born silk dragonflies of myriad colors hang from filaments tacked to the ceiling and posters of rock stars adorn the walls u sinead oconnor rem sting shelves of photographs and swimming trophies line the wall opposite my closet chronicling a competitive career that began at five and ended at sixteen the older photographs show my fathera dark handsome man of medium heightstanding next to a gangly little girl with long bones but no apparent muscle as the girls body begins to fill in my father vanishes from the photos and an older man with silver hair chiseled features and piercing eyes takes his place my grandfather dr william kirkland studying the photos now it seems odd that my mother is in so few of them but mom never took much of an interest in my swimming an unsocial activity that consumed vast amounts of time that could otherwise have been spent in more appropriate pursuits glancing into the closet i see clothes i wore in high school hanging there beneath the clothes a wicker laundry basket filled with louisiana rice creatures the sight of the clothes doesnt affect me but the colorful stuffed animals bring a lump to my throat originally stuffed with dried rice rice creatures were local precursors of the beanie babies that later became a national craze there must be thirty of them in the basket but the only one that really matters to me is missing lena the leopardess lena was my favorite and im not sure why maybe because she was a cat like me i loved lena s spots i loved her whiskers i loved how she felt pressed against my cheek while i fell asleep i carried her everywhere i went including my fathers funeral it was there surrounded by adults in the visiting room prior to the service that i saw my father lying in his coffin he didnt look like my father anymore he looked older and he looked very alone when i pointed this out my grandfather suggested that daddy might not feel so lonely if he had lena for company while he slept the idea of losing lena and my father on the same day frightened me but grandpapa was right lena made me less lonely every night and i was sure she could do the same for daddy after asking mom if it was okay i reached over the high side of the coffin and nestled lena between my fathers cheek and shoulder just as i did with her every night i missed her badly after that but i comforted myself with the thought that daddy had a little piece of my heart to keep him company standing in this bedroom is creeping me out as it has on each of the occasions when ive returned home why does my mother preserve it this way shes an interior designer for gods sake practically manic in her desire to transform every space over which shes given dominion is it an homage to my childhood to a simpler past or is it an open invitation to me to come back and start over at a point before i veered off track just when that wasmy personal failure as a desalle womanis a point of contention within my family in my grandfathers eyes i didnt screw up until i was asked to leave medical school which precluded my following in his footsteps as a surgeon but in my mothers eyes my failure began long before at some indeterminate point during adolescence though im not a desalle by namemy father was a ferryi am very much considered a desalle woman which carries with it a legion of traditions and expectations but a thousand small choices have taken me ever further from this predestined road onto one that hasnt led me within a stones throw of a husband a fact my mother never lets me forget im actually thankful i arrived tonight to find her gone as i stare at a photograph of my father holding my hand high in triumph the valium enters my bloodstream and a blessed calm comes over me because my father died when i was eight it was he alone that i never disappointed i like to think that had he lived he would be proud of what ive accomplished as for my problemswell luke ferry had problems of his own i pull back the spread on my permanently made bed and take my cell phone from my pocket a pang of guilt hits me when i see thirteen missed calls punching to check my voice mail i listen to the first message sean called me even before he left arthur legendres house in a reassuring voice he tells me to stay calm that piazza is his problem not mine and then he begs me to keep myself together until he gets there there being my house on the lake i skip ahead several messages the change in seans voice is astonishing its me again he says angrily im still at your house and i have no fucking idea where you are please call me back even if you dont want to see me i dont know if youre drunk in some dive in the quarter or lying dead in a ditch somewhere have you stopped taking your meds somethings wrong cat i know it and i dont mean the murders lookyou have to trust me and you know you can theres a crackling pause damn it i love you and this is bullshit this is why were not together already im sitting in this empty house and theres a click then nothing this message exhausted the phones available memory i slip off my pants and draw the bedcovers up to my chest i want to call sean and tell him im all right but the truth is im not in fact i might be losing my mind but theres nothing he can do about that as the cell phone drops from my hand i see an image of arthur legendre lying dead in his gleaming kitchen black socks pulled up on his white sticklike legs above his corpse floats the killers message painted in blood my work is never done again i see the bite marks on legendres bloodless flesh one more set in the endless train of scars and mutilation ive witnessed over the past seven years is this really my job how can someones lifes work be the analysis of something so brutal so small so irritatingly specialized there has to be more to my choice of career but what my fathers mysterious death too obvious my work is never done i murmur feeling the valium course through my veins earlier today the sedative id swallowed to combat my alcohol withdrawal gave me an unexpected gift dreamless sleep i havent known such relief for years thank you i whisper to the drug as though to the god of sleep my left hand slides over my hip and comes to rest on my lower tummy my right hand slips out of the covers reaching for a hand that isnt there daddy i whisper is that you he doesnt answer he never does but tonight the aching loneliness that accompanies thoughts of my father isnt so severe valium pads the edges of the pain easing my descent into sleep for years ive suffered from nightmares and lately the alcohol i use to deaden them seems to have made them worse but the valium is an unfamiliar drug as fresh and potent as the first drink i ever swallowed tonight sleep enfolds me like the ocean depths on a free dive a bright upper layer that deepens in color and density as i descend swimming down down down away from the chaos of the surface into the blue cathedral of the deep my sanctuary from the world and from myself no thoughts here beyond the exigencies of survival only peace the bliss of entering a place where but a handful of humans can go without bottled air where death is a constant companion where life is sweeter for the awareness of its fragility here i am weightless shapeless an astronaut drifting through deep space without a tether unconcerned that her life support systems have shut down that her body must sustain itself or die anyone with a lick of sense would kick madly for the surface not me because here i am free i dont know how long i float this way because time means nothing here what i do know is that i must be sleeping because on a real free dive time means everything time is the remaining oxygen dissolved in your bloodstream the only currency that can buy you depth and depth is the holy grail the point of the whole mad exercise or its supposed to be anyway that part confuses me actually because you can never reach the bottom not in the real ocean its only back on land that you can do that surfacing now i know because the sea has slowly stopped trying to drive my wet suit into every opening in my body and bluewhite lightning is flashing above me a sudden storm i tense against the inevitable clap of thunder but it doesnt come when the lightning flashes again a strange sound registers in my mind not thundernot even the lap of waves against the dive boat its the snick of a camera shutter when i finally break through the surface i smell acetone not the ozone that follows a lightning strike blinking in confusion i call out sean sean is that you a dark brown forehead and saucer eyes rise above the footboard of my bed a nose and mouth follow the mouth agape in wonder im looking into the face of a black girl of about eight she has the frozen look of a child who has entered a familiar yard only to find a strange dog waiting for her who are you i ask half wondering if the girl is real natriece she says her voice almost defiant natriece washington i glance around the room but all that registers is the sunlight pouring through a crack in some curtains what are you doing here the girls eyes are still wide i be here with my auntie i didnt mean to make no mess your auntie the smell of acetone is stronger now miss pearlie suddenly it all comes rushing back the phone call from sean the corpse in the house on prytania street the zonedout night drive to natchez what an irony to find that you do crazier things sober than you ever did drunk what time is it the child gives an exaggerated shrug i dont know morning time pushing down the covers i crawl to the foot of the bed the contents of my forensic dental case are spread across the floor in disarray natriece is holding my camera its flash must have caused the lightning that awakened me among the instruments and chemicals on the floor lies a spray bottle of luminol a toxic chemical used to detect latent bloodstains did you spray any of that natriece she solemnly shakes her head i gently take the camera from her grasp its all right if you did i just need to know i mightve sprayed a little bit i get out of bed and pull on my pants its okay but you need to leave the room while i clean it up thats a dangerous chemical in that bottle ill help you clean up i knows how to clean tell you what lets go visit your auntie and then ill come back and deal with this i havent seen pearlie in a long time natriece nods she told me nobody was out here she just unlocked the door to get mrs ferrys wash i take the little girls hand and lead her to the door then flip off the light and walk into the hall natriece lingers behind standing with her back to me looking into the dark room did you leave something i ask no maam i just looking at that what that there did i do that i look over the girls head on the floor near the foot of my bed a greenish blue glow hovers in the darkness the luminol has reacted with something on the carpet the chemical registers false positives with several compounds one of them household bleach its all right i tell her dreading my mothers reaction to the mess natriece has made freaky she says that looks like ghostbusters or something stepping around natriece i look down at the luminescence on the floor its not diffuse as i had thought but well defined suddenly an eerie numbness spreads through my body im looking at a footprint i felt the same numbness twentythree years ago when my grandfather turned away from the first corpse i ever saw knelt before me and said baby your daddys dead natriece stay back yessum actually it isnt a footprint at all but a boot print i only register this fact because now another ghostlike image has taken shape beside it the image of a bare foot much smaller than the boot a childs foot with slow insistence a percussive hiss intrudes into my concentration subtly at first but growing steadily to a soft roar its the sound of rain drumming on a tin roof which makes no sense because the slave quarters has a shingle roofnot tinand im standing on the first of two floors but ive heard this sound before and i know it for what it is an auditory hallucination i heard the same metallic patter a week ago at the nolan murder scene just before my panic attack i was staring down at the retired cpas naked corpse and a rapid beat of footsteps startles me from my reverie natriece has bolted down the hall a scream cuts the air in the bedroom nanna nanna nanna checking my watch i wait for the glowing footprints to fade false positives generally fade quickly while the luminescence caused by the hemoglobin in blood lingers like an accusation thirty seconds pass i look around the bedroom this strange shrine to my childhood then i look back at the floor a minute now and the glow shows no sign of diminishing come on i whisper fade my hands are trembling i want to run for pearlie too but im no longer a child my eyes blur from the strain of focusing so hard could that be the imprint of my own foot bloodstains can endure for decades on some surfaces fade i plead but my plea does no good ive been drinking for over fifteen years ive been sober now for fortyeight hours ive never needed a drink so badly in my life chapter inside my mind instinct is at war with itself as i stare down at the two glowing footprints half of me wants to run the other half to lock the door i want photographs of the prints but to get them ill have to act quickly once the chemical reaction that causes the blood hidden in the carpet to luminesce is complete it cant be repeated the front door of the house bangs shut pearlie i cross the bedroom and lock the door then i open my camera case bring out my slr and fit a standard mm lens and cable release to it damn i forgot to unload my tripod from the trunk of my car someone raps sharply on my bedroom door a rush of d√£j√£ vu tells me that rhythm belongs to pearlie catherine ferry calls a throaty voice as familiar to me as my mothers you in there girl im here pearlie what you doing home last time you came back wasi dont know when why you didnt call ahead i cant waste time trying to explain the situation ill be out in a few minutes okay grabbing my car keys i slide up the window climb out and run to my car tripod in hand i climb back into the bedroom close the curtains and set up the tripod almost directly above the footprints pearlie is still knocking on the door after mounting the camera and aiming it downward i switch on the lights and shoot a reference photo of the floor then i close down the lens aperture by two fstops take a ruler from my dental case and switch off the overhead light the ruler has copper wire wrapped around the inch markings the copper will fluoresce when sprayed with luminol laying the ruler alongside the glowing footprint i spray both ruler and bloodstain with more of the chemical and wait what you doing in there pearlie demands did natriece mess up something im all right i snap just give me a minute i hear the muted chatter of pearlie interrogating the little girl as the greenishwhite glow begins to increase in intensity i open the camera shutter with the cable release and look at my dive watch to capture the faint glow of luminol in the dark i need a sixtysecond exposure my hands are shaking badly but the cable release will keep the camera from vibrating this time the tremor isnt from medication or alcohol withdrawal its fear the same sickening panic i felt at the legendre crime scene and at the nolan scene before that if it werent for the childs footprint id assume the boot print was made with deer blood whitetail often wander onto the grounds of malmaison and my grandfather has been known to shoot a buck now and again sometimes from the window of his study but the childs footprint is there when my watch hits the sixtysecond mark i close the shutter then to be sure i capture the prints i open the lens aperture by one fstop and repeat the procedure by then pearlie is squawking through the door catherine desalle ferry you open this door the familiar ritual of crime scene photography is calming my nerves habits have great comforting powereven bad habits as i discovered long ago answer me girl i cant read your mind like i used to youve grown up too much and been gone too long i smile in spite of my fear the year after my father diedthe year i stopped speakingonly pearlie was able to communicate with me the stoic maid could read my emotions in a glance from the curl of a lip to the angle of my downcast eyes im coming i call going to the door as soon as i turn the knob pearlie pushes open the door and stands with her hands on her hips over seventy years old she is tall thin and tough as gristle with chocolate brown skin and clear traces of caucasian ancestry in her facial features her eyes still flash with intelligence and wit and her barkthough intimidating to strangersis considerably worse than her bite around my grandfather and my mother pearlie displays the quiet dignity of a nineteenthcentury servant she can vanish as silently as a ghost when certain whites enter a room but around me she is much more animated treating me as she might a daughter she still wears a starched white uniform which you dont see much anymore and a shiny reddish brown wig to cover her grizzled white hair ive missed her more than i realized for her part i see a mixture of pique and excitement in her eyes as though she doesnt know whether to hug me or spank me were it not for natrieces fear and the odd scene in the bedroom pearlie would undoubtedly crush me to her chest answer me this minute she demands you aint been home since your grandmothers funeral and thats been a year now fifteen months i correct fighting a new wave of emotion that i cant afford to face right now last june my grandmother drowned on desalle island part of the sandbar she was standing on simply slid into the mississippi river there was no warning four people saw it happen yet no one could save her no one even saw her surface after the bar collapsed catherine poitiers kirkland was an excellent swimmer in her youthshe taught me to swimbut at seventyfive shed been no match for the mighty current of the mississippi lord lord pearlie sighs wellwhy didnt you call to say you was coming i would have cooked for you it was an impulse aint it always with you she gives me a knowing look then pushes past me into the bedroom whats going on in here natriece told me theys a ghost in here i see the little girl standing just outside the door there is in a way go look at the carpet by the foot of the bed pearlie walks over to the tripod bends at the waist and examines the floor with the eagle eye of a woman who has spent decades eradicating the slightest specks of dirt from her house whats making that rug look like that blood old bloodstains hidden in the carpet fibers its reacting with a chemical that natriece sprayed on it by accident blood pearlie says skeptically i dont see no blood that looks like them halloween teeth you used to wear when you was a child vampire teeth like count dracula its the same principle but theres blood there you can count on that blood the only thing make that stuff glow no i concede some metals will do it household bleach can do it have you spilled clorox in here or in the laundry room and then tracked it in here pearlie purses her lips cant say i have cant say i aint either could have done i guess ive seen lots of stains like this blood has a particular kind of glow with luminol and im ninetyfive percent sure im looking at blood well i dont hardly see nothing now it fades pretty quickly thats why i took pictures of it pearlie always minimized the negative aspects of any situation part of what she was paid for i suppose i even used to hear her sing an old johnny mercer song to that effect while she worked you got to accentuate the positive eliminate the negative could be deer blood pearlie suggests or armadillo maybe dr kirkland shoots armadillos round here all the time they always digging up the yard nasty things there are tests that will tell me whether the bloods human you know it would take a lot of blood to make prints this well defined theres a boot print and also the print of a childs bare foot pearlie stares down with mute skepticism have there been any children around here since i left im an only child and my aunt ann despite three marriages has no children has natriece been around here much pearlie shakes her head my kids live in chicago and los angeles you know that and natriece only been to this house two times before this she never been out here that i know about she turns and glares at natriece you ever been in this room before child no maam answer me straight now i aint one of them soft teachers you got at school im telling you true as natriece pooches out her lower lip i kneel and study the fading image of the bare foot pearlies right its nearly vanished natriece will you take off your flipflop and put your foot over here in blood not in it just hold your foot above the rug the little girl slips off her yellow flipflop and places a callused foot in my waiting hands i hold it just above the dying glow of the footprint its almost a perfect match how old are you natriece six but i be big for my age i think youre right i had guessed her age as eight so her foot is probably about the size of a normal eightyearolds pearlie is watching me with a worried look wheres mom pearlie where you think gone to biloxi again to see aunt ann what else that ann draws trouble like my sheba draws tomcats what about grandpapa dr kirkland gone off on another trip he supposed to get back later today though where has he been the island lord no he aint been down there in a good while where then pearlies face closes i aint supposed to say not even to me i dont know pearlie the maid sighs and cocks her head at me she and i have kept each others secrets for years pearlie kept quiet about my sneaking in and out of the house as a teenager which she usually witnessed while smoking on her porch in the wee hours i kept quiet about occasional male guests staying over at pearlies house pearlie was never officially divorced but shes been alone since she was thirty and as she often said she might be old but she wasnt dead you wont say i told she asks you know i wont dr kirkland gone to washington washington mississippi washington is a small town about five miles east of natchez and at one time the territorial capital of mississippi pearlie snorts dr kirkland wouldnt waste five minutes out there unless there was timber to buy out that way then where washington dc girl he go up there all the time now i think he must know the president or something he does know the president but that cant be who hes seeing who is it i cant tell you what i dont know i dont think anybody knows not mom she act like she dont you know your grandfather i want to ask more questions but natriece doesnt need to hear them i cut my eyes toward the child who is trying to reach one of the silk dragonflies hanging in the corner of the room pearlie gets the message run outside and play for a few minutes treecy natriece pooches out her lip again you told me i could have a snocone if i was good i laugh despite my sense of urgency she promised me the same thing lots of times did you get it natriece asks with severity if i was good i did which wasnt too often pearlie snaps taking a step toward natriece if you dont go play right this minute you aint getting no kind of cone youll be eating brussels sprouts for supper natriece makes a face then darts past pearlie just out of reach of the old womans spanking hand i close the door pearlie is again studying the carpet where the bloodstains are hidden how is natriece related to you granddaughter pearlie laughs a deep rattling sound great granddaughter i should have guessed thats whats wrong with black peoples round here nowadays she says these little girls getting theirselves pregnant at twelve years old i cant believe my ears they dont do that alone do they what about the men who get them pregnant she waves her hand dismissively oh mens gonna be mens no matter how many shows oprah runs about child mamas its up to us old ones to teach these girls how to act but they all too far from the church now these young people mm mm the last two syllables carry such finality that i know its fruitless to argue pearlie i want to talk to you about the night daddy died she doesnt turn away but neither does she say anything she doesnt respond in any overt way though i detect a deepening in her dark eyes there are different levels of awareness in pearlies eyes the way there are in the eyes of most black people of her generation in natchez prior to a black person could witness a fatal shooting between two white people and see nothing at all such an event was white folks business and that was that i hate to think what sins lie concealed beneath that outdated rubric instead of prodding her further i wait in silence you done asked me about that a thousand times baby she says closing her eyes against my scrutiny and youve put me off a thousand times i told you what i saw that night when i was a child but im asking you again im thirtyone years old for gods sake tell me about that night pearlie tell me everything you saw at last the eyelids open revealing dark brown irises that have probably seen more of life than i ever will all right she says wearily maybe itll finally settle you down chapter pearlie sits on the edge of my old bed and looks at the wall her eyes cloudy with remembrance the truth is i didnt see much if id been sleeping in my house i might have but i was in the big house tending to your grandmother she stops talking and for a moment i fear she means not to continue but she swallows and goes on mrs kirkland was having pains that turned out be her gallbladder she had to have it cut out the next night your granddaddy wanted to do it but she wouldnt let him anyway i heard a gunshot what time about tenthirty i guess rifle i thought that cracking sound you know it woke up your grandmother i said dr kirkland probably just shot a buck that wandered up out of the woods but mrs kirkland told me to call the police did you yes how long did it take them to get here ten minutes maybe a little longer and you only went down to the garden after the police got here she nods slowly but i phoned down here to make sure you and your mama was okay who answered dr kirkland he told me everything wasnt okay but that i should stay with mrs kirkland i panicked and made him tell me you was all right thats when i figured out something had happened to mr luke mr luke pearlies term of address for my father he was supposed to have left for the island about nine but i just had a feeling i went out to the back gallery of the big house and looked down when i saw mr luke lying under that tree it broke my heart lord lets dont talk about that did you speak to mom when you phoned down no i close my eyes blue police lights flash behind them illuminating the great u created by the rear of malmasion and the two slave quarters painting the streaking rain with a sapphire glow tall men wearing uniforms and caps stand talking to my grandfather amid the roses deferring to him like soldiers to a senior officer i open my eyes before the memory can go any further this is what i remember being told i murmur daddy and grandpapa both heard someone prowling the grounds daddy was in here grandpapa in the main house they met outside talked a few seconds then started checking the grounds separately both had guns but daddy was surprised by the prowler they fought in the dark and daddy was shot with his own rifle pearlie nods sadly thats what dr kirkland told me is that what he told the police course it is child thats what happened why you ask me that without realizing it ive already formulated an answer to her question because i think that bare footprint on the carpet is mine and i think i put it there on that night pearlie shakes her head thats nonsense child you aint never got over losing your daddy thats all you been trying to make sense of it for twenty years but there aint no sense to things like that not unless you god hisself then you understand everything but thats the only sense there is aint none for you and me i ignore pearlies simplistic philosophy however accurate it might be talking to mom about that night was like pulling teeth when she did talk she told me conflicting stories she heard the shot she didnt hear it she saw one thing then she didnt see it what do you think about that pearlie gives me a rare unguarded look you say youre grown up nowand i guess you are old enough to hear this anyway your mama didnt see anything that night baby she was taking your fathers sleeping pills back then or his pain pills whatever he took for his war wound and his nerves nerves pearlies euphemism for posttraumatic stress disorder youre saying that was a habit girl your mama swallowed most everything mr luke got from the doctor back then she had nerve problems herself your daddy went to dr tom cage back then and i think dr cage prescribed enough for the both of them your mama wouldnt hardly go see a doctor i make a mental note to find out if dr cage is still alive so mama was unconscious when daddy was shot i close my eyes and try to visualize somethinganythingbefore the blue lights appeared but nothing will come so it was only when you came down to the garden that you saw me walk up to the body thats right where did i come from pearlie hesitates from this house i think or behind it maybe im not sure i try again to recall something fresh from that night but the impassable gate that guards that information from my conscious mind remains locked pearlie who do you think that prowler was what was he doing here the maid sighs with bonedeep fatalism and then her dark eyes settle on mine you really want to know yes i think he was a friend of your daddys either that or somebody who came here to kill dr kirkland for a moment i cant speak in all the years since my fathers death ive never heard anyone voice either of these theories kill grandpapa why would someone do that pearlie sighs heavily nice as your granddaddy can be hes a tough businessman hes ruined some people and in a town this small that can catch up with you has anybody tried to hurt him since that night not that i know about she gives a little shrug im probably wrong about that but now hes got that driver that billy neal i dont like that boy at all ive met my grandfathers driver only once and then briefly thinfaced and muscular billy neal reminds me of the men who relentlessly hit on me in bars quiet men who assume too much their silence is not solicitous but threatening almost belligerent do you think billy neal is a kind of bodyguard pearlie snorts i know he is he too mean to keep around for anything else specially just driving the idea that my grandfather should need a bodyguard seems ridiculous yet that was the impression i got when i saw him in new orleans with his new driver but its pearlies first theory that has my heart thumping why do you say the prowler might have been a friend of daddys i think it would have had to be she says firmly to get close enough to your daddy to shoot him with his own gun like that why i never saw a man so alert child mr luke slept with both eyes open always looking for danger i guess the war made him that way dr kirkland think hes a big hunter but your daddyhe could walk through the woods without bending a blade of grass first couple of years he was back from the war he walked this property all hours of the night the island too i heard bout scared me to death sometimes hed just appear in front of you like a ghost couldnt nobody slip up on mr luke without him knowing no way no how thats one thing i know a friend i murmur trying to get my mind around the idea i dont remember daddy having friends pearlie smiles with regret they wasnt friends really just boys like he was boys whod been in the war not with him but like him they was good boys but a lot of good boys come back from vietnam hooked on that dope black and white the same my nephew was one anyway them friends wouldve known your daddy had pills around plus they probably figured dr kirkland kept drugs here not hard to figure the rest is it i gaze around the forlorn bedroom a childs room without a child in it im not claustrophobic but sometimes certain places get to me and in those times i have to move move or freak out lets go outside pearlie takes my hand whats the matter baby i need some air well lets get you some then i let pearlie exit first then close the door behind us dont go back in there anymore i tell her i still have work to do inside what kind of work the same work i do in new orleans there may be more blood in there anxiety tightens her shoulders whats the matter i ask she stops in the kitchen and lays a hand on my forearm baby girl it dont do no good to dig up the past even simple folk know that and you aint simple i wish i were sometimes pearlie clucks softly theres one thing we cant change in this world our natures we come into the world with them and they stay with us all the way through do you really believe that a terrible wisdom seeps from her eyes i believe it all right ive watched too many children from the cradle to the grave not to i dont agree but neither do i argue pearlie washington has lived a lot longer than i have we walk out into the sunlight of the rose garden i have one more question i tell her and i want you to tell me the truth the maids eyes deepen again like a stilling pool ill try baby do you think daddy might have killed himself she draws back what you talking bout girl im asking you if there was really a prowler here that night or whether everybodys been lying to me all these years to protect my feelings whether what daddy went through in the war was just too much for him so bad thatthat even mom and me werent enough to keep him wanting to live pearlie lifts her long brown fingers to my cheek and wipes away tears oh baby dont you ever think that mr luke thought the sun rose and set in your eyes thats a fact i try to blink away the wetness in my eyes did he i dont remember she smiles i know you dont he got took from you too early but mr luke didnt go through all he did in that war just to shoot hisself when he got back home he loved you more than youll ever know so you get that foolishness right out of your mind all right yes maam im surprised by the childlike sound of my own voice i better find natriece pearlie says squaring her shoulders and looking toward malmaison you holler if you need me chapter as pearlie walks toward the rear of malmaison i take my cell phone from my pocket and check the screen eight more missed calls all from sean he wont give up i open my digital phone book and dial my mothers cell phone she answers through a crackle of static cat whats wrong why do you think somethings wrong why else would you call me good god where are you mom about thirty miles south of natchez coming back the liberty road way ive been to see your aunt ann how is she not good its too long a story to tell on a cell phone where are you home are you working on those murders down there i saw the news yes and no im actually in natchez right now static never sounded so empty what are you doing in natchez ill tell you when you get here dont you dare do that to me tell me now when you get here goodbye mom i hang up and look back at our house i want to work the rest of my bedroom for latent blood but i dont have the right chemicals luminol can damage the genetic markers used to identify the person who lost the blood some rapidly evaporating solvents neither dilute nor damage bloodstains i have some in new orleans but not here my cell phone rings again i answer by saying ill tell you when you get here mom this isnt mom says sean but i guess i know why you finally answered i feel a rush of guilt hey im sorry about the missed calls its okay i wouldnt have kept bugging you today if it werent important what is it are you sitting down just tell me damn it weve finally connected the nomurs victims my heart stutters how you wont believe it its the women women what women female relatives of the victims i look around the gardens of malmaison my mind too filled with thoughts of the past to make sense of what sean is saying tell me from the beginning im not there with you remember when a lowrisk victim is murdered you have to look at the family right and these were all lowrisk victims the task force has been taking apart the lives of every family member moving out in concentric circles well this morning we learned that female relatives of two of the victims go to the same psychiatrist my skin feels hot which victims two and four riviere and legendre whats their relation rivieres daughter legendres niece holy shit whats the shrinks name nathan malik i run the name through my memory never heard of him im surprised hes pretty well known and fairly controversial hes written a couple of books on what repressed memories bringing back repressed memories i guess this pricks something in the back of my mind thats usually related to sexual abuse i know are you thinking what i am revenge killings our victims are child abusers being killed by their victims or by a male relative of the abuse victims from that angle the sex and advanced age of the victims suddenly makes all the sense in the world thats what i thought says sean were checking every relative of every victim for visits to nathan malik or any other therapist its not easy though the two women weve linked to malik were hiding the fact that they were seeing him paying in cash and lying to their families about where they went the only reason we figured it out is because they were obsessive about keeping up with their money they had amazingly detailed private records the fbi psychiatrist at quantico says theres a strong possibility that dr malik could be doing the murders himself theres something called countertransference where a shrink vicariously experiences the pain of his patients the fbi shrink says that could trigger malik to commit revenge murder just as if hed been abused himself and malik would have the knowledge to stage the scenes to look like gardenvariety sexual homicide has anyone talked to dr malik yet no but hes under surveillance how old is he fiftythree this is outside the age range of the fbis standard serialkiller profile but well within the bounds of possibility based on the literature i cant believe the adrenaline flowing through my veins what happens next thats what im calling you about we want you to check nathan maliks dental records see if they match the bite marks on the bodies you already have them no when will you im not sure yet i dont get it whats going on sean weve got the name of maliks dentist and since you know damn near every dentist in the new orleans area we were hoping you could have an informal chat with this one maybe get a look at some faxed dental records just enough to tell if malik is the killer or not a red flag goes up in my mind an informal chat youre shitting me no who wants this sean the task force or you the resulting pause is long enough for me to guess the answer are you out of your mind theres no way a dentist is going to let me see his records without a court order not with all the new hipaa regulations when can you get a court order the task force is debating that now the problem is as soon as we ask for those records we tip malik to our interest in him so if his dental records match the bite marks on the victims that wont matter but if i break the law to get an informal look at those recordsor maliks dentist breaks itand thats brought out at trial couldnt that get malik off if it came out at trial yes but youre part of the old boy network in this town in dentistry anyway youre wrong about that sean im toleratedmaybe grudgingly respected but if i cat his voice is filled with presumptuousness do you really want to stop this guy that badly or do you just want the glory of catching him thats not fair bullshit this killers been hitting one victim a week its only been twentyfour hours since his last strike we have some time the task force does i mean sean doesnt reply in the silence i try to divine his true motivation he likes glory but theres something deeper at work here hes speaking again but i dont catch what hes saying because suddenly i understand youre trying to save your job i know from the silence that im right does captain piazza want to fire you because of us piazza will never fire me he says with bravado i make her look too good maybe but shed damn sure yank you off the task force and bringing in a positive id on the killer before the bureau can would put you back into her good graces wouldnt it more silence i need this cat maybe so but jailing this killer is more important than your job i know that im just no way sean ive broken a lot of rules for you but ive never put a conviction in jeopardy i wont do it now okay okay but lookat least tell me if you know the dentist his name is shubb harold shubb i feel a quick rush of excitement harold shubb is part of the disaster identification unit made up of volunteer dentists across the state of louisiana i organized that unit shubb took one of my seminars in forensic odontology and he would love a call from me you know him i can tell sean says i know him is he an okay guy yes but that doesnt change anything get your court order and shubb will do you right you should also be trying to find out if this malik had any orthodontic work done as an adolescent or even later orthodontists keep their patient models for a very long time as a defense against future lawsuits sean sighs heavily ill tell them that kaiser probably knows already i picture the former fbi profiler in my mind i cant imagine much getting by him i know you wont make the call sean says in a wheedling tone but at least let me fax you what i have on malik you want to see that right i dont answer my thoughts have wandered back to the bloody footprints in my bedroom cat are you there send me what youve got give me a fax number i give him the number of my grandfathers fax machine i know it because we sometimes have to exchange documents dealing with my trust fund ill get it to you as soon as i can sean promises fine theres an awkward pause then he says are you coming back tonight i actually hear loneliness in his voice no tomorrow then i dont know sean why not you hardly ever go home and when you do you dont like it somethings happened up here what is somebody sick i cant explain now i have to go call me later then if i notice anything interesting in the stuff you fax me ill call otherwise itll be tomorrow at least before you hear from me sean is silent then after a few moments he says goodbye cat i hang up and look back at the slave quarters then up at the rear of malmaison i want to talk to my mother but shes still twenty minutes away suddenly from the roiling mass of thoughts that is my mind in this moment a clear image rises breaking into a trot i head into the trees on the east side of the vast lawn following a path first beaten by my own feet fifteen years ago i need to be underwater as i jog through the trees i spy a dark figure standing in the shadows about forty yards ahead a black man in work clothes i bear left so that i wont pass him too closely but as i near the figure i recognize mose the yardman who has worked at malmaison since before i was born once a strapping giant who could carry railroad ties on his back mose now has a bent spine and white stubble that grows almost up to his watery yellow eyes he lives alone in a small house at the back of the property but once a week he commands an army of younger men who groom the grounds like a crack army platoon i wave as i pass to his left the old man lifts his arm in a vague way he doesnt recognize me probably thinks im one of the suburban housewives from brookwood the scary thing is that im old enough to be one now i quicken my pace my mind racing ahead to a place i havent visited in far too long years fall away as i run chapter pounding through the trees at the eastern border of malmaisons grounds i suddenly emerge behind the houses of brookwood estates a subdivision built on desalle land sold to a developer during the s when malmaison was out of the familys hands the homes in brookwood are mostly singlestory s ranch houses but a few at the back are twostory colonials i came here countless times during my youth and always for the same reason one of the colonials belonged to the hemmeters an elderly couple who owned a swimming pool i came because my grandfather despite his enormous wealth and my fanatical dedication to swimmingthree consecutive state titlesrefused to build me a practice pool my request was not that of a spoiled child my high school st stephens had no swimming pool so our team was forced to practice wherever we could get permission at different times of the year my mother and grandmother gave my suggestion their usual shaky support but since the original malmaison had no pool my grandfather refused to desecrate his grounds with one to remedy this i did my daily laps in the hemmeters pool in brookwood the old couple always sat on their patio to watch and they became my biggest fans at local meets mr hemmeter died a couple of years ago but his widow kept the house something about the place looks different as i approach but thats only to be expected after the man of the house has died at least the pool is being kept up mrs hemmeter stopped swimming several years ago so the clear water sparkling in the sun strikes me much as my bedroom didsomething maintained in the hope that i will return to it someday vanity perhaps but i suspect im right i jog around the house and check the garage empty returning to the pool i strip off my jeans and blouse and dive cleanly into the deep end leaving hardly a ripple behind me the dive carries me halfway to the far wall i breaststroke to the shallows then get out and search the flower bed until i find a flat heavy rock about the size of a serving platter this i carry down the steps into the shallow end after a period of preimmersion meditation during which my heart slows to around sixty beats per minute i lie down on my back beneath the water and set the rock on my chest the water is just under ninety degrees like the sea under an equatorial sun i lie on the bottom for three minutes until my chest spasms in its first physical scream for oxygen free divers train themselves to ignore this reflex which would send a normal person into fullblown panic after enduring a varying number of these spasms humans can move into a far more primitive mammalian state one the body dimly remembers from its genetic heritage as a waterborne animal in the beginning i endured as many as twenty spasms before entering the primitive dive state now the miraculous transition is almost painless once in the dive state my heartbeat decreases dramatically sometimes to as low as fifteen beats per minute my blood circulation alters to serve only my core organs and blood plasma slowly fills my lungs to resist the increasing pressure of deep water i can feel it now the steady descent to a state of relaxation i can find nowhere else in my life not in sleep where nightmares trouble me not in sex where frantic urgency drives me to numb a pain i cannot even name not in the hunt for predators where the triumph of trapping my quarry brings only transitory peace somehow when i am submerged in water the chaos that is my mind on the surface discharges itself and my thoughts either go flat or pattern themselves into a comprehensible order that eludes me in the air with the pool water gently swaying my body the crazed events of the past week begin to come clear im not alone today a child is growing in my belly eating what i eat breathing my air being pregnant doesnt seem as frightening down here the childs conception is no mystery after all a simple combination of carelessness and lust seans kids were gone to summer camp his wife was visiting her mother in floridahe stayed over at my house from a thursday to a sunday by saturday morning id developed cystitis from too much sexwhat they called honeymoon syndrome in medical schoolso i took a brief course of cipro to cure it the antibiotic interfered with my birth control pills and that was that i was with child as my grandmother used to say the mystery is why i havent yet told sean i love him he loves me up to now weve shared every thought and feeling weve even confessed our secrets which was painful but the only way to maintain sanity in a relationship conducted in the shadows there has to be some honesty amid the lies my fearwhen im brave enough to face itis that sean will think i got pregnant on purpose that i trapped him and even if he believes the truth will he leave his family to be with me will he want to father a child with me when he already has three of his own sean is obsessed with his work so much so that it takes time away from his family now will the fact that we could work together persuade him that our relationship could succeed if it were out in the open i wonder if part of my zeal for solving seans cases has been an effort to make myself indispensable to him pathetic if true yet if it isthis time ive failed at even that with the nomurs victims connected at last finding the killer is only a matter of time if nathan maliks teeth match the bite marks on the victims corpses its all over but the lethal injection ten years down the road the idea of a psychiatristmurderer intrigues me there are similar cases in the literature i wonder if dr malik is aware of that ive had therapists i suspected of deeprooted weirdness there was dr delorme a softspoken psychologist of sixty whose eyes glittered whenever he questioned me about sexual matters his best efforts went in vain but i at least found a diversion from my problems during the sessions by trying to read what went on behind those eyes what would delorme make of my panic attacks at the crime scenes hed probably attribute them to my pregnancy but i experienced the first attack two days before i discovered i was pregnant unless slightly elevated hormones can precipitate panic the cause must lie elsewhere alcohol is another possible culprittoo much or too littlebut i had the first attack while floating comfortably on grey goose and the second while stone sober ive always suffered occasional blackouts from drinking but never panic attacks in fact alcohol gives me a surplus of courage dutch courage they call it in old movies as the level of oxygen in my tissues continues to fall deeper questions bubble up from my subconscious whats the significance of rain on a tin roof why am i hearing that and why at the times that i do the only tin roof at malmaison is on the barn my father used for a studio and my memories of that space are so precious as to be sacred nothing about the barn elicits panic and my nightmares for years my sleep has been haunted by terrifying scenes of creaturessometimes human other times half human half beasttrying to break into my house and kill me this scenario comes in a thousand variations all of them as real as my experiences in the waking world i also have recurring dreams as though my subconscious is trying to send me a message yet neither i nor my therapists have been able to decode the imagery two weeks ago before my first panic attack i began dreaming of a summer day on desalle island im riding in the old roundnosed pickup truck that my grandfather used for work on the island grandpapa is driving and im just tall enough to see over the dashboard the truck smells of old motor oil and handrolled cigarettes were riding across a pasture up a gentle hill on the other side of that hill lies a small pond where the cows drink each time the dream recurs we make it a little farther up the hill but we never reach the crest the glowing footprint from my bedroom fills my darkening mind did my eightyearold foot leave that track who else could have left it that bedroom was mine alone for sixteen years the carpet was installed the year i was born when the whole room was remodeled no other child lived at malmaison after me and as far as i know no other child has ever stayed in that room the conclusion seems inescapable but why am i using logic the overpowering wave of d√£j√£ vu that hit me when i first saw that glowing print is all the proof i need that bloody track is mine the question is whose blood was on my foot my fathers if enough genetic markers survived natrieces luminol bathand if i can get a sample of my fathers dna from somewherea hair from an old brush perhapsthen a dna test can tell me whether it was his blood or not big ifs and even with my contacts at the crime labs throughout the state a dna comparison could take several days in the meantime i have only my memoryor the lack of itto go on i remember almost nothing from the night my father died nothing before i walked through the rain to the dogwood tree and saw his body lying motionless on the ground its as though i simply materialized from the grass without my voice and it was more than a year before i spoke again why where was i when my father died asleep or did i witness something something too terrible to recall much less speak of pearlie knows more about that night than shes told me but what is she holding back and why once she states something to be true she rarely goes back and adjusts her version of events but maybe i dont need pearlie for the first time in my life i have a witness to that nights events that cannot conceal or distort events blood the oldest sign of murder abels blood crying out from the ground mayday cries a voice in my head mayday mayday that voice is the product of five years of dive training it tells me when im nearing the crisis point the level of oxygen in my tissues has fallen to a point where most people would be unconscious in fact most people submerged for the length of time i have lain here would be dead by now but i still have a margin of safety my thoughts have condensed from a bright stream of consciousness to a single line of pulsing blue light the message carried in that blue light has nothing to do with my past its about my baby she is here with me cosseted in the sheltered pool of my uterus a core organ if anything qualifies as one most women would excoriate me for risking my babys life this way in another situation i might do the same but im not in another situation a lot of women finding themselves pregnant by a married man would already have scheduled an abortion but i havent done that i will not this is my baby and i intend to have her i risk her life only by risking my own as for my motivethe pulsing blue thread of light in my mind tells me this my baby can survive this when we rise from this water we will be one and nothing sean regan says or does will have any power over us my body tenses opening my eyes i see a dark figure hovering above the water slowly a golden spear separates from the figure and descends toward the surface directly above me i shove the rock off my chest and burst up into air and light sputtering in terror a tall man stands at the side of the pool a tenfootlong net in his hands he looks more frightened than i i thought youd drowned he cries then he blushes and turns away i cross my arms over my breasts only now remembering that i went into the pool in my underwear who are you wheres mrs hemmeter magnolia house hes still looking away the assistedliving home she sold the house to me do you want to put on some clothes i kneel so that the water covers me to my neck im decent now the man turns around he has sandy brown hair and blue eyes and hes wearing khakis and a blue buttondown oxford shirt several tongue suppressors protrude from his shirt pocket he looks to be in his early thirties and something about him strikes me as familiar do i know you i ask he smiles do you i study him but cant make the connection i do or i did im michael wells oh my god michael i didnt didnt recognize me i know ive lost eighty pounds in the last two years i survey him from head to toe its difficult to reconcile what i see before me with my memories of high school but theres just enough of the old michael left to recognize its like meeting a man in the real world whom you first encountered as a cancer patient on steroid therapybloated and soft then but now miraculously recovered healthy and hard my god you lookwell hot michaels blush returns redder than before thanks cat he was three years ahead of me at st stephens then at the university medical center in jackson did you stick with pediatrics i ask searching my mind for details he nods i was practicing in north carolina but st catherines hospital came up and recruited me this town was desperate for more pediatricians well im glad you came back you own this house now yep i used to swim here all the time he smiles mrs hemmeter told me did she well do you like it the house i mean i do i like being at the back of the neighborhood its no malmaison of course be glad its not you dont want the upkeep on that place i can imagine did you ever live anywhere else in natchez no my dad came back from vietnam with posttraumatic stress disorder he couldnt hold a job so my mom came home from college and they moved into one of the slave quarters i was born four years later we never left after that what did your father do before the war he was a welder is that where his sculpting came from yes im surprised michael remembers that after two years of wandering the woods and watching television my dad fired up his welding equipment and began sculpting metal in the beginning he produced huge horrid piecesasian demons cut from steel and ironbut as time passed his work mellowed and became quite popular with some collectors is that a rock down there michael asks pointing into the water yes your rock i used it to keep me submerged im a free diver whats that i dive deep in the ocean using only the air in my lungs michael looks intrigued how deep ive been to three hundred and fifty feet jesus i scuba dive a little and ive only been to ninety feet with tanks i use a weighted sled to help me get down quickly thats one extreme sport ive never heard of its pretty intense as solitary as you can be on this planet i think he squats beside the pool his eyes filled with curiosity do you like that solitude i mean sometimes other times i cant stand to be alone literally i learned to fly five years ago ive got a little cessna out at the airport thats where i get my solitude well there you go flying scares me to death if i got into your cessna id need a doggie bag in the first two minutes michael laughs and blushes at the same time youre just trying to save my pride im not flying scares me especially small planes i look toward the trees that conceal malmaison have you met my grandfather yet he smiles in a way thats hard to read the lord of the manor yeah he still comes to the occasional staff meeting at the hospital even though hes more of a wheelerdealer than a surgeon these days from what i hear for a lot of years now by the time he was forty surgery was just a prestige hobby for him michael glances toward the woods as though my grandfather might be watching us i saw him out running one day he didnt recognize me i tell you hes a tough old man hes what seventy seventyseven god he can run me into the ground and he doesnt have that oldman jog either you know he runs hes strong i havent seen him much lately hes apparently out of town a lot michael bends and dips his hand into the pool theres a rumor that hes buying up most of downtown natchez what when the paper mill closed the real estate market here crashed but then a front company started buying up downtown by the block like its boom times again word is the front company is really your grandfather i cant fit this into my frame of reference about my grandfather why would he do that wheres the profit in it this time michael shrugs nobody seems to know but some people say he has some grand plan to save the city i shake my head hes always done a lot for the town but that seems a bit crazy given the local economy maybe he knows something we dont he always does we look at each other without speaking michael doesnt feel compelled to fill every silence as some men do but then this is his property im the interloper you know i didnt finish med school right i say cautiously i heard what did you hear he replies in a neutral tone careful to keep any judgment out of his voice depression nervous breakdown the usual nothing else something about an affair with an attending physician or a professor something he flipped out over you and lost his job you got booted something like that i dont care much about gossip everybodys got a past i smile do you sure he chuckles softly maybe not as colorful as yours we both laugh i had a terrible crush on you in high school he says i have to tell you that i didnt have the nerve to back then the most beautiful girl at st stephensmy god and now im standing in your swimming pool in my underwear how do i look he doesnt answer immediately im surprised by the anxiety i feel about his answer why do i care so much what a virtual stranger thinks you havent changed at all michael says now i know youre lying you should have told me about the crush back then he shakes his head nah you only dated jocks or bad boys what were you the chubby geek you know that i dont insult him by arguing you seem to have reinvented yourself he nods his eyes reflective sometimes you have to its not easy either youre married of course nope one girlfriend all the way through med school but we ended up splitting you must be the most eligible bachelor in natchez michael expels a lungful of air with obvious frustration the local matrons and divorc√£es certainly treat me that way its a new reality for me my cell phone rings in my jeans pocket on the side of the pool i slide over to it on my knees and check the screen my mother is calling again mom im home now cat where are you swimming at the hemmeters house thats not the hemmeters house anymore i know i just met dr wells did you well get home and tell me whats going on i hang up and look at michael i need to get out he retrieves a towel from his back porch hands it to me then turns away walking quickly up the pool steps i strip off my underwear and dry my skin then i put on my outer clothes and wring out my bra and panties to carry home all covered up again michael turns around please feel free to use the pool anytime thanks i wont be in town long though thats too bad do you as question fades into silence color rises into his cheeks what do you have someone in new orleans i start to lie then decide honesty is best i really dont know he seems to mull this over then nods with apparent contentment i turn to go but something makes me turn back to him michael do you ever have patients who just stop speaking stop speaking altogether sure but all my patients are kids thats why i asked what causes a child to stop speaking he bites his bottom lip sometimes theyve been embarrassed by a parent other times its anger we call it voluntary mutism what about shock shock sure and trauma thats not voluntary in the strictest sense have you ever seen it last for a year he thinks about it no why after my father was shot i stopped speaking for a year he studies me in silence for several moments theres a deep compassion in his eyes did you see anyone about it not as a child no not even a family doctor no my grandfather was a doctor you know mom said he kept telling her the problem would be selflimiting look i need to run i hope i see you again sometime i do too i walk backward for a few steps give michael a last smile then turn and sprint off through the woods when i am deep into the trees i stop and look back hes still staring after me chapter my mother is waiting in the kitchen of the slave quarters sitting at the heartpine breakfast table shes dressed impeccably in a tailored pants suit but she has dark bags under her eyes and her auburn hair looks as though she drove all the way from the gulf coast with her windows down she looks older than when i last saw hera brief lunch in new orleans four months ago still gwen ferry looks closer to forty than fiftytwo which is her true age her elder sister ann once had the same gift but by fifty anns troubled life had stolen the lingering bloom of youth at one time the two sisters were natchez royalty the beautiful teenage daughters of one of the richest men in town now only my mother carries whats left of that banner occupying the social pinnacle of the town president of the garden club a deceptively courteous organization that once wielded more power than the mayor and the board of aldermen combined she also owns and operates an interior design center called maison desalle which caters to the small coterie of wealthy families that remain in natchez she stands and gives me a side hug then says what in the world is going on ive always asked you to come home more often and now you show up without even a phone call glad to see you too mom her face wrinkles in displeasure pearlie says you found bloody tracks in your bedroom thats right she looks perplexed i went in there and didnt find a thing on the floor just a bad smell you went into my room why wouldnt i the coffeemaker bubbles on the counter and the aroma of canal street coffee hits me trying to suppress my exasperation i say id appreciate you not going in there anymore not until im finished finished with what testing the rest of the bedroom for blood mom interlocks her fingers on the table as though trying to keep from fidgeting what are you talking about catherine i think im talking about the night daddy died two splotches of red appear high on her cheeks what i think those footprints were made on the night daddy died well thats just crazy shes shaking her head but her eyes have an unfocused look is it mom how do you know because i know what happened that night do you she blinks in confusion of course i do werent you knocked out from taking daddys pills her cheeks go pale dont you talk to me like that i may have taken a sedative or two in those days you werent addicted to daddys medicine who told you that your grandfather no hes out of town youve been talking to pearlie havent you i cant believe shed say something so hurtful does it matter who ive been talking to we have to tell the truth around here sometime mom straightens up and squares her shoulders you need to take some of your own advice missy theres no doubt about whos told the most lies in this house with trembling hands she turns and pours a cup of coffee from the carafe maybe the hand tremor is a family trait i take a deep breath and slowly let it out we got off on the wrong foot mom hows aunt ann doing shes married another bastard third time in a row this ones hitting her did she tell you that i have eyes god i dont want to talk about it i dont even want to think about it i need sleep maybe youd better skip that coffee then if i dont drink this ill get a caffeine headache she takes a steaming sip and makes a face you ought to know about addictions i fight the urge to snap back ive been sober for nearly three days she looks up sharply whats the occasion i cannot tell her that im pregnant not yet as my eyes seek out the floor i feel a soft hand squeeze my upper arm whatever it is im with you she says when we know better we do better thats what dr phil says like me and those sleeping pills dr phil mom please you should watch him honey well watch this afternoon before my nap dr phil always relaxes me i cant listen to any more of this i

there whens he due back i ask heading for the door today is all i know i start to leave then stop at the kitchen door and turn back mom do you have anything personal left of dads like what pictures what like an old hairbrush a hairbrush what on earth for i was hoping you might have some of his hair sometimes people keep a lock of hair when they lose a loved one shes suddenly frozen in place her eyes wide you want it for a dna sample a statement not a question yes to compare to the blood on the floor of the bedroom i dont have anything like that the carpet is the same one as when i lived here isnt it the two red circles have darkened on her cheeks you dont remember it i just wanted to be sure is the bed the same for gods sake catherine is it the frame is the same i had to get rid of your mattress why urine stains you wet the bed so often when you were a child i did puzzlement in her eyes now you dont remember that no she sighs wearily well its best forgotten just part of being a child what did you do with the mattress the mattress im sure pearlie had mose take it to the dump i saw mose outside earlier i cant believe he still works here he refuses to quit hes not as strong as he used to be but hes still going i hate to push her but what do i have to lose now i know its a long shot mom but do you think daddy ever donated to a sperm bank or anything like that my mother stares at me as though she cant believe im her child im sorry i whisper i have to do this i have no choice after a long look she turns away and takes a sip of coffee knowing that no words from me will make her feel better i walk outside and make my way across the garden to the rear of malmaisons left wing my grandfathers study is on the ground floor entering the mansion i walk with bored familiarity past priceless antiques eventually making my way to the library which functions as my grandfathers study patterned after napol√£ons library its a world of dark wooden columns rich upholstery and broad french doors that open onto the front gallery civil war muskets are mounted on the ceiling beams and twin crystal chandeliers light the room leatherbound volumes line the shelves with paintings suspended on velvet cords in front of them a few of the canvases show english hunting scenes but most depict civil war battlesconfederate triumphs all the rooms only concession to modernity is a long cypress table beside my grandfathers rolltop desk on it stand a computer printer copier and fax machine the fax tray is empty i take out my cell phone and speeddial sean cat he says over the chatter of the squad room im standing by the fax machine i tell him nothings come yet im sending it through now theres a decent amount of public information on malik but its mostly scholarly stuff when you get right down to it its hard to get a feel for what makes this guy tick when is the task force going to talk to him they still havent decided like you said they feel they have some time before he hits again nobody wants to screw this up okay ill get back to you if i notice anything interesting hey sean says yeah get back to me anyway i miss you i close my eyes as a wave of heat runs up my neck okay i hang up then sit at my grandfathers desk and wait for the fax to come through the room smells of fresh cigars old leather good bourbon and lemon oil intrigued by michael wellss story of a front company buying up downtown natchez i consider poking through my grandfathers desk but its locked tired of waiting for seans fax i pick up the phone dial information and get the number of dr harold shubb in new orleans before second thoughts can stop me i let the number automatically connect then identify myself as a fellow dentist to dr shubbs receptionist just one moment doctor says the woman after a brief pause a man who sounds excited to be taken away from his operatory chair comes on the line cat ferry i always knew this call would come i look forward to it and dread it at the same time has there been a plane crash dr shubb has naturally assumed that im calling to activate the volunteer disaster identification unit no harold im calling about something just as serious though whats going on what can i do for you have you been following the recent murders in town sure yeah of course theres a bite mark angle to the case really i hadnt heard that the police are keeping it from the public what im about to tell you you cant mention to a soul goes without saying cat wethat is the task force working the casewe have a suspect hes one of your patients harold stunned silence on dr shubbs end of the line holy god are you kidding me no i hear his breathing shallow and irregular may i ask who it is not yet this is an informal call harold another pause im not sure i understand the fbi is probably going to contact you todayofficiallyto get a look at any xrays you might have on this patient the nopd however wants you and me to have an informal conversation a little sooner than that dr shubb processes this im listening im worried that any specific discussion we have about xrays or teeth could later wreck the chance of a conviction you might be right if you dont have a court order i mean all this hipaa privacy crap is driving me insane im sure look what i was thinking was that we could have a general conversation about this patient but without getting into his mouth would you have a problem with that fire away i wont tell a soul i pray this is true the suspects name is nathan malik hes a shrink shubb finishes holy shit hes a psychiatrist not a psychologist and he makes sure you know that in the first five seconds ive seen malik quite a bit done two root canals on him so far this year mds hardly ever take care of their teeth you know that i just harold shubb falls silent then he whistles long and low as if only now realizing the implications of our conversation i fight the urge to describe the bite marks on the victims in less than a minute we could probably confirm or eliminate nathan malik as the killer of the nomurs victims but in a case this sensitive procedure must be followed to the letter what kind of guy is he harold an odd duck smart as hell a little intimidating if you want to know the truth knows something about everything even teeth really its rare for mds to know much about dentition i know youre going to think your call influenced me to say this but the guy makes me a little uncomfortable not much for small talk though he has a smartass sense of humor but what he really gives off is intensity total intensity you know the type i think so has malik talked about his background not much i think hes from mississippi originally like you really does fiftythree years old sound right about right hes in good shape except for his teeth i could check my records dont do that i say quickly rightyoure right shit im getting nervous just talking to you were almost done harold do you know anything about maliks modes of therapy what he specializes in anything repressed memories physical and sexual abuse of women men too i think weve had several conversations about it hes an expert at helping people recover lost memories uses drugs hypnosis everything its controversial stuff lots of litigation in that area thats what i thought ill tell you this if nathan malik is your guy i hope you have some rocksolid evidence on him he wont be intimidated by the fbi or anyone else when it comes to things like patient privacy hell go to jail before hell tell you a damn thing hes a fanatic about it hates the government i jump as the fax machine beside me hums to life that rocksolid evidence may be sitting in your xray files right now harold he whistles again i hope so cat i mean i know what you mean if its him exactly look the fbi doesnt need to know about this conversation what conversation thanks harold ill see you at my next seminar cant wait i ring off and watch the paper spool out of the fax machine someone has typed a detailed summary of the available information on dr nathan malik i have an almost overwhelming urge to go to my grandfathers sideboard and pour a quick shot of vodka before reading it but i manage to strangle the impulse as the second sheet emerges from the fax machine i glance down then grip the table to stay on my feet at the bottom of the page is a blackandwhite photo of nathan malik a bulletheaded bald man with deepset black eyes on some men baldness conveys an image of weakness or advancing age but on nathan malik the bald pate seems more a challenge than a weakness the way it did on yul brynner proud piercing and defiant his eyes silently order you back a step maliks nose was broken at some point in his life and his lips curl in a wry smile that expresses only contempt for the camera he has the arrogant disdain of an aristocrat but thats not what has taken my breath away what did that was the eyes i first saw themand this facenearly a decade ago at the university medical center in jackson mississippi grabbing the first page from the fax tray i scan the psychiatrists cv born two years in the army a tour of duty as a medical corpsman in vietnam undergraduate education tulane university graduated tulane medical school in a residency at ochsner hospital several years of private practice followed after whichi feel my heart pounding against my sternumnathan malik took a position on the psychiatric faculty at the university of mississippi medical center in jackson jesus christ i whisper malik was at umc during the two years i was there i did know him but something is wrong i didnt know the man in this picture as nathan malik but as dr jonathan gentry and gentry wasnt bald not even close higher up the page i find what im looking for nathan malik was born jonathan gentry in greenwood mississippi in he legally changed his name in one year after i was asked to leave medical school i pick up my cell phone and speeddial sean sweat breaking out on my face and neck you got something sean says without preamble sean i know him knew him i mean who malik what only his name wasnt malik then it was gentry he was on the faculty at umc in jackson when i was there he had hair then but its the same guy i couldnt forget those eyes he knew that professor i had the affair with he actually hit on me a few times i mean okay okay you need to get i know ill leave as soon as i can get out of here i should be there in three hours dont wait for anything cat the task force is going to want to talk to you bad the calm i experienced in the pool has fled me i can hardly keep a logical thought in my head sean what does this mean how could this be i dont know im going to call john kaiser you call me when you get on the road well figure it out though im alone in the room i nod thankfully i will ill talk to you soon bye babe hang tough well get this straight i put down the phone and gather the sheets from the fax tray there are three now as i turn toward the study door it suddenly opens as though of its own volition towering in the doorway is my grandfather dr william kirkland his angular face lined with care his pale blue eyes survey me from head to toe then take in the room hello catherine he says his voice deep and precisely measured what are you doing in here i needed your fax machine grandpapa i was just about to head back to new orleans a shorter man in his thirties peers around my grandfathers broad frame billy neal the unpleasant driver pearlie complained about his eyes flick up and down my body making private judgments that produce a smirk grandpapa gently but forcefully pushes his driver backward then walks into the library and closes the door hes wearing a white linen jacket and a necktie on the island he dresses like a laborer but in town he is unfailingly formal im sure you dont want to leave before weve had a chance to visit he says its pretty urgent a murder case he smiles knowingly if it was that urgent you wouldnt be in natchez in the first place would you unless someone was murdered here while i was gone i shake my head thats a relief though i can think of a few locals i wouldnt mind seeing hurried along to their final reward he walks to the sideboard sit down catherine what are you drinking nothing he raises a curious eyebrow i really have to go your mother told me you found some blood in your old bedroom thats right i found it by accident but its definitely blood he pours himself a neat scotch human i dont know yet i glance longingly at the door grandpapa removes his jacket revealing a tailored dress shirt with rolledup sleeves even at his advanced age he has the corded forearms of a man whos worked all his life with his hands but youre assuming that it is why do you say that i never assume anything i say that because you look agitated its not the blood its the murder case in new orleans he hangs his jacket on a rack in the corner are you being completely truthful about that i just spoke to your mother i know how much the loss of your father hurt you how its haunted you please sit down catherine we should talk about your concerns i look down at the faxed pages in my hands the hypnotic eyes of nathan malik stare up at me prodding me to leave for new orleans but then an image of glowing footprints comes into my mindone tiny and bare the other made by a boot a work boot maybe or a hunting boot the nomurs killings have a claim on me but i cannot leave malmaison without knowing more about those footprints i take a deep breath and force myself to sit chapter my grandfather sits in a leather club chair and regards me with interest hes an imposing figure and he knows it william kirkland looks the way people want their surgeons to look confident commanding untroubled by doubt like he could operate ankledeep in blood and only get calmer as the situation deteriorated god endowed my grandfather with that magical combination of brains brawn and luck that no amount of poverty could hold in check and his personal history is the stuff of legend born into the hardshell baptist farmland of east texas he survived a car crash that killed his parents while they were traveling to his baptism taken in by his widowed grandfather he grew into a boy who worked from can see to cant see in the summers and in the winters managed to score so highly in school that he attracted the attention of his principal after receiving a full athletic scholarship to texas a ampm he lied about his age and enlisted in the marines at seventeen twelve weeks later private kirkland was on his way to the pacific islands where he won a silver star and two purple hearts as he fought his bloody way toward japan he recovered from his wounds then used the gi bill to graduate from a ampm where he won a scholarship to tulane medical school in new orleans there he met my grandmother the demure princess of tulanes sister college h sophie newcomb a presbyterian and a pauper my grandfather was initially regarded with suspicion by the catholic patriarch of the desalle family but by sheer force of personality he won over his future fatherinlaw and married catherine poitiers desalle without changing his religion they had two daughters before he finished his medical training yet still he managed to win top honors during his surgical residency in he moved his young family to his wifes hometownnatchezand joined the practice of a prominent local surgeon the future seemed set in stone which as a believer in the calvinist doctrine of predestination suited my grandfather just fine then his wifes father died with no male heir to take over the desalle familys extensive farming and business interests my grandfather began to oversee those operations he showed the same aptitude for business that he had for everything else and before long hed enlarged the family holdings by percent surgery soon became almost a hobby and he began to move in more rarefied business circles yet he never left his rural past behind he can still split a fifth of cheap bourbon with a group of field hands without their guessing hes the man who pays their wages he runs the desalle empirehis family includedlike a feudal lord but without sons or grandsons to carry on his legacy the weight of his frustrated dynastic ambitions has devolved onto me where have you been i ask having endured all the silent scrutiny i can stand washington he replies department of the interior the candid answer surprises me i thought that was a big secret he sips judiciously from his scotch to some people it is but unlike your mother and her sister you know how to keep a secret i feel my cheeks flush my status as my grandfathers favorite has always been more of a burden than a blessing and it frequently causes jealousy in my mother and aunt i want to show you something catherine something no one else has seen outside atlanta he stands and goes to a large gun safe built into the wall which he unlocks with precise twirls of the combination lock i feel a great urgency to get to new orleans but if i want to find out anything about the night my father died ill have to humor my grandfather for a few minutes grandpapa kirkland doesnt hand out anything for free especially information hes a quid pro quo man this for that i recite mentally translating the latin he insisted i study in school as he works at something in the safe i recall what michael wells said about how strong grandpapa seems most men age first in their shoulders and chests their muscle mass waning as their middles thicken the bones slowly becoming brittle like those of their wives but my grandfather has somehow retained the shape of men twentyfive years his junior hes a member of that rare brotherhood that seems to age at half the rate of mortal menepic figures like charlton heston and burt lancaster instead of the priceless antique or musket i expect him to bring out of the gun safe he produces a large architectural model it looks like a hotel with two grand wings framing a central section done in the greek revival style so common to the antebellum homes of natchez whats that i ask as he carries the model to a poker table in the corner maison desalle he says with pride maison desalle thats the name of my mothers interior design business i walk over to the table that looks way too big to be a new building for moms store he chuckles with rich amusement youre right i just liked the name this maison desalle is a hotel and casino complex a resort why are we looking at it grandpapa sweeps his arm over the model like a railroad baron taking in a map of the continent sixteen months from now this will be standing in downtown natchez overlooking the mississippi river i blink in disbelief by law every mississippi casinoeven the vegasstyle palaces on the gulf coast has to be built on some kind of floating platform natchez has its own riverboat casino permanently docked at the bottom of silver street how can that be doesnt state law restrict gambling to casinos on water he smiles slyly michael wells was right my grandfather knows something no one else does theres a loophole in the law which is indian gaming licenses you mean reservation gaming like in louisiana louisiana and about twenty other states we have one in mississippi already up at philadelphia silver star its called but theres no reservation in natchez grandpapas smile becomes triumphant there soon will be but we dont have any native americans here who do you think gave this town its name catherine the natchez indians i snap but they were massacred by the french in slaughtered down to the last infant not true my dear some escaped he runs his long fingers along the roof of one of the models wings then caresses the casinos central section ive spent the last four years tracking down their descendants and paying for dna tests to prove their lineage i think it would interest you were using threehundredyearold teeth to get the baseline dna im too stunned to speak impressed he asks i shake my head in bewilderment where did the survivors escape to some vanished into the louisiana swamps others went north to arkansas some got as far as florida a few were sold into slavery in haiti the survivors mostly assimilated into other indian tribes but that doesnt affect my venture if the federal government certifies their descendants as an authentic indian nation every law that applies to the cherokee or the apache will apply to the descendants of the natchez how many of these people are there eleven eleven is that enough he taps the model with finality absolutely tribes have been certified with fewer members than that you see the fact that there are so few left isnt the indians fault its the governments the french government in this case i say drily and by the way theyre called native americans now he snorts i dont care what they call themselves but i know what they mean to this town salvation thats why youre doing this to save the town you know me well catherine ill grant you the cash flow from this operation could run twenty million a month but no matter what you may think thats not my reason for doing this i dont want to listen to one of my grandfathers righteous rationalizations for his ambition twenty million a month where will the people come from the gamblers i mean the nearest commercial airport is ninety miles away and we still have no fourlane highway from it im buying the local airport what he laughs privatizing it actually ive already got a charter airline committed to coming here why would the county let you do that ive promised to bring in ongoing commercial service its like field of dreams isnt it you believe that if you build it they will come he fixes me with a pragmatists glare yes but this isnt a dream of foolish sentimentality people want glamour and stars and ill give them that the high rollers will fly into the cotton capital of the old south on a learjet and live gone with the wind for three days at a time but thats all window dressing what they really come for is the ageold dream of getting something for nothing of walking in paupers and walking out kings thats an empty dream because the house always wins in the end now his smile shows pure satisfaction youre right and this time were the house my dear but unlike that abomination floating under the bluff which fleeces local citizens of their social security checks and sends the profits directly to las vegas maison desalle will keep its profits right here in natchez im going to rebuild the infrastructure of this town a stateoftheart industrial park will be first then what about the indians i ask bluntly the cool blue eyes lock onto mine silently chastising me grandpapa has grown unused to interruptions in my absence i thought you said they were native americans now i thought you might answer my question those eleven indians will become some of the richest people in mississippi naturally ill receive fair compensation for spearheading the venture and laying out the initial capital i see it now my grandfather will be hailed as the savior of natchez yet despite the stated nobility of his goal i feel uneasy at the way hes going about it can anything go wrong at this point oh something can always go wrong every old soldier knows that but my washington contacts tell me that federal certification of the natchez nation should come within seven days i walk away from the poker table my eyes on a bottle of absolut on the sideboard sure you dont want a drink he asks i close my eyes id hoped to wean myself off the valium today but im going to need one for the drive to new orleans positive he takes a last look at his model then carries it back to the gun safe while his back is turned i take a pill from my pocket and dryswallow it by the time my grandfather returns to his chair the valium is in my stomach tell me about the night my father died grandpapas eyelids seem to grow heavy ive told you that story at least a dozen times humor me tell me once more youre thinking about that blood you found he lifts his scotch and takes another swallow it was late i was reading here in the library your grandmother was upstairs with abdominal pain pearlie was with her i heard a noise behind the house a metallic sound a prowler had knocked over a metal drum on the patio in the rose garden did you see that happen of course not i found the drum when i went outside were you armed yes i took a smith and wesson out with me what was in the drum pesticide for the roses it was a heavy drum so i figured a deer had got spooked while eating the roses and knocked it down why didnt you call the police he shrugs i thought i could deal with it myself your father was standing outside your house i thought hed left for the island but hed been down in the barn working on one of his sculptures hed heard something too luke was holding the old remington rifle he brought back from vietnam the one that hung over our fireplace thats right the so he went into the slave quarters to get that apparently so and then we separated i went to look behind pearlies house while luke circled around yours i was on the far side of pearlies house when i heard the shot i raced around to the garden and found luke lying dead shot in the chest are you sure he was dead then did you check his pulse i spent a year in combat in the pacific catherine i know a gunshot death when i see it his voice has the kind of edge that closes further questions in that line did you see the prowler you know i did please just tell me what you saw a man running through the trees toward brookwood did you chase him no i ran into your house to make sure you and gwen were all right i try to picture this scene were we your mother was asleep but you werent in your bed what did you do he closes his eyes in recollection the telephone rang it was pearlie calling from the main house she and your grandmother were in a panic she asked if you were all right i said you were but at that point i didnt know did you tell her to call the police shed already called them what happened then i searched the house for you and i didnt find you i was worried but i knew the man i saw running hadnt been carrying a child so i wasnt panicked i figured you were hiding somewhere did you wake mom up no i knew gwen would panic but she soon woke up on her own she didnt believe luke was dead so i walked her out to look at his body did she ask where i was the truth not at first she wasnt in very good shape shed taken a sedative i think she assumed you were asleep in your bed how many mothers would assume that under those circumstances was there a lot of blood around daddys body grandpapa tilts his head from side to side as though filtering his memory of my fathers corpse through decades of surgical experience enough the bullet clipped the pulmonary artery and there was a goodsized exit wound enough for what for someone to track blood into your room i suppose my grandfathers face gives away nothing when did i turn up right after the police arrived i was telling them what happened when you walked up out of the dark from the direction of our house i didnt see where you came from but i remember the eastern slave quarters behind you so i guess so was i wearing shoes i have no idea i wouldnt think so did i get close to daddys body you were practically on top of him before anyone noticed you i close my eyes willing my memory of that image back into the dark where i keep it was the prowler you saw running away white or black black youre sure positive what kind of shoes were you wearing that night i didnt mean to ask this aloud but its too late to take it back i wore boots during the day back then but that nighti dont recall did you go into my room after the murder i did to help your mother calm you down was i upset not that a stranger could tell you didnt make a sound but i could see it pearlie was the only one youd let hold you she had to rock you in the chair like she did when you were a baby thats the only way we got you to sleep i remember that feeling if not that specific night pearlie rocked me to sleep on many nights and long after i was a baby well he takes a conclusive breath have i told you what you needed to know i havent begun to get the answers i want but at this point im not sure what the right questions are who do you think the prowler was grandpapa no idea pearlie thinks it might have been a friend of daddys looking for drugs grandpapa appears to debate with himself about whether to comment on this then he says thats a fair assumption luke took a lot of prescription drugs and i caught him growing marijuana down on the island more than once i never knew that of course you didnt anyway i worried at times that he might be selling the stuff when he was killed i thought of telling the police to explore that avenue but in the end i decided against it why what could it do but bring calumny on the family name of course the family name matters more than anything even justice i want to ask him the final question i put to pearlie but grandpapa always saw my father as weak and if hed believed that fatal rifle shot had been selfinflicted he wouldnt have concealed from anyone this vindication of his instinctsnot even to protect the family name because he didnt really see my father as part of the family and yetthere could be factors i know nothing about my mother for example did you really see a prowler that night grandpapa his eyes widen and for a moment im certain my blind shot has struck home before he speaks he reaches out and drains the last of his scotch exactly what are you asking me catherine did daddy shoot himself that night did he commit suicide grandpapa raises a hand to his chin and massages the flesh beneath it his eyes are unreadable but i see a shadow of conflict in them if youre asking me whether i think luke was capable of suicide my answer is yes he was severely depressed a good deal of the time but that nighteverything happened just as i said he died trying to protect his home and family ill give the boy that only when i exhale do i realize how long ive been holding my breath i feel such relief that it takes a supreme act of will not to get up and take a slug of vodka from the bottle on the sideboard instead i stand and gather my fax pages from the table you hardly draw anything from your trust fund nowadays grandpapa remarks you dont spend money anymore i shrug i like earning my own i wish the rest of the family would take a page from your book i take this for what it is a thinly veiled insult to my mother and aunt but most of all to my father you really didnt like him did you daddy i mean tell the truth grandpapas eyes dont waver i dont think i made a secret of that perhaps i should have but im no hypocrite why didnt you like him was it just oil and water a lot of it was the war catherine lukes war vietnam his mental problems i guess he was wounded too you know i still recall the line of holes in daddys back caused by shrapnel from a boobytrapped artillery round i always got chills when he removed his shirt lukes physical wound wasnt his problem you dont know what he went through over there i cry defensively though i dont really know either thats true grandpapa admits i dont i heard some of the things you used to say to him how vietnam wasnt a real war how it wasnt nearly as tough as iwo or guadalcanal he stares curiously at me as though wondering how an eightyearold child could remember something like that i did say those things catherine and in the time since ive realized i might have been wrong to an extent anyway vietnam was a different kind of war and i didnt understand that then but by god i saw things in the pacific that were about as bad as a man can see and i didnt let it paralyze me a few men didgood men some of themand i guess maybe luke was like them shell shock the doctors called it then or battle fatigue im afraid we just called it well yellow i finish trying to resist a rush of emotion my cheeks are burning why didnt you tell daddy youd seen good men react like the way he did you called him yellow to his face i heard you i didnt know what you meant then but i did later grandpapa folds his stillpowerful hands together and fixes me with an unrepentant gaze listen to me catherine maybe i was too hard on your father but at some point it doesnt matter what youve gone through you have to pull up your bootstraps and get on with living because one things for sure nobody else is going to do it for you your fathers job was to provide for you and your mother and at that job he failed miserably im almost speechless with fury did you really want him to succeed what does that mean i gave him three different jobs and he couldnt handle any of them how could he you despised him and didnt you just love being the big man the one who paid for everybodys food and shelter who controlled us all he settles deeper into his chair his chiseled features hard as the face of a mountain youre distraught my dear well continue this at another time if we must i start to argue but whats the point i have to get back to new orleans please dont go into my old bedroom before i get back you cant see anything without special chemicals and please dont let anyone else go in there moms liable to try to scrub the place from top to bottom with dont worry ill keep the room secure test anything and everything you like i collect my papers and walk to the study door you seeing anybody that looks like a potential husband grandpapa asks a wave of heat shoots up my spine im wondering if im ever going to see some children around here before i die if he knew i was pregnant now he probably wouldnt even care that im not married i wouldnt worry about that i say without turning youre going to live forever arent you i open the door to find grandpapas driver staring at me an open leer on his face hey he says i brush past billy neal without a word but as i walk away i hear him mutter something that sounds like frigid bitch on any other day i would turn back and bite his head off but todayits just not worth it today i keep walking chapter im twenty miles south of natchez when the valium starts to soothe my frayed nerves sean has called twice but i didnt answer i needed a few minutes to decompress after meeting with my grandfather and to prepare for questioning about nathan malik by the fbi whatever the reality of the night my father died i have to put it aside for now and think about my two years in medical school they will soon be the subject of intense scrutiny by the fbi the facts are simple enough as michael wells heard through the grapevine i had an affair with a married professor and it got out of hand after four months i tried to end it he wouldnt let me to emphasize my point i slept with an er doctor the professor knew the professor promptly attempted suicide he didnt end his life but he did end his teaching career and also my days in medical school my grandfather could probably have used his influence to get me reinstated but the truth was i didnt want to go back certainly not like that the fbi will want to know all about nathan malikor jonathan gentry as i knew him thenbut i dont remember much i was drunk a lot of that time what i do remember about those years begs a question why have i always involved myself with married men therapists tell me its the impossibility of such relationships that draws me single guys always fall in love they end up possessive and wanting me forever i dont want permanencei didnt back then anywayand married men are a pragmatic solution theyre romantic sexually experienced and committed elsewhere im well aware of the freudian implications of my lifestyle i grew up mostly without a father so im attracted to older men what of it the moral issue bothers me sometimes but thats ultimately the mans problem whats dismayed me more is learning firsthand just how little love there is in many marriageseven those of relatively short duration yet here i am now wanting sean for myself for my baby forever the irony is almost too much and despite my dreams of a blissful future ive always sensed a dark truth in my deepest being theres no happily ever after for girls like me my cell phone is ringing again this time i answer where are you sean asks halfway to baton rouge doing eightyfive in a fortyfive zone ive got my flashers on if the highway patrol stops me im telling them to call you no problem look the fbi got their court order theyll have their odontologist at dr shubbs office checking maliks dental records long before you get here damn i hate that it wont be me who makes the comparison but the point of all this is to stop the killer as i scolded sean this morning good thats good but xrays may not be enough he should take alginate impressions of maliks actual teeth thats specified in the court order if he needs impressions to make the id hell get them theyre also going to swab maliks mouth for dna my foot depresses the accelerator and the audi zips up to a hundred miles per hour even if its not me making the comparison i have to be involved in this do they still want to talk to me absolutely john kaiser wants to call you right now and ask you about malik im ready be totally honest with him cat hes fbi but hes a good guy you can trust him he was in vietnam like your dad this admonition angers me totally honest you said so if he asks about you and me you know what i mean ill talk to you soon sean cuts the connection less than a minute later my phone rings its kaiser the fbi agents voice is lower than seans and more measured in cadence he asks me to summarize my time in medical school and my contact with nathan malik i give him a concise account and he doesnt interrupt me so you only met him a few times kaiser says when i finish and never alone right i mean we were alone in the sense of him cornering me in the next room away from a dinner party but thats it all he did was hit on me what specifics do you remember about him he didnt drink why does that stick in your mind because i did a lot we all did but not malik he was the observer type superior and aloof sat back and judged everybody you know sniped it was when i was drunk that he came on to me which surprised me because until he did i thought he was gay really theres a pause i picture kaiser making notes on a pad and youve never seen him in new orleans not in the supermarket the mall nothing like that no and id remember do you have any idea why he changed his name no where did he get the name malik it was his mothers maiden name huh thats pretty common i guess not so much with men kaiser replies but it happens the fbi agent is silent for a brief period so basically nathan malikthen called gentrywas a friend of this doctor you were having an affair with so its the doctor i need to talk to definitely can you spell his name for me christopher omartian md hes an eent i think he practices in alabama now mobile how do you know that he sent me a letter a couple of years ago did you respond i threw it in the trash kaiser thanks me for my time says he might need to call back then starts to say goodbye agent kaiser yes what about the two female relatives of the victims the ones you used to link dr malik to the murders what about them have you talked to them yet weve tried with one but shes very suspicious bordering on paranoid wont tell us a thing about malik look i really need to run dr ferry thank you for your help kaiser signs off i figure sean will call back immediately but my phone doesnt ring suppressing the urge to call him i slow the audi along the curving road to st francisville where john james audubon painted many of his famous birds the angola penitentiary sign flashes past on my right and my stomach does a little flip angola means many things to me as a child i attended the prison rodeo and marveled at the cavalier way the convicts risked their lives with the bulls and broncos but what angola means most to me is the island the prison road is the one we traveled to reach desalle island from the eastern bank of the mississippi the old river channel that guards the islands eastern shore had to be crossed by boat for most of the year but during the summer an oil company maintained a lowwater bridge to service its wells on the island that bridge led to an exotic world of shadows and light of joy and terror of memory and forgetting i made childhood friends on the islandblack friends mostlythen lost them to the realities of a social order i didnt even know i was part of i worked the ground only to see what id planted washed away by floods i cared for animals only to see them slaughtered for food i learned to hunt and to kill and then to hate the killing death and the island are inextricably bound in my mind when i was ten years old four hardened killers escaped from angola by floating out into the river on a log the prison chase team radioed my grandfather that the rivers current might drive the escapees ashore on desalle island they sent men with dogs to comb the island for a solid day they found nothing the next night grandpapa his white foreman and two handpicked black men rode off on horseback with four prize hounds at dawn the next day two escapees were locked in the dog run behind the barn their hands and feet bound with bailing wire the other two lay dead on the barn floor their bodies ravaged by dog bites and bullets last year my grandmother drowned during a picnic on the sandbar one minute she was laughing the next she was gone sluffed into the current with thirty feet of sand her body never found i wasnt there that day and it was probably best i would have killed myself trying to save her i know the mississippi river in a way most people never will where most fear the great muddy tide i respect it when i was sixteen i swam across it on a dare to prove that i feared nothing my reckless courage almost killed me that day the island and the river have claimed many more lives than those convicts and my grandmother but i dont want to dwell on that now dont borrow trouble my grandmother used to say south of st francisville the road broadens to four lanes i open up the throttle and go flat out on the straightaway to baton rouge im passing the main exit for lsu when sean finally calls back im in baton rouge now i tell him one hour away you can slow down cat my chest tightens i can tell from his voice that the news is bad what happened maliks teeth dont match the bite marks on the victims i blink in bewilderment are you sure who did the comparison an fbi guy named abrams says it wasnt even close shit he knows his business looks like the malik connection wasnt the break we thought it was i whip into the left lane and pass a rattling winnebago sean theres no way maliks connection to the victims could be coincidence its the key to the whole case we just havent figured out how it all fits together yet you got any ideas i think furiously maliks dna may still match the saliva in the bite marks but his teeth dont match the marks he might have used someone elses teeth what it happened in that book red dragon the tooth fairy used his grandmothers false teeth to bite victims with him it was part of the murder fantasy but with malik it could simply be staging where would malik get false teeth anywhere he could have stolen an articulated model from dr shubbs office just veer into the lab on his way out to the front desk and boom hed have a working set of teeth and the saliva could still be his like he licked the wounds or something just like that or it could be someone elses to throw us off ill check this but it seems far out the fbi has given the dna test on malik top priority but you know what that means damn i gun the audi around a tractortrailer does malik have alibis for the murder nights two out of four he was with patients or so he says did they confirm shit he wont tell us who they are hes stonewalling us can he get away with that not for long but hes one contrary son of a bitch and so far hes hanging tough huh maybe he really is innocent why would an innocent man be so stubborn about hiding things especially with peoples lives at stake youre thinking like a cop sean we all have something to hide you know that yeah well i am a cop and i want to know what the son of a bitch is hiding he may feel that his patients privacy outweighs the risk to their lives he may feel that even revealing their names could put them at greater risk i think hes just an asshole i remember the cold fish i knew as jonathan gentry you could be right look at this speed ill be in new orleans in forty minutes where should i go i dont know kaiser isnt sure how he wants to play it yet and the task force is sort of paralyzed youd better just go to your place first where will you be static crackles through the silence id like to be there waiting for you i close my eyes if we meet at my house there will be no way to avoid the subject ive been keeping to myself for the past three days not without drinking anyway god help me i whisper what asks sean youre breaking up something in my chest lets go this mornings events at malmaison combined with the anticipation of nailing malik had blotted out almost everything else in my mind but now reality is crashing in like a dark tide i am pregnant by a married man and no matter what kind of spin i try to put on it the bottom line comes up the same im a fool a whore no worse a slut cat are you there i dont know what did you say i said ill see you in an hour chapter i press my garagedoor opener and anxiously watch the white panels rise seans car is parked inside my garage a dark green saab turbo ten years old i walk into my house with my purse in one hand and a paper sack in the other the sack holds a bottle of grey goose already halfempty i pass through the kitchen and den like an exhausted soldier then climb the stairs to the living room which looks out over lake pontchartrain sean is waiting on the sofa facing the lake the picture window is covered with drops of condensation from the air conditioner but i can still see sails on the horizon sean isnt watching the sails hes watching a golf tournament on espn he points at the paper bag the news about maliks teeth bum you out that bad i set my purse on a glasstopped table in the corner then i take a highball glass from a shelf on the wall pour two fingers of vodka into it and take a bittersweet sip im not thinking about malik hey sean stands and comes to me you need a hug i do but not the kind he wants to give me as his arms close around me i feel the temptation to yield to his embrace he squeezes gently at first working his fingers into the muscles of my lower back a week ago i would have loved this now i feel a manic pressure building within me as predictably as the evening tide his erection presses into my abdomen i feel only revulsion hey he says as i pull away whats the matter i dont want that his green eyes soften its okay i can wait awhile i dont want it later either sean leans back to study me but keeps his arms around my waist whats the matter babe whats happening another depressive episode his casual use of medical jargon irritates me i just dont want to okay but you always want to no you always want to i just never say no he stares at me in disbelief you mean you make love to me when you dont want to sometimes sometimes like how many times i dont know more than a few i know how important it is to you his hands drop from my waist and you waited over a year to tell me this looks like it the look of pain in his face is like the look of dumb hurt on an animal when its been struck for no apparent reason god i think is there anything on earth more fragile than male pride sean swallows hard and gazes out toward the lake after a while he looks back his face composed you and i have been through some serious shit together your mood swings some bad arguments ive spent the night here and done nothing but hold you all night when you were suicidally depressed this is true though on most of those nights he tried to make love with me you have to tell me whats going on he says i want to yet i cant i take another sip from my glass why did you stop drinking i mean its great that you did but what prompted it was it just another crazy tangent like yoga and why are you drinking again now it would be so easy to tell him but why do i have to hes a detective for gods sake why cant he figure out the situation and just tell me its okay without me having to say it is the answer that hard to see has anything else ever prompted me to stop drinking cat he says softly please im pregnant i blurt and tears fill my eyes sean blinks what you heard me buthow i mean youre on the pill right yes i was but i took those antibiotics for my bladder infection and that interfered with my pills he nods for a few moments then stops didnt you know that could happen here it comes the accusation i only took three cipros i didnt think that would make a difference but youre a doctor i mean my composure snaps like brittle glass and suddenly im screaming i didnt do it on purpose okay you gave me the goddamn infection youre the one who wanted to have nonstop sex for three days clearly unprepared for this level of anger sean takes two steps backward i know you didnt do it on purpose cat its justa lot to get my mind around how long have you known three days i think almost four now im not sure anymore my sense of time isnt working too well ive been off my meds for three days i know that for sure off your lexapro and the depakote depakote can cause spina bifida if you take it in the first twelve weeks okay but shit you have to get back on the lex you know what happens when you skip yes i go manic you stopped drinking when you found out you were pregnant sean thinks aloud i cant think of anything to say but youre drinking again now did you lose the baby no i couldnt tell you i was pregnant without a drink isnt that pathetic ive been taking valium too his eyes narrow in anger what the hell for to keep from getting the dts he tries to take the glass of vodka from my hand when i resist he grabs my wrist and jerks at the glass with his other hand i let him take it but then i get the bottle from the table try to take this away and ill brain you with it he starts toward me then stops jesus cat think about the baby will you my laughter rides an undercurrent of hysteria is that what youre thinking about or are you thinking about the wife and kids you already have and whether you can still keep me a secret through all of this he rubs his forehead with both hands drags his fingertips back through his hair i see more gray when he does that look i just need some time to absorb this to think about the implications the implications i echo lets seetheyre pretty straightforward a im pregnant b im keeping the baby c a baby needs a father as well as a mother d this baby either has a father or it doesnt it sounds simple sean agrees but its not you know that look my honest answer right now is that im not sure what to do yeah i got that he gives me a pleading look did you think id know in the first five minutes i hoped you would he tries to come to me again but i hold up my hands just go okay leave me alone the next words spill out almost of their own accord and leave your key here when you go what cat you heard me sean stares at me in silence for nearly a minute in his eyes i see a long history of hurt and confusion he looks away then pulls his key from his pocket and lays it on the glass table im going to check on you tomorrow even if you dont want me to then he goes downstairs when i hear his car start in the garage i feel my chest caving in but i have the antidote for that taking the grey goose bottle from the bag i go down to my bedroom and lie on the duvet with my free hand i rub a little circle on my tummy just you and me now kid i say in a desolate voice just you and me i sip from the bottle savoring the anesthetic bite as it spreads across my tongue i hate myself for doing it but i swallow anyway selfhatred is a familiar emotion to me and familiarity brings comfort as the chemical warmth diffuses through my veins i hear the sound of rain again the rain from my waking dreams not the soft hiss of drops falling on my shingles but the hard percussive patter of rain hitting a tin roof i hope oblivion comes soon i awaken to the hiss of rain but this time the sound is real my bedroom window stands open and sean regan is leaning in through it his hair and shoulders soaking wet a corona of gray light shows behind him i look at my alarm clock am sixteen hours have disappeared down a hole you wouldnt answer your phone sean says im sorry about last night i reply my throat dry and croaking thats not how i wanted to handle it thats not why im here the bottle of grey goose spilled during the night saturating my sheets selfloathing fills me like poison why are you here our boy hit again this morning no way i rub my eyes not really believing it its only been two days are you sure the victim was a fiftysixyearold white male bite marks all over him no forced entry body found by the maid we dont have a ballistics match yet but we do have this sean holds up a piece of paper and extends it toward the bed its a photograph even from this distance i can see that its of a window on the glass above the sill written in blood are the words my work is never done holy shit we never released that to the media he says so id say the ballistics match is pretty much a formality same for the bite marks i roll over and try to rise but my whole body feels sore maybe after three days sober the vodka was a shock to my system still there was enough left to soak my sheets so i didnt drink all of it where was nathan malik last night home all night under surveillance are you sure he was in his house the whole time we didnt have anybody sleeping with him but he was there i wave sean inside and push myself up to a sitting position what should i do i want to do something i want to help he climbs through the window and sits on the floor his legs crossed indianstyle the posture makes him look twenty years younger but his drawn face betrays his age from the shadowy circles under his eyeseyes that carry twice the spiritual burden they did yesterdayid guess hes slept three consecutive hours since i last saw him do you want to talk about the baby he asks i close my eyes not right now not like this then well do what we always do what i ask suspiciously work the case right here i feel relief and a strange spark of excitement the kitchen table its worked before he picks the television remote off the floor switches it on and tunes the set to the local news the screen shows captain carmen piazza leaving a blue twostory house special agent john kaiser walks a step behind her thats the scene sean says old metairie the medias amping up storys going national some cops have started calling this guy the vampire lestat tell me youre kidding i mutter wishing id left a bottle of water by my bed sean laughs darkly hey this is new orleans and it fits if you think about it no witnesses no forced entry affluent male victims teeth marks everywhere i wonder what the killer will make of his new appellation if my past experience with serials is a guide hell love it why dont you take a shower sean says ill give you the details when you get out i roll slowly off the bed and walk to the bathroom unbuttoning my soiled blouse as i go hey cat i turn back seans green eyes focus intently on mine when youre ready to talk about the baby i am too theres a hitch in my heartbeat okay his eyes go back to the television chapter sean and i sit on opposite sides of my kitchen table case files and photographs spread out between us weve enacted this ritual many times before but in the past we sat on the same side of the table today this new arrangement seems more appropriate for the past fifteen months its been seans habit to build a private file on every major murder case assigned to him he keeps these files in a locked cabinet at my house selectively adding to them as new evidence comes in he digitally photographs what he cant get me access to and dubs audiotapes of most witness interviews and interrogations hes broken countless rules and probably some laws by doing this but the result has been to jail more killers so he doesnt struggle with the ethics too much sean brewed coffee while i was in the shower and by the time i emerged wearing scrub pants and a pearl jam sweatshirt a cup was waiting by my chair this kind of courtesy grew rare after the first few months of our relationship but today it doesnt surprise me the pregnancy is making him walk on eggshells captain piazza hasnt officially suspended sean from the task force but she did remove him as lead nopd detective on the case she only toured him through the crime scene this morning because his case clearance rate is so high piazza doesnt know that sean uses a lot of help from me to accomplish this but after the captains little lecture at the legendre crime scene i think she may suspect it in any case seans information flow has not been cut off his partner is shuttling between police headquarters and the task force headquarters at the fbi building keeping sean informed of all new developments by cell phone ironically the fortresslike new fbi field office is situated just five minutes up the shore of lake pontchartrain from my house inside that building at least fifty people are studying the same information were looking at now james calhoun i read naming the fifth victim what makes him different than the others nothing says sean leaning his chair back on two legs he was alone in the house no sign of forced entry one paralyzing shot to the spine then the bite marks delivered antemortem like the others delivered is a pretty sterile word to describe the savage act of tearing human flesh with teeth but that kind of semantic distance creeps into law enforcement work all the time just as it does in medicine when thinking about murder i always try to keep the immediacy of the violence in the forefront of my mind and a coup de gr√£ce to the head sean finishes end of story trace evidence aside from the note written in bloodthe victims bloodnothing new this guy is too good i say with frustration my work is never done he must be wearing a space suit while he does this work of his then how is he biting them he left saliva in the bite marks again yep huh is there any way nathan malik could have gotten out last night without his surveillance team knowing i dont think so sean leans forward bringing the front legs of his chair back to the floor but theres always a way i guess no thermalimaging camera to make sure a warm body was in the house no they were going to start using one tonight its been about a week between each hit like you said i dont think the feeling of urgency was there last night famous last words time of death probably about seven this morning i feel a peculiar shock of surprise so the crime happened in daylight lots of people moving around then getting their timespicayune leaving for work he stares at me in an odd way then shakes his head its sunday cat nobodys leaving for work church then i say quickly my cheeks coloring with embarrassment seans gaze doesnt waver and i sense that hes ruthlessly gauging my mental state no witnesses so far he says at length we canvassed like crazy were still trying to locate a couple of neighbors but so far nobody saw anything the killer could have entered the house during the night i point out and only left during the day lets get off calhoun for a minute sean says tapping a pen on some papers in front of him the whole stringall five victimswhat are you thinking just off the top of your head i think its malik and if he didnt do calhoun this morning somebodys helping him thats whos leaving the bite marks an accomplice maybe but not necessarily that could still be malik sean squints as though he doesnt understand yesterday you said something about the killer using fake teeth to make the marks i didnt really catch all that and when you got home he trails off not wanting to mention the awful scene we played out while i was drunk i said the killer could be using someone elses teeth what did you mean like dentures dentures would work but how would he make the marks look real wear them over his own teeth he could do that but hed get his own saliva in the wound doing that theres another way when dentists make dentures theyre attached to a hinged metal device called an articulator it simulates the opening and closing of the jaw thats how we finetune the dentures for proper occlusion occlusion the way the teeth come together the bite malik could make the marks with that sean looks intrigued how easy would it be for him to get one of those he could order one off the internet or as i said yesterday he could have stolen one out of dr shubbs office lab you should check and see if shubb has lost an articulator in the past couple of years he might not even have noticed it missing sean makes a note in a small wirebound pad and the dentures same thing malik could have stolen them or they might belong to a relative like francis dolarhydes grandmother sean looks blank who the killer in red dragon oh yeah you mentioned that i saw the movie but i dont remember anything about dentures you should have read the book it was a big deal psychologically those teeth but for us the point is that malik could be using dentures and he could get them almost anywhere a family memberliving or deadis one possibility i want to go through everything you know about maliks family just a minute you couldnt tell the bite marks were made by dentures as opposed to real teeth no what about the saliva in the wounds again that could still be maliks but its more likely to belong to an accomplice if there is one or the killer could even be swabbing in someone elses saliva where the hell would he get that i shrug one of his patients all we know from the saliva so far is that the dna in it belongs to a caucasian male sean mulls this over i guess all malik needs is some spit from a guy he knows wed never check i can see it he takes a sip of coffee the paralyzing gunshot keeps coming back to me its not always paralyzing i shuffle through the autopsy reports of previous victims call it incapacitating thats splitting hairs the point is excellent marksmanship the fax you sent me said malik served in vietnam as a medic i think which means he probably saw action that doesnt make him a good marksman especially with a handgun does malik have any handguns registered in his name one a automatic the murders were committed with acaliber pistol and they searched maliks house already top to bottom no other weapon found what did they find a shrinks househad to be some weird stuff in there sean waves his hand as if he doesnt want to be distracted hes always been more linear in his thinking than i have lets stay with the gun for now funny weapon for this kind of crime you ask me more of a saturday night special than an organized killers weapon he nods or maybe a cops throwdown gun well it obviously does the job i point at a photo of colonel frank morelands naked corpse a neat hole drilled through its forehead we should find out if malik visits any shooting ranges around here see if anyone knows how good a shot he is the task force is already on that we need to get outside the box cat think of things theyll miss like the dentures thing are you going to tell the task force my theory about that sure sean says casually im talking to john kaiser hes a good guy for a fed are you going to tell him i came up with it sean freezes his face uncertain do you want me to what if i say yes if you say yes ill tell him i hold his gaze without blinking yes okay then ill tell him sean looks sincere but i wonder if hell follow through colonel morelands photo brings another thought to mind in some serial murder cases close analysis of the first murder scene ultimately breaks open the case the reason is simple serial killers like any other hobbyist get better with practice theyre frequently very anxious during their first murderthey may not even have meant to kill their first victimand they make stupid mistakes mistakes they never repeat at later scenes but the nomurs killer is different firstvictim angle i say knowing sean will understand my shorthand yeah its led us nowhere right why the guys a prodigy sean shakes his head with something like respect its like he walked out of nowhere onto the pitchers mound at yankee stadium and threw a nohitter and hes thrown nothing but nohitters ever since what does that tell you either hes killed before or or he knows a lot about murder i finish sean nods yeah who would know that a cop who else crimescene tech forensic tech pathologist truecrime reader psychiatrist i say softly sean looks unimpressed maybe whats your point my point is that every killer makes mistakes the first time out maybe not a technical mistake maybe its just his choice of victim why was colonel moreland killed first was he random i dont think so theres got to be a reason kaisers all over that kind of thing cat the task force is taking apart every victims family just bear with me any likely suspects in morelands family hes not from here right just retired here yeah but hes got a daughter living here and a son in biloxi daughter is stacey lorio a registered nurse sean shuffles through the pile of paper on the table and comes up with a fivebyseven photo it shows a blonde woman in her midthirties with a hardlooking face thirtysix years old divorced works two jobs a private clinic and nights at touro infirmary alibis for the murders rock solid the son sean comes up with another photo this one a walletsize shot of a goodlooking man in a blue uniform frank moreland junior a major in the air force stationed at keesler air force base big family man medals out the yinyang his alibis are bulletproof neither one has any connection to malik not that we can find shit i shift in my chair and take a sip of coffee okay forget that for now lets talk about maliks patients do you know yet if james calhoun has any family members whove been treated by malik the hint of a smile plays across seans lips youre gonna love this what maliks still refusing to hand over that information he hasnt given you the names of his patients yet nope hes arguing doctorpatient privilege that wont hold up in a case like this will it sean shakes his head no we can show a judge a strong likelihood that the killer is choosing his victims from maliks patient base that creates a situation of imminent danger which is a public safety issue that should override the privilege sean knows what hes talking about three years ago he earned a law degree by going to night school he didnt really want to but after being wounded in the line of duty he let his wife persuade him that a career change was in order hoping to improve his marital situationnot to mention his financial onesean attended night school while working fulltime as a detective he graduated seventh in his class retired from the force and went to work for a criminal defense firm in less than six months he was going crazy his wife pleaded with him to try working for the district attorney but sean despised the man he told her he was going back to police work and that she would have to deal with it she did not deal with it well our unsub isnt actually killing dr maliks patients i point out using the fbis jargon for unknown subject hes killed relatives of two patients thats all you can prove maybe malik is relying on that to shield his records from the police wont hold up sean says with certainty a judge will consider the privacy issue but with our unsub killing so frequently well get the names of maliks patients at the very least but not the records we should get those too everything but private notes malik takes during sessions couldnt those be important obviously but we wont get them lots of precedent for that i stand and begin to pace my kitchen the real question is why is malik holding this stuff back he claims his patients lives could be destroyed if things theyve told him in confidence become public he says some of them are at risk if it even becomes known theyre in therapy yesterday i suggested this rationale to sean myself but todaygiven the new victimit seems a stretch at risk from whom he wouldnt say im assuming from family members since the two women we know about kept the fact that they were seeing malik secret from their families maybe from boyfriends what if maliks not the killer but hes shielding the killer i suggest then hes an accessory to murder if he has prior knowledge of a crime hes bound by law to try to prevent it that means telling the police i stop pacing what if hes only told about the crime after the fact is he like a priest hearing it in confession same principle sean looks at the table his lips pursed tightly yes i think that would fall under the privilege i sense that im onto something what if a patient comes in four weeks in a row and says i killed somebody a couple of days ago past conduct is protected under the privilege if it werent nobody would ever disclose anything to their shrink or to their priest or their lawyer exceptions to the privilege are based on the risk of imminent harm i take a banana from a bowl on the counter start to peel it then put it back okay so malik could be shielding the killer legally why would he do that because hes an arrogant asshole an academic who cant even begin to imagine the reality of these murders a combat medic probably has a pretty good idea about the reality of murder as sean concedes this with a sigh i feel a sudden rush of excitement what if hes shielding the killer because he believes the murders are justified like a twisted moral stand maybe not so twisted an abuse victim kills the man whos been raping her for years in her mind its selfdefense and to malik justifiable homicide sean adds an edge of enthusiasm in his voice the problem is we have five victims you think one of maliks patients was abused by all five of these guys its possible if there was some kind of pedophile ring or something youre saying the killings are revenge over something that happened a long time ago malik specializes in repressed memories right lets talk about sex for a minute misunderstanding me sean gets a twinkle in his eye he starts to make a joke but the twinkle vanishes as he remembers our present situation does malik treat both men and women i ask i think dr shubb said he did we know hes treated some men we dont know how many the task force is talking to every psychologist and psychiatrist in louisiana and mississippi looking for anyone whos referred patients to malik they already found a psychologist who referred a guy to him last year for sexual abuse the shrink wouldnt say without a court order damn how longrealisticallybefore you can force malik to turn over his patients names kaiser thinks he can get a judge to order it this afternoon maybe the records too and if malik refuses hell be in contempt of court immediate jail no thered have to be a hearing first but he will go to jail do they set bail in cases like that no because on a contempt charge the prisoner can walk out of jail any time he wants to all he has to do is comply with the courts order do you think malik will do jail time to protect his patients names sean gives a knowing smile i think well have those names by tonight good hey did you guys search maliks office too for guns i mean yeah malik was present during the search and he made sure no one looked at his records the records were specifically excluded in the warrant we didnt want to waste time arguing that with a judge but were there records there did you see actual files in the cabinets i wasnt on the scene ill check but im sure someone would have mentioned it if they were missing dont assume anything sean ill bet maliks already moved those records offsite have you kept men at his office to pick up any patients who show up for appointments hell yeah but nobodys shown up we cant figure it out how do they know not to come weve tapped maliks phones since we suspected him and he hasnt called anyone to cancel he doesnt have a fucking receptionist and of course youve gone to the victims families and asked pointblank if anyone is a patient of maliks yeah but were being cautious about that just in case maliks right about his patients being in danger it wouldnt look good if malik warned us that his patients could be harmed and then we got one of them killed in some kind of domestic dispute cautious how are they trying to get female family members off by themselves yeah but its hard to know who they all are what with marriages and divorces and all my mind drifts back to midjuly after the second victim was killed andrus riviere the retired pharmacist i went with sean to interview the riviere family and there i saw a strange sight a granddaughter of mr rivieres was running joyously through the house as though preparing for a birthday party rather than mourning her grandfather and it wasnt a momentary burst of energy she continued to behave that way throughout our visit about seven years old she stuck in my mind because she didnt seem like an insensitive child in fact when i spoke to her she seemed quite the opposite the calm regard in her eyes made me feel as if i were talking to an adult how do you feel about a woman committing these crimes i ask sean stands and goes to the refrigerator but instead of opening it he looks back at me i like the revengeforabuse idea but its hard to see a woman doing what weve seen theres almost no precedent in the literature female serial killers aileen wuornos is about it thats not strictly true almost five percent of serials are female sean looks expectantly at me hes an instinctive investigator and while he is very good most of his knowledge is based on his own experience or that of other detectives around the countryusually men with whom he has a personal relationship ive made it a point to educate myself in the professional literature of serial homicide and my knowledge is far broader this often irritates sean but hes pragmatic enough to make use of what i know female serials operate for an average of eight years before being caught i tell him thats twice as long as male offenders and one of their hallmarks is a very clean crime scene okay he allows but dont most of them have a male accomplice eightysix percent use an accomplice but its not always male what works against a female here is the type of crime most female serials are socalled black widows who kill their husbands or angels of death who kill hospital patients often the victims are family members the only female serial classified as committing sexual homicide against strangers and acting alone is wuornos sean looks almost smug but i think she was wrongly classified i go on aileen wuornos killed to punish men for sexually abusing her one of maliks patients could be doing the same thing im not saying its impossible says sean but the crime signature weighs against it the marksmanship the nudity the torture revenge i argue you have very little coolingoff period in revenge killings and that fits this case and the bite marks are almost certainly made after the incapacitating gunshot a woman would have to disable her victims before getting close enough to bite like that do you really see a woman ripping these guys up with her teeth ive had some pretty violent urges myself a sexually abused woman probably carries around a lot of repressed rage sean yeah but women turn rage inward thats why they commit suicide not homicide hes right about that what about colonel morelands daughter stacey lorio army brat toughlooking woman you said she had alibis for all the murders yep all corroborated couple of times with friends couple of times with her exhusband her ex doesnt even like her but he confirmed talked to him myself he said to tell you the truth i cant stand the bitch but i still like to screw her now and again sounds like a great guy frustration is making me crave alcohol okay then a male patient of maliks abused as a boy a large percentage of convicted serial killers were abused as young boys now youre talking sean says his tone warming the second we get that patient list ill start working that angle he bends over and stretches his back the vertebrae popping like chinese firecrackers you want to take a break my body tenses normally when given an opportunity to be alone for an extended period like this we would spend much of it in bed but today the bedroom door is closed and its going to stay that way my eyes must have betrayed my thoughts because sean quickly says i was thinking of running over to r and os getting a couple of oyster poboys i relaxa little that sounds good ill be back in twenty minutes look you dont have to stay here all day i want to read maliks book sean looks at me with calm sincerity i want to stay if thats all right with you i cant help but smile okay why dont you get the food then he gets his keys and heads out to the garage no kiss goodbye just a light touch on my forearm i go into the bedroom and strip the vodkasoaked sheets then carry them to the washing machine the alcohol evaporating from the cotton is enough to ignite a craving that itches in every cell of my body my mind goes to the valium in my purse but its time to start weaning myself off that a birth defect isnt the first gift i want to give the baby growing inside me to take my mind off my cravingas if anything couldi go back to the kitchen table and pick up nathan maliks book which sean borrowed from the tulane medical school library titled the river lethe repressed memory and soul murder its a thin volume only pages long its dark jacket shows an eerie moonlit scene an old robed man standing in a boat in a river and a frail young woman waiting to board the image seems unlikely to inspire feelings of wellbeing in someone whos been sexually abused but maybe it presses a button in such victims that prompts them to want to discover whats between the covers the book jacket has the opposite effect on me despite my desire to learn more about the inner workings of nathan maliks mind the prospect of wading through pages on child abuse is too much to handle right now maybe its the pregnancy besides sean will be back soon better to start the book later when i can read it in a single sitting while i wait for sean to return i scan a list of maliks professional publications his earliest articles focused on bipolar disorder summarizing extensive work he did with manicdepressives then came a study analyzing posttraumatic stress disorder in vietnam veterans judging by the abstracts of the articles maliks work on ptsd in veterans is what led him to study the same phenomenon in survivors of sexual abuse this in turn led to groundbreaking research on multiple personality disorder oysters in the house sean calls from the garage door he walks in carrying a brown bag spotted with grease hes opening it on the kitchen table when his cell phone rings glancing at the screen he says its joey detective joey guercio is his partner joey what you got the smile vanishes from seans face no shit was kaiser around when they found thisokay ill talk to him later this could be big though i appreciate it yeah they checking all the other vics for the same thingokay call me with anything else they find he hangs up and looks at me theres another connection between two of the victims the first one and todays colonel moreland and calhoun through malik i ask hopefully no whats the connection vietnam i couldnt have been more surprised if sean had said harvard what about vietnam they both served there moreland and calhoun at the same time their dates of service intersect colonel moreland was career army he served incountry from to james calhoun was there in sixtyeight and sixtynine what branch of service none calhoun was a civilian engineer on contract to the department of defense i find it difficult to believe that this connection is relevant to our case vietnam s a big country there were five hundred thousand troops there is there any evidence that the two men knew each other not yet the task force just found this out but it seems odd dont you think not really most of the victims are the right age for vietnam yes but most people that age didnt serve over there a couple of my older brothers friends went but thats all i knew now out of five murder victims we get two guys who did i dont answer im thinking about my father and his vietnam service how many of my schoolmates fathers or uncles served there none that i can recall but i went to a prep school probably quite a few kids from the public school had fathers in that war were forgetting something else sean says nathan malik did a tour in nam same time frame as calhoun which means he was there at the same time as moreland too what do you think about that it is sounding less like a coincidence we could be way off on motive cat this directly links the victims themselves not women who happen to be related to them but youre using malik as part of that linkage and we got to malik through those female relatives sean nods youre right and if these murders have to do with vietnam why are we seeing sexual homicides maybe were not maybe thats just staging think about it theres been no sexual penetration of any of the victims no semen recovered anywhere at the scenes which means theres not even masturbation going on not unless its into a condom and im just not getting that feel from these scenes to me these killings look like punishment our unsub is punishing the victims for something in the past the antemortem biting that could either be torture as punishment or for humiliation like the nudityhumiliation youre going too fast sean says what about the gunshots why arent neighbors hearing the gunshots were assuming a silencer for a saturday night special hell you can get one for anything these days guys have machine silencers in their garage workshops now sounds like something a vietnam vet might know how to do calhouns body was found by his maid right been working there seven years as i search in vain for some new angle on the facts seans cell phone rings again he looks at the screen then up at me its john kaiser kaiser served in nam himself i wonder what he thinks about this sean answers then listens for several moments when he hangs up his mouth is hanging slack what is it whats happened he shakes his head as though in shock the color has left his face twenty minutes ago nathan malik called the task force and said he wants to talk to you my blood pressure drops twenty points thats crazy sean looks me hard in the eyes and i know something bad is coming you havent heard anything yet kaisers outside right now outside where here my house he knew i was here cat oh my god are they following you i have no idea maybe joey told them i was here a hard knocking reverberates through the house we both whirl toward the garage door as though expecting it to burst open but nothing happens sean looks at me in a dazed panic i shrug in resignation i guess youd better let the man in chapter special agent john kaiser is taller than sean and he fills the space in my kitchen in a different way he seems denser somehow and though clearly more reserved than sean he seems capable of sudden action if that becomes necessary the friendly face from the legendre crime scene is gone replaced by a piercing gaze that misses nothing dr ferry he says nodding curtly is this some kind of joke i ask something you guys cooked up to scare sean and me no joke nathan malik has requested a personal interview with you kaisers eyes tell me hes not lying do you have any idea why he might do that no of course not did you tell me everything you remember about the period that you knew him when you were in med school in jackson absolutely kaiser glances at sean then back at me would you remember everything from that time what do you mean you told me that you drank quite a bit in those days the fbi mans attempt at tact does not lessen my sense of violation i look at sean but hes staring blindly forward his jaw set tight what the hell are you saying whats going on here kaisers eyes dont waver you know what im saying i take a step back trying to tap my reserves of selfrestraint do i remember everything that happened at those dinner parties every word and gesture of course not but everything big i remember you never blacked out in nathan maliks presence hell no did he say i did dr malik hasnt said anything dr ferry im just trying to learn as much as i can i never blacked out in his presence do you always remember when you black out how do you know i black out at all i ask glaring at sean look i met malik under another name over ten years ago he hit on me a couple of times i rejected him thats it kaiser looks honestly perplexed then why does he want to talk to you now it seems a strange time for him to choose to renew a casual acquaintance dont you think ask him that he doesnt want to talk to us he wants to talk to you suddenly i know why kaiser has come you want me to talk to him dont you to malik the fbi mans face betrays nothing do you want to talk to him im not answering that why not i shake my head angrily dont play games with me agent kaiser theres no right answer here if i say i want to talk to malik you suspect i was involved with him if i say i dont you ask why not like im hiding something do you want me to talk to the guy or not kaiser holds up his hands in apology im coming off like a jerk here im sorry why dont we sit down for a minute he gestures at the kitchen table when i remain standing he takes a chair and waits i look at sean who shrugs and sits to kaisers right after a moment i sit opposite the fbi man i know this situation is difficult kaiser says but its nothing compared to whats about to come down on you outside that door weve had two murders in three days the medias in a frenzy if they find out malik asked to talk to you thats bad enough if they find out aboutkaiser indicates sean and me with a nod of his headyou can pretty much kiss your careers goodbye why is that sean asks sounding defensive so were having an affair that doesnt have anything to do with our work kaiser looks down at my table which is covered with crimescene photos and copies of police reports shit mutters sean i can tell from his face that he cant quite believe this is happening hes thinking of his wife and kids his retirement i feel more alone and isolated than i did last night im more sympathetic to you guys situation than you might think kaiser says i met the woman im with now during a highprofile murder case i wasnt married at the time but i have some insight into that problem too okay but right now the thing for us to do is focus on this case if we solve this case a lot of shit gets resolved with it how did you know about us sean asks how did you know i was here kaiser throws him a look that says give me some credit then turns to me youre right dr ferry if youre amenable id like you to talk to malik the judge is almost certainly going to order maliks arrest today for contempt of court hes flatout refused to give up the names of any of his patients or their records id prefer not to arrest him yet but theres tremendous political pressure to force some kind of break in this case were already in an adversarial relationship with malik before we jail him and make a bad situation worse id like to learn everything we can from him because hes asked to speak to you we have a unique opportunity to do that but a meeting like that is risky and in more than one way before we go ahead with it i need to speak very frankly to you no room for hurt feelings john kaiser is only three or four years older than sean but he appears to possess a depth and honesty that make sean seem a boy beside him a weariness that has nothing to do with the simple passing of years yet sean is no boy hes a veteran homicide detective whos witnessed much human misery what did this fbi man experience that aged him this way i understand i say oddly excited by the prospect of speaking to nathan malik in person ask away your father served in vietnam correct yes one tour during and yes he was later murdered in i resist the urge to shift in discomfort thats right i was eight i tried to get a copy of your fathers autopsy record but the state of mississippi appears to have lost the original was there any aspect of your fathers murder that could possibly relate to the murders happening here over the past month you mean bite marks like that any similarity at all nothing are you suggesting that my father knew nathan malik in vietnam its possible maybe even before vietnam nathan malik and your father were both born in both in mississippi different towns its trueseparated by two hundred milesbut their paths might have crossed before vietnam or after they were incountry sean looks impatient what do their army records say was it possible if only it were that simple says kaiser ive seen maliks file but luke ferrys military record is sealed by the department of defense until i feel a sudden dislocation from the world around me i cant believe that what the hell are we dealing with here john sean asks no way to know yet kaiser looks unhappy but its safe to say this case is a lot more complicated than i first imagined it was he turns to me i know its upsetting to have your personal life pried open doctor but if you can ask what you need to i tell him i know theres worse coming kaiser looks as if hed prefer not to venture down the path hes about to take after you and i spoke yesterday i called dr christopher omartian to find out what he remembered about malik i close my eyes and steel myself chris omartian tried to kill himself because of me he probably had plenty to say none of it good dr omartian said some unkind things about you kaiser confirms i sensed that he has some issues of his own particularly as related to you but i need to ask some questions based on what he said go ahead he suggested that you might be manicdepressive im not but i have been diagnosed as cyclothymic kaiser gives me a questioning look cyclowhat cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder i have symptoms of mania that fall below the cutoff for true mania they call it hypomania the diagnosis depends on the frequency and severity of your manic episodes the fbi man clearly wants more specific information look i suffer from depression i also have occasional episodes of manic behavior the periods alternate with varying frequency sean has suffered through these swings for almost two years i can be suicidally depressed then a week later flying i think im invulnerable i take crazy risks i do notverynice things sometimes and some timesnot very ofteni dont remember those things kaiser glances at sean who surprises me by saying its not as bad as she makes out shes been doing really well dr ferry kaiser says carefully is there any possibility that youve ever seen dr malik as a patient what i have to ask you that why do you think i have multiple personalties or something im just trying to put together a picture nathan malik and i dont fit into the same picture i dont know the guy all right kaiser steeples his fingers his eyes uncertain do you feel that youre stable enough to handle a meeting like this i start to answer but he holds up a hand im thinking of your panic attacks at the murder scenes theres no telling what kind of head games malik might try to run on you where would this meeting happen malik suggested his office its not far from here actually on ridgelake just off veterans boulevard he wants to talk to you facetoface and alone youre kidding right says sean kaiser shakes his head but his eyes remain on me youd be wearing a wire of course swat would be right outside and you could trigger a rescue with a prearranged phrase if you became concerned for your safety no way snaps sean malik could shoot her before your guys even made the door ive seen it happen john so have you kaiser gives sean a dark look dr malik said dr ferry could come to the interview armed if she wants to he also told us were welcome to tape the conversation the fbi agent shifts his gaze back to me i think you know why im inclined to allow this meeting to happen at maliks office its his territory the more comfortable he feels the more likely he is to say something that might be useful to you kaiser smiles its nice not to have to spoonfeed someone for a change he gestures at the bloody crimescene photos on the table five murders in the past month two in the last three days id say our killer is decompensating rapidly anything we can do to stop him im game for trying this is bullshit says sean pick a neutral location a place you can control i lay a hand on his arm let it go sean when are we talking about doing this kaiser stands and looks down at me maliks at his office now ive got a wire team in the van outside how soon can you get dressed a thrill of anticipation shoots through me for the first time in three days my craving for alcohol has receded to the level of background noise five men have been murdered hundreds of law enforcement agents are working around the clock to find the killer yet no one has come close now im going to walk into a room with the man most likely to have committed the crimes a normal person ought to feel some fear at least some anxiety but i feel only exhilaration the pure and distilled essence of being alive the only feeling that comes close is the almost sexual rush of hyperawareness that signals the onset of a manic episode and no normal person ever experiences that kaiser and sean are watching me with the wariness of doctors in a psych ward i strangle the impulse to laugh give me ten minutes chapter im standing with john kaiser at the bottom of a metal staircase that leads up to nathan maliks office building the stucco structure has only one floor but its elevated on concrete columns so that patients can park beneath the building everything okay kaiser asks from behind me transmitter bothering you im good an fbi technician taped the transmitter to my inner thigh beneath my skirt i almost came casual but at the last minute i chose a pencil skirt and fitted top if malik was attracted to me during medical school a subtle sensuality might serve me well in my quest for information today the transmitter on my thigh is the least of my worries two dozen cops are concealed in and around vehicles parked at the buildings adjacent to maliks eight of them members of a special weapons and tactics team as soon as im inside maliks office that team will surreptitiously enter the building and cover me from one room away unless malik plans to simply pull out a gun and shoot me as i enterknowing that the police are outsidei should be safe yet now that i stand on the threshold of the meeting reality has dampened my earlier excitement i feel as though im about to enter the cage of a tamed tiger the beast might be conditioned to show docility but anyone who believes that savagery can be removed from a predator is kidding himself cat kaiser says anxiously in the past half hour its become clear to me that john kaiser is running the nomurs task force it may be a joint law enforcement operation in name but in the primitive hierarchy that determines the true chain of command kaiser is the alpha male ive tried to be very conscious about how i behave toward him in front of sean its an old problem i have a compulsion to make the dominant male in any situation want me im all right i assure kaiser silently repeating the safety phrase that he gave me a few minutes ago do you follow saints football this mundane sentencein theory at leastwill trigger an explosive entry by the nopd swat team whenever youre ready kaiser says its your show now i climb the steps in a single steady effort then open the door at the top before second thoughts can stop me the fbi agent pats me on the back as i go in and im thankful for the touch it reminds me of my swimming coach wishing me luck before i took my place on the starting block beyond the door is a hallway with doors running down either side threadbare green carpet on the floor brown paneling on the walls the place smells like a doctors office which surprises me most therapists offices ive been to smelled like houses or apartments hello calls a male voice is that you dr ferry yes i answer embarrassed by the smallness of my voice in the dead air of the corridor in here end of the hall the door at the end of the hall is partly open i walk to within two steps of it then pause and flatten my skirt against my thighs it crinkled during the drive over come in says the voice nothing to be afraid of right i say silently and walk through the door nathan malik sits at a large table facing the doorway despite the summer heat hes wearing black slacks and a black mock turtleneck probably silk there isnt a spare ounce of fat on his muscular frame and his bald head seems posed upon his body like a carved bust on a shelf his skin is fair almost pale a difficult feat to manage in the new orleans summer but the paleness dramatically sets off his eyes which have irises so brown they look black his hands are small and appear delicate enough to be a womans i try to imagine those hands firing bullets into the spines of five men in the past month then finishing them off with a shot to the head in a single fluid movement malik stands and gestures at a sofa opposite his desk black leather squares in a tubular chrome framea mies van der rohe or maybe a knockoff as i sit i glance quickly around the office but the place is so sparsely decorated that i only register a few details soft white walls teak shelves a couple of long vertical paintings that look chinese to my left hangs a samurai sword its truncated blade gleaming with threatening purpose to my right on a sideboard sits a stone buddha that looks authentic enough to have been stolen from an asian jungle somewhere everyone likes the buddha malik says taking his seat again where did you get it ive never seen one like it i brought it back from cambodia its five hundred years old when were you there nineteen sixtynine as a soldier a thin smile touches maliks lips an invader i regret taking it but im glad i have it now behind the psychiatrist hangs a large painted mandala a circular geometric design of brilliant colors woven into a mazelike pattern to stimulate contemplation in the viewer carl jung was fascinated with mandalas im curiously happy that youve come malik says are you yes i thought it would be you who showed up to take impressions of my teeth i got a rather ugly little fbi dentist instead im confused did he take impressions of your teeth no oddly enough i assume thats because my xrays were sufficient to rule me out as a suspect he did swab my mouth for dna im sitting the way lauren bacall sits in old movies knees together but showing beneath the hem of my skirt sandaled feet tucked a little behind me as maliks eyes linger on my knees it strikes me that im here to reverse the usual dynamic of the psychiatrists officeto extract information from the doctor rather than the other way around since malik is probably an expert at verbal games i decide to be direct how did you know i was involved with this case doctor he waves a hand as if dismissing a triviality the fbi wanted a few strands of my hair as well but alas he gestures at his bald pate and laughs malik is testing me if the fbi came for hairs they got them one way or the other unless youre bald down low as well which i havent run across yet my my you dont shy away from the earthy realities do you did you expect me to he shrugs with obvious amusement i didnt know i was curious to see how you turned out i mean ive followed you in the newspapers but stories like that never offer any meaningful detail well what do you think youre still quite striking beyond that i dont yet know anything i didnt know before is that really why im here you wanted to see how i turned out no youre here because none of this is accidental what our juxtaposition in space and time we knew each other years ago seemingly in passing and now were brought together again synchronicity jung called it a seemingly acausal linkage of events which have great meaning or effects in human terms i call those coincidences we didnt actually come together until you asked for this meeting it would have happened sooner or later i have a sudden urge to ask malik if he knew my father but instinct takes me in another direction do you have a thing for me dr malik a thing feigned ignorance doesnt suit the psychiatrist well come on an interest a crush a jones do many men react that way to you enough he nods slightly ill bet they do you had them eating out of your hand at umc all those doctors in their forties salivating over you like a bitch in heat malik uses the word bitch like a man who breeds dogs as though referring to a species far down the evolutionary scale you were one of them as i recall i noticed you ill admit that why did you notice me you were out of the ordinary beautiful highly sexual you drank like a fish and you could hold your own in conversation with people twenty years your senior i was also bored are you bored now a thin smile no its not often that i speak to someone with a live audience i slide up my skirt and part my knees enough for malik to see the transmitter pack taped to my inner thigh hello everyone he says voyeurs one and all if were done strolling down memory lane i have some questions for you fire away only i hope theyre your questions id hate to think you volunteered to act as a mouthpiece for the fbi that would be beneath you the questions are mine at your service then do you treat only patients who have repressed memories malik seems to be debating whether to answer this question no he says finally i specialize in the recovery of lost memories but i also treat patients for bipolar disorder and for posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd solely as it relates to sexual abuse another hesitation i also treat some combat veterans vietnam veterans id rather not get into specifics about patients i want to ask him about his service in vietnam but the time doesnt yet seem right im going to ask you this straight out why wont you reveal the names of your patients to the police whatever good humor was in the psychiatrists face vanishes because i owe them my loyalty and my protection i would never betray my patients in that way would merely revealing their names constitute a betrayal of course their lives would instantly be turned inside out by the police many of these patients are very fragile they live in difficult family situations for some violence is a daily reality for others an everpresent possibility i have no intention of putting them at risk to satisfy the whims of the state the whims of the state the police are trying to stop a serial murderer whos probably choosing his victims from among your patients none of my patients has died their relatives have two that we know about and maybe more malik looks at the ceiling in a way thats almost a roll of his eyes perhaps anger surges within me at his apparent smugness its not perhaps for you is it you know who else is at risk yet you refuse to tell the police malik simply stares at me his dark eyes flat and steady how many of the murder victims were related to people you treat doctor do you honestly think im going to answer that catherine please call me dr ferry a gleam of bemusement ahh are you in fact a doctor yes im a forensic odontologist to clarifya dentist maliks eyes have taken on a sheen with highly specialized expertise stillthats not quite a doctor is it have you ever delivered a baby shoved your hand into the chest cavity of a gunshot victim to keep his heart in one piece you know i havent oh thats right you left medical school in the second year before the clinical work really got started malik is clearly enjoying himself did you bring me here to insult me doctor no i merely want us to be clear about who we are id like you to call me nathan and id prefer to call you catherine how about i call you jonathan thats what you called yourself when i met you jonathan gentry the psychiatrists eyes go flat again that is no longer my name its the one you were born with though right malik makes a very european gesture of the head the sophisticated version of a teenagers whatever call me what you like catherine but before we go on lets dispose of this issue of patient confidentiality i tell you now im quite prepared to spend a year in jail rather than betray my patients privacy he sounds sincere but i dont believe this refined professional man is willing to do actual jail time for a principle youre prepared to spend a year in the orleans parish prison i realize that may be difficult for you to understand have you ever seen the parish prison malik turns up his palms on the desk as though preparing to explain a complex concept to a child i spent six weeks as a prisoner of the khmer rouge a year in an american jail can only be a vacation some of my confidence evaporates theres more to nathan malik than ive been led to believe as i try to decide how to proceed the psychiatrist puts his elbows on his desk folds his hands together and speaks in a voice that carries years of hardwon wisdom listen to me catherine you walked in here from the world of light the world of malls and restaurants and fourth of july fireworks you see shadows at the edges of all that you know bad things happen that evil exists youve worked a few murder cases but mostly its abstract the policemen to whom you lend your skills see more of the reality but cops work very hard at denial the ones who dont eat their service weapons anyway maliks pale cheeks color with passion but here there is no denial in this office i shut out nothing here the shadows come out and play these walls have heard the most depraved acts of humanity recounted in all their sickening detail he sits back in his chair and speaks quietly here catherine i deal with the worst thing in the world i fold my hands over my knees dont you think you might be overdramatizing a bit you think so a humorless chuckle escapes maliks lips whats the worst scourge of mankind war i suppose so war and the things that go with it ive seen war he gestures at the stone buddha staring placidly from the sideboard handtohand savagery and anonymous slaughter ive been shot ive killed human beings but what ive seen and heard inside this drab little office building is worse far worse the psychiatrist speaks with such conviction that im not sure what to say why are you telling me all this to answer your question which question the same one all your friends are asking out there in the world why wont he give us the names of his patients whats the big deal i let the silence stretch out hoping to dissipate some of maliks intensity i still think that the imminent danger to innocent people outweighs your patients right to privacy its so easy to say that catherine what if i told you that the majority of my patients are holocaust survivors survivors of concentration camps that were never liberated and that some of them still live with their nazi guards thats not a fair analogy its not true youre wrong maliks eyes flash children suffering prolonged and repeated sexual abuse are living in concentration camps theyre under the power of despots on whom they depend for their very survival they suffer terror and torture on a daily basis their own siblings and often their mothers betray them in the struggle for survival any identity these children have is systematically destroyed and hope isnt even a memory make no mistake doctor theres a holocaust going on all around us only most of us prefer not to see it nathan maliks preternatural calm has given way to a deep and abiding anger he is nothing like the psychiatrists ive seen as a patient at some level i always craved this kind of passion in my therapists but in truth its not their proper role this kind of passion in a therapist is dangerous in a neutral voice i say my memory from med school is that therapists should maintain objectivity at all costs you sound more like a patient advocate than a dispassionate clinician should one be objective in the face of a holocaust just because one happens to be a physician do you know how many american women are believed to have suffered sexual abuse as children one in three one in three thats tens of millions of women thats women in your family catherine for men its between one in four and one in seven i force myself to maintain my neutral tone believed by whom thats hard data not propaganda from some victims group the average duration of incestuous abuse is four years half of abused children are assaulted by multiple perpetrators you want to know more doctor im a little confused i say softly are you treating children or adults with an explosive movement malik stands as though the chair can no longer contain him hes only about fivenine but he radiates a power that seems to have its origin in his unearthly stillness he projects a centeredness ive only seen in devotees of the martial arts youre speaking in a chronological sense he says his voice almost too quiet for me to hear i cant afford to make such distinctions a childs emotional development is typically frozen in whatever stage he or she was in at the time the abuse occurred sometimes i dont know whether im dealing with an adult or a child until the patient opens her mouth sowhat youre talking about now is repressed memories right malik hasnt moved toward me but he suddenly seems much closer than he did before and the swat team seems a lot farther away than it did a minute ago my eyes go to the samurai sword on the wall to my left its placement opposite the buddha on the right wall creates a disturbing impression of extremes peace and war serenity and violence i think you know what im talking about malik says doctor for the first time since entering the office i am afraid my scalp is tingling and my palms are wet the man before me isnt the man i knew in medical school physically he is but emotionally he has evolved into something else the psychiatrist i knew was an observer essentially impotent this man is as far from impotent as i can imagine and his agenda remains a mystery to me i need to pee i say lamely down the hall malik replies his expression unchanging last door on the right as i walk to the door i feel as though his words emerged from the simplest cells in his brain while the higher functions remained totally focused on his internal landscapeof which i am clearly a part alone in the corridor i exhale as though ive been holding in a single breath for fifteen minutes i dont need to pee but i walk down the hall anyway certain that malik would notice a lack of footsteps as i pass an open door on my left i see a man covered in black body armor kneeling in the doorway with a stubby submachine gun his eyes track me as i pass but he doesnt move when i pull open the bathroom door i find john kaiser standing inside he quickly motions for me to enter the tiny cubicle do you really have to pee he asks no i just had to get out of there he jumped up from his desk and it scared me the fbi agent squeezes my upper arm his hazel eyes reassuring do you feel youre in danger i dont know he didnt really threaten me it just felt scary youre doing great cat can you handle going back in i turn the taps on the little sink and splash cold water on my neck is it really doing any good are you kidding this conversation is the only window we have into this guys head i lean back against the wall and dry my neck with a paper towel okay do you feel confident enough to try to provoke him a little jesus how do you suggest i do that kaiser gives me a smile that tells me he knows me better than i thought i dont think you need any suggestions in that area do you i guess not if you feel threatened dont hesitate to pull the plug well have him facedown on the floor in five seconds alive or dead thats his choice kaisers eyes almost glitter in their hardness is it the fbi agent reaches behind him and flushes the toilet youre right where you like to be cat on the edge go nail this guy chapter nathan malik is standing at the sideboard lighting a cone of incense on a burner before the buddha a tendril of gray smoke spirals upward and the aroma of sandalwood reaches me when he returns to his desk and takes his seat the aura of threat that surrounded him before is gone with his shaved head spare frame and black clothing he looks almost like a choreographer from a broadway show but thats an illusion i remind myself this man has killed people in combat if not in the city outside this office do you believe that traumatic memories can be lost catherine in my mind i see the flashing blue lights on the night my father died and feel the terrible blankness of the hours before that i dont reject the idea out of hand i suppose im a little suspicious of it most people are the word repression itself is freighted with all sorts of freudian overtones we should drop it altogether memories are lost by a sophisticated neurological trick called dissociation dissociation is a welldocumented human defense mechanism im sure you recall it from your med school days refresh my memory daydreaming is a common example of dissociation youre sitting in a classroom but your mind is a thousand miles away your bodys in one place your mind in another when the professor calls your name you might as well have been asleep weve all experienced that sure how about driving your car while totally focused on something inside it the cd player a child programming your cell phone your body and brain are performing the task of driving of keeping the car on the road while your conscious mind is entirely occupied elsewhere ive actually driven quite a distance without consciously looking at the road so have i but i dont have amnesia for whatever i was doing at the time you werent in a traumatic situation malik gives me a paternal smile when used as a coping mechanism against trauma dissociation has far more profound effects when human beings are placed under such severe stress that fight or flight are the only sane responses they must do one or the other if theyre in a position where neither response is possible the brainthe mind ratherwill attempt to flee on its own the body endures the trauma but the mind in effect is not present it may well watch the trauma occur but it will not process it not conventionally anyway malik has not moved a muscle apart from those that control his mouth and jaw do you find this concept difficult to accept it makes sense in theory then lets get down to cases imagine a threeyearold girl suffering repeated rape several nights a weekshe never knows whicha man ten times her weight and strength slips into her room and does things to her body initially she may be flattered she feels pleasure and participates but eventually the secret nature of the activity comes home to her she begs him to stop he doesnt threats are made threats of violence abandonment murder a tremendous amount of negative anticipation is set up inside her mind she endures unimaginable levels of fear which night will he come does going to sleep make him come but no matter what she does to prevent it he still comes this huge and terrifying manusually a man who is supposed to love and protect herclimbs on top of her and begins to hurt her maybe shes four or five now but she cant fight or run from him so what happens just as in combat situations the brain attempts to cope with the unbearable as best it can massive defense mechanisms are set in motion and dissociation is the most powerful of those mechanisms the girls mind simply vacates the premises and only her body suffers the rape in the most extreme cases these kids develop did did dissociative identity disorder what we used to call multiple personalty disorder the mind becomes so adept at splitting off from reality that separate psyches come into being prolonged sexual abuse is the only known cause of multiple personality disorder these traumatic memories i say trying to find my way back to the main thread of the conversation they remain intact even though the person isnt conscious of them intact and accessible at a later date years later malik nods the degree of recall varies of course but not the veracity the actual memory is indelible its simply located in another part of the brain this idea of course is at the root of the repressed memory debate well how do you help patients access these lost memories in some ways theyre not really lost if an adult woman finds herself in a situation similar to that in which the abuse took placesay normal sex with her husband and he tries something new like oral or rearentry sexshe may suddenly experience panic pain heart palpitations anything a smell can trigger the same responses a hair cream the abuser wore say bathrooms can do it this phenomenon is called body memory the sensory part of the brain recalls the trauma but the conscious mind does not but how do you bring these memories to the conscious level talk therapy hypnosis what hypnosis has been largely discredited as a tool of memory recovery inexperienced clinicians have implanted too many false memories with it which is a pity throwing the baby out with the bathwater i think do you use drugs malik looks impatient i use whatever approach i think best for a particular patient drugs talk therapy emdr hypnosisi could run clinical jargon past you for hours precise but pointless i find it useful to use symbolism when discussing my work mythology most of all the greeks knew a thing or two about psychology incest especially maliks gaze wanders to my legs again i pull my skirt down over my knees im all ears are you familiar with the concept of the underworld the river styx charon the ferryman cerberus the threeheaded dog i know the basics if you want to understand my work think of it this way victims of chronic sexual abuse arent merely the walking wounded theyre the walking dead the repeated trauma and dissociation i described to you has effectively killed their spirits soul murder is how some clinicians describe this pathology i see these patients souls as trapped in the underworld call it the subconscious whatever you will the children that they once were are cut off from the world of light wandering in eternal shadow but though their souls have crossed the river to the land of the dead their bodies remain behind with us i remember the jacket of maliks book the old man in the boat waiting for the young woman to board what river do they cross the styx your book had lethe in the title malik smiles in surprise five rivers bordered the underworld styx was merely the river the gods swore oaths by my patients have crossed lethe the river of forgetfulness and my job is to do what the living are not meant to do journey to the land of the dead and bring back the souls of those poor children is that how you see yourself a classic hero reversing the whims of fate no but its certainly a heroic undertaking in myth only orpheus came close to accomplishing the task and even he failed in the end i actually see myself as charon the ferryman i know the underworld the way most people know this one and i guide travelers back and forth between the two i think about the metaphor for a while its interesting that you identify with charon the main thing i remember about him is that he had to be paid to ferry the dead across the river your turn for insults malik smiles in appreciation yes charon had to be paid with a coin in the mouth but you misunderstand the metaphor my fees dont pay the price of the patients journey to the underworld the patients have usually paid that price long before they see me to whom to the darkness the price is paid in tears and pain to avoid maliks challenging gaze i look over at the buddha repressedmemory work is pretty controversial arent you afraid of lawsuits lawyers are parasites catherine i have no fear of them i deal in truth i journey to the land of the dead and come back with memories that terrify the most powerful of men they havent got the balls to sue me they know that if they do theyll be destroyed destroyed by eyewitnesses to their own depravity what about your patients ive never been sued by a patient havent you ever made a mistake i mean even if delayedmemory recall is a real phenomenon there are many documented cases of such memories being proven false recantations by patients right the psychiatrist waves his hand im not getting into that controversy with you recantations are a problem for therapists who are inexperienced misguided poorly trained or downright gutless i understand why harold shubb warned me that the fbi had better have an ironclad case if they were going after malik the man has no fear and he never questions his own judgment but maybe thats his weakness ive been here for quite a while now and you havent asked me anything about the murders malik looks surprised did you expect me to i thought they would interest you from a psychiatric perspective im afraid sexual homicide is depressingly predictable as a rule i suppose trying to identify and apprehend particular offenders offers a certain lurid excitementthe thrill of the hunt as it werebut i have no interest in that maliks subtle cuts and backhanded insults remind me of my grandfather on a bad day you dont see sexual homicide as an extreme form of sexual abuse he shrugs its merely the dropping of the other shoe the poisoned chicken coming home to roost childhood sexual abuse is almost universal in serial murderers and theyve frequently suffered the most systematic and violent forms of it the rage they carry is unbearable their turning that violence back on the world is as inevitable as the setting of the sun i suddenly remember kaiser and the others listening to the transmission from my hidden microphone i have a unique opportunity to probe their most likely suspect and i dont want to squander it i close my eyes and try to let instinct guide me but the voice that comes to me is not my own do you have nightmares catherine recurring nightmares before i can dissemble or deny i see blue lights in the rain and my father lying dead his eyes open to the sky hordes of faceless figures caper at the edges of the scene the dark men whove tried to break into my house during countless dreams then the image vanishes and i find myself riding slowly over a grassy pasture with my grandfather in the roundnosed old pickup truck that smells of mildew and handrolled cigarettes we grind our way up a hill toward the pond that lies on the other side my grandfather is smiling but the fear in my chest is like a wild animal trying to claw its way out of my body i dont want to see whats on the other side of that hill this dream began only two weeks ago yet each time it recurs the truck moves farther toward the crest why do you ask that malik is watching me with compassion in his face i sense needs in certain people i sense pain its an empathic ability ive always had more a burden than a gift really i dont remember you as particularly empathetic or insightful for that matter mostly i remember you as an arrogant smartass an understanding smile from the doctor youre still an alcoholic arent you but youre not an annoying drunk noa secret drinker his face wears the sad familiarity of a man for whom life holds no surprises yes thats you publicly an overachiever privately a mess i want to pull the microphone from the transmitter on my thigh john kaiser and the fbi wire team are the only ones hearing this now but god only knows how many people will listen to the tape later i mentioned emdr therapy earlier malik says have you heard of it i shake my head it stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing its a relatively new therapy thats worked wonders for ptsd patients it allows you safely to reexperience your trauma without becoming too distraught to handle the information you might derive great benefit from that im not sure ive heard correctly i beg your pardon youve obviously suffered severe trauma in your life catherine you showed clear signs of ptsd when i knew you in jackson similar to the vietnam vets i was working with at the time thats another reason i noticed you i dont want to let malik know how close to the bone hes come but he has gotten me curious what kind of trauma do you think i suffered the murder of your father for a start beyond that i have no idea merely living with him in the years prior to his death might have constituted severe stress i feel a rush of anxiety as though my innermost thoughts have suddenly become visible to the man sitting in front of me what do you know about my father i know he was wounded in vietnam and that he suffered severe posttraumatic stress disorder how do you know that did chris omartian tell you that another careworn smile does it matter it matters to me malik leans back and sighs wellperhaps we can go into more detail at another time why not now were not exactly alone here i have nothing to hide i say with bravado i dont feel we all hide things catherine sometimes from ourselves his voice feels like a stiff finger probing the spongy tissue of my brain look if were ever going to talk about this nows the only chance were going to get im sorry to hear that i thought you might consider coming to me as a patient my scalp is tingling again are you kidding me im quite serious i cross my legs and try to keep my face impassive this is a joke right i dont even know what im doing here except that you used to hit on me when i was a stupid kid dating a man twentyfive years older than i was and married malik observes and married so youre over that now are you dating married men i dont want to lie but sean is already in enough trouble yes im over it a peccadillo of your student days all behind you now go to hell what is this a frank conversation exchanging confidences is the basis of trust catherine exchanging you havent told me a damn thing malik gives me an expansive smile what would you like to know we can trade stories ill show you mine if you show me yours is that something you do commonly with patients trade horror stories i do whatever is required im not afraid to experiment do you consider that ethical in the benighted times in which we live i consider it essential all right then lets do some sharing your spiel about being the ferryman to the underworld sounded a little shopworn to me the stuff about the holocaust was from the heart youre not just a bystander to sexual abuse are you malik looks more intrigued than angry what are you suggesting i think you have some personal experience youre very perceptive you were sexually abused as a child yes i feel a strange quivering in my limbs as though from a mild electric shock this is the stuff kaiser wants and needs by whom my father im sorry did you repress the memory no but it destroyed me anyway can you talk about it malik gives another dismissive wave of his hand the actual abusewhats the point its not the crimes against us that make us unique but our responses when i was sixteen i talked to my older sister about what had happened to me tried to anyway i was very drunk she didnt believe me why not sarah was married by then shed married at seventeen to get out of the house of course the fastest way she could i asked if our father had done anything like that to her she was flabbergasted didnt know what i was talking about maybe she was just pretending she didnt no her eyes were blank as a dolls two years later i was drafted and sent to vietnam i did well there i had a lot of rage inside but also a desire to help people a quite common paradox among abuse victims they made me a medical corpsman but i still managed to kill some vietnamese vietcong malik raises one eyebrow dead vietnamese were by definition vietcong surely you know that why would i know that another cryptic smile my sense of emotional nakedness has returned look if you have something to say about my father why dont you get it out you knew him didnt you i know every man who served in vietnam more or less were brothers under the skin you didnt answer my question malik sighs i never knew your father are you speaking literally or figuratively does it matter jesus you were the same age from the same state and you both went to vietnam how much do you remember about the night your father died catherine thats none of your business id like to make it my business i think i could help you with it if you would trust me im not here for therapy doctor are you sure you look like you could use a drink i have some isojiman sake here no vodka im afraid how the hell does he know i drink vodka does he remember that from ten years ago finish your story i tell him trying to steer the conversation onto safe ground did i not your sister had been abused too right but she blocked out the memory malik studies me for perhaps half a minute then he begins speaking softly during my tour incountry i got a letter from sarah shed been having nightmares for some time but now she was having what she thought were hallucinations while she was awake images of our father removing her clothes touching her those were flashbacks of course not hallucinations at the end of her letter she told me shed been thinking of harming herself of ending her life what triggered all that your talking to her no she had a daughter by then and the daughter had just turned threeprobably the age at which my father began abusing sarah thats a very common trigger for delayed memory recall in young adult women what did you do i tried to get compassionate leave to go back to the states the army wasnt having any i wrote her letters every day trying to keep up her spirits pointing out all she had to live for some of it must have rung hollow because i had my suicidal moments too id run to wounded men in the middle of firefights when i was almost certain to catch a bullet i ran through mortar fire machinegun fire everything they gave me a medal for my death wish a bronze star anywaymy letters werent enough the flashbacks got worse and sarah came to realize that she was seeing something that had really happened to her she couldnt bear that she hanged herself while her husband and daughter were at the zoo malik is no longer looking at me his eyes have focused somewhere in the middle distance and the glaze over them tells me his mind is far away i dont even presume to express my sympathy i want to know what im doing here i say quietly the thinnest of smiles touches his lips and then his eyes focus on mine at last so do i catherine its time to end any semblance of a charade im here because i think you killed those five men maliks eyes flicker above the smile do you really if you didnt kill them you know who did and youre protecting them them him whatever you get my point oh catherine i expected so much more from you his condescension is finally too much for me to bear i think our murder victims are male relatives of your patientssexual abusersand that by killing them you see yourself as some kind of crusader against an evil you know only too well the psychiatrist watches me in silence what would you think of me if that were true pedophilia has the highest rate of recidivism of any crime abusers never stop catherine they just move on to new victims they cannot be rehabilitated are you saying that murdering them is justified im saying that death or infirmity are the only things that will stop them i pray that the transmitter is relaying all this to kaiser and the others are you an expert shot doctor i can hit what i aim at do you practice martial arts he glances at the samurai sword on the wall i could decapitate you with that before the swat team outside could get in here if thats what you mean a shudder goes through me i glance at the closed door behind me praying theres a swat officer on the other side of it ive forgotten the safety phrase something about football i almost jump out of my chair when malik stands but he only folds his arms across his chest and looks at me with something like pity when you leave remember that weve barely scratched the surface of this subject we havent even discussed the guilty ones the guilty ones he nods how can a holocaust happen in our midst without the community rising up to stop it well think about that catherine i have things to do now you can tell me your thoughts at our next meeting there wont be another meeting malik smiles of course there will much is going to come to you over the next few days thats the way it works he reaches back and takes something off a low table then he leans across the table that serves as his desk and holds it out its a business card out of curiosity i stand and take it on it is printed maliks name and beneath that two phone numbers call me he says if they decide to jail me dont worry im quite capable of taking care of myself the meeting is over i walk to the door then turn back one last time malik looks odd standing there clad in black from head to toe so still that he could be carved in stone im not sure he blinked once during the entire interview dont blame yourself he says chapter im sitting in the backseat of an fbi crown victoria leaning against sean as the car roars down west esplanade skirting lake pontchartrain on its way to the fbi field office john kaiser sits up front with a bureau driver speaking on a large cellular phone that encrypts every word spoken over it find out everything you can about maliks sister and her death he orders someone at the field office malik told dr ferry she committed suicide i want to know about his father too everything you can get and get on the horn to the dod i want to know about maliks captivity in cambodia if hes telling the truth about it i didnt see that mentioned in his record its possible that he met one or more of the victims in a prison camp i tune out kaisers voice and sit up straight on the seat throughout the meeting with malik i held up fine but once outside i began to shake like a soldier after his first battle youll be okay soon sean assures me squeezing my hand you did great did you hear it all every word i think malik could be the guy no shit i close my eyes and grip the door handle every nerve feels as though theres static electricity crackling along it i feel strange inside strange how shaky i dont really want to see anybody sean grimaces they want to debrief you babe can you handle that i dont know right now i feel like jumping out of this car he takes hold of my wrist hard enough to restrain me if i try to jump ive felt this compulsion beforeduring depressive episodesand a couple of times i came close to doing it ill do anything you want cat just tell me now kaiser is talking to the chief of the nopd in about an hour theres going to be a hearing before a district judge where the fbi will argue that malik should be compelled to give up the names of his patients malik apparently intends to forgo legal representation and argue his own case kaiser seems confident that the judge will rule in the bureaus favor but something tells me he may be underestimating his opponent if not i wonder if malik will really go to jail rather than betray his patients everything okay dr ferry kaiser has hung up and turned in the seat so he can look back at me she cant go to the field office right now sean says kaisers eyes remain on me why not shes too shaky shes needs some time to regroup the fbi agent nods but his eyes are all business look its natural to lose it a little bit after something like that well take some time in my office decompress before we talk to the sac or anyone else i want to explain myself to him but for some reason i cant sean looks at me then back at kaiser you dont understand john if she says she cant go right now she cant kaisers eyes probe me like a doctors hands again im reminded of the swimming coach i had as a girl hard eyes gauging my capacity to continue after sustaining an injury are you saying you cant do it i wish the answer were different im sorry maybe later on your office is only five minutes up the lakeshore from her house sean says as if kaiser didnt just leave my house an hour ago ill bring her over as soon as shes feeling better kaiser studies me a little longer then glances at the driver take us back to dr ferrys house i squeeze seans hand in gratitude do you mind answering a few questions for me now kaiser asks his eyes back on me no go ahead was your father ever captured while overseas i dont think so but i cant be sure he wouldnt talk to us about what he went through i mean i was only eight when he died but he never talked to my mother either or so she said maybe she was just trying to protect you from things she didnt think you could handle a week ago i would have argued this but after finding the bloodstains in my bedroom im not sure of anything for all i know my mother my grandfather and pearlie have been insulating me for years from realities i never suspected starting with the truth about my fathers death malik still makes the distinction we all made in nam kaiser says to the agent driving the car you notice that what distinction asks sean between where he is and the rest of the world he says back in the world with a capital w just like the grunts used to say it like hes in a war now a freefire zone a place where the normal rules are suspended he was so calm i think aloud most of the time anyway it was eerie he wasnt like that when you knew him before i dont think so the driver turns right and lake pontchartrain appears on our left steely blue and rolling with whitecaps not many sails today whats your gut feeling about him kaiser asks you looked him in the eyes i didnt did malik kill those men a gull drops low over the road and dives toward the surface of the lake if youre asking me whether i think he could do it my answer is yes i think he could kill without blinking an eye but if youre asking me whether he didi cant say he seems above these murders somehow he wouldnt do it in anger not hot anger anyway if malik is our killer then everything we know about serials so far is going to be useless to us i agree whats your gut feeling i ask kaiser looks thoughtful i used to be a profiler for the isu at quantico i had a knack for it but i had to quit either of you know that sean glances at me then nods slowly do you know why i had to quit kaiser asks i heard you burned out sean says you could say that i attacked a guy in prison a child murderer i was sitting there with the chief of my unit calmly interviewing this con filling out a questionnaire actually and the killer was sitting there describing how hed used his power tools on this little boy ill spare you the details anyway i just snapped before i knew what was happening id gone over the table and tried to punch a hole in his windpipe broke some bones put out one of his eyes my boss had to club me with a coffee mug to get me off the guy kaisers hazel eyes have a faraway look like hes recalling a past life i got the same feeling when i was listening to malik not relating him to that convict but to myself we all have a breaking point you know you sit there for years listening to this obscene stuff being professional maintaining distance then one day before you even realize it the veneer cracks its like you said in maliks office dr ferry if malik is killing these guys its because he thinks hes right its a crusade theyre child molesters and hes decided that taking them out is the only meaningful response to the situation do you think thats whats happening if it is i hope the public never finds out why not because a lot of people would probably agree with him kaiser sighs like a man wrestling with his own inner demons before i can speak again kaisers cell phone rings he answers then faces forward his mind already back on logistical details were close to my house now i let go of seans hand and try to catch sight of it as we round the corner i see the trees first the weeping willow that shades the west side of the house the stand of pines on the other though i have neighbors on both sides the curve of the levee here gives the illusion of seclusion and thats one of the main reasons i bought the place that and the lake view from the second floor i have to be near water the crown vic stops before my closed garage door which has always shielded seans car from prying eyes not much point in hiding it anymore everyone in the department will know about our affair by tonight sean reaches across me and opens my door i wait to say goodbye to kaiser but his conversation shows no sign of ending so i get out and start toward my front door im nearly there when i hear a clatter of heels on the sidewalk dr ferry its kaiser trotting after me i stop and wait you called me cat back at maliks office thats how i think of you he says but its good to preserve some professional boundaries in these situations what situations are those i wonder as sean walks up behind kaiser i appreciate what you did today kaiser says id really like you to come over to the field office later if youre feeling better im not really listening agent kaiser do you think im involved with these murders in any way or with nathan malik kaisers face changes about as much as a rock when the wind blows across it hes probably a hell of a poker player i think you did everything you could today to help us solve this case he says and i think the people who matter will see that why do you think malik said dont blame yourself to me as i left i dont know what do you think he meant this is like talking to a shrink i have no idea kaiser looks at the ground then back at me well just have to try to figure that out together thats all im going to get i offer him my hand he shakes it and then i walk inside my house without looking back chapter im standing at my picture window gazing out at the lake my meeting with malik profoundly disturbed me and im not sure why his cryptic comments about my father stirred up a stew of fragmentary memories but none has told me anything useful im not even sure the images in my mind are real and not things ive pieced together from old photographs and stories a few things im sure ofsalvaged from nights i sat in the loft of the barn my father used for his studio watching him work into the small hours of the morning the roar of the acetylene cutting torch the hiss of steam as he dipped redhot metal into the trough he used to cool it the smell of acids he used for etching the sound of the riveter as he linked various pieces of his sculpture into a whole that existed only in his mind there were no sketches no plans just raw metal and the vision in his head now and then he would remove his mask and look up into the loft at me sometimes he would smile other times he just stared watching me with something like fear in his eyes even so young i sensed that my father saw me as another of his creations one too fragile to handle with confidence he seemed afraid that unlike the metal he shaped with such assurance i might be damaged by a wrong word or move and that the damage could never be undone i thought of the barn as my fathers studio but in truth he slept there for the last few years of his life it was only a couple of hundred yards down the hill from the slave quarters where i slept with my mother but the separation was absolute no one was allowed into the barn when he was working no one except me when i asked my mother for an explanation of these sleeping arrangements she said it was because of the war she wouldnt elaborate my father told me that he had bad dreams at night and that sometimes when he woke up he didnt know where he was at those times he said it was like the war had never ended like hed never made it home when that happened it was better for me and my mother if we werent in the house with him it was only later that i realized that for our family what my father believed during his flashbacks was true the war hadnt ended for him he had never quite made it home what are you thinking sean asks from behind me i dont turn there arent many boats out but i need to watch them a sail moving slowly across the horizon gives me something to focus on when my internal moorings start to come loose like now the frantic feeling that awakened in me upon leaving maliks office has not abated about my dad i say softly what about him just stuff fragments thats all i have really sean lays his hand on my shoulder and squeezes lightly i jump at his touch but i manage not to pull away i need a drink i murmur i really need it he waits a bit before answering what about the baby its a drink or a valium at this point im not sure which is worse would one drink be that bad its not just one drink its the first step off a cliff the grip tightens on my shoulder we need to get your mind off it what can i do i dont know the sail i was watching has vanished the boat is tacking fighting its way back toward shore maybe we should make love seans other hand comes to rest on my other shoulder are you sure no i just need something to numb this thing inside me what is it is it the manic feeling i dont think ive ever felt this before i felt good before i went in to see malik and i was fine while i was with him but nowits like he flipped a switch in my head all these feelings are flooding through me too many feelings sean turns me around and steps close enough that our chests touch i look into his eyes trying to lose myself in them ive done it before lost myself in those green spheres like a little girl swimming in an emerald sea drifting and rolling i jerk backward sean has kissed me and the touch stunned me like an electric shock hey he says worry in his face whats going on i dont know i feel tears on my cheeks i dont know i have this feeling that everythings connected but i cant see how whats connected babe everything all of it the murders me malik kaiser thinks so too he just doesnt see any upside to telling me right now come on cat how could everything be connected how could it not a month ago these murders begin then i start having panic attacks at the crime scenes something thats never happened to me before the only connection between the victims is a psychiatrist i happened to know ten years ago a shrink who hit on me then you make another connection between the victims vietnam who went to vietnam my father nathan malik and two of the victims maybe more of them and they were there in the same year what are the odds of that sean im no mathematician but its not impossible coincidences like that happen all the time his attempt to minimize the significance of these facts infuriates me my father was murdered sean and i dont know why i reach backward and touch the picture window the cool hardness of the glass reassures me somehow i dont remember anything about that night before seeing his body in the garden but i found blood in my old bedroom and im having nightmares recurring dreams and hallucinations ive always had them but now theyre getting worse the fucking rainit wont stop and what does nathan malik specialize in recovered memories sean is looking at me strangely what rain are you talking about and you found blood where i forgot he knows nothing about my visit to natchez in the bedroom i grew up in old blood i think it dates from the night my father died catwhat the hell are you talking about that was twenty years ago twentythree i only found the blood by accident when i went home the other dayjesus that was yesterdaya little girl spilled some luminol in my room i think theyve been lying to me all this time my mother our maid my grandfather for a while i was afraid my father had killed himself but i dont think that anymore i think sean grips my shoulders tight enough to make me stop speaking youve got to calm down i want to hear this but youre starting to fly cant you feel it youre going too fast you told me to tell you when you sound like your thoughts are racing well im telling you hes right my thoughts are racing and i dont want them to slow down ive experienced amazing epiphanies during manic episodes from that dizzying neurochemical height the seemingly random details that confuse normal people form themselves into coherent patterns im almost certain that if my brain kicks up to the next plateau the connections among myself malik his patients and the dead men will leap into stark relief i know what youre thinking says sean i can see it in your eyes youre thinking riding the high is worth the low thatll follow the crash he knows me well thank god theres enough of my baseline identity left for me to hear him in my present circumstances the next crash could kill me tell me about natchez he says what happened there i think i may have seen my father murdered sean why do you think that the night he was killed i stopped speaking that sounds normal enough for a year his cheek twitches as though from the effort of trying to look calm okay maybe not so normal and after talking to malik today im thinking maybe i was so traumatized by what i saw that night that i became dissociated that the truth about his death is locked inside my head somewhere but i cant reach it what do you want to do i want to talk to malik again sean blinks in disbelief jesus cat the guys going to be in jail soon i dont care i think he knows something about me what could he know about you the reason my father died you told me your dad was killed by a prowler and your nightmares are consistent with that faceless men breaking in and hunting you through your house what if theyre also consistent with something else like what i dont know maybe his death had something to do with vietnam our maid thinks one of my dads friends came looking for drugs and they argued but what if it was about something else dating back to the war like what the vietnam war ended thirty years ago yes but it hadnt even been over for ten years when my dad was killed and i really dont know what he did there sean clearly wants to help me but he has no idea what to do weve been in similar situations before listen i tell him not at all sure i should confess this i didnt tell kaiser this but i have the feeling ive met malik before sean looks confused you have met him before at university medical center no somewhere else or some other way shit what way thats what i want to ask malik youre freaking me out cat the guy did act like he knew things about you is kaiser right could you have had more contact with malik than you think but blocked it out somehow i turn up my palms in frustration cat i want to go to bed right now to make love you mean no to sleep sean closes his eyes then opens them and gives me a longsuffering smile okay lets get you tucked in after managing a smile of gratitude i walk past him and down the stairs to my bedroom i want to fall into bed but my hygiene ritual is one of the things that holds me together i manage to finish most of it but my skin lotion will have to wait until tomorrow as i climb under the covers sean comes in and sits on the edge of the bed in the least threatening position possible feel better he asks no what are we going to do about what we were just talking about i shake my head about us he gives me what he must think is a brave smile i dont know cat now that kaiser knows about ustheres no telling what kind of stories will spread can you leave them sean just tell me the truth can you leave your wife and children to be with me he takes a deep breath and slowly blows it out i can i can give up everything to be with you i see in his eyes that its true but do you want to is it the best thing best for who for me yes for the kids i cant say that it might be the worst thing that ever happens to them it might ruin their lives i close my eyes i dont want to ruin anyones life but i dont want to lose mine either youve got three days to decide after that youre either all the way in my life or all the way out sean has witnessed terrible things in his life but those quiet words seem to have put him into shock im pregnant sean i cant wait anymore i have to live a real life he nods slowly he gets it can you sleep id sleep better if you were here i can stay how long its still afternoon five or six hours maybe unless the killer hits again then ill have to go if that happens i want you to go but i dont think it will sean pats me on the shoulder which i hate go to sleep ill be out there watching tv wake me up if you have to leave i dont want to wake up alone i will he kisses my hair above the ear which i like as he leaves the bedroom i prop one pillow so that it blocks the light from the window then turn to the wall and let my eyes lose their focus maliks words are ricocheting through my head like bats in a cave how did he get to me like this what does he know about me that i dont and how does he know it ever since i was a child ive had the feeling that the world makes sense but according to a logic indecipherable to me that the region of my mind that can decode lifes symbols is inaccessible due to the chemical imbalances in my brain only in sleep do i travel to that place and even then the faces i see are obscured the words garbled as though spoken through water as a teenager i experimented with techniques that supposedly allow people to guide their dreams but i had no luck to this day my subconscious remains offlimits to my conscious mind like two hostile nations along a fiercely guarded border when i do dream terror and confusion are the primary emotions i experience im a stranger in a strange land trying to read signs printed in a foreign language praying only to find my way back to the safety of the waking world nothing ive seen seems related to my fathers death though at least not to the story i was always told as sleep draws its curtain over my fevered mind i ask myself again if the adults in my life long ago decided to protect me from a reality they deemed too devastating for me to endure nathan malik seems to think so where wakefulness becomes sleep i never know because my dreams are as vivid as anything i experience while awake this time im back on the island in the ancient pickup truck riding through the pasture with my grandfather at the wheel he points out cows grazing by a fence others standing with dumb satisfaction in a waterhole the acrid scent of tobacco burns my nostrils the trucks round hood is rusted orange and dented from a hundred impacts the engine groans as grandpapa forces the truck up the long slope toward the crest of the hill theres a pond on the other side of the hill ive played in it many times but today im afraid something terrible is waiting over there something i cant bear to see i know its there but my grandfather doesnt i cant warn him my mouth is glued shut i can only sit on the torn vinyl seat eyes shut tight praying god will spare us from the horror that awaits suddenly theres a crash of thunder and then i wake to violence in the dark battle erupting above and around me thick arms flailing fists cracking bone i want to run but im rooted to the bed the combatants struggle over me in silent rage their sole intent to kill ive seen this battle before but this timeunlike the other nightsi see the whites of two eyes flickering in the black mask of one face as the face whips toward the bedroom window i recognize my father and i scream chapter my eyes open in the dark i know the nightmares are over because the little teeth are gnawing at my veins again i need a drink my bedside clock reads am ive slept over twelve hours sean must be long gone he promised to wake me if he had to leave but its morning and here i lie alone it doesnt surprise me much sean has broken promises before ive broken a couple myself adultery isnt a fairy tale sean is probably lying in bed with his wife right now soon hell wake and drive to the fbi field office to work with kaiser and the rest of them picking apart the tapes of my conversation with malik reexamining every scrap of evidence from the murders waiting for me to decide im capable of handling debriefing by the fbi thats not going to happen today lying in the dark i know one thing with absolute certainty i must return to malmaison today i may believe that one of the bloody tracks on my bedroom floor was put there by my foot twentythree years ago but until thats a proven fact i can go no further with the information i have the tools and the knowledge to prove it and i wont feel any peace until i do because i keep my forensic equipment packed and ready at all timeseven the stuff for tests that fall outside my disciplinei can be on the road in twenty minutes i dont plan to take much longer than that its monday and i want to beat the traffic walking down the hall to make coffee i smell cigarette smoke then i hear a cough from the den sean quit smoking a year ago i creep to the end of the hall the den is dark as my eyes adjust to the gloom i see a man sitting on the sofa i reach out and flip on the hall light sean is wearing boxer shorts and his oxford shirt unbuttoned all the way down his face is as haggard as ive ever seen it he looks like a man who has witnessed a terrible accident an accident involving his own family sean what are you doing he doesnt look in my direction thinking i pad over to the sofa and look down at him a bottle of bushmills stands on the coffee table a saucer piled with crushed cigarette butts beside it the bottle was new but its onethird empty now an opened newspaper lies on the table as well and the face of nathan malik stares up from it beside the closeup of the psychiatrist is a shot of malik waving to the camera as hes led along gravier street by policethe socalled hollywood walk that leads from nopd headquarters to the central lockup unit are you all right i ask no have you been here all night in the house i mean no he still hasnt looked up at me you told me youd wake me if you had to leave i tried you wouldnt budge where did you go at last he looks up his eyes are glazed they know cat know what who knows everybody whats happened sean what are you talking about us everybody knows about us i take a step backward what do you mean somebody talked he shrugs as if he doesnt give a damn i doubt it was kaiser maybe it was his driver i dont know but word got back to the task force by suppertime rumors were flying through the department you wouldnt be acting like this over rumors in the department he shakes his head somebody called karen the wife of this detective i pissed off about a year ago she called karen and made it sound about as bad as she could ive been expecting something like this for months now that its finally happened i feel a strange numbness in my chest and karen called my cell phone about eight last night she told me not to come home what did you do i tried to talk to her in person you went home he nods she wouldnt let me in you have a key sean chuckles softly the sound eerily devoid of humor she changed the locks good for you karen i say silently she got a locksmith out there after hours and changed every damn lock on the house i look over at the picture window a faint blue glow lightens the blackness on the left side of the lake the sun is coming i need to move look i know this is a bad timebut i have to go he blinks in confusion go yes youre ready to talk to the fbi no im going back to natchez he rubs his eyes like a man coming awake after a long sleep what are you talking about you just came from there why would you want to go back trying to explain my reasons to sean while hes drunk is more than i want to deal with look i dont need to be here right now i need to go home he waves his arm broadly i thought this was home i have to know what happened in that room what happened the night my father died well you cant just leave malik thinks he has some kind of connection with you youre important to solving the case an image of the psychiatrist comes to me a blackclad figure looking down a corridor like a concerned father wheres malik now whats that newspaper story about hes in the orleans parish prison he refused to obey the court order the picayune ran a story about his big moral stand against the feds some people think maliks a hero for protecting his patients privacy others think hes the killer or that hes protecting the killer all anybody agrees on is that hes the only goddamn lead in the case none of this surprises me look i did what kaiser wanted thats all i can do right now im an expert on bite marks but theyve got somebody else doing that job theres nothing i can do to alter events im done im going home sean shakes his head as though trying to sober himself up last night you asked me if i could give up everything for you i told you i could i nod but say nothing wellwe can be together now right now no waiting ive dreamed of hearing him say this for more than a year but now that he has i feel only sadness you didnt make that choice freely sean you got caught thats a different thing he looks incredulous are you serious on top of that youre drunk you dont know how youre going to feel when you sober up for all i know youll be begging karens forgiveness and trying to sleep at home by tonight i dont want to sound like a bitch okay i love you but i have something important to do and i cant put it off because you happened to get caught last night you do sound like a bitch my laugh is a short harsh bark that surprises even me thanks for making it easier chapter at malmaison i find the wroughtiron gate standing open could the house be on tour its the wrong season for that carefully negotiating the blind curves of the highbanked lane that leads to the main driveway i circle around to the rear drive and pull into the gravel lot behind the two slave quarters and the rose garden mothers maxima pearlies blue cadillac and my grandfathers town car are in the lot theres also an acura i dont recognize the town car is running my grandfathers driver is sitting behind the wheel billy neal gives no semblance of a greeting but stares at me with a strange malevolence im about to walk over and ask him what his problem is when grandpapa marches through the trellis at the rear of the rose garden he wears a stylish suit cut by the hong kong tailor who travels through natchez twice a year and takes measurements at a local motel the dark fabric sets off his silver hair and he wears a white silk handkerchief prominently in his pocket billy neal gets out of the lincoln and opens its rear door but by then my grandfather has seen me and turned in my direction neal leans against the trunk of the town car and lights a cigarette his posture radiating insolence catherine grandpapa calls two visits in three days whats going on im not going to lie about my reason for being here even though it might upset him i came back to finish the work in my bedroom he stops a couple of feet from me his blue eyes twinkling with interest you mean the blood you found yes i want to check the rest of the room for blood and other trace evidence probably the rest of the slave quarters as well the twinkle goes dead what kind of evidence evidence of what evidence of what im not sure but ill find whatever is preserved after twentythree years he glances at his watch youre going to do this yourself i dont think so i wanted to and my forensic equipment is packed in my trunk but if something i discovered ultimately involved the courts that could the courts hes giving me his full attention now what could possibly involve the courts why is he forcing me to say it look i know you told me that you and i probably tracked that blood into the bedroom from the garden that night but but what it was raining that night grandpapa hard he nods as if only now remembering youre right its not that i dont believe you but i cant stop thinking about that rain how could anybody track enough blood over thirty yards of wet grass to make those footprints he smiles youre as obsessive and tenacious as i am i cant help but smile back as far as me doing the work the problem is objectivity if any kind of legal proceeding involved meand if i alone had discovered the evidencethat evidence would be suspect i know people who work at the state crime lab in baton rouge they do some moonlighting reconstructing crime scenes testifying as experts in criminal trials mississippi or louisiana louisiana grandpapa gives a perfunctory nod as though suddenly preoccupied with something else they could work up my bedroom in half a day and videotape the whole thing any evidence they discovered would be beyond reproach honestly i cant even pretend to be objective about this i understand he glances over at his driver then back at me do you have any problem with me doing this grandpapa he seems not to have heard me the stroke he had a year ago wasnt supposed to have affected his conscious thought processes but sometimes im not so sure whose car is that i ask pointing at the acura anns he replies his eyes distant aunt ann rarely visits malmaison her stormy personal life long ago alienated her from my grandparents its my mother who makes the effort to exert a positive influence in anns life but her efforts mostly go in vain diagnosed as bipolar in her midtwenties annthe beautiful and favored child of the familybecame a cautionary tale in local society an example of how great wealth doesnt necessarily confer happiness is she visiting mom i ask shes with gwen now but she actually drove up to see me what about grandpapa sighs wearily whats it always about money mom told me that aunt ann long ago depleted the trust fund my grandfather set up for her yet she has no qualms about asking for money whenever she needs it mom said anns new husband is beating her grandpapas face tightens and i sense the slowburning anger of a man who judges men by his own strict code if she asks me for help with that problem ill intervene i want to ask if he gave ann the money she requested but i dont he probably wouldnt tell me hes looking at his watch again catherine i have a meeting with a member of the mississippi gaming commission its about maison desalle i cant be late i suddenly remember the architectural model he showed me in his library his plans for federal certification of a natchez indian nation oh right good lucki guess across the parking lot billy neal holds up his wrist and points at his watch grandpapa waves acknowledgment then gazes deeply into my eyes as though trying to communicate something important through his hypnotic blue eyes hes brought the full weight of his considerable charisma to bear on me his mental capacity hasnt diminished at all catherine he says his voice grave id like you to postpone your plans until i get back from this meeting it wont take more than an hour or so why he reaches out and takes hold of my hand its a delicate matter a personal matter personal for you for me a strange buzzing has started in my brain then tell me now i was about to call the crime lab and get things moving this isnt the proper place dear we should talk in my study lets go then i cant now i have the meeting i shake my head in frustration im tired of being in the dark grandpapa if you want me to hold off doing this tell me whatever it is right now anger flashes briefly in his eyes but instead of chastising me he walks slowly around the audi and climbs into the passenger seat his desire is clear i get into the drivers seat beside him but hes not looking at me hes staring through the windshield with a faraway look in his eyes listen i say ever since i found that bloodlong before that reallyive had the feeling you guys have been keeping something from me about that night im sure you think youre protecting me but im not a child anymore okay not even close so please tell me what this is about his eyes remain on the red sea of rosebushes in the garden the rain he murmurs we were foolish to think we could lie to you and get away with it for long his big chest falls with a deep sigh you always had finely honed instincts even as a child my extremities are tingling please hurry grandpapa suddenly faces me his eyes solemn the eyes of a doctor about to break bad news darling your father didnt die where we told you he did a strange numbness seeps outward from my heart where did he die luke died in your bedroom my bedroom the numbness inside me turns cold the numbness of frostbite internal frostbite i look away my eyes drawn to the roses ive hated for so long how did he die look at me catherine look at me and ill tell you all i know i force myself to turn to focus on the lined patrician face and he begins to speak in a soft voice i was downstairs reading i heard a shot it was muffled but i knew what it was it sounded the way our ms did when we mopped up the jap bunkers after the flamethrowers went in when i heard the shot i ran outside i saw a man running away from the eastern slave quarters your house i didnt chase him i ran straight over to see whether anyone had been hurt was the running man black like you told me before yes when i got inside i found your mother asleep in her bed then i checked your room luke was lying on the floor bleeding from the chest his rifle was beside him on the floor where was i i dont know i examined lukes wound and it was mortal did he say anything grandpapa shakes his head he couldnt speak why not catherine why not he was drowning in his own blood from a wound to the side of his chest darling that rifle was loaded with hunting rounds designed to mushroom on impact the internal damage was devastating i shut out the pain by focusing on details did you touch the gun i picked it up and smelled the barrel to see if it had been discharged it had did you call the police pearlie did she called down to check on you just as i told you the rest happened much the way i told you the other day your mother woke up and you walked into the bedroom moments later where had i been i meanit happened in my bedroom he takes a moment to consider this outside i think who moved daddys body into the rose garden i did why to protect you of course what do you mean grandpapa shifts on the seat but his eyes remain on me deadly earnest and filled with certainty you were eight years old catherine your father had been shot by an intruder in your bedroom if that story had been printed in the examiner there would have been no end to the morbid speculation what happened to you before luke arrived were you molested in some way raped in this little town that would have followed you for the rest of your life i saw no reason to put you through that and neither did your mother luke was dead it made no difference where the police found his body mom knows of course and pearlie it was pearlie who helped me clean lukes blood off the bedroom floor and walls before the police arrived not that it mattered they never even checked the slave quarters why not he looks at me as though the answer should be selfevident they believed what i told them luke was lying dead under the dogwood tree in the rose garden i told them how it happened and that was that such a passive police response would be unimaginable in new orleans even back in but in the natchez of twenty years ago what local cop was going to question the word of dr william kirkland especially when his soninlaw had just been murdered did they do any forensic investigation at all did they search the grounds for blood or other evidence yes but as you pointed out it was raining hard they didnt put too much effort into it it was a sad night and everybody wanted it over i gaze across the rose garden to the slave quarters that was my home for sixteen years then i pan my eyes right to the dogwood tree where for most of my life ive believed my father died luke was deadit made no difference where the police found his body but of course it does make a difference to me it makes all the difference in the world but grandpapawhat if something did happen to me did you ever think about that before he can answer his town car pulls alongside my audi on the passenger side billy neal gives my grandfather a pointed look whats his fucking problem i snap grandpapa frowns at the expletive but he motions for billy to pull away after about ten seconds the driver obeys of course i considered the possibility dear i examined you myself after the police had gone and i saw no evidence of assault you checked me for sexual assault he sighs again obviously put out by the specifics of my question i did a thorough examination nothing happened to you nothing physical i mean the psychological shock was clearly devastating though you stopped speaking for a year what do you think i saw i dont know on the milder side the prowler might have exposed himself to you i suppose he might have fondled you or forced you to fondle him but at the other end of the spectrumyou might have seen your father murdered before your eyes i want to hide my quivering handsmy grandfather despises weaknessbut theres nowhere to put them then he closes one of his strong agespotted hands around both of mine stilling my tremors with the force of his grip do you have any memory of that night not before i saw his body i have nightmares though ive seen daddy fighting with a faceless manother things but nothing that makes any sense he squeezes my hands harder those arent nightmares dear those are memories ive said some bad things about luke i know and god help me ive lied to you as well hopefully for a good reason but one thing i told you you can take as holy writ your father died fighting to save your life he probably did save your life no man could have done more i close my eyes but the tears come anyway ive always felt a certain amount of shame about my fathers warrelated problems to hear now that he died a heroits almost too much who did it grandpapa who killed him no one knows did the police really look youd better believe it i rode them hard but they couldnt come up with anything i can i say quietly i can take apart that crime scene with tools that didnt even exist about back then grandpapa is watching me with grief in his face im sure you can catherine but to what end what if you were to find dna from an unknown person there were never even any suspects are you going to take blood samples from every black man in the city of natchez that could be five thousand people and the killer could easily be dead now he could have left town years ago are you saying i shouldnt try to find out who murdered my father grandpapa closes his eyes just as i decide he has fallen asleep he opens them again and turns them on me with startling intensity catherine youve spent your adult life focused on death now youre about to cross the line into fullblown obsession i want my granddaughter to live i want you to have a family children im shaking my head violently not because i dont want those things but because i simply cant think about them now and because i already have a child on the way thats what luke would want grandpapa finishes not some belated quest for justice with no chance for success its not just justice i want what then the man who killed my father is the only person in the world who knows what happened to me in that room at last my grandfather is silent something happened to me that night something bad and i have to know what it was grandpapa is saying something else but i cant make out specific words his voice seems to come from across a windy field pulling one hand loose i yank open the door and try to climb out he tries to hold me by my other hand but i relax my fingers and the hand slips free my feet hit the ground and i start running toward the slave quarters sensing something amiss billy neal jumps out of the lincoln and blocks my path get away from me you shit i scream he grabs for my arms but i pivot and reverse away from the buildings without looking back i sprint down the hill toward the bayou where the barn that served as my fathers studio and sleeping quarters stands in the shadow of a wall of trees ill be safe there voices cry out behind me one of them pearlies but i run on windmilling my arms like a panicked little girl chapter i cant get into the barn for the first time in my life my fathers sanctuary is closed to me the main entrances are padlocked and the secret ones i used for years have been nailed shut if i could find a ladder id try the loft door but as i begin looking for one i hear pearlie shouting from the direction of the house shes running down the hill in her white uniform that shes over seventy seems not to affect her speed at all her bony legs move in a herkyjerky motion giving her the appearance of a marionette being controlled by invisible strings but she moves fast i wait by the barn watching pearlie come wondering what she has to say thats so important the air here smells of the bayou beyond the barn decaying vegetation dead fish frogs snakes skunks the mosquitoes have always been bad down here too but daddy never seemed to mind them what you doing here pearlie calls i want to look in the barn she slows to a stop panting why because i want to be close to my father because his grave does nothing for me because here where his final sculptures are storedunsold at my requesti feel a connection with him that has never died or even faded i just do i snap why is it locked all mr lukes metalwork be in there all i thought there were only a couple of unsold pieces left used to be but your granddaddy been buying up all the others whenever something comes on sale he buys it he got at least ten of them things in there big ones too this seems impossible to me why is he doing that he never liked daddys work pearlie shrugs got to be money in it some way them statues worth money aint they some of em he brought all the way from atlanta a few collectors think theyre important but theyre not worth the kind of money that matters to grandpapa pearlie steps closer and looks me in the eye what happened in that car up there whyd you run away like that i turn back to the barn door grandpapa told me where daddy really died she circles me so that she can maintain eye contact i see fear in her eyes what are you afraid of pearlie what did you think he told me i aint afraid of nothing you tell me what he said he told me daddy didnt die under the tree he was shot in my bedroom saving me from the intruder pearlie seems frozen in place what else did he say he told me that you cleaned daddys blood off the walls and the floor the old woman lowers her head how could you do that how could you lie to me all these years pearlie shakes her head her eyes still downcast i got no regrets about cleaning that blood wasnt no good going to come from you knowing any different than what we told you you dont know that isnt it always better to know the truth no matter what she looks up her eyes brimming with emotion maybe you aint lived long enough to learn it yet but some things its better not to know specially if youre a woman why do you say that if everybody knew what everybody else was really thinking and doing all the time thered be a lot more people in the jailhouse and there wouldnt hardly be one family left together hardly any left together now come to that especially black ones i want the truth pearlie i dont want to be protected i dont want to be lied to i want the truth however bad it is you dont know what youre saying girl you think you do but you dont i take hold of her arm you know everything that ever happened to this family what else have you been keeping from me nothing what dr kirkland done that night was right wasnt no use having everybody talking bout you being raped all them old white ladies would have been whispering poison every time you walked into a room you didnt need to carry that around with you not in this little town i dont care what those people think not now not then you know that pearlie nods you a strong girl all right always was but you didnt need that scandal hanging on you now come back up to the house dr kirkland got the only key to this old barn you gonna have to wait on him to get inside and he gone to his meeting now i jump as my cell phone beeps out u its sean my first instinct is to ignore the call but something makes me answer what is it i ask hold on to your socks sean says his voice raspy from an obvious hangover at eight oclock this morning nathan malik gave up the names of his patients i cant believe it theres no way a man who spent time as a prisoner of the khmer rouge was broken by one night in the parish prison is he out of jail now yep and we were suspicious for the same reason you are why would malik go to jail on principle then suddenly crack its almost like he did it for the publicity and once he got that he caved well kaiser suddenly realized that without maliks medical records we had no way to know whether the patient list was complete so he got a court order authorizing us to compare the list to maliks computer records well guess what there werent any the hard drives at his office were wiped clean this i can believe the data can still be retrieved you just youre not listening cat the datas gone all of it the fbi technicians said it would take somebody who really knew computers to pull that off malik could do it hang on i gotta run cat things are popping down here i miss you he clicks off leaving me feeling utterly dislocated from my old life bad news pearlie asks not good i reply wondering whether the list malik gave the police has a single current patients name on it i turn reluctantly from the barn and follow pearlie up the hill as we reach the parking lot my mother and aunt ann walk out of the rose garden each is rolling onehalf of a matched pair of louis vuitton suitcases from a distance they could be twins but as we near them anns age shows itself in her face only four years older than my mother shes paid the price for years of alcoholism and hard living a friend of mine from natchez wrote a book about her troubled family in it she wrote beautiful women are haunted houses i always think of that line when i see aunt ann ann was the one that the boys always followed home her face had the classic proportions that transcended smalltown prettiness but beauty seemed to bring her more trouble than happiness and by fifty it was mostly gone now her cheeks hang on the longenvied bone structure like ragged sails on the woodwork of a onceproud ship looking at the spiderwork of veins in her face i touch my own knowing that one day my secret drinking will exact the same price from me what have you two been doing down by the bayou my mother calls the mosquitoes will eat you alive down there looking at the barn i answer i wanted to see some of daddys pieces the smile fades from moms face well theyre all locked up now ann props up her suitcase walks over to me and gives me a tight sisterly hug not one of the side hugs my mother favors then she draws back and looks into my eyes hers are as blue as my grandfathers and almost as penetrating if i didnt know better cat id think youve been crying i shake my head wondering if ann knows where daddy really died good thats my department how are you holding up down in new orleans fine im good she nods though she obviously doesnt believe me you seeing anybody of the male persuasion down there i have a guy yeah handsome i force a laugh i dont feel yes good for you every mans going to wear you down eventually so you might as well pick one whos pretty to look at ann gives me a conspiratorial wink but i cant summon another laugh theres a glitter in her eyes that makes me wonder if shes in a manic phase anns headed back to the coast soon says my mother but were going to have brunch at the castle first why dont you put on some decent clothes and join us thats the last thing i want to do now but looking for some of my fathers sculptures wont qualify as a sufficient excuse in my mothers book id really like to but i have some things to do mom looks put out for example i search for an excuseany excuseto skip lunch dr wells asked me to come swimming over at his house ann gives me another wink sounds a lot better than lunch with us you go on cat well catch up with each other soon in the most casual voice i can muster i say mom who in town has some of dads work on display well they still have that piece at the library and theres the one at the vietnam veterans building over at duncan parkthe helicopter other than those and whats in the barn everythings in private homes most of them are far from natchez i give ann another hug then glance at pearliewho has watched this exchange like a silent sentineland set off through the trees toward michael wellss house my plan is to turn around as soon as ann and my mother drive away but they stand by the acura talking to pearlie as if they have all day with little choice but to play out my charade i walk deeper into the trees something moves among the trunks to my right and it startles me then i recognize mose the yardman hes setting mole traps in the scraggly grass beneath the trees about thirty yards away looking at him bent over the ground i recall grandpapas description of the prowler who ran away from the slave quarters on the night daddy died he was black could that have been mose hes lived on the property for decades he always drank quite a bit and it strikes me now that he might have had some dealings with my father over drugs i veer toward the old man and walk for several yards but something makes me stop short of him mose had an open window into my life from infancy to age sixteen is it possible that he lusted after me to the point that he came into my room and tried to molest me could he have done something before that night even on the grounds of malmaison maybe under the tin roof of the barn could that something have been so traumatic that i blocked it out before talking to nathan malik i wouldnt have considered this but now thinking of the nightmares that have troubled me for yearsfaceless black figures breaking into my housei wonder the idea that a random prowler would walk all the way from the highway to malmaison during a rainstorm has always bothered me but if that prowler were mose he wouldnt have had to walk more than a hundred yards could he be the faceless black man in my dreams the demon fighting my father in the dark ill have to ask pearlie that mose hasnt seen me yet behind malmaison ann and my mother are still talking by the car i might be able to reach michaels house without mose seeing me but michael is bound to be at work i could still use his pool though i think of the flat rock in his flower bed five or six minutes on the bottom of that pool might be just the thing to calm me down im thinking of sprinting the rest of the way when the sound of a motor carries through the trees anns acura is backing up i hear her shift gears and then the car rolls slowly down the curving driveway toward the gate miss catherine croaks a voice parched by thousands of handrolled cigarettes i whip my head around mose is standing erect staring at me from behind his pile of mole traps that you miss catherine my eyes aint so good no more its me mose i call already walking back toward malmaison dont work too hard in this heat heat dont bother me none he laughs ill take it over the cold any day i give him a broad wave then turn and race back toward the house chapter the vietnam veterans building is closer to malmaison than the public library so i go there first situated in the citys main public park the small onestory building began its life as the pro shop of the public golf course the vietnam vets took it over when the golf course was expanded to eighteen holes and a new pro shop built in another part of the park they used it for support group meetings for parties and for a place to hang out besides home the dilapidated building sits on a long slope below the oakshaded public playground that natchez kids have used for sixty years overlooking the playground is auburn an antebellum mansion that serves as headquarters for one of the local garden clubs across the lane from auburn stands an old steam locomotive a sort of living museum for children in the distance i see the public swimming pool the only decent pool where black children can swim en masse in the city its been closed for the past four years due to lack of money for repairs down the long slope from the vets building red and green tennis courts bake in the sun surrounded by the grassy fenced triangles of little league ball fields i expected to find my fathers sculpture inside the veterans buildingwhere i last saw itbut as i pull into the parking lot i see the shining rotor blades that crown the piece jutting over the roof have they mounted it on some kind of pedestal i get out and walk around the corner a housesize structure stands on the lawn built of wooden poles hung with parachutes and camouflage netting inside the netting is a grass hut and in front of the hut an army tent forms the centerpiece of a simulated military campsite a steel beam rises out of the center of this scene and mounted atop it is my fathers sculpture a brushedsteel huey helicopter with a wounded soldier suspended from its belly by a winch cable its one of the most realistic pieces my father ever did most of his workespecially the later stuffwas far more abstract like the tall tree standing between the twin staircases at the public library but the ascending helicopter pleased everyone what its doing in the middle of this throwntogether display puzzles me though can i help you miss a heavyset man with a grizzled beard is walking toward me he wears army fatigue pants a black mia tshirt and harleydavidson motorcycle boots a gold earring decorates his left earlobe and a braided silver ponytail hangs over his right shoulder he looks to be in his late fifties i hope so my dad sculpted that helicopter up there i came by to see it a smile lights up the mans face youre luke ferrys kid it feels good to be recognized as something besides william kirklands granddaughter thats right did you know him sure not real well of course but he came to a few meetings here kept to himself quite a bit but he did this helicopter for us i tell you for anybody who served in nam the huey medevac is a thing of beauty like a guardian angel coming to pull you out of hell i nod unsure what ive really come for i thought you kept it inside the building we do most of the year but on july fourth the priest from st marys does the blessing of the fleet out at lake st john theres a boat parade out there and contests for best float we do one every year for the mias to keep up awareness you know weve put your daddys chopper on there four years running its been sitting out here for the past month the bearded man looks embarrassed we had tarps on it till today im actually here to break down the float we brought it back from the lake on a flatbed and this is as far as we got everybody was a little drunk but man people love to see that huey coming up the lake gives em a good feeling inside specially these last couple years with all the boys overseas now i find myself smiling daddy would have liked that the vet nods then sticks out his hand jim burley miss proud to know you cat ferry another smile cat huh short for catherine oh i get it well what can i do for you tell me my father was a good man well i was only eight when my dad died so he never really told me about the war do you know much about what he did over there burley thinks for a bit then scratches his thick beard why dont we sit down in the shade over here i follow him to an olivedrab picnic table beneath an oak tree and sit opposite him a bumper sticker stuck to the top of the table reads for those who fought for it freedom has a flavor the protected will never know your dad was a quiet guy burley begins i guess you know that already a few years younger than me luke was served his tour a couple years after mine lots of guys who come in here are quiet types but they tend to open up after a while luke stayed quiet he wasnt unfriendly or anything just needed a little more space than most people you know the war did that to some of us i nod trying to picture my father inside the little building or even sitting at this picnic table he needed a lot more space than most people all i really know burley says is that luke didnt pull no runofthemill tour way i heard it he was a crack shot long before he got inducted hunted all his life out at cranfield probably so when they took him into the airborne they made him a sniper a sniper ive never heard this before burley nods thats a tough job oneonone killing you know and not in the heat of battle either to do that job you gotta be able to kill in cold blood and unless you got a screw loose somewhere that takes something out of you i cant believe no one in the family has told me this but maybe they didnt know either do you remember anything else burley takes a deep breath and sighs couple of the guys wangled a few facts out of luke the picture we got was this your daddy was taken into some kind of special unit sort of a raiding unit the kind they used to go into places we werent supposed to be in like where like laos and cambodia an inexplicable shudder goes through me i close my eyes and see nathan malik sitting before me telling me about his stone buddha i brought it back from cambodia do you know for sure that my father was in cambodia i dont know nothing for sure honey but it was one of those places anyway there was some trouble about this unit he was in accusations of atrocities that kind of thing i shake my head more from surprise than disbelief the government got up an investigation for a bunch of courtsmartial then they just dropped it all flushed the whole thing down the pentagon toilet when was this some of it during the war i think soon after it happened then again later on i think luke was dead by that time though look mr burley i want you to be straight with me do you think my dad was involved in war crimes the vet thinks about this for a while i tell you cat looking back on it now a lot of what i done over there seems like crimes to me but when i was there i didnt think twice about it it was part of the job the rules of engagement didnt cover half the situations you ran into it was survival hindsights a luxury we didnt have now a lot of hollywood movies dont show nothing but grunts cutting off ears and killing women and kids and some of that happened i wont lie that and worse but most guys just served their tour and did the best they could to be honorable men im sure thats true but im not here about them i want to know about my father burley gives me a heavyhearted smile im telling you about him though it may not sound like it im telling you that whatever luke did you aint gonna be able to understand by looking backward from the usa thirtyfive years later im not excusing atrocities or anything like that im just sayinghell i dont know what im saying a deep sense of frustration is building inside me is there anybody i could talk to who might know more specific information somebody daddy might have confided in burley shrugs there was a black guy luke was pretty tight with for a while some of the brothers dont come around here as much as they could we try to make em welcomea vets a vet you knowbut it was the same incountry especially after sixtyeight when dr king was assassinated do you remember this guys name jesse something cant quite recall his last name burley waves back toward the building ought to have it inside but i dont our records are for shit right now computers busted jesse was in the airborne too i remember that different unit from your daddys same unit jimi hendrix served in jesse was real proud of that was jesse from here no louisiana down the river a bit st francisville maybe you cant remember his last name burley squints like man looking into bright sunlight i know iti just cant get it oldtimers disease you know wait a second billings no billups billups thats it like the gas stations we used to have around here jesse billups spec st airborne id hoped i would recognize the name but i dont glancing down the hill toward the tennis courts i wipe sweat from my eyes i played tennis down there a few times in another life it seems now i look up at my car but feel no inclination to drive anywhere do you need help taking down the float burley laughs i dont need it but id sure love the company i know you got better things to do than hang around here though im not sure i do hey he slaps the picnic table with a beefy palm you ought to be able to find jesse real easy whys that youre dr kirklands granddaughter right grew up over in that big house where luke lived in the barn yes well jesse was related to the housekeeper over there second cousin or nephew something like that my scalp and palms are tingling to the housekeeper you mean pearlie pearlie thats it burley laughs jesse used to talk about her some and not all of it good his mama was related to pearlie some way i stand so suddenly that i feel lightheaded im sorry mr burley i need to go sure no problem thank you so much im already walking backward toward my car hey listen burley calls dont you worry about what your daddy done over there he came back alive thats the main thing right there is it i wonder trotting toward the audi i wonder he made us this huey burley says anybody makes something that pretty and gives it away for free hes gotta be all right down deep you know no i dont i think climbing into the car i dont know anything anymore chapter pearlie washington is sitting on her porch reading the newspaper when i drive into the lot behind the slave quarters aunt anns acura hasnt returnedor else its come and gonebut my grandfathers lincoln is back i see no sign of billy neal though and im glad for it where you been pearlie asks not looking up from her copy of the natchez examiner shes wearing street clothes and a pair of reading glasses they look expensive unlike the walmart specials my mother wears driving driving that sounds like what you used to tell me when you was a teenager out chasing boys i never chased boys they chased me there are two rockers on pearlies porch i sit in the empty one dont bother asking she says i done told you all i know about what whatever it is you gonna ask me about i look over at the rows of blooming rosebushes pearlie i think you could talk from now until next week and not finish telling me everything you know about this family i aint paid to talk im paid to clean she licks her finger and turns a page dr overtons wife died yesterday she was a cranky old soandso tell me about jesse billups pearlie goes still like a deer sensing threat dont even try to pretend you dont know who he is she looks up from her newspaper at last who you been talking to a guy who served in vietnam jesse billups knew daddy pearlie i want you to tell me who and where he is you know ill find out one way or the other i cant believe you never told me about him before pearlie closes her eyes as though in pain jesse is my sisters child half sister really we had the same mama but different daddies your sister from desalle island pearlie nods ivy the only sister i got i see an image of a small strong black woman with her hair pulled back in a bun with this image comes the smell of alcohol and a memory of pain ivy gave me a painful tetanus injection once after i stepped on a nail in the pond where is she now ivy done passed baby dont you remember been almost four years now i dont remember hearing that ivy died but i remember the woman wellnot by name but by occupation she worked as my grandfathers assistant in the little building known on desalle island as the clinic grandpapa maintains the clinic to treat the islands black population whenever he stays there or when emergencies arise at times more than a hundred people have lived and worked on the island many of them using chain saws and dangerous farm equipment daily i saw grandpapa stitch up so many lacerations there that by twelve i could do it myself if the need arose he charged nothing for his services so most islanders waited for his visits rather than seeking medical care on the mainland across the river ivy had no formal medical training but she was smart silent and had deft hands grandpapa taught her enough to do a good deal of doctoring in his absence their most famous exploit was removing my aunt anns appendix by lantern light during a storm that cut off the island from the mainland in what about jesse billups i ask is he still around pearlie sighs and rubs her forehead baby what you digging into all this old business for i refuse to be sidetracked is jesse still alive jesses the foreman on the island now or caretaker or overseer whatever they call it now jesse billups is caretaker on the island now he runs the hunting camp all of that sho do how old is he fiftysomething i guess if he was ivys son why dont i remember him pearlie shrugs again he took his daddys last name for one thing even though he was an outside child plus he was gone a lot back in your day went off to the city with some big plan but all he got was big trouble did him a hitch in angola right across from the island funny when you think about it ive never seen much funny about angola penitentiary you dont sound like you care for him much jesses all right i reckon i told you the other day some good boys went over to that war and came back different not their fault what happened to him in the war different things i guess some inside some out he never talked about it same as mr luke did you ever see jesse talking to daddy i seen em together some thick as thieves for a while mr luke spent a lot of time down on the island said he liked the quiet down there what did they do together smoked that dope probably pearlies voice is bitter thats about all jesse done after he got back and daddy mr luke did some of that too not as bad as jesse though your daddy had a lot of pain from his woundin his mind too i think he used that weed to help no hard stuff though when was the last time you saw jesse been a long time now he stay on the island and i dont go down there never pearlie shakes her head i dont like it dont like the peoples and they dont like me why not you were born on that island she snorts im a house nigger girl youre kidding me that kind of stuff is ancient history she peers at me over the rims of her reading glasses not on desalle island it aint they never joined the modern world down there dr kirkland likes it that way and i think the black peoples down there like it all right too change is something they cant abide well im going down there pearlies eyes widen when today im going to see jesse child dont you go messing round down there cant no good come of that you think something bad will come of it pearlie folds her newspaper and lays it beside her chair you go poking a stick in a hole you best be ready for a snake to crawl out of it im about to ask her whats shes afraid of when my cell phone beeps the screen shows a text message waiting i flip open the phone and hit a button the message reads im going to call you in a second dont even think about not answering its about malik sean somebody trying to call you pearlie asks i hate them phones someones about to the phone rings on cue tell me i answer the shits hit the fan says sean a little after eleven we got an anonymous call telling us to check an apartment in kenner the caller said malik rented it under an alias we got a warrant and went there with some jefferson parish detectives the landlord idd malik from a photo and we went in what did you find a lot of video equipment for one thing pro quality stuff and a computer rigged for digital film production video equipment what else we found the murder weapon cat my throat tightens what thirtytwocaliber charter arms revolver the handgun that killed our five victims it had the serial number filed off were going to try to bring it out with acid but we dont know anything yet did you arrest malik for murder yeah got him at his home he resist no went like a lamb and no hollywood walk this time we booked him and took him to the clu through the garage jesus who do you think the tipper was we dont know maybe one of maliks patients a girl he took to that apartment or a guy i suggest the caller was female anyway malik was already so high profile because of the contempt story that we had to go ahead with his arraignment the da argued for no bail but the judge set one anyway a million bucks can he pay that probably hes got a house across the lake he could put up as surety he was in central lockup but they just moved him to the parish prison the anonymous tip about the location of the murder weapon bothers me it was too easy sean do you really think malik is the killer im a lot more convinced than i was yesterday i just found out that ten days after malik got back from vietnam his father was badly beaten spent two months in the hospital and he never looked the same again did maliks father id his assailant said he didnt see anything it happened in his home but nothing was stolen did malik have an alibi nobody even asked him for one this was columbus mississippi not berkeley california malik was a hero just home from the war what did he have to be pissed about as i consider this billy neal walks into my field of vision just below pearlies porch dr kirkland wants to see you he says though im obviously using the phone he told me to bring you to the study tell him ill see him later i have somewhere to go first what says sean a strange smile distorts billy neals mouth the island you mean sean let me call you back i put the phone in my pocket and address the driver have you been eavesdropping here neal ignores the question hes waiting for you now he doesnt like to wait i turn to pearlie whats going on what is it about the island that nobody wants me to know pearlie gets up from her rocker and gives me a hug its not my place baby go talk to your granddaddy if you still want to go down to the island after that maybe ill go with you she steps to the porch rail and gives billy neal a withering glare get out of my sight trash the driver laughs a brittle sound that makes me think of a boy i once saw torturing a cat in a sandbox pearlie turns and goes into her house without another word your grandfathers waiting neal says again tell him ill be there in a minute he said i should bring you listen asshole you keep standing there youll be waiting all day billy neal gives me his crooked smile i wouldnt mind that you aint half bad to look at the door behind me bangs open and pearlie walks out carrying a rifle her eyes are squinted nearly shut and her jaw is set tight get away from here trash she says in a menacing voice thats a pellet gun says neal his smile broadening an air rifle thats right pearlie raises the rifle until its pointed at his midsection i use it to kill the possums that tear up the garbage but if i shoot you in the balls with it they gonna swell up like a watermelon and you aint gonna be bothering no womens for a long time to emphasize her point pearlie puts her eye to the sight and aims the barrel at neals genitals the smile vanishes from the drivers face your days coming nigger if i tell dr kirkland you bothering his grandbaby your days come and gone cracker get out of here billy neal laughs again then walks slowly back toward malmaison why did you do that i ask i can take care of myself hes a bad apple i dont know why dr kirkland keeps him around here hes a bodyguard you said the other day pearlie spits over the rail that boy got a law degree too from somewhere you believe that this revelation makes me think of sean and his nightschool law degree he told me tales of con men and criminals taking the same courses and earning the same degree he did i believe it i think he got something over dr kirkland pearlie says softly what do you mean something on him she nods once firmly what could he have on grandpapa pearlie shakes her head her eyes still on the retreating figure his mama used to work for your granddaddy secretary or bookkeeper something she knew things what could she know about something illegal pearlie turns to me her eyes hard i dont know dr kirklands careful with the family business but its got to be something your granddaddy wouldnt let that trash tie his shoes otherwise her comment reminds me that my grandfathera man who places such value on integrity that he closes milliondollar deals with a handshakehas destroyed the careers of several men who crossed him or who lied to him in business deals i wouldnt want to try to blackmail grandpapa lord knows thats right be like climbing into a bear pit with the bear in it you stay away from that driver pearlie she reaches out and squeezes my wrist you too baby things have changed around here have they i shake my head i dont think so i think things were always this way i was just too young to see it chapter grandpapa is waiting for me in his study hes sitting in the same leather executive chair he sat in two days ago when he told me the same old lie about my fathers death what does he want to tell me now he doesnt speak when i enter he sits erect in his chair his left hand cradling a glass of scotch his blue eyes looking strangely wet hes still wearing his suit and tie and his tanned skin and silver hair give him the appearance of a veteran hollywood actor awaiting a scenenot a character actor but an aging leading man your driver said you want to talk to me thats right he says his voice a commanding blend of baritone and bass i need to ask you a question catherine please sit down something makes me want to take the initiative away from him why do you keep that lowlife around grandpapa appears taken off guard who billy yes he doesnt belong here and you know it grandpapa looks at the floor and purses his lips as though reluctant to discuss this with me then he speaks in a tone of regret the casino business isnt like our other family businesses catherine las vegas wears a corporate image nowadays but the old unsavory practices are still around the big nevada boys dont like competition and they have quite a stake in mississippi i need someone who knows that world inside and out billy worked in las vegas for twelve years and he spent three working for an indian casino in new mexico the exact nature of his experience is something into which i dont delve too deeply im not proud of that but sometimes to accomplish something good you have to rub elbows with the devil thats the nature of the gambling business it surprises me to hear you talk that way he shrugs in the chair this town is desperate we cant afford our high ideals any longer please take a seat dear i sit in a club chair and face him across a bokhara rug still off the alcohol he asks motioning toward the sideboard so far so good i wish i had your willpower must be the diving that gives you the discipline you said you needed to ask me a question yes this morning you mentioned hiring a professional forensic team to search your old bedroom for blood and other evidence you said i nod but say nothing have you shelved that plan given what i told you this morning about lukes death no grandpapa doesnt react at first then he raises his glass and takes a long drink of scotch closing his eyes as he swallows after a few moments he opens them again and sets the glass on a table beside his chair i cant let you do that he says what do you mean i ask silently but aloud i say why not because i killed your father catherine i shot luke the words dont really register at first i mean i hear them i recognize the order in which they were spoken but their actual significance doesnt really sink in i know this is a shock to you grandpapa goes on i wish there were some other way to deal with this that youd never have to know but you found that blood and now theres no other way to put an end to this i know you youre just like me you wont stop until you know the truth so im going to give it to you i thought you gave it to me this morning he shifts in his chair i lied to you before darling we both know that and youre probably wondering why you should believe me now all i can tell you is this when you hear what im about to tell you youll know its true youll know it in your bones and i wish to god it was a different truth what are you talking about what is this grandpapa rubs his tanned face with his right hand squeezing his jaw catherine someday you will get old and youll hear from some doctor that youre going to die but what youre about to hear will be worse than that part of you is going to die today i want you to brace yourself my extremities are going cold i felt a little like this when i saw my home pregnancy test turn pink a temporary paralysis set in while my mind tried to adapt to the total transformation of my life i feel that paralysis now but with it comes a terrible foreboding a fear that my whole world is about to be sucked inside out by something thats been kept from me my whole life and the funny thing is im not surprised at all its like ive known this moment was coming since i was a little girl that one day i would find myself in this room or a room like it while someone gave me the terrible secret of why i am the way i am there was no prowler here on the night luke died grandpapa says you already suspect that thats why you asked me if luke committed suicide did he asks a faint voice that comes from my throat no i told you i killed him but why did you argue with him was it an accident no grandpapa squares his shoulders and looks me in the eye two days ago you asked me why i didnt like luke i didnt tell you the complete truth yes his reaction to his war service bothered me and the fact that he couldnt provide for you and your mother didnt help matters but from the very beginning i had a bad feeling about that boy something wasnt right about him your mother didnt see it because she was in love but i saw it i couldnt put my finger on exactly what it was i just sensed something as a man that made me recoil i cant stand this please just tell me whatever it is do you remember that when luke was having his bad periodshis spells pearlie called themyou were the only person hed let near him the only one hed let into the barn while he worked of course he spent a lot of time with you catherine you were his connection to the real world you two had a very unusual relationship and as time went on i started to feel that it wasnt an appropriate relationship the numbness is spreading to my heart how do you mean that night luke died i wasnt reading downstairs i had turned off all the lights downstairs and pretended to go up to bed but i didnt id done this several nights in a row luke was supposedly leaving for the island that night instead of watching from the window i went out into the yard with a flashlight and sat on the grass another swig of scotch after about an hour i saw luke coming up the hill from the barn he wasnt walking like himself in the dark i actually thought he was a different person i thought he was a prowler but it was luke he went through the door of your house without making a sound i circled the house and went to your window i saw a crack of light as he opened your door i thought he might be checking on youbut he wasnt the door opened and closed quickly and i knew hed gone into your room and stayed there im dreaming if i can wake myself up i wont have to hear this but i cant wake up i keep sitting motionless and my grandfather keeps talking i slipped inside the house gwens door was open but she was sound asleep then i opened your door and clicked on my flashlight no i whisper dont luke was in the bed with you catherine i hoped it was some kind of psychological dependency something like that that he needed to get into bed with you to be able to sleep but it wasnt that when i yanked back the covers dont he wasnt wearing pants catherine and your gown was pushed up to your chest im shaking my head like a child trying to reverse time to bring back a dog that was run over by a car or a parent who was just lowered into the earth but it does no good grandpapa stands and looks at the french windows his voice rising with emotion he was molesting you catherine before i could say anything he jumped up and started trying to explain himself that it wasnt what it looked like but there was no denying the state he was in i grabbed his arm and yanked him toward the door he went crazy he started hitting me grandpapa turns to me his eyes bright luke was so passive most of the time it took me completely by surprise but he could be savage when he wanted to be he wouldnt have survived the war without that capacity for violence grandpapa stops three feet away from me looking down from what seems an enormous height i wanted to get you out of there but hed hit me several times and showed no sign of stopping i remembered the rifle that hung over the fireplace in the den i ran out and grabbed it chambered a round and went back in to get you luke was in the corner by the closet down on his knees your bed was empty i knew you must be terrified and i figured youd tried to escape through that closet back then it didnt have a back wall it was like the old country places where adjoining bedroom closets are actually the same space anyway i told luke to get away from you and stand up when he didnt i walked over with the rifle and told him to get the hell off my property and never come back grandpapa shakes his head his eyes cloudy with memory maybe it was the sight of the gun that did it or maybe he couldnt deal with the idea that he was going to be exposed but he attacked me again he came up out of that corner like a wild animal i pulled the trigger out of pure reflex grandpapas hand actually jerks when he says this you know the rest the round hit luke in the chest and he died quickly the silence in the study is absolute then out of the vacuum that is me at this moment a question rises did i see it happen i dont know baby when i got to the closet you werent there you must have crawled through to your mothers bedroom i suspect you tried to wake her up but couldnt do it do you remember any of this maybe that i whisper trying to wake mom up but maybe it wasnt that night i dont know i think that happened a lot back then but you remember nothing of the abuse i shake my head with robotic precision i thought not but youve never recovered from it just the same its haunted you your whole life ive watched you all these years wishing i could do something for you but i couldnt see what i didnt see how telling you this about your father could help you they say the truth shall set you free but im not so sure if you hadnt found that blood in your room i doubt id ever have told this thing he goes to the sideboard pours a nearly full glass of vodka and holds it out to me the vodka might as well be water im so anesthetized by shock that even my craving for alcohol is gone take it he says do you good no it wont i say silently itll hurt me itll poison my baby what are you thinking catherine i dont speak im not sharing my only pure secret with anyone im not sure what to do now he says youve had problems with depression in the past and i was damn little help to you i was from the old school if i couldnt palpate it irradiate it amputate it or resect it it wasnt a problem i know different now i worry that telling you this could trigger a major depressive episode are you still taking ssris for that i dont reply my silence must remind him of the wordless year that followed my fathers death because it spooks him catherine he says in an anxious voice can you speak i dont know am i speaking now surely you have some questions you always do but im not me anymore well after youve had time to absorb this i think youll see why i dont want you bringing outsiders here to search that room for more blood no possible good can come from anybody learning what i just told you none at all but great harm could result who else knows i whisper no one not pearlie a solemn shake of the head she might suspect but she doesnt know mother no one catherine did you really examine me that night after the police left he nods sadly what did you find a deep sigh vaginal and anal irritation old scarring your hymen wasnt intact thats not conclusive in itself but i knew what id seen if id waited ten minutes to go into that room id have found more evidence and if a forensic team had tested your bedsheets back then please stop all right darling just tell me what i can do nothing im not sure thats true now that you know the truth about your past it might be helpful to speak to someone i can get you access to the top people in the country i have to go where anywhere why dont you stay here for a while ill have pearlie fix a room upstairs you dont ever have to go back into that slave quarters again youd have never lived there in the first place if it had been up to me it was luke who refused to move in here i offered him a whole damn wing i guess now you know why anyway you take a few days and start trying to get your mind around this it could take a long while to really deal with it i cant believe this is my grandfather talking his philosophy was always unequivocal when life throws you a curveball you knock that son of a bitch right down the pitchers throat i actually heard him say that many times yet here he stands talking like hes been watching dr phil with my mother i have to go now grandpapa i turn and walk quickly to the french doors that lead out onto the lawn his footsteps follow me then stop in a moment im standing in bright sunlight on an endless plain of freshly mown grass and there the tears come great racking sobs that make my ribs hurt i fall to my knees and bend over the grass the way i would if i were puking drunk but im not drunk i am desolate what i want most is out of my skin i want to take a knife slash myself from my pubic bone to my neck and crawl out of this disgusting body catherine calls a frantic female voice whats the matter did you hurt yourself its my mother shes kneeling in the flower beds near the front entrance of malmaison the mere sight of her throws me into panic when she gets to her feet i stand and race for the far corner of the house rounding the corner of malmaison i sprint along the back wall of our slave quarters my bedroom window flashes at my left shoulder and i shudder at the sight of it theres my car my connection to new orleans my escape moms cries fade as i slide behind the wheel and slam the door the revving motor is the first thing that slows the spinning panic in my chest throwing the audi into gear i roar out of the parking lot spraying gravel against the wall of the slave quarters never have i wanted to leave a place so badly as i do malmaison at this moment of course there is only one way to truly leave this place behind die chapter desalle island rises out of the mississippi river like the back of a sleeping dog the long low line of trees stretches four miles north to south three miles east to west its so big you wouldnt know it was an island without crossing it the setting of my childhood summers the island is as much a part of me as natchez and new orleans yet it stands utterly apart from them apart from everything really nominally part of louisiana it is in truth subject to no authority other than that of my family it was created when the mississippi river having wound back upon itself like a writhing snake finally cut off its own tortuous bend with a great rush of floodwater that shortened its course by more than five miles left in the wake of that cataclysm was a great island covered with timber rich topsoil wild game and the shacks of a dozen black families that worked for my ancestors for yearsfirst as slaves then as sharecroppers and finally as wage earners floods eventually smothered the topsoil with sand and killed the oaks and pines but the blacks worked on raising cattle instead of cotton managing a deer camp and doing whatever else kept food in their childrens bellies the only whites who come here are members of my family or business associates of my grandfathers invited here to hunt im parked where the narrowest part of the old river channel flows through a treacherous plain of mud here a dirt causeway stretches across the old channel to the island every spring its washed away by overflow from the river but every summer its rebuilt the cost being split between my grandfather and an oil company that operates several wells on the island the river is high for this time of year and the backwater laps against the edges of the causeway with maybe an inch to spare ive been parked at the end of the causeway for twenty minutes trying to decide whether its safe to cross a line of thunderclouds has been blowing up from the south for the past hour if they cut loose with enough rain the causeway could disappear under the rising water its happened before i drove the seventy miles here in a state of near hypnosis my only goal to reach this place where my father spent so much time to somehow solve the tragic mysteries of his life and mine i was conscious enough to call sean twice but he didnt answer that means hes with his wife if he were in a task force meeting or even at a fresh murder scene he would have at least textmessaged me back sothe father of my baby is almost certainly trying to save his marriage after failing to reach sean i felt an irresistible compulsion to speak to nathan malik i called his cell phone but it kicked me over to his voice mail i wanted to leave a message but i didnt if the psychiatrist is still in jail his cell phone is probably sitting on the desk of some fbi agent it might even be in john kaisers pocket whoever has it has probably already put the bureaus technical machinery in motion trying to trace the number of the person who called their main suspect when i couldnt reach malik i started paging through my digital phone book thats one thing you do when youre depressed one thing i do anyway go through my phone book calling friend after friend praying for a sympathetic voice i call people i havent seen in months and even years but todayi didnt do that as the rolling hills of southwest mississippi swept me into the boot of louisiana i called directory assistance and got the number of michael wellss medical office it took some convincing but his receptionist finally put me through i told michael id really like to talk to him if he had some time im up to my ass in alligators right now he said laughing sick twoyearolds actually but it amounts to the same thing id love to see you later though would you let me buy you dinner we actually have a thai restaurant in natchez now i was silent for a momentor maybe longerbecause michael said cat is something wrong ummyeah thats what i wanted to talk to you about but we can do it some other time tell me whats wrong do you believe in repressed memories related to what that usually has to do with child abuse yeah like that he was silent for a bit is this a hypothetical question i wasnt sure how to answer sort of forget about dinner come to my office right now im on jeff davis boulevard you remember where that is sure but its okay forget i called im not even in town right now where are you new orleans no lookif i get back in time ill call you later okay cat i hung up and put my ringer on silent why was i trying to involve a pediatrician who knew nothing about me and my problems because wed known each other in school because he had a sympathetic face because he treated children and right at that moment i felt about four years old across the old river channel a green johnboat is plying the shore in the shadow of some cypress trees squinting i can make out the silhouette of a shirtless black teenager he paddles a few feet bends down works at something then straightens up and paddles on when he hauls a fat gray fish into the air i realize what hes doing checking a trotline the static line has dozens of hooks hanging from it one every few feet baited with something stinky to attract the catfish that abound in this old channel its been ten years since i visited the island but life doesnt seem to have changed much as the boy works his way along the line i pick up my cell phone and speeddial dr hannah goldman hannah is my court of last resort i dont call her often but when i do she answers immediately or gets back to me within an hour you dont find commitment like that in too many therapists cat she says apparently looking at a caller id screen mmhm i say in a tiny voice where are you we have a bad connection her statement is punctuated by a burst of static out of town it doesnt matter whats going on i just found out something do you want to tell me about it i dont know well you called me i think you want to tell me about it okay twenty words or less my grandfather killed my father not much throws dr goldman but this does after several seconds she says please tell me some details i thought your father was shot by an intruder i thought so too but my grandfather just told me a different story its complicated i found some blood in my old bedroom a latent bloodstain i wasnt even looking for it but it got me thinking about that night i started asking questions i was going to bring in an outside forensic team so he decided to tell me the truth he being dr kirkland yes was the shooting an accident no he caught my father abusing me sexually abusing me and he killed him i see dr goldman says in her most professional voice she says that to keep from saying dear god or something similar hannah tries to be detached but shes not thats why she lets me call her this way hannah goldman is the middle ground between professional detachment and the activist commitment of nathan malik do you believe what your grandfather told you hes never lied to me before except about this i mean by omission he said he kept the truth from me to protect me and i always felt like something was wrong with the story theyd told me as a child do you have any memory of the events he described no but ive been thinking about repressed memories a lot lately why it has to do with a murder case im working on the murders here in new orleans yes i see do you believe in repressed memories hannah i mean do you believe that a person can totally block something from their conscious mind yes i do its a controversial subject very little is known about the neuromechanics of memory but current evidence indicates that some trauma victims dissociate during their experiences and suffer amnesia for those events the strange thing about your case is that its happening backwards youve been handed corroboration of abuse before you even started to remember it considering the issues weve been dealing with for so long this information could be the greatest gift you ever receive i know its hard to see that now but i think im right uhhuh listen to me cat this is a very dangerous time i want to see you as soon as you can get to my office like i said im not in town now well you need to get here are you drinking i havent had a drink ina long time im pregnant what this time hannah cant mask her shock i know i should have called you but im doing okay listen to me i think we should consider a hospital detox program then an inpatient abuserecovery program somewhere you cant do this alone after what youve been told today theres simply no telling what might happen flashbacks body memories suicidal impulses please tell me where you are im all right really i just wanted to ask you something what if my daddy was really doing that to mehow could my mother not know dr goldman takes her time before answering there are two or three scenarios in these situations that usually explain the mothers behavior at some level she is aware of the abuse but whether shes in denial or a silent coconspirator i cant tell you without more information in any case the mothers primary goal is to keep her family together at all costs stillgwen might have had no idea that this went on did you suspect it did you ever think i might have been sexually abused its crossed my mind once or twice but these days we dont bring up that idea unless the patient leads us there and you never did i thought the murder of your father was sufficient trauma to cause the problems weve seen but now that this has surfaced theres a lot of work we can do that we need to do i know some very good people in this area cat do you know nathan malik why do you ask that hannahs tone is suddenly guarded do you know him i met him have you seen him as a patient no do you think hes good at what he does hes published some interesting articles and hes had some surprising successes with recovered memories but he uses radical techniques theyre unproven and maybe even dangerous i wouldnt want you under the care of someone like that youre too fragile i was just asking cat are you in your car i dont think you should be driving dr goldman has received many calls from parking lots and from the shoulders of highways no im just sitting here are you in a safe place i look across at the island ominous and even forbidding beneath the gray clouds yeah where are you in your cycle up or down neither im numb a sharp intake of breath belies the calming words that follow cat my concern is that this new information will trigger a manic episode youre in shock you have no defenses left other than mania by going manic youre brain convinces itself youre invulnerable and if that happens when you finally crash static blots out hannahs voice the main thing to keep in mind is that what happened between you and your father is not your fault you were a child you couldnt possibly make a free choice you the static returns this time like intermittent explosions in my ear thanks for answering i say into the static thanks for always a blaring horn nearly knocks me out of my seat i look in my rearview mirror and see a big white pickup truck parked behind me hannah the connection is gone the truck honks again its waiting to use the causeway the driver behind me may trust the muddy span but i dont i want to back up and get out of his way but i cant seem to move my hands lie on my lap like the hands of a quadriplegic the horn blares again i cant move half a minute passes then a black man who looks like he weighs three hundred pounds climbs out of the truck and walks toward my car hes wearing a tshirt stretched tightly over breasts much bigger than mine and he doesnt look happy at being delayed when he reaches my car he knocks on the window up close the man has a kind face he looks about fifty years old and though it seems unlikely i wonder if fate has put me in the path of jesse billups with great effort i pull the switch that rolls down my window you look like you in the wrong place lady he says in a deep and melodious voice are you jesse billups the big mans mouth breaks into a broad smile hell no jesse my cousin though is he on the island today jesse always on the island i need to talk to him the man leans back and looks at my audi then laughs you got business with jesse thats kind of hard to believe is it well i do wait a second you with them sports illustrated people who shot that bikini spread here back in the spring no im catherine ferry a blank look then a faint spark of recognition in his eyes catherine desalle ferry i clarify the smile vanishes and the man straightens up and starts to tuck in his tshirt sorry i didnt recognize you maam im henry washington what can i do for you you want me to lead you over the bridge and find jesse is it safe to cross washington cocks his round head to one side well thats a stretchy kind of word safe i been over this old thing many a time and it aint caved in yet but one of these days its bound to happen dr kirkland need to put a little more money in this old bridge make life a lot safer for everybody over here i think youre right tell you what why dont you ride over with me when you done talking to jesse hell bring you back here to your car and if he cant i will sounds good to me talking to another personparticularly a strangerhas forced me to reenter the world of time and motion after backing the audi under a pecan tree and locking it i climb up into the cab of henrys truck and perch on the passenger seat this truck is nothing like the pickup in my dream its high off the ground with a fancy sound system thick upholstery and a roomy backseat the truck in my dream is old and rusted with round front fenders that make it look like a toy a stick shift rises from the floor and theres no upholstery at all not even on the roof you related to dr kirkland henry asks putting the truck in gear and easing onto the soft dirt of the causeway hes my grandfather huh how come i aint seen you down here before you probably have its been ten years since i visited though longer than that since i spent any real time here well it aint changed much we got electricity about five years back used to have to use generators when we wanted power i remember what about telephone service henry taps a cell phone on his belt these all we got and they work about half the time thats why we keep twoway radios in the trucks we hit a muddy patch and the tail of the truck slides almost out from under us i clench every muscle but henry just laughs as we straighten up again you think you scared he booms my big ass goes into that water its all over but the crying why i cant swim some people would laugh but i cant it makes me sad as we near the shore of the island a few raindrops splatter on the windshield will the rain cover the bridge i ask probably not says henry but ive seen it happen still rain aint gonna come down hard for another hour yet how do you know he looks at me and taps his nose the smell they ought to put me on channel sixteen im lots better than that weatherman they got you have tv out here now satellite no cable though things have changed indeed the last time i was here desalle island was as primitive as an appalachian hollow two dozen shotgun shacks for the workers my grandfathers clinic some cabins near the lake for visiting hunters and various utility buildings most of the shacks had outdoor plumbing the only buildings with modern conveniences were my grandfathers hunting lodgea plantationstyle house built of cypress that overlooks the lake designed by the noted louisiana architect a hays townand the clinic almost there henry says giving the pickup a little gas as the wall of trees gets nearer i catch sight of a small shed near the water and a chill runs through me like almost every other building on desalle island the shed has a tin roof as the chill subsides my heart suddenly pounds against my sternum parked beside the shed is the roundnosed pickup truck from my dream chapter the moment henry washingtons truck rolls onto the gravel road that follows the eastern shore of the island a strange thrumming starts in my body its as though a mild current of electricity is sparking along my peripheral nerves worsening the hand tremor thats bothered me for the past three days the island looks the same as it always did the perimeter skirted with cypress trees growing out of the shallow water near the shore the interior forested with willow brakes and giant cottonwoods the cypresses are on my right now were driving north i want to ask henry about my grandfathers old truck but a tightness in my chest stops me as it falls farther behind i try to remember the layout of the island from the air desalle island looks like a foreshortened version of south america its nearly bisected at the center by a horseshoe lake that was once a bend in the mississippi river grandpapas hunting lodge stands on the north shore of the lake the shacks of the workers on the south west of the lake lie five hundred acres of rice fields the northern end of the island is pastureland dotted with cattle and oil wells and south of the lake lie the woods were passing now nestled among the trees at the lower edge of the woods are the cabins and utility buildings of the hunting camp and below themthe argentina of our islandlowlying sand dunes and muddy slews tail down to the confluence of the old channel and the mississippi river jesses been on the north end chasing stray cows henry says shaking his head as though such labor requires a certain level of insanity he said something about doing some plumbing work at the hunting camp after that in a few seconds the trees on my left will thin and reveal the lake and the cluster of shacks where the workers live didnt we already pass the road to the camp henry laughs the closest road we did but i dont take this truck into no slews theres a gravel road goes into the camp from the north now i see the lake dark green under the clouds with small whitecaps whipped up by the wind henry turns left and follows a road that runs between the lake and the south edge of the woods he waves broadly at a group of shotgun shacks by the lake the sun has started to sink and most of the porches have people on them the old ones rocking slowly the children scampering around in the dust with cats and dogs here we go henry says turning right onto a narrow gravel road through the trees whats jesse like i ask you dont know him no jesses a mystery he used to be the most laidback cat on this island loved to smoke and talk but now hes a hardass i dont know why exactly but he is was it the war henry shrugs his big shoulders who knows jesse dont talk too much he mostly work or watch other people work a minute passes in silence the cabins of the hunting camp appear ahead unlike the shacks of the workers many of which are made of tar paper or clapboard on brick stilts the cabins are built of sturdy cypress weathered gray and hard as steel the roofs are corrugated tin thats rusted to dark orange there jesse says henry i dont see a man but i do see a brown horse tied to the porch rail of one of the cabins henry pulls up in front of the cabin and honks his horn three times nothing happens hell be here henry says sure enough a wiry black man wearing no shirt crawls from beneath the cabin stands and brushes himself off at first he looks like a hundred other black workmen ive seen then he turns and i see the right side of his face blotches of bright pink skin stand out like splatters of paint from his right shoulder to his right temple and his cheek is a mound of deformed scar tissue he got burned over in vietnam henry says it looks bad but we used to it now henry leans out his window and shouts yo jesse got a lady in here wants to talk to you jesse walks over to the truckmy side not henrysand looks me in the eye henry uses his switch to roll down my window which leaves only six inches of space between my face and jesse billupss scars what you want with me he says in an insolent voice i want to talk to you about my father whos your father luke ferry jesses eyes widen and then he snorts like a horse goddamn all this time and now you come back i met you when you was a little girl i knew your mama pretty well howd you get down here henry says her cars parked on the other side of the bridge i told her youd take her back to it when shes ready you got her okay jesse studies me for a bit yeah ill take her back he opens my door and helps me down from the high cab jesse must have a half inch of calluses on his hand as henry drives away with a blast of his horn jesse leads me to the next cabin down from the one where his horse is tied hardass dont like strangers he explains you named your horse hardass people call me hardass all the time behind my back so i figured id let em know i know it he climbs onto the porch and sits against the wall of the cabin i sit on the top step and brace my back against the rail theres no doubt that jesse billups works hard for a living he has to be fifty to have served in vietnam but his stomach is still as tight as a teenagers his arms dont bulge but the long muscles in them ripple with every movement his face is another matter its hard to get an impression of his looks i cant really see past the scars yet diesel fuel he says in a ragged voice what this face i got i was cleaning toilets at a firebase when mr charlie dropped a few mortar rounds on us for christmas we used to burn our shit with diesel fuel i was standing next to five burning drums when the round went off covered me with shit and burning diesel would have been funny except for the infection i got from it im sorry he gives me a cynical wink then takes a pack of kool menthols from his back pocket lighting one with a silver lighter he inhales deeply then blows blue smoke away from the porch he seems to be settling in for a long talk after another deep drag on his cigarette he turns his dark eyes on me you here to ask about your daddy i heard you knew him pretty well this seems to amuse jesse i dont know about all that but me and lukie hung together some yeah a long time ago i was hoping you could tell something about what happened to him in the war you know anything already somebody told me he was a sniper i didnt know that they also said he was part of a unit that was accused of war crimes do you know anything about that jesse snorts in derision war crimes shit that the craziest expression i ever heard war is a motherfucking crime start to finish its only people who dont know that be talkin bout shit like war crimes im not sure how to continue well there must have been some unusual events at least for the army to talk about prosecuting his unit unusual jesse barks a humorless laugh yeah thats a good word can you tell me anything luke told me a little about that he was a country boy see thats what got him in trouble he knew how to shoot im a good shot but that boy was something with a rifle like he was born holding one wouldnt kill nothing after the war though not even deer for food anyway the army made him a sniper and he did that job for a couple months then they took him into this special unit called the white tigers supposed to be a allvolunteer thing but i think the co pretty much volunteered anybody he wanted into it thats how old lukie got stuck the white tigers what was the purpose of the unit they was put together for one reason what they call incursion into enemy territory only this incursion wasnt exactly legal the tigers went into cambodia to try to hit the cong where they hid from our bombers do you know what happened there same shit that happened a lot of other places only worse the tigers went from village to village looking for weapons vc or vc sympathizers thing was they didnt operate like we did over in i corps in cambodia they didnt wait around to get shot at they went in there to scare the shit out the people keep em from helping mr charlie to deny the enemy sanctuary and interdict lines of supply macv would have said doubletalking motherfuckers anyway they had some bad boys in this tiger outfit hard cases from other platoons so naturally they did some bad shit what exactly falls into that category jesse stubs out his cigarette and immediately lights another assassinated tribal chiefs and vc paymasters punished anybody known or suspected of helping the vc or the khmer rouge questioned people vigorously he laughs bitterly that means torture my father did some of this he nods deliberately that was the job you know that shit happened down where i was too especially shooting prisoners so you wouldnt have to drag them around with you but if the wrong officer saw you you could get in bad trouble lukes outfit was different in the tigers it was the officers instigating the shit cutting off heads and leaving them on sticks to scare the khmer rouge taking girls from the villages and using them for recreation getting wait a second i cut in you mean they kidnapped girls and raped them jesse nods like its no big deal sure thats how the co rewarded his men when his boys did good they could pick a girl from a village and keep her for a couple days what happened to the girl when they were done with her jesse raises his hand and makes a quick slicing motion across his throat the deadness in his eyes makes me shiver i told you they done some bad shit how did my dad feel about that jesse shrugs he blamed the government shit thats who put him in the middle of it he didnt ask for that and what could he do about it way out in the bushthe whole operation off the booksco had the only radio so luke did what he had to do and got the hell out what about the war crimes investigation who started that some rat in their unit probably somebody looking to get his name in the papers this doesnt sound right to me reporting that kind of thing seems like a good way to get dead it must have been someone with a conscience who first went public jesse shakes his head all i know is when the government questioned luke he didnt tell em shit the government dropped the investigation end of story jesse takes a drag from his cigarette inhaling so deeply that he seems to draw sustenance from the smoke as i watch him it strikes me that his lean frame is not the result of good health its almost as if the fat that a normal human would accumulate is being consumed by a deepbanked anger well do you think what you come down here for jesse growls with sudden intensity you didnt come here to talk about no vietnam yes i did he barks another laugh maybe you think you did but theres something else behind these questions i look away hoping to hide the guilt i feel over what my grandfather told me today because thats what i feel i realize guilt thats why im asking these questions if my father really did those things to me something must have pushed him to it and if it wasnt the war then what else could it have been but me ive always craved attention and ive always been very sexual hey says jesse you look like you about to cry on me i tilt back my head and blink away tears youre right i dont know what i came here for exactly i was hoping forsomething i dont know what you looking for some kind of explanation for the way luke was hoping id tell you he was a saint or something behind that closedup face of his he was just a dude like me we all got good and bad deep down inside he points a longnailed finger at me but i aint telling you nothing you dont already know i can look in your eyes and see that you luke ferrys kid i know you got both inside of you now the tears come too many to blink away why did my daddy spend so much time down here jesse what was it that drew him jesse scowls and looks off into the trees was he growing dope down here he tried but he wasnt no good at it did he ever deal drugs i mean the scarred head turns slowly left and right shit i had to get lukes weed for him what am i missing then how much time did he actually spend down here a lot specially in the winter summertime your family was down here a lot in deer season dr kirkland and his buddies would visit but all the other times luke stayed down here what the hell did he do if he didnt hunt or fish jesse looks back at me but the anger i sensed before seems to have leaked out of his pores he walked around a lot drew things in a notebook played a little music had him a guitar down here i taught him some bottleneck stuff i faintly remember a guitar in my fathers barn studio but i dont remember him playing it was he any good he was all right for a white boy he could bend a note had some blues in him well did he the ring of a cell phone stops me but its not mine jesse takes a nokia from his pocket and answers he listens for a bit then says hell get right on it and hangs up i got to go he says right now yep gotta get some supplies from the mainland in case the water covers the bridge sposed to rain a couple of days straight all along the river we better get moving but i have some more questions we can talk on the way he walks over to his horse unties him and leads him over to where im standing hardass flicks his tail at a buzzing horsefly im gonna get on then pull you up behind me you just stay clear of his hindquarters i will jesse puts a foot into the stirrup and expertly mounts the horse then he takes his foot out of the stirrup so i can get a foothold when i do he takes my left arm and pulls me effortlessly up behind his saddle you can talk but hang on while you do he puts the horse into a canter on the grassy shoulder of the gravel road his broad shoulders are wet with sweat and pink scar tissue dots the back of his neck you work for my grandfather right i ask thats right what do you think about him hes a tough old man do you like him dr kirkland pays my wages like got nothing to do with it i have a feeling the relationship between jesse billups and my grandfather isnt simple at all what are you not telling me jesse i can almost feel him smile dr kirkland beat me once when i was a boy beat me bad but id have done the same thing in his place so were square enough on that i guess i want to ask more about this but before i can i see a woman riding toward us on a bicycle the gravel road makes her work difficult she looks as if she might skid and fall at any moment mother fucker mutters jesse whos that dont pay her no mind she halfcrazy the woman slows as she nears us but jesse spurs his horse as though he means to pass her without a word wait cries the woman stop i tell jesse he doesnt goddamn you jesse billups shouts the woman dont you run from me i reach around jesse and grab for the reins stop this horse he curses then stops the horse on a dime you gonna wish we hadnt as agitated as the woman below me looks i expect her to start shouting accusations of battery or paternity at jesse billups but now that the horse has stopped she acts as if jesse doesnt exist she has eyes only for me are you catherine ferry she asks thats right im louise butler i want to talk to you what about your daddy did you know him i surely did swinging my left leg over the horses flanks i drop to the gravel beside louise butler shes about forty and very pretty with the same milkchocolate skin pearlie has shes watching me with what looks like suspicion in her large eyes if you stay here and jaw says jesse you gonna have to get back to your car on your own i gots to go i know where my car is i can get back to it jesse kicks his horse and leaves us in a small cloud of dust i look at louise and wait expecting some explanation of her sudden appearance but she only stares at the sky gonna rain soon she comments i got a place by the lake wed better start back that way without waiting for an answer she turns her bike around and starts pushing it down the road i watch her for a few seconds noting her onepiece shift and keds sneakers then i trot forward and fall in beside her my feet scrunching the gravel as i walk how did you know i was here i ask henry told me she says not looking over at me so you knew my father now she turns to me you might not like what im gonna say miss catherine please call me cat she laughs softly kitty cat a chill goes through me my father called me kitty cat when i was very small he was the only one who did you did know him please tell me anything you can i dont want to make you feel bad honey you cant make me feel any worse than i already do today dont be so sure did jesse tell you anything bad about luke not really he might have but you came along louise wrinkles her nose you cant trust jesse not about luke i thought they were friends they was for a while what happened me you she looks at me out of the corner of her eye darling luke was my man for seven years from right up to the night he died and a lot of people didnt like that i stop in my tracks this woman cant be more than ten years older than i and shes telling me she was my fathers lover louise walks on then realizes im no longer beside her she stops and turns back i dont want to hurt your feelings i just wanted to talk to you about him see if i could see him in you can you she smiles sadly hes looking out of your eyes at me right now every line of your face got a shadow of him in it louise what before i can finish my sentence the clouds open up fat raindrops slap the creamcolored dust on the shoulder of the road making dark circles of mud the circles multiply too fast to follow and then louise and i are running down the road like little girls she pushing her bike at first then jumping onto it and riding beside me youre in good shape she cries as the shacks of the little village come into sight my house aint far but its past this bunch here we race past the gray shacks their porches empty now and turn down a muddy path that parallels the lake there it is louise shouts i hold my hand over my eyes to shield them from the rain in the distance i see a shack thats not gray like the others but bright blue like a shack in the caribbean now that i know where im going i sprint ahead of the bike my feet have better purchase in the mud than her bicycle and i beat louise to her porch watching her ride the last few yards i realize that im about to hear things about my father that he never meant for me to know does this beautiful stranger know things that might explain what grandpapa told me today or at least confirm it go on in she says lifting her bike onto the narrow porch of the little house im right behind you i walk through the flimsy front door into a room that serves as a combination kitchen den and dining area the moment i enter two things strike me with startling intensity first is the sound of the rain hitting the tin roof above me its my recurring dream made real and the rattling almost takes my breath away the second is the certainty that my father once lived here on the mantel over a gas space heater is a sculpture of a woman though its of african rather than asian derivationa blank oval face over a long neck and a trunk with graceful limbsone glance tells me its my fathers work the woman is lying on her side with one knee raised and one hand on her hip the way a woman might lie in bed watching her lover across the room this sculpture is easily worth more than louises whole house the dining table too is my fathers work brushed steel with inset glass plates and flecks of mica fused to the steel theres no bed in this room but id bet anything that he built that too luke wanted me to have my own place louise says from behind me suddenly im wavering on my feet the heat in the house is stifling as though the place has been shut up for days and the rattle of the rain seems to grow louder by the second but thats only part of it today my fathers life has turned from a patchwork of happy memories to a house of mirrors what is it cries louise i dont know she rushes to an air conditioner mounted in a window and flips a switch the rumbling roar of the old window unit does much to drown the sound of the rain but its too little too late youre going to faint as my knees go out from under me louise catches me under the arms and steers my falling body toward a sofa chapter drink this says louise holding a glass of iced tea under my chin the heat got you thats all this place been shut up a couple of days and it gets like an oven without the ac going its not the heat i tell her taking the glass and drinking a sip of syrupy sweet tea was it seeing lukes things i should have known that would upset you thats not why i passed out she studies me with her deep brown eyes you look scared more than anything i nod slowly its the rain the rain the sound of it rain hitting a tin roof louise looks confused you dont like that its not a matter of liking it or not i just cant take it really i love that sound it makes me lonely but i still love it i used to lie in bed with luke on rainy afternoons and listen for hours its like music i try to smile but my lips wont do it im sorry youre upset and im just thinking back on good times did something bad happen to you in the rain i wish i knew lately ive been hearing that sound in my dreams and even while im awake sometimes thats the way of it louise says walking to the sink i got a lot of things inside me i dont understand she runs tap water into a carafe i got to make some coffee it can be a hundred degrees outside but i got to have my coffee addicted i guess louise what can you tell me about the orange pickup truck by the bridge she switches on the mr coffee then comes and sits in a naugahyde recliner on my left that old rusted wreck by the shed yes that was dr kirklands truck back in the old days i know but did my father ever drive it she closes her eyes yeah luke drove it some when dr kirkland wasnt around dr kirkland used to brag all the time about how long that junker had been running he said it had never quit on him and never would finally did though why i think i saw something when i was in that truck i have this dream where im riding in it with grandpapa were on the north end of the island riding up a hill in the cow pasture toward the pond louise nods i know where that is in the dream we never get over the hill we get closer and closer but we never get over it lately the closer we get the more afraid i get how long you been having this dream a couple of weeks maybe longer do you know of anything that happened up there something bad i might have seen she leans back in her chair and looks at the porch window the storm clouds have brought a premature darkness and the wind rattles the glass in its frame gonna get worse before it gets better she predicts lots of bad things happened on this old island over the years but the pondyou think you saw somebody get beaten killed maybe something like that i dont know a different thought strikes me did you and daddy ever do anything at the pond sexually i mean a deep stillness comes over louise we swam there sometimes but not while you were on the island did you ever make love when i was on the island she averts her eyes we tried not to but sometimes we did im sorry if that upsets you but i dont want to lie no i want the truth and i know how it is when you love somebody wellyou could have seen us swimming naked in the pond but i dont think you did sensing discomfort in louise i change the subject did daddy ever talk to you about the war not with words but he let me see the pain in different ways what do you think happened to him over there her large eyes fix on me an earnest passion in them he got poisoned thats what happened not in his bodyin his soul louiseive been told that his unit committed war crimes atrocities do you understand what im saying she nods solemnly they tortured people kidnapped women and raped them do you think daddy could have done anything like that this is as close as i can bear to come to asking louise if she thinks my father could have molested me she stands suddenly and goes to a drawer then takes out a pack of salem cigarettes and lights one with a kitchen match despite the passage of time louise still has a slim figure with taut calves that a lot of women would kill for i can only imagine what she must have looked like as a young woman luke had some problems okay she exhales blue smoke when he and i first got together he couldnt make love you mean physically a strange excitement awakens in my chest he was impotent she tilts her head as if unsure how to reply he was and he wasnt what do you mean he was and he wasnt louise looks at me skeptically i dont see a ring on your finger you ever lived with a man a couple or they lived with me rather you dont have to pull any punches with me louise i know men she chuckles softly you know how when a man wakes up lots of times hes hard down there from having to go to the bathroom i nod my curiosity making me grip the arm of the sofa well luke would be like that in the morning but if i tried to make love with him he couldnt stay that way i see i knew something in the war had done that to him not his wound something in his head it took more than a year to get him where he could be with me where he could trust me i think thats what it was trust but im no doctor i dont know he may have done or seen things over there that made sex something terrible to him wild thoughts are spinning in my head if my father was impotent could he have abused me of course he could have answers a bitter voice there are lots of sex acts besides intercourse im not even sure intercourse is the main form of child abuse i should ask dr goldman or even michael wells a blast of wind makes the windows shudder and the rain drives against the roof like hail i focus on the drone of the air conditioner to block it out what did you say about you coming between jesse and my father louise pours herself a cup of stillbrewing coffee jesse always wanted me watched me from the time i was a little girl always talking to me bringing me presents following me around on his horse but i didnt want him why not i just didnt feel right about it i didnt know what i wanted but it wasnt jesse then i started seeing this white boy wandering around the island he was a man reallylike jessebut he seemed more like a boy always off by himself like me him and jesse talked sometimes but i think all they had in common was the war anyway id figure out ways to get ahead of luke on his walks so hed stumble on me like it was an accident i liked talking to him i hadnt been nowhere but here and to school in west feliciana parish and that was just an old country school for black people didnt learn nothing there id just sit and listen while luke talked which was funny cause people who met him wondered if he could talk at all but he could when he wanted to he talked to me all the time i did the same thing i tell her i used to go into his studio every night to watch him work he didnt talk much to mebecause i was so young probablybut he let me sit with him i was the only one hed let in louise is smiling at me we are sisters under the skin how old were you when all this happened i ask her cheeks darken in embarrassment i was fourteen when i started following luke around but we was just talking like i said we didnt do nothing till i turned sixteen sixteen i can see you were in love with him theres a faraway look in her eyes you want to know if he was in love with me dont you yes he told me he was i know that probably hurts you but ill tell you this he wasnt ever gonna leave you to come to me he hated that place that malmaison hated your grandfather too and my mother louise gives me an intense look he loved your mama now she just didnt understand him but when id talk to him about leavingand dont think i didnt lord i begged him sometimeshed say i cant leave my kitty cat louise cant leave my baby in that house with those people so i cant come to you and he never did this confirmation of my fathers love warms my heart despite what i heard from my grandfather today yet as soon as i feel this emotion something clenches in my chest did he say anything else about my mother she looks hesitant please tell me he said your mama had problems with sex even before he went to the war what kind of problems wellshe just couldnt do much she did the one position man on top and she had to have the lights off to do that couldnt take her clothes off in front of him before they got married he thought it was just shyness but she never loosened up luke said he was patient and i believe him i think shed just been taught that sex was something to be ashamed of i know some women like that and then after he got back from the war luke had his own problems thank you for being so honest louise i got no reason to lie except to spare you pain and you seem like you can handle it youd be surprised at how much and how little i can handle sometimes what did you do after daddy died she sighs deeply i left this damn place for one thing where did you go st francisville i fixed hair over there for a while why did you come back i got in some trouble over there got caught with some weed in my car i didnt even like smoking that stuff but it was better than drinking didnt make me fat and it took away some of the pain of grieving luke taught me that were you arrested bitterness comes into her face oh yeah they was gonna put me in jail but dr kirkland told me that if id come back to the island and get clean hed vouch for me and thats what happened of course i think with a strange feeling of resentment with a single phone call the feudal baron restores order to his universe when did you come back nineteen eightythree you havent left here since then not to stay this islands kind of like a prison i think people get out of angola sometimes and youd think theyd be happy but theyre just lost after all them years behind bars they dont know what to do without em so they do some crime to get put back inside again this islands kind of like that lots of folks leave but sooner or later most of em come back like me do all roads lead back here youve got pretty hair louise says even that reminds me of your daddy did daddy talk to anybody else about the war besides jesse i think he talked to dr cage some over in natchez thats who gave him his medication dr cage is a good man i saw him a couple times he likes to listen to people talk i remember pearlie mentioning dr cage about the only thing i can think of that might help you is his diary my pulse quickens diary it wasnt really a diary it was a drawing pad luke used to carry it around making sketches lots of times he would sit by the river and write in that pad he talked about maybe writing a book one day i think some of that writing was about the war my palms are tingling do you have this sketch pad no i wish i did what did it look like it was just a sketch pad like they used to sell in the dime stores a thick one he drew all kinds of pictures in it he drew me once i do have that picture she goes to a fiberboard cabinet kneels and brings out a photo album opening the large book she brings out a piece of paper and holds it up for me to see its a charcoal sketch of a girl of no more than twenty with stunning bone structure and shy eyes you were beautiful were louise snaps then she laughs with loud good humor lord knows ive changed but i was pretty then and im glad i brought some happiness into his life by being pretty she shakes her head sadly lord i loved that boy you know he was only thirty when he died you ever think about that my father was a year younger than i am now when he died i dont usually i guess i think about him the way i saw him as a little girl she nods knowingly god made a mistake on that day taking luke out of this world taking him and leaving thousands of men who aint worth spit my eyes have focused on one of the cabinet shelves theres a line of books there dispatches by michael herr bernard falls book on dien bien phu graham greene tim obrien koko and the throat by peter straub siddhartha the bell jar four or five books on the my lai massacre it looks like daddy put a lot into this house i say gesturing toward the dining table im really trying to stall while my mind works out just what it wants to know from this woman but louise smiles with pride this old house was falling down back then but it sat apart from the others and i liked that so luke fixed it up for me he said he was fixing it up for himself so dr kirkland wouldnt pay no mind but then i started using it when luke was gone after a while wed stay in here together everybody knew but nobody said nothing since dr kirkland didnt some of these women round here called me a ho but i didnt pay no mind narrowminded and mean most of them my grandfather knew about the affair hed have to have been blind not to and thats one thing dr kirkland aint what do you think about my grandfather louise she takes her time answering dr kirklands a hard man in some ways but soft in others hes tough on dogs and horses hes good at taking care of people though saved a lot of lives out here over the years saved my uncle after a chain saw accident lost his arm at the shoulder and damn near bled to death but dr kirkland pulled him through the doctors got a temper now if he gets mad theres hell to pay lukes the only man i ever saw defy him and get away with it when was this im sure i never saw anything like that in my experience grandpapas word was always law dr kirkland and a cousin of mine was breaking some horses one spring one of those broncs was stubborn and dr kirkland lost his head he tied that horse to a fence and started beating it with a hoe that animal was screaming something terrible dr kirkland was using the handle end at first but the more he beat that horse the madder he got i think he was about to flip that hoe around and start chopping that poor creature to pieces when luke grabbed his arm no i whisper unable to imagine such a scene she nods once with an exaggerated motion dr kirklands a big man you know that and strong as an ox back then but luke knew things he never showed nobody he caught ahold of dr kirklands arm some way that he couldnt move it dr kirkland was yelling he was gonna kill luke when he got loose he tried to beat luke with his other hand but luke did something to that arm he was holding and dr kirkland turned white and dropped down to his knees my god what happened luke kept squeezing until dr kirkland let go of that hoe then luke patted that horse turned and walked off into the woods did my grandfather do anything to get back at luke louise shakes her head i reckon he did he shot that horse five minutes later jesus it dont pay to cross dr kirkland he dont play a strange current of emotion wells up from my soul louise what would you say if i told you grandpapa killed luke that night not a prowler she stares at me for several moments then begins shaking her head like a superstitious native confronted by a ghost dont tell me nothing like that i dont even want to think that if it scares you that much i say softly you must think it could be true she finally stops shaking her head what are you saying cat nothing crazy thoughts i want to tell her what i know but something stops me is it my lack of proof of grandpapas motive or just common decency louise has precious memories of my father what good could it do for me to smudge them with accusations of child molestation may i see your bedroom louise a knowing expression comes into her face you want to see if luke built the bed yes come look she leads me to a door set in the back wall and opens it in the small bedroom beyond stands a bed that looks as if it belongs in a manhattan loft four brushedsteel posts support an ovalshaped canopy frame and within the headboard and footboard are ornate patterns rendered in different metals some of them reminiscent of the mandala on dr maliks office wall its one of the most detailed pieces my father ever did my god i whisper do you know what that bed is worth louise laughs i got an idea i guess this bed is what ive got instead of retirement please dont let anybody steal it and if you ever want to sell it give me a call i may take you up on that one day she leads me back into the front room and we stand in a suddenly awkward silence the economic gulf between us could scarcely be greater than it is how old are you louise fortysix older than i thought but still only fifteen years older than i am what do you do for a living if you dont mind me asking she looks at the floor i got a man here takes care of me i just keep up this house forwell you know why this wasnt what i was hoping to hear is the man jesse billups louise sighs and for a moment i dread her answer not jesse she says henry the man who drove you onto the island he aint pretty like luke but hes got a good heart are you married i aint interested in getting married i dreamed of it for a long time butthe man i wanted to marry got killed that was the end of that dream for me i reach out and take hold of her hand i never met this woman before today yet i feel more intimately bound to her than to people ive known my whole life when i think about what grandpapa told me about my fathers death it makes no sense how could the man this woman loved so profoundly commit unspeakable acts with a child with his own child and yetthe professional in me knows that such things happen sounds like the rains slacked up louise says youre right i should go now while i can do you have a car she shakes her head no and henrys gone to lafayette to see his kids they stay with his exwife what about jesse she opens a kitchen drawer and takes out a cell phone after dialing she listens then says jesse this is louise i still got miss ferry with me at my place she needs to get back to natchez you carry your narrow ass back here and take her to her car call me back and tell me youre on your way she hangs up and looks at me helplessly does anybody else have a car we can borrow i ask lots of people here own cars but they keep them on the mainland by the ferry dock what do they use for transportation here theres five pickups on the island and jesse got the keys to all of them use to be lots of people had keys but dr kirkland started complaining about the gas they were using so jesse keeps all the keys now what do you do in an emergency make do but jessell call back in a minute hes probably just checking that everythings tied down tight for the storm the fishing boat on the south end maybe no he left the island he said he had to get some supplies on the mainland louise looks bewildered thats funny jesse dont leave the island too often and never at the same time henrys gone somebody called his cell phone and he said he had to leave right then he say who it was no that dont sound right she shrugs then goes to the front window and looks out the sky is darker if anything if jesse doesnt call back you can stay the night with me i know its not what youre used to but i can sleep on the sofa you can sleep in the bed your daddy made i stand motionless in the close air of the shack listening to the rain drumming over the drone of the air conditioner my skin is crawling theres no guarantee the bridge will be there tomorrow is there depends on the rain but if its flooded out somebody can take you back to your car by boat i appreciate it but i think id rather get back to my car now if you think i can make it she turns from the window and looks at me oh you can make it if you dont mind getting wet you can use my bike aint much lightning out there and if you cut through the woods the rain wont be as bad cause the trees make a tunnel over the road cut down through the hunting camp thenwhen you hit the road to the boat rampturn back up along the shore till you come to the bridge i can do that sure you can it aint even dark yet really just cloudy and i got a light on the front of my bike ive ridden around this island in the middle of the night when i needed to its safe just watch you dont slide off the gravel into a ditch or something lots of snakes this year on the back side i shiver recalling the hallucinatory snakes i saw in my apartment as the dts began how fast can the water rise could the bridge be covered up already i doubt it if the river wasnt already so high you wouldnt have nothing to worry about but youll be at the bridge in ten minutes if you do have a problem call my cell phone stay where you are and ill come get you how will you come on my two feet she takes my cell phone from me and programs her number into its memory if i need to i can get there in no time and if jesse calls back ill send him after you he can drive you across and bring my bike back both i move to the door then turn back and hug louise she squeezes me tightly you going through some tough times girl you come back and see me sometime i promise that i will though i suspect i wont ever be here again then i walk onto the porch and carry her bicycle down to the path hey louise calls through the rain wait i stand in the rain while she disappears inside for a minute the air out here has a greenish tinge like the look the sky gets before a tornado the wind is blowing hard from the south and the raindrops sting my face i hope shes getting me a raincoat but when she returns shes carrying what looks like a ziploc sandwich bag for your cell phone she says over the wind taking the baggie i slip my phone and car keys inside it crush the bag to get the air out then zip it shut and stuff it into the front pocket of my jeans i start to pedal away but louise grabs my arm her eyes desperate i know you didnt tell me everything she says i know you got something bad on your back all i know is this aint no man all good or all bad and if you find out something bad about luke i dont want to know okay i wipe the rain from my eyes and nod time will heal you louise says wont nothing else do any good at all i feel an eerie certainty that if i dont start for the bridge now i wont make it to my car pushing down hard on the right pedal i struggle toward the road that cuts through the woods toward the hunting camp the wind slaps the rain against my right cheek and ear but soon im passing the shacks by the lake the porches that were full of people an hour ago hold only dogs now im alone again when i turn south on the camp road the wind hits me full in the face pushing against my body like a sail trying to drive me back toward the lake i lean low over the handlebars to cut my resistance and bear down hard on the pedals the shoulder is so muddy in places that i almost take a spill but the farther down the island i ride the sandier the soil gets and soon im making good time despite the weather beneath the black storm clouds the world has gone gray everything ahead looks as flat as a blackandwhite photograph the gray cabins of the hunting camp are almost invisible in the shadows beneath the trees even the grass has lost its color only a slight brightness low in the sky to the west lets me know the sun is there at all there should be a left turn soon if not ill come to the southern tip of the island a rolling mosquitoinfested hell of scrubcovered dunes and muddy slews that i always avoided when possible out of the grayness ahead the old channel of the river appears and relief washes through me a mile up the road that runs along this channel is the bridge that leads to my car im about to turn onto it when two bright beams of light swing across me from behind i look back over my shoulder headlights they look high enough to belong to a truck like the one henry was driving louise told me she would send jesse after me if he called her back i stop the bike at the turn and wait to my right a bluewhite beam much larger than those cast by the headlights illuminates the far shore then sweeps south again for a moment this puzzles me then i realize its the spotlight on a push boat a quarter mile south of where i stand the old channel runs back into the main channel of the mississippi river a pushboat captain driving a string of barges upstream is checking his course the driver of the pickup has spotted me forty yards away he flicks his lights to high beam the rain is blowing almost horizontally through their glare i raise my hand to wave then freeze the truck hasnt slowed at all as the hair on my neck stands up something sean told me before we were lovers sounds in my head that hair standing up on the back of your neck is two hundred million years of evolution telling you to get the hell out of wherever you are the truck engine roars with acceleration in the same moment that i dive into the ditch on the left side of the road i regain my feet as the truck crushes louises bicycle beneath its bumper and bounces after me across the ditch my only hope is the trees but i cant outsprint a truck not even for thirty yards an unholy grinding of gears gives me hope the bike must have been caught in the trucks linkage as the driver tries to manhandle his vehicle off the twisted wreckage beneath it i reach the first giant willow and dart behind it looking back i see headlights bouncing up and down then suddenly the trucks motor dies the headlights remain on though and the interior light flicks on behind them theres a figure inside the caba manbut his face is obscured by distance and rain he leans into the space between the door and the body of the truck im squinting my eyes to try to see his face when a flash blooms in the dark and splinters pierce my left cheek only then does the supersonic crack of the rifle bullet reach me i run chapter panic drives me through the trees without direction a single thought burns through the flood of endorphins in my brain get away from the man in the truck a second gunshot quickly follows the first and one look over my shoulder tells me that the shooter has followed me into the woods now and then he flicks on a flashlight to find his way through the trees from his careful progress i know one thing hes driving me southward down an evernarrowing strip of land its only a matter of time before he corners me on the tip of the island a bare patch of sand with a mile of rushing water at my back i need to find a way to slip around him but on this ground thats almost impossible the island here is like tropical jungle the willow and cottonwood brakes give good cover but theres too much underbrush on the ground to move quietly even in the rain theres only one other chance the boat ramp is on the west side of the island facing the main channel of the river if the shooter were farther behind me i might have time to launch the fishing boat before he reached me but hes not ive got to slow him down but how i have no weapons as i fight my way through the underbrush an image comes into my mind bull nettle bull nettle is a twisting green vine about four feet high that bristles with thousands of hypodermic needles those needles inject a painful toxin into any animal that rubs against it horses will lie down in bull nettle to avoid brushing against more of it in humans it causes painful itching and hives and the effect is immediate the southern tip of desalle island is covered with bull nettle i veer south again tree branches whip my face and peppervine claws at the legs of my jeans here the ground rises and falls in threefoot undulations and i pray not to step on a cottonmouth as i splash through the dark slews ive seen fifty moccasins together roiling the water in the drying pools the rain falls relentlessly and the sound of my pursuer crashing through the brush grows nearer sweat pours from my skin and my heart thumps against my breastbone free diving keeps me in good physical shape but terror steals my breath and alcohol withdrawal probably isnt helping matters as i slow to get my bearings the rifle cracks again driving willow splinters into my left arm i duck down and scramble between two cottonwood trunks then crabcrawl through the dark until my arms begin to itch like fire bull nettle theres a thicket of the stuff all around me i could never have imagined being glad to feel this pain but at this moment im ecstatic thirty yards into the thicket i bear right toward the boat ramp before i cover twenty yards the sound of cursing floats through the trees with a tight smile on my face i rise and sprint for the west side of the island a light beam cuts the air close by but then a scream of male rage echoes through the trees i cant make out his words or even if there were any my heart lifts with hope as i hit a level patch of sand cause for joy until i spy a string stretched across my path at thigh level its an old trotline strung with rusty fishhooks and though i twist my body torturously in an effort to avoid it nothing can stop my headlong flight i swallow a scream as the hooks tear into my flesh the line rips free from whatever held it as i fall but the treble hooks are well and truly buried in my right thigh the rifle booms again its echo rolling over sandy berms like cannon fire my hunter heard my scream and got a new fix on my position i pray he doesnt know about the boat ramp but what are the odds of that im almost certain that its jesse billups behind me who else knew where i was at the top of a dune i catch myself and stop the main channel of the mississippi has opened before me its far shore a mile away cloaked in rain and darkness get down shouts a voice in my head youre silhouetted against the clouds sliding down the dune i race south along the bank skirting cypress knees and driftwood snags theres the boat ramp forty yards along the shore its concrete slab runs right down into the water at a steep angle a glittercoated bass boat sits on a trailer on the sand about five feet above the river the problem is its totally exposed to launch that boat quickly ill have to unsecure it from the trailer lift the hitch end of the trailer and heave both trailer and boat down the ramp into the water if i can manage that the boat should float free while the trailer sinks into the depths ill have to swim freestyle with the fast current to catch the boat and board it but i can do that id rather swim the damned river with one arm than fight this island on foot anymore the boat ramp looks deserted from here but that means nothing if i walk into that open space unprotected a tenyearold could pick me off with a rifle i crouch near the rivers edge my senses primed for the slightest stimulus somethings not right i dont hear my pursuer anymore the wind is louder on the exposed bank but i should hear something the rain raking the water sounds like rain hitting a tin roof only the pitch is higheralmost a hiss the southerly wind blasting upcurrent is building whitecaps three feet high rough going for a bass boat i need a weapon a tree branch not much good against a rifle a rock same problem what do i have with me cell phone if i can get close enough to my attacker to identify him before he shoots me i can give his name to the policeand tell him im doing it killing me at that point would be the act of an idiot or a lunatic counters the voice in my head taking the ziploc out of my pocket i see silver metal but no electric light did the sealed bag somehow short it out i squeeze the phone through the plastic and the light of the screen clicks on my joy is shortlived the screen reads no service shit i need to move to higher ground theres no true high ground on the island but there are better spots than this a blue beam of light sweeps over me nearly stopping my heart its the push boat again driving its barges upriver any hope there i could signal the crew by standing in the spotlight and waving my arms but that would be suicide i could try swimming out to the boat but i would probably be sucked under its barges and into its massive propellers im thinking of sprinting north along the shore away from the boat ramp when a flashlight beam shines out of the woods behind me and moves steadily along the bank in seconds it will pick out my hunched body on the sand without even thinking i shove the baggie into my front pocket crawl to the rivers edge and slip into the current like a rat leaving a sinking ship the water is cool but not cold thank god and it soothes the hives caused by the bull nettle the waves are another matter when i swam this river at sixteen its surface was like glass now it batters me like breaking surf and the rain lashes my face as i try to keep my head above the waves the flashlight sweeps over the spot i just left and lingers but im no longer there the current has me now im moving along the shore at the speed of a jogging man and a force like the hand of a giant is pulling me out into the river i feel no bottom below me because there are no shallows here this part of the island forms the outside of a river bend and so takes the full brunt of the current before deflecting it west the cutting power of all that water is enormous wherever it hits a bank like this the mississippi gouges out a channel over a hundred feet deep compounding this effect the river also narrows here creating a sort of sluiceway that would knock down skyscrapers if they were placed in its path ive got to get my shoes off my jeans too in this river theyre more lethal than jesses rifle im reaching down to pull off my left shoe when the flashlight pins me to the crest of a wave i dont feel or see the impact of the bullet but the whipcrack by my ear knocks my heart into my throat whoever is firing that rifle knows what the hell hes doing im a good shot jesse bragged when telling me about my father i yank off the shoe and dive exhaling to bleed off buoyancy extending my limbs like sails to catch the current and drift more swiftly past the island when i surface again the flashlight is gone unsnapping my jeans i try to peel myself out of them but theyre tight even when dry i curse my vanity sinking like a stone as i fight to get the soaked denim off my legs my left leg comes loose but the other wont kicking back to the surface i see why the fishhooks from the trotline have fastened the jeans to my thigh two prongs of the treble hook are buried deeply in my flesh id like to rip the jeans to get them free but even if i could manage to tear the wet denim i cant afford to do itnot with what i have in mind i pull gently on the central stem of the hooks and a trickle of blood runs toward my groin getting fishhooks out of flesh is a tricky business ive seen my grandfather remove dozens sometimes he snips off the loop and pushes the barb out through unwounded skin other times he widens the hole with a scalpel and frees the barb the way it came in both methods take tools i dont have its really a question of pain my fingers cant grip the free hook firmly enough to rip out the other two but my tag heuer watch has a steel band slipping the barb of the free hook into a crevice in the band i turn my forearm so that i can jerk upward with maximum force if i can stand the pain this should rip the buried barbs out of my skin taking a deep breath i curl into a fetal position then explode out of it yanking my right arm up and my right leg down the flesh of my thigh rises like a pup tent and a scream bursts from my throat consciousness flickers and my stomach starts to come up my brain screams for me to stop but in that moment i yank still harder and something tears free afraid it was only my watchband i right myself in the water and look at my thigh where the hooks were embedded is now only a ragged hole streaming blood it looks like a small vicious animal took a hunk out of me after retching in the water i carefully remove the freed jeans leg making sure i dont hook myself again im tempted to let the jeans sink into the river but that would be a fools gesture this pair of banana republics is going to save me treading water with only my legs i tie knots in both legs of the jeans then i put the jeans behind my head take hold of each side of the waist and whip them back over my head in a wide arc trapping enough air in the makeshift life vest to keep me afloat for ten minutes then i lay my chin in the inverted crotch of the jeans with the knotted legs sticking up like the arms of those inflatable figures you see at car dealerships i learned how to do this on the swim team and it works surprisingly well now i can devote some energy to trying to figure out where the hell i am in relation to the man who wants to kill me im fifty yards from the island now all i can see is a narrow strip of beach but then that too disappears fifty yards only fifteen hundred left to swim maybe seventeen hundred the safest thing to do would be to drift south along this bank for a mile or so then climb ashore the problem with that plan is that id be getting out of the river at a place called iowa point this isnt a town or even a crossroads but only a dot on the map the nearest telephone lies across five miles of uninhabited swamp uninhabited by humans anyway there are plenty of alligators and snakes to keep you company very little chance of a cellular transmission tower but if i cross the river ill come ashore less than a mile from louisiana highway not far from the morganza spillway there i can flag down a carwhich shouldnt be difficult in my underwearor easily walk to a place where ill have cellular service am i crazy to try it most people would say yes but i swam this river fifteen years ago and if i did it then i can do it now the fact that it almost killed meunder ideal conditionsis something best not dwelled upon the trick as ive told several people is not to fight the current or even to try to swim across the river the trick is to float with the current and gradually vector out toward the thalweg or deepest part of the channel once you reach that the river will do its best to deposit you on the opposite shore of the next bend under optimum conditions that would happen about a half hour from now but tonight there are complications darkness rain waves trying to beat me to death a string of barges that i cant see and that could crush me like a tractortrailer squashing a mosquito any normal person dropped into this situation would drown within ten minutes but im not normal and at least the madman with the rifle has been removed from the equation my makeshift life preserver is steadily losing air ill have to reinflate the jeans soon because of the pounding waves i keep my right hand gripped over the jeans pocket that holds my bagged cell phone every time a wave carries me to its crest i glance around to make sure im in no immediate danger all kinds of debris gets swept into the river when its high the biggest threat is logs some float high and dry but others ride halfsubmerged like alligators tearing the props off pleasure boats and staving in the sides of barges from the bridge at natchez ive watched hundredfoot trees bobbing like twigs in the muddy flood below ten minutes of steady kicking move me into the main body of the river and in that time i probably drift half a mile downstream now its barges that concern me though the last string has passed others will come and theres simply no way to see them with these waves the front barge in a string carries only two lights green on the starboard side red on the port the push boat itself might be a thousand feet behind those lights its pilot ignorant of anything happening below the bow of his waterborne freight train if im crushed by barges no one will ever know not even the man who killed me the sound of an engine penetrates the hissing rain and it chills my blood the pitch is too high for a pushboat engine its revving like a chain saw cutting its way across the surface of the river if it were daylight i might think it was a chain sawsound travels amazing distances over waterbut nobodys cutting trees at this hour that revving sound is an outboard motor probably the evinrude on the old bass boat i decided to leave on the island jesse has come looking for me chapter kicking up onto a wave crest i see a flashlight bobbing up and down about thirty yards away its hard to believe my pursuer could get this close by design but maybe he heard my scream if it is jesse billups he probably knows the river well i try to calm myself with logic the odds of his sighting me in this maelstrom are low as long as i keep my head down pulling the deflating legs of my jeans beneath my arms i lie flat on the surface and stop kicking the whine of the motor gets louder then dies only to return again closer to me jesse must be as scared as i am a submerged log could tear off his propeller leaving him without power or smash the side of his fiberglass boat and dump him into the river with me his rifle wouldnt do him any good there i wonder if he can swim his cousin henry admitted he couldnt but jesse was in the army the st airborne they teach men to parachute in the airborne do they teach them to swim maybe it doesnt really matter though if i can get him into the water with me i can kill him all i have to do is get close enough to tangle him up like a squid drowning a sperm whale even if he were choking me i could drag him under and keep him there until his brain winked out like an old lightbulb its a strange thing to contemplate the only person ive ever thought about killing before is myself the motor revs suddenly not twenty yards from my right ear sucking in a lungful of air i duck my head and drop three feet underwater clinging only to the jeans pocket that holds my cell phone i hear the prop spinning a highpitched whine like a kitchen blender the boat doesnt seem to be moving though only holding its position in the river did jesse catch sight of me in the waves for two minutes i float like the fetus in my womb listening to the spinning prop he must have seen me why else would he remain in one place surfacing slowly i raise my eyes above the water this time a white shaft of light slices through the rain like the eye of god for an instant i think its a push boat but the beam is too near the water noits a qbeam spotlight mounted on a pivot on the bass boats hull whoever is piloting that boat either just remembered that spotlight or just discovered it maybe the gunman isnt jesse billups the foreman of the island would have switched on that spotlight as soon as he launched the boat the qbeam rakes over the waves like a searchlight in a prison movie first this way then that occasionally returning to one spot or another in the frothing waves once when the light lingers upstream i see the massive rootball of a tree moving in the glare half the twisted roots are above the water and by the size of them the tree itself must be eighty feet long the drone of the motor rises and the searchlight moves closer to the tree its white beam probes the tangled root structure its operator obviously looking for a stowaway on this natural vessel without warning the light whips back around toward me submerging again i feel my jeans adding to my weight the air in them is gone i need to reinflate them but whipping them over my head right now would be like waving a flag like most of my decisions my next is made purely by instinct carefully removing the ziploc containing my cell phone from my pocket i let the jeans sink in the river then i kick toward the bass boat using the spotlight as my guide my goal isnt the boat itselfor the man in itbut the tree floating toward it after thirty seconds underwater i surface to check my progress the boat is fifteen feet in front of me its pilot invisible behind the spotlight taking a gulp of air i drop back under the waves and swim past the boat when i surface ten meters beyond it the tree arrives like a scheduled bus with my right hand i reach out and catch a trailing root its like catching hold of a ski rope being towed by a speedboat the root bloom is the bow of my adopted ship the branches far behind me its stern the trunk is easily four feet in diameter which tells me its probably a willow uprooted by high water as the monster trunk drifts downstream i climb from its submerged roots to the dry roots above the waterline suddenly the waves that were thrashing me around the river are merely scenery im riding atop an eightyfoot willow like cleopatra on her royal barge the rifleman in the bass boat is already behind me and though he could return to search this tree again the tangle of roots and mud could easily conceal me i can see much more from this vantage point the riverbank to my leftthe eastern bankis enveloped in darkness but on my right a haze of faint bluish light reflects off the clouds that light is louisiana highway that light is civilization and the river true to its course is driving the tree beneath me straight toward the far bank of the bend beneath those lights in about three minutes i should be able to leap from these roots and swim no more than three hundred yards to shore even the rain doesnt bother me here the roots above my head shield me from most of it flipping over the ziploc to check my cell phone i see its screen glowing green in the darkness it shows three bars under the antenna icon i have service again its surreal riding down the mississippi river in the rootball of a floating willow tree i can call any telephone in the world some people in this situation might call the coast guard which maintains stations along the river but my main concern is no longer reaching the opposite bank its catching a ride when i get there besides the nearest coast guard station is probably thirty miles away at new roads and what would i tell them to look for a floating willow tree in a storm a bass boat with its spotlight on theyd never find the former and the bass boat would go dark and disappear long before a coast guard vessel could catch it while deciding whom to call i realize my screen shows four missed calls paging through screens i see that one was from sean one from dr goldman one from michael wells and one from unknown caller i check the battery to make sure i have adequate power then listen to the messages sean hey its me im sorry about not answering before i was with karen were talking about the whole divorce thing and about you its complicated look theres something you need to know nathan malik isnt in jail anymore he made his bail a million bucks the fbi had him under surveillance but malik drove out to lakeside mall and pulled some kind of switch in the dillards store they lost him they should have let us tail him anyway you need to watch your back malik hasnt been declared a fugitive but if he leaves the state he will be hes already the target of a covert statewide manhunt here and theyll be doing the same thing in mississippi his datas gone out nationally as a bolo you need to know because the guy obviously has some kind of fixation on you dont come back to new orleans cat and even in natchez you shouldshit karens coming theres a click and the message ends so malik is free again where is he now i wonder could he be the man behind me in the bass boat seans message was timestamped pm its conceivable that malik could have driven from new orleans to desalle island in that time but how would he even know where it was or that i was coming here the next message is from dr goldman in her eerily calm voice hannah says catherine im very concerned about the things you told me in our earlier conversation i want to see you as soon as possible call me any hour of the day or night i consider this a crisis and i want you under my direct care the time for distance is over this is the most dangerous and the most hopeful moment in your life please call me the next message says cat this is michael wells i got your cell number from your mother im done with work now and id really like to talk to you you didnt sound good on the phone earlier that stuff about repressed memoriesall that im not sure what youre dealing with and you may be fine now i just want you to know im here for you as a friend a doctor whatever you need my home number is four four five eight six six three call me okay no pressure no pressure god how those words sound good to me the last message is only dead air then static followed by a click so much for unknown caller for a brief moment i wonder if that could have been dr malik but the odds are against it probably just a wrong number no pressure michael said the idea of calling sean is nothing but pressure and dr goldmanmaybe tomorrow right now i need a different kind of help after checking my orientation to the riverbanki have about a minute left before my swimi dial michaels number he answers on the third ring dr wells he says sounding ready for anything from a toddler with a cold to an infant with spinal meningitis tears well in my eyes and for some reason it hits me now that the chief difference between michael and me is that he treats live patients while i work with the dead its cat ferry michael cat are you all right yes and no im in trouble actually what kind of trouble i need a ride a ride okay ill come get you where are you i close my eyes in relief and worry im about forty miles south of natchez by air but more like seventy by road theres a pause then michael says thats fine just tell me where to go god bless you im going to be beside highway one on the westbank side of the mississippi river somewhere near the morganza spillway do you know where that is yep ive flown down the river several times to baton rouge and new orleans if you could just start in this direction i can tell you exactly where i am when you get close im leaving now are you safe cat i mean do we need police or anything maybe a firstaid kit im going to talk to the police myself and theres no danger for you i know this is a huge favor to ask but dont even think about it im on my way im less than a quarter mile from the bank now but the tree is starting to slide left beneath me the current is sucking us back out toward the center of the river i have to go michael ill call you soon and thank you thank you im on my way he repeats dont worry about anything i hang up the phone then replace it in the ziploc this time when i seal the bag i leave a small opening at one end through this hole i blow air into the bag until its full like a balloon then i seal it tight if for some reason i drop it at least it will stay afloat clenching the baggie in my teeth like a saint bernard i climb down the ladder of roots until im half in the water then i push away and start swimming freestyle toward the bank i do this for about thirty yards just to get clear of the branches of the tree that saved me then switch to the breaststroke i could easily freestyle to the bank in calm water but the waves are still bad the breaststroke carries me up and down the waves in a more natural motion and its a good stroke for breathing fifteen minutes of steady swimming bring me within twenty yards of the bank my wind is still good but my arms and legs are getting that leaden feeling i used to get during the longer solo races the bank here is very steep theres nothing i can grab to pull me up in the end i simply breaststroke along the rivers edge and crawl snakelike onto the muddy slope digging my fingernails into the earth for purchase i lie panting on the bank like a novice marathon runner but its not as bad as it could be ive surfaced from free dives so fatigued that i had to be put on oxygen to maintain consciousness the rain still lashes my face but i hardly feel it now the ground under me seems like the most solid thing in the world and i dont want to get up my body tenses in fear someone is whistling the sound dies then starts again its my cell phone its ring muted by the ziploc ripping open the bag i press send hello cat its sean where are you you wouldnt believe me if i told you where are you home with karen silence then actually i am im calling because you need to know something did you get my message about malik making bail and evading surveillance yes im still thinking about sean being home with his wife have you heard anything from malik no the fbi knows you tried to call him so so are you out of your mind it doesnt look good i dont care do you care about staying alive strangely enough i do i just found that out beyond any doubt what do you mean im laughing softly somebody just tried to kill me what it doesnt have anything to do with malik how do you know that it happened on the island my familys island in the river this is about something else im not sure what but its not the murders in new orleans where are you right now lying on a riverbank with a hole in my leg and rain falling in my face i dont have any clothes or shoes and i feel a hell of a lot better than i did this morning catthat sounds like your manic voice are you taking your meds i have to go sean dont worry about me cat dont do this the fbi wants to talk to you kaiser wants to talk to you tell kaiser ill call him tomorrow and sean yeah you know how we used to wonder about some of the things i wanted you to do to me sexually i mean his voice goes quiet yeah i just found out that my father abused me so dont worry about any of that stuff it had nothing to do with you same with the other stuff i did the onenight things i think all that stuff is from what happened to me when i was a kid cat you dont sound good let me what can you leave home now can you come get me right now i may be able to yeah im an hour away from you maybe more silence i can send somebody one more knife in the stomach dont worry about it sean take care of your wife and kids goodbye cat i hang up before he can finish he cant help me now he never really could rolling onto my stomach i lay my palms flat on the ground and push myself to my feet the glow of the highway looks about a mile away i start walking chapter im sitting against the wall of an abandoned gas station on highway wearing only my underwear and waiting for michael wells to save me from the mosquitoes that are making a feast of my blood the river coated my skin with a rank oily film but the mosquitoes here must be used to it if i dont have west nile virus by tomorrow it will be a miracle the narrow overhang above hardly protects me from the rain but i dont mind the rain tonight its the only thing relieving the stifling heat the dark is another matter the only light comes from a diffuse glow behind the thunderclouds and the occasional glare of headlights flying up the highway michael told me to watch for a black ford expedition but its hard to get a look at the passing cars without exposing myself since im on the opposite side of the river from the man who was trying to kill me im probably safe from him for a while but if i stand on this highway wearing only my bra and panties im asking to get raped besides its only been an hour or so since i called michael he couldnt be here yet unless he drove ninety or faster the moment i leaned against this cinderblock wall a deep fatigue settled into my limbs it wasnt exhaustion from swimming the river i feel disconnected from everything even from myself theres a hollowness in my heart that must be the beginnings of grief ive lost so much today seanby my own choice if not by his my father who remained alive in my heart for all the years since his death finally began to die this afternoon when grandpapa told me what hed done my mother who somehow could not protect me from my fathers secret desires even pearlie who kept so much from me all these years im not even sure i want to know what she knew and when and then theres me the woman who despite alternating bouts of elation and depression managed to work her way to the top of her field she isnt who i thought she was at all part of me was always a sham the public personathe superachiever who brooked no nonsense from anyonewas a professional doppelg√£nger who protected a little girl filled with selfdoubt who secretly drank vodka almost around the clock to numb a pain she didnt understand and who needed a man to protect her from dangers that existed mostly in her head yet somehow that bundle of contradictions added up to someone who functioned efficiently in the world someone i liked reasonably well but now the formless pain i always ran from has a face and that face belongs to my father suddenly the wild emotional gyrations of my past make sense i am no longer a mystery im an oprah show my cell phone is ringing the screen reads unknown caller im afraid to answer as though by doing so ill allow the caller to see where i am like the eye of sauron seeing frodo when he put on the one ring but thats crazy after a quick breath i press send is this catherine ferry asks a precise voice my body goes rigid dr malik yes i didnt want you to think i was ignoring you we cant speak for long im afraid but we should get together soon im sure youve been going through some difficult times since our last conversation i have i admit my hands already shaking thats only to be expected catherine have you been having dreams flashbacks anything like that all of the above i found out this morning that i was sexually abused as a child i suspected that when you were a medical student dr omartian was twentyfive years your senior after all there were other signs too we can discuss all this but im afraid it will have to be at a later date my grandfather killed my father silence who told you that grandpapa he says he caught daddy molesting me why would he tell you something like that after all these years i was on the verge of discovering it anyway a pause i see a pair of headlights flashes out of the dark and blows past the gas station the glare doesnt touch me for more than a second but being illuminated at all makes me shiver you know the task force is hunting you yes they think you killed the victims in new orleans yesterday you thought that yourself hes right im not sure what i think now i only know that as i speak to this man whom the police and the fbi believe killed five men in brutal and premeditated fashion i feel calmer than i have in days do you still believe that catherine i dont know if the murders are true sexual homicides i dont think you did it but if theyre something elsemaybe you did what else would they be punishment a long pause youre a perceptive woman that hasnt helped me much it may yet what was the video equipment for the stuff the police found in your secret apartment public education ill speak to you again soon dear i have to move now separation anxiety pierces me like a blade dr malik yes someone tried to kill me tonight silence was it you no where did this happen in the middle of nowhere an island in the mississippi river more silence i cant help you with that do the murders in new orleans have anything to do with me with my life in natchez yes and no i have to go now dear be careful trust no one not even your family with one click hes gone im still holding the phone to my ear when a black expedition wheels into the parking lot and blinks its headlights three times i stay where i am until michael wells climbs out cat he yells its michael over here keeping my back against the wall i push myself erect with my legs and walk toward the expedition chapter michael looks worried as i approach the expedition but then he smiles every time i see you youre in your underwear seems that way doesnt it he reaches into the vehicle and hands me a tshirt a pair of warmup pants and some slippers about five sizes too large for my feet thanks do you have a towel or something i dont want to ruin the pants ive got a lot of blood on my leg he opens the passenger door and helps me up onto the seat then he bends over the ragged hole in my thigh damn ill have to suture that when we get back for now well just clean and cover it from a paper bag on the floor he takes a bottle of betadine soaks some gauze with it and presses the soggy ball into my wound after a few seconds he removes the gauze and squirts half a tube of neosporin into the hole then covers it with a large bandaid most of my patients need a tootsie pop after this do you have one he reaches into his glove box and with a magicians flourish whips out a chocolate tootsie pop this actually brings a smile to my lips how about we get the hell out of here now he says i nod gratefully michael shuts me into the passenger seat and gets behind the wheel as i pull the clothes over my underwear he makes a threepoint turn and skids back onto the highway headed north how did you get down here he asks in my car its on the other side of the river do we need to get it i would like to have my car back but to get it wed have to cross the ferry at st francisville thats the only way across the mississippi river between natchez and baton rougeother than the ferry at angola which is used only for prison businessso its an ideal ambush site for whoever was trying to kill me on the island if the gunman waits for me near my parked audi he risks being caught if i bring the cops back with me but the ferry is a choke point with plausible deniability if i push my luck and try to cross there he could get lucky no ill get it tomorrow okay take it easy now ill have you back in natchez in an hour i recline my seat and take a few deep breaths with the air conditioner on i feel like im resting in a suite at the windsor court i dont want to pry into your business michael says but what the hell happened to you today you sounded bad when you called my office this afternoon i got some bad news okay he doesnt ask for details but i dont see much point in holding back the rest of it just before i called you i found out that i was sexually abused as a child he nods slowly i thought it must be something like that when you asked about repressed memories ive been reading up on the subject today you got me curious ive been in this vehicle less than five minutes but already my head feels fuzzy we can talk about it i murmur i just need to rest my eyes for a little bit cat wake up i blink awake and look around im sitting in a truck in a brightly lit garage where are we my house michael says in brookwood oh i wasnt sure where you wanted to go i tried to ask you but you wouldnt wake up i stopped by my office for some sutures then brought you here lets get that cut stitched up then ill take you to your grandfathers house nathan maliks words come back to me like a brand burned into my brain trust no one not even your family i dont want to go there you dont have to ill take you wherever you want to go or you can stay here ive got three extra bedrooms its up to you i nod thanks but say nothing i dont know what i want to do i definitely want my leg stitched up it hurts like hell and stitching means local anesthetic at least i hope it does did you bring some lidocaine michael shakes his head nah i figured anybody who can free dive to three hundred feet can handle a couple of stitches without breaking a sweat he looks serious but after a few moments of eye contact he reaches into his pocket and brings out a vial of clear liquid the magic elixir he says with a smile lets do it michael sutures my leg while i sit on the cold granite of his kitchen island the gleaming room reminds me of arthur legendres kitchen only theres no corpse lying on the floor michaels house was built in the s and until mrs hemmeter sold it the decor was original to the house avocado green appliances and heavy brown paneling like that in my old bedroom michael has totally redone the place and with surprisingly good taste for a bachelor this reminds me of my grandfather stitching me up on the island when i cut my knee i tell him as he pulls the ethicon through my skin with a curved needle i guess he always carried his black bag with him oh he has a whole clinic down there when my aunt ann was ten years old the family got trapped on the island in a storm she had a hot appendix grandpapa removed it by lantern light with one of the island women assisting him thats one of his hero stories but its pretty impressive michael nods and continues stitching youd be surprised what you can do when conditions demand it ive been on a few medical mission trips to south americasaw some unbelievable things obs sterilizing women one after another in the open air they stretch them out on benches cut them open clip their tubes with special plastic clips and close them up again jesus he laughs i wouldnt recommend it to a suburban housewife but it does the job medical mission trips i have a feeling theres a lot more to michael wells than most people know i like what youve done with this house do you your mom did most of it youre kidding no when i first got to town i was too busy to breathe much less decorate a house i stopped by gwens interior design store one afternoon and hired her to do the whole place now im not sure i like it he laughs you dont get along with your mother we do as long as we dont see too much of each other he ties off the last stitch then lays his forceps on the countertop you hungry starving steak and eggs are you ordering out no he goes to the refrigerator and brings out a package of rib eyes go sit on that sofa youll be digging into this in twenty minutes the sofa sits against the wall beyond a round table in the dining area too far away for conversation or even to watch michael cooking given my earlier experiences today i dont really want to lie on the couch and let my mind wander sliding off the counter i sit on a barstool and watch michael its strange to have a man cook for me though sean sometimes boils crawfish in my backyard you want to talk about today michael asks meeting my gaze long enough to let me know hes genuinely concerned it isnt just today its the past month its my whole life really can you give me the gist in twenty minutes i laugh and then i start talking i start with my panic attack at the nolan crime scene the one prior to arthur legendres house that leads me to legendre then to carmen piazza removing me from the task force and then to my trip back to natchez and to finding the bloody footprints in my bedroom im talking on autopilot though because what im really doing is watching michael cook hes good with his hands and i can tell from the way he uses them that hes a good doctor he asks questions during my pauses and before long im telling him about the depression that began in high school the mania that followed and my serial monogamy with married men hes a good listener only i cant tell what he makes of all this he looks as though hes hearing nothing out of the ordinary but inside he may already regret rescuing this particular damsel in distress when the steaks and eggs are done we move to the glass dining table but i do as much talking as eating i cant seem to stop the funny thing is he doesnt try to force me to eat as most men would he just keeps watching my eyes as if theyre telling him as much as my words i tell him about my father grandpapa pearlie my mother dr goldman nathan malikeven the things grandpapa told me earlier today the only thing i dont tell michael about is being pregnant that i cannot bring myself to do when at last my stream of words slows to a trickle he sighs deeply and says you want to watch a movie i rented the new adam sandler im not sure whether im offended or relieved are you kidding he grins yes you want to know what i really think about all that i do i think youre under more stress right now than most people could stand i think your life is probably in danger from whoever is behind these murders not to mention the risk of dealing with your disease without adequate therapy or medication i say nothing does it piss you off that i said that a little he holds up his hands palms outward i know its not my business if you dont want to take your medication fine but i know a little bit about being bipolar i had a good friend in medical school who was that way im not bipolar im cyclothymic thats just semantics same symptoms just a question of degree i concede this with a nod what i learned from my friend was that a lot of bipolar people tell you they want to get better but they really dont they feel so good during their highs that theyre willing to endure the lows as the price of that euphoria even if the lows are so bad that the person is suicidal when they crash i cant argue with that what happened to your friend he flunked out of med school just like me is that your point you didnt flunk out they basically kicked you out for causing someone else to try to kill himself yep michaels face is nonjudgmental i dont think any of that stuff was your fault cat i dont know too much about the links between childhood sexual abuse and adult psychological problems because i treat kids thats why i knew so little about repressed memories but i do know about child abuse ive seen a lot of it especially as a pediatric resident working ers theres something in his eyes that reminds me of john kaisers eyes knowledge earned through pain wisdom never asked for those cases are the easy ones though michael says the tough cases are the ones where you know something isnt right but youre not looking at genital warts or something obvious like that dealing with those cases is how i learned the most surprising things about sexual abuse like like its not usually the physically painful horrible thing that people imagine its not violent rape or even necessarily a terrible experience in itself not in the beginning if it were sexual abuse wouldnt be the invisible epidemic that it is sex is pleasurable even to a child adult abusers know that they seduce the child a little at a time gradually raising the stakes the family dynamics are altered in ways it would take freud years to figure out complex power games are played between abuser and victim you get young girls serving as surrogate wives in the home sisters competing for the sexual attention of their father fathers training sons to use women the same way they do of course the reverse happens too you get older daughters trying to protect younger siblings by doing anything they can to keep the abusive father focused on them i close my eyes in horror ill bet this isnt how you thought youd be spending this evening michael spears a piece of cold steak and chews it thoughtfully no but im okay with it i was always curious about you why you picked the guys you did in high school and these repeated relationships with married guys thats not hard to figure out now is it my therapist tells me i pick unavailable guys so that i cant become too attached to a man that way the loss i experienced with my father cant be repeated is it too late to get your money back michaels eyes silently apologize for joking about something so serious but hes so honest about his opinions that its difficult to get angry i think its the secrecy thats the root of your affairs he says secrecy was part of your sexual imprinting i think youve been reenacting your abuse for most of your life you thrive on a secretive relationship with a forbidden partner a relationship thats very sexual in nature is that accurate are you sure you didnt subspecialize in pediatric psychiatry he shakes his head once you know about the abuse its easy to see the connections you may not feel comfortable telling me this but do you have any quirks in your sex life that seem abnormal i feel myself flush and it surprises me im usually quite candid with men about sexual matters sometimes shockingly so but tonightim not sure we know each other well enough to go there yet youre right he puts down his fork and lays his hands on the table let me ask you another question okay did your mother have an illness that kept her bedridden for long periods after i was born she had some kind of female problem pelvic inflammatory disease maybe im not sure but she would stay in bed for weeks at a time i was very young then of course what about later was she absent from the home a lot yes my main memories of my mother are of her leaving home or returning and she always had something in her handssomething besides me mom was completely obsessed with her interior design business if you asked her whether i liked mayonnaise on my sandwiches or not she couldnt have told you but if you asked her how many shades of grasscloth wallpaper were available in america she could list them from memory michael doesnt seem surprised was alcohol a problem in your house or substance abuse both more drugs than alcohol my dad used all kinds of drugs when he got back from vietnam prescription mostly my mother didnt drink when i was growing up so i thought she was clean but apparently she was taking my fathers prescription meds for years why are you asking these questions theyre classic markers for an abusive situation his uncanny accuracy about my life makes me want to know more but to learn more ill have to give more can i trust him with my secret self michael reaches out and touches my hand youre shaking cat you dont have to tell me any more no i want to i say quickly he withdraws his hand and leans back in his chair all right then tell me chapter ive always needed certain things during sex i say softly pain for example nothing masochistic really but justvery physical penetration with fingers objectsi dont know and choking sometimes i have this intense desire to be choked during sex michael is still leaning back from the dinner table but i sense a new alertness in him and i have a problem reaching orgasm even if i get those things i want it just doesnt happen for me on one hand i have this hyperactive sex drive but on the other i cant make it to the point of release not with a man i mean i can do it alone but with men its this maddening spiral upward without ever being able to break through but the men youre with think youre the best sexual partner they ever had right now im really blushing they say so all classic signs of past sexual abuse pain was part of your sexual imprinting just like secrecy your father may have put his hands around your throat during sex or maybe you just felt you couldnt breathe during the acts maybe thats what youre trying to repeat with the choking that makes me wonder about your free diving too lying on pool bottoms for five minutes at a time to relax that would put most people into a coma i guess it is kind of a red flag and your sexual performance thats the easiest thing of all to understand from childhood you were trained to please a man sexually that was the only goal of the abuse and your survival instinct made you learn it well so youre an expert at giving pleasure you just cant feel it yourself i guess the good news is that now that youre aware of the abuse this therapist you likedr goldmanshe should be able to make some real progress with you maybe but right now i just want to pretend it never happened even if its the answer to everything i dont want to think about it who would thats a normal response michael gets up and starts clearing the table im actually more concerned about this murder case youre working on i mean somebody tried to blow your brains out tonight i carry the glasses to the sink and he starts rinsing the plates to put in the dishwasher im not sure that has to do with the murder case i tell him what then these revelations of abuse your fathers been dead for twenty years what about the vietnam angle you think someones trying to prevent thirtyyearold atrocities from coming to light you said jesse billups served in a whole different theater of the war than your father i dont think thats it cat then what i think the murders in new orleans are somehow connected to your life here to your past maybe even to your abuse though i cant see how but sexual abuse is the common factor in both situations its oddly familiar standing in a kitchen batting around theories about a murder case with a man only the man im doing it with is not familiar both pearlie and louise told you that tom cage was your fathers doctor here in town hes been practicing for more than forty years and hes a great guy you should talk to him about the vietnam stuff do you know him in my mind i see a tall man with a saltandpepper beard and twinkling eyes i know who he is i dont think he likes my grandfather much that wouldnt surprise me tom cage is the opposite of your grandfather he never gave a damn about making money he just treats sick people ill be glad to call him for you if you like set up a meeting maybe tomorrow michael turns on the dishwasher then takes a tub of blue bell ice cream from the freezer and starts scooping it into two bowls this is my reward for doing a good deed tonight he says with a smile i didnt ask if you wanted any because i knew youd say no ill have to run an extra mile tomorrow morning i think i already got my workout tonight no doubt hey who knew you were going to that island today i think about it as we walk to the table pearlie my grandfather and his driver somebody probably told mom after i was gone i guess mose the yardman could have found out michael slowly stirs his ice cream once you were on the island word probably spread quickly that you were there but i dont think it was anybody from that island who tried to kill you i think somebody followed you there or found out you went there and went after you but i dont get it what good does killing me do anybody good is a relative term what good did killing the other five victims do youre right if i knew that i could solve the case i know you feel like this dr malik isnt the killer but youre not stable enough right now to make that kind of judgment i know when im off my meds i feel much more alive and in the moment but that comes at a price my memory and logic definitely suffer maybe if i wean myself completely theyll come back maliks at the center of this whole mess hes the only known connection between you and the new orleans murders hes already demonstrated that hes fixated on you i think you should consider him the prime suspect i hold some ice cream in my mouth savoring the rich taste of vanilla wellthe fbi is already searching for him and he couldnt have known i was on the island you dont know that you do know hes going to call you back yet you havent told the fbi that why how do you know i havent michaels eyes say give me a break i think you want to talk to dr malik without anyone listening in you think he can figure out things about your life that other therapists never could like like why this abuse happened to you proof that it did happen thats one thing i read today about people with delayed memories of abuse even when they manage to find proof that their memories are real they still doubt the truth of what comes back to them this gives me an unexpected chill why because accepting that the abuse really happened means accepting that the person who abused them never really loved them to accept your abuse cat the little girl inside of you is going to have to admit my daddy never loved me do you think you can do that im not sure i could ive never wanted ice cream less than i want it now thats the core of this whole problem michael reflects denial mothers deny its happening to their children so they can keep their families together the rest of us refuse to believe that our doctor or our minister or the nice mailman is having sex with his threeyearold child because if we do we admit that the whole veneer of civilization is bullshit worse wed have to admit the danger that our own kids are in because if we cant recognize the abusers we shake hands with every day how can we protect our children this is a depressing conversation you want to watch that movie now god no i want to sleep for thirty hours straight then thats what you should do michael shrugs as if were on vacation together deciding whether to go out to dinner or to eat in i dont blame you for not wanting to go home going back into the physical space where the abuse happened to you cant be a good idea do you really have a guest room i can stay in he smiles i have three youll have total privacy the whole second floor is yours you wont know im here unless you come downstairs and find me i wait a moment before speaking i dont want to sound ungrateful but guys have made me promises like that before they never seem to live up to them im not most guys i believe you but why arent you a selfdeprecating smile probably because my puberty years sucked so badly i understand deferred gratification is that what you want from this relationship though in the end gratification michael suddenly looks very serious im not thinking that far ahead okay i dont even know if youre sane enough to handle a real relationship i just like you i always did i also happen to think youre beautiful but anyone can see that the point is you can stay here as long as you want and you dont have to worry about sex being in the mix i dont know why but i believe him okay deal show me the bedroom you can find it upstairs is all you need to know take your pick the wide smile on my face surprises me before it can fade i turn and walk to the foyer where the stairs are i remember the layout from when the hemmeters owned the house as i put my foot on the second step i hear michaels voice i have to go to work in the morning he says walking into the foyer but im going to leave the expedition for you what will you drive i have a motorcycle a motorcycle does that surprise you well a strange laugh escapes my lips you have a plane and a motorcycle i guess i associate that with a certain kind of guy and you dont seem like that kind of guy it doesnt pay to stereotype people touch√£ he takes a step back toward the kitchen ill leave the keys on the counter i start to go up but something has been nagging me since he said it michael what you said beforeabout why mothers keep quiet about abuse going on in their homes yes you said they do it to keep their families together right right i would think thats because the father in those situations is the primary breadwinner the source of support for the whole family michael nods exactly the abuser creates a situation in which everyone in the family is dependent upon him by denying the abuse the mother avoids her worst nightmares of abandonment and poverty but that doesnt work in my case see for my family because your father wasnt the provider right my grandfather was what about your fathers sculpting he didnt make any real money from that until a couple of years before his death grandpapa paid for everything i mean we lived in his slave quarters for gods sake it sounds terrible but if my dad had been hit by a bus it wouldnt have affected our situation in the least materially speaking michael says but money isnt everything based on what youve told me tonight i think your fathers early death went a long way toward wrecking your life hes right of course michael steps back toward the staircase so why would your mother deny that your father was abusing you if she didnt have to fear losing him i feel blood heat my cheeks right it may be that she didnt really know about it but thinkyour father returned from vietnam with severe posttraumatic stress disorder he told you himself that you couldnt be around him at certain times now youve learned that he was part of a military unit that committed atrocities during the war it would probably be difficult to overestimate your mothers fear of what that man might do to heror to youif she confronted him about abuse or worse tried to take you away from him michaels logic leaves me in cold shock why is it so easy to see the essential nature of relationships in other peoples families but not in our own ive been angry at my mother for years and i didnt know why today i thought id discovered the reason but nowgiven an idea of what it must have been like to live with daddy not as a blindly loving daughter but as a wife my mother seems a completely different person to me michael lays his hand over mine which is resting on the newel post get some sleep cat its going to take a while for all this to sink in ive gotten similar advice countless times from the women in my life go to sleep everything will look better in the morning but it doesnt sound the same coming from michael he has no illusions that things will be better tomorrow thanks i tell him i mean it youre welcome he withdraws his hand and walks back toward the kitchen i slowly climb the stairs and flick on the light in the first bedroom to my right the walls are pale yellow and the queen bed has a white comforter on it walking to the window i see that it overlooks the glowing blue rectangle of the swimming pool i can sleep here the bathroom is stocked with towels and toiletries even a new toothbrush i strip off the warmup pants and tshirt michael brought me then lean into the shower to turn the faucet handles before i can the opening notes of sunday bloody sunday fill the bathroom i glance at the screen of my cell phone and my pulse instantly accelerates its a new orleans number that i dont recognize nathan malik i press send and then hold the phone to my ear dr ferry says a man who sounds nothing like dr malik yes i say cautiously this is john kaiser i need to talk to you about nathan malik chapter is he alive i ask without any rational reason the silence that follows this question seems interminable i sit on the lid of michael wellss commode and wait for agent kaiser to tip me off my precarious mental precipice why would you ask me that question he asks didnt you speak to dr malik earlier tonight seans warning that malik might be declared a fugitive from a murder charge comes back to me with all its implications yes i confess briefly youre aware dr malik purposefully evaded surveillance and will be declared a fugitive if he leaves louisiana two things hit me instantly one kaiser is speaking for a tape recorder two sean obviously told kaiser about our conversation yes i think you know that did malik give you any idea where he was when you were talking no but you must have figured that out by now a brief pause he called you from a pay phone on the west bank in new orleans by the time we got a car there he was gone is that right i stall trying to gather my wits its disorienting to deal with this call while naked in the guest bathroom of michael wellss house id do better in my own house or even in my car but one thing i know if malik was on the west bank when he called me he could not have been shooting at me on the island dr ferry kaiser says in a softer voice youve asked me to call you cat may i do that sure i say pulling the tshirt back on i need to cover several things with you quickly i want you to tell me everything that pops into your head while we talk is there any reason you feel you wont be able to do that such as some sort of loyalty to dr malik my cheeks burn i told you i dont even know the guy you heard every word of our meeting in his office yes i did but clearly the two of you feel some sort of rapport an emotional connection perhaps it has to do with your similar medical histories i close my eyes wondering how much kaiser knows about my personal life did sean tell him about my sexual abuse please go ahead with your questions agent kaiser all right are you absolutely positive that dr malik never treated you as a patient yes did sean regan tell you that we finally found a patient of maliks who would talk to us no like his other patients she feels great loyalty to malik but she had to drop out of her therapy group with him she found it too stressful this piques my interest as kaiser must have known it would stressful how apparently malik does delayedmemoryrecall work with several patients in the same room thats highly unorthodox the experience of hearing other women relive abusive experiences gave this patient acute anxiety attacks and wellthats what youve been having at our crime scenes give me a break anything can cause an anxiety attack nevertheless malik manages several different groups his treatment protocols vary according to what he thinks each group can tolerate drugs with some not with others in this womans group malik encouraged aggressive confrontations with family members who had sexually abused the patients as children malik compared these confrontations to the solo flights of student pilots the final step to freedom and independence anyway this woman couldnt handle that and she dropped out we found her through the psychologist who initially referred her to malik thats all very interesting but it has nothing to do with me kaisers sigh carries a lot of fatigue in it cat a lot of people on the task force are very angry with you im not one of them whether you believe me or not i think you have some real insight into this case maybe insight you dont even realize you have i also know that you gave sean regan a lot of help on one of the serial murder cases he got credit for solving who told you that sean did thats a shock he really cares for you cat extramarital affairs are hard on everybody but sean thinks youre a genius men always try flattery first to manipulate women john kaisers no different the threat will come later im no genius im just obsessive whatever works sean told me somebody tried to kill you tonight yep do you know who it was nope is this your gary cooper impression i cant help but smile a little nope do you think the attempt on your life was connected to the new orleans murders in any way or to your work on those murders no why not im looking into a separate matter up here a personal matter a personal matter kaiser seems to mull this over are you sure its unrelated to your work in new orleans you cant be a hundred percent sure of anything but im pretty sure its not did you tell dr malik about the attempt on your life yes did he suggest there might be a link between that and the new orleans murders i suddenly have the feeling that kaiser has every word of my phone conversation with malik on tapethat hes just testing my honesty with these questions i asked him that exact question he said yes and no cat i want you back in new orleans youre tied into these murders somehow surely you see that theres an earnestness in kaisers voice that tells me hes really worried about me i concede that malik has a fixation on me okay but if he called me from the west bank of new orleans this evening he couldnt have shot at me on desalle island thirty minutes before that thats physically impossible im not sure what were dealing with here kaiser confesses but i know nathan malik is involved in the murders he probably knows more than hes telling but if you want to know what he knows i have a lot better chance talking to him on my own than with you listening in do you plan to speak to him again if he calls me hm i get the feeling kaiser would like to run this investigation one way while his colleagues on the task force would prefer a stricter approach are you listening in on my cell calls no not yet anyway if kaiser is telling the truth its only because he doesnt yet have a court order or the assets in place to bug my phone but he soon will why did you go to desalle island he asks this personal matter of yours im trying to find out something about my past about your father how did you know that im extrapolating from your conversation with malik in his office did you learn anything important im not about to give kaiser the sordid history of my childhood nothing relating to your case well the fact that lukes military record was sealed bothered me so i did some digging on my own my heart is tight in my chest what did you find out luke ferry was in a unit called the white tigers they made an illegal incursion into cambodia in details are tough to come by but theres no doubt that the white tigers committed war crimes during that period two major investigations were conducted by the jag corps but all charges were ultimately dropped the whole thing was deemed too embarrassing for the government however i did learn that some veterans of the white tigers were prosecuted for heroin trafficking after the war some as recently as the late s your father was murdered in so im not ruling out anything im tempted to tell kaiser that my father was shot by my grandfather but something holds me back have you found any connection between malik and drugs yes malik tortured a vietnamese prisoner with drugs in he was a medic then remember apparently he did it on the order of his commanding officer he was also arrested for selling army pharmaceuticals on the black market in saigon the charges were later dropped and he was returned to his unit no reason given was malik a member of the white tigers not that i can prove but a largescale drug operation needs people all over the country again im just not sure what were dealing with here for what its worth i dont think the murders in new orleans or my fathers death have anything to do with drugs i just dont then what childhood sexual abuse obviously i dont know john is there anything else be very careful if you speak to malik you could easily cross the line into aiding and abetting i dont even respond to this i have to say this cat id like you to accept roundtheclock fbi protection no you wouldnt even know we were there look no women have died okay its men who are at risk from this killer until you got shot at tonight i might have agreed with you were very good at this cat no one would know we were guarding you malik would know i dont know how but he would and he wouldnt come near me a long silence tell me why you want to talk to him i dont know why to tell you the truth he just knows something i need to know i sense that remember what curiosity did to the cat i groan yeah but cats have nine lives remember kaiser delivers his retort like a valediction from what i understand youve used up most of yours i need to go john ill let you know if i learn anything vital i click off before he can say more chapter the oily film that the river left on my skin has a sulfurous stink and i want it off me i turn the shower taps and the water heats up fast stripping off the tshirt again i climb into the tub and stand under the steaming spray except during my drive to the islandwhen i was pretty much in shocki havent had time to think about what grandpapa told me this afternoon not critically anyway what i told michael is true when i stop taking my meds my logical faculties go to hell so does my shortterm memory but when grandpapa told me he killed daddy it was as though the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle fell into place completing a picture that had eluded me for most of my life only that story resonates emotionally with my past as i know it according to michael accepting that my father abused me means accepting that he didnt love me i suppose thats true since abusing a child means using it purely for your own ends but couldnt daddy have loved me independently of that couldnt he have loved me but simply been unable to resist the impulse to touch me or is that just wishful thinking for some reason this thought makes me think of michael the guy drove out to the boondocks in the middle of the night to rescue me and asked for nothing in return he even cooked supper for me then he gave me a room to sleep in using my past experiences with men as a guide michael should pull aside the shower curtain about now and climb in with me saying he just couldnt resist but he wont do that im sure of it my ears pick out a strange harmonic from the water spraying from the nozzle when it stops and begins again i recognize the tones of my cell phone rinsing the soap off my face i grab the phone lean away from the spray and look at the screen det sean regan i dont really want to answer but i do want to know if sean is sleeping at home with his wife or not i press send and say dont say anything until you tell me where you are this isnt who you think it is says a precise voice with a trace of humor in it my heart is pounding dr malik none other are you alone catherine i need to speak to you a current of fear shoots through my veins not for me but for sean how did you get seans cell phone i dont have his phone i reprogrammed the phone im using to mimic detective regans digital id information john kaiser and the fbi wont pay so much attention to this call if the esn belongs to your boyfriend how the hell does he know all that go ahead then im calling you because i need to leave something with you i turn off the shower and wrap a towel around my chest what is it id rather not tell you on the phone i just need to leave it with someone i can trust you trust me yes why instinct you shouldnt im working with the fbi are you a hint of sarcasm i dont think so it has to be you catherine theres no one else what about a friend i dont have friends i have patients i feel exactly the same way i can relate to that patients and exlovers thats about it malik laughs softly i have only patients i have the distinct feeling that the psychiatrist is telling me his patients are his lovers if youre trying to give me your patient records i cant accept them the fbi named those in a search warrant theyd prosecute me if i withheld them its not my records maliks indrawn breath stops suddenly its a film a film a film and the raw materials relating to it minidv tapes dvd disks audiotapes like that its all in two boxes what kind of film im making a documentary about sexual abuse and repressed memory this revelation comes as such a surprise that im not sure how to respond yet it makes perfect sense recalling malik in his allblack getup its easy to see him as some sort of revolutionary filmmaker nothing like it has ever been seen before he says with gravity its the most emotionally devastating thing ever committed to film if it reaches the screen it will shake this country to its foundations what does it show actual sexual abuse in a way it shows women reliving abuse in a group setting some of them obviously regress to a childhood state their experiences are shattering i assume the women are patients of yours did they give their permission for you to record them yes theyre part of a very special group an experimental group women only i formed it after years of watching conventional therapy approaches fail i chose patients who were at the stage where the eruption of delayed memories was beginning to destroy their lives and where multigenerational abuse seemed likely they were highly motivated ive spent seven months working with them and weve done some groundbreaking things is that the extent of it women in group therapy malik makes a sound i cant interpret you shouldnt denigrate what youve never experienced catherine never fear though ive recorded certain other activities as well i cant discuss those now lets just say theyre highly controversial in nature explosive might be a better word certain other activities are you talking about the murders i cant discuss the specifics of the film with you now my heart rate is steadily accelerating do you plan to show this film anywhere yes but right now im more concerned with keeping it safe from whom a lot of people would like this film to disappear my film and all my records these people are terrified of the truths i know if youre that worried why not turn yourself in to the fbi the fbi wants to jail me for murder if youre innocent what does that matter there are degrees of innocence i think youre talking about degrees of guilt doctor thats a philosophical question we dont have time for ill turn myself in when the time is right for now i need your help will you keep my film safe for me look i couldnt do it even if i wanted to the fbi is probably following me they may even be listening to this call by tomorrow maybe were safe for now do you have a pen i glance around the bedroom but theres nothing to write with my purse is in my audi across the river from desalle island no but i have a good memory memorize this phone number five zero four eight zero two nine nine four one do you have it i repeat the number aloud and commit it to memory if you need to speak to me after this malik says leave a message at that number i want to speak to you now and not about your film hurry why did you tell me not to trust my family im trying to protect you from what malik sighs as if unsure whether he can spare the time to talk to me families like yours are made up of three types of people offenders deniers and victims every family member plays one of these roles when a victim begins digging into her past and making assertions of abuse the other family members become paranoid their interest is maintaining the status quo you threaten that the emotions that swirl around sexual abuse frequently spill over into family violence thats shrinkspeak doctor ive heard enough of it to know you have specific information about my family about my father why are you keeping it from me im not your therapist catherine i want you to be ill meet you somewhere for a session you dont need to speak to me alone you need a group and my days as a practicing psychiatrist are clearly over why do i need a group because your problem is sexual abuse one of the main elements of the abusive relationship is secrecy a oneonone relationship with a therapist can mirror the primary abusive relationship in group therapy that cycle of secrecy is broken look you chose me okay you started this secret relationship im ready to talk to you now and without the fbi listening in this time you want a session keep my film for me youd be doing yourself a favor too im tempted i want to see what malik really did behind the closed doors of his office but the fbi could be listening to this call id like to see it but i cant promise ill keep it for you then we have no reason to meet why the hell would you meet me anyway i could bring the fbi with me why would you risk that theres no risk i do know things about your father catherine i know why he was murdered and if you bring the fbi with you ill never tell for once im a step ahead of malik i already know why my father was killed you dont you dont know anything my heart flutters like the wings of a panicked bird why are you playing games with me i just want the truth maliks voice drops lower you already know the truth catherine its written indelibly in the convolutions of your brain you just have to peel away everything thats laid over it how do i do that youre already doing it just follow the memories where they lead the truth will set you free i cant wait for that someones trying to kill me malik sighs deeply why were you having panic attacks at the crime scenes in new orleans i dont know do you come on catherine you know how therapy works im prodding you to find your own answers youre fucking with me is what youre doing who do you think tried to kill you today it might have been a black guy who knew my dad years ago i dont know do you know no but you do if only you think about it in the right way you said the new orleans murders both are and arent connected to my personal life what did you mean by that what do you think i meant i close my eyes and try not to scream i feel like im in a kafka novel every question is answered by another question everyone around me knows the obvious truth about my life but i cant see it what are you trying to tell me everyone keeps asking me if i was ever your patient have you given them that idea do you think you might have been my patient at some point im hanging up this phone in five seconds no youre not my experimental group is called group x does that ring a bell anywhere group x no should it we dont have time for this malik says his voice suddenly impatient not now but i do want to talk to youpreferably on film will you appear on camera what no then i thought the fbi confiscated all your video equipment i still have a camera with me quite a good one look you cant understand it yet but theres a symmetry to all this an underlying symmetry that youll ultimately appreciate we need to find a safe place to meet a place where we can speak privately we should do it tomorrow when were finished you take possession of my film at that point ill turn myself over to the fbi why dont you just leave your film with your lawyer because i despise lawyers i intend to represent myself of course i dont wish to be ungracious malik says but if you dont comeor if you bring the fbi with youyoull never know the answer to the mystery of your own life now ive been in one place for too long do you remember the phone number i gave you i spit the number back at him like a curse good call it tomorrow and leave a different number where i can reach you not your cell and dont get too chummy with john kaiser he doesnt really care about either of us the phone goes dead in my hand chapter i feel like im going to puke i already know why my father was killed you dont you dont know anything fear is worse than death death is but the end of life and i know it well what i know i can fight what can be named i can endure but what lies in shadow i can neither fight nor endure my whole life seems a shadow now a performance invented to fill the void of my true past for every childhood memory i possess a thousand have been lost ive always known that back beyond a certain point in time theres simply nothing when other kids talked about this or that indelible moment from their time as toddlers i reached backward and found only a blank wall a child without a childhoodthats how i felt and i never knew why this afternoon i thought id learned the answer as terrible as it was at least it put firm ground beneath my feet but now that ground has shifted a seismic change wrought by only a few words from a psychiatrists mouth you dont know anything i dont want to think about the things dr malik said i want the questions to stop i want a drink failing that i want a valium but i cant take one and thinking of the reason whythe baby in my tummysuddenly brings up my steak and eggs with a vengeance i fall to my knees over the toilet retching and shivering as ive done after my worst binges hugging the commode i feel the substance of my body fading as though im becoming transparent ive felt this way before i want to get up and check the mirror to make sure im wrong but i cant bring myself to look instead i turn on the hot water climb under the scalding spray and sit on the floor of the tub my skin blisters red as the water rises above my hips then to the edge of the tub i shut off the tap and lie back submerging my head here maliks words cannot hurt me theyll vanish like words spoken in a vacuum like a scream in outer space its not his words that matter anyway but what was beneath them a hidden key waiting only for me to find it just as john kaiser did malik asked if i thought id ever been his patient thats not a question you ask a normal person thats a question you ask someone with alzheimers disease or amnesia or somethings wrong im bathing in zero gravity the water wont lie in the tubit breaks into millions of droplets and floats into the air clammy liquid bursts from my pores like overflowing panic under the scalding water it feels like sleet on my skin do you think you might have been my patient at some point thats a question you ask a patient with dissociative identity disorder what we used to call multiple personality disorder sometimes the dissociation during sexual abuse is so profound and repeated that the mind splits into separate parts in order to wall itself off from the pain no i say aloud digging my fingernails into my palms not possible im certain i never saw nathan malik as a patient but then i is a problematic pronoun in a sentence spoken by someone with multiple personality disorder i may not have seen malik but someone else within my brain may well have the disorientation i feel now is much like that ive felt after waking from an alcoholic blackout or coming out of a hypomanic state i know ive been somewherea party an apartment a housebut im not sure what i did there how far things went and yet despite this similarity ive never felt so disconnected from myself that a whole separate life seemed possible take it easy i say in a shaky voice what did malik say before that we were talking about group therapyhe said you shouldnt denigrate what youve never experienced why would he say that if i had ever been part of his group x a sense of relief washes through me then evaporates could i have seen malik oneonone in a dissociated state then forgotten or repressed it i have no memory of that but neither do i have any memory of my childhood sexual abuse that doesnt mean it didnt happen could malik know so much about me because i told him myself i lurch up out of the tub and splash cool water on my face from the bathroom sink as i peer at my bloodshot eyes in the mirror a shudder goes through me heralding a terrifying thought at one point during the phone call i had the feeling malik was telling me his patients were his lovers or exlovers could he have consummated his old lust for me during a session of which i have no memory i still recall the shock i felt when maliks photo first scrolled out of my grandfathers fax machine that was the first time id seen his face in ten years i was sure of it but what is the value of my certainty once you open the door to the idea that you dont remember parts of your past anything is possible and for someone whos dealt with blackouts and manic episodes its not a great leap to make stop thinking says a voice in my headthe voice of selfpreservation too much truth too fast can kill you grabbing a large towel from the hanger on the door i wrap it around me then climb into bed and pull the comforter up to my neck the light is still on and im not about to turn it off i set my phone to vibrate close my eyes and pray for sleep on any other night id need a drink or a valium to shut off the thoughts racing through my head but tonight exhaustion does the job for me as consciousness blurs dr maliks face flashes before me his eyes cold and penetrating then michael wellss face replaces it michaels eyes are warm kind and open something about him reminds me of my father but i cant place what its not his eyes or his build its just a way a reluctance to judge perhaps whatever it is it draws me to him why didnt i tell michael i was pregnant it was the only thing i held back was it because deep down im the one hoping for this relationship to progress am i afraid that when he learns im pregnant hell vanish like those men drawn by my body and my intensity would stop shouts the voice in my head stop stop stop i have a trick to deal with destructive thoughts i put myself in a different place altogether a place of peace for me its the ocean im free diving down a multicolored wall of coral a steep wall that slopes down through caribbean blue toward depths of india ink theres no sound but the beating of my heart my body knifes through warmth until warmth becomes cold and my perception balloons out beyond the cage of my skull taking in all that i see and rapture comes over me the rapture of the deep im diving that wall now down through the last glimmering stratum of wakefulness into sleep i wish it were only darkness that awaited me below but its never just the dark dreams lie in wait as they always have the netherworld where im always a stranger or a fugitive or a soldier frozen in the midst of battle fear and confusion are my only companions there and our journeys are always long ones when i was a teenager i heard that dreams that seem to last hours actually happen in a span of six or seven seconds i know now that this isnt true most dreams last ten or fifteen minutes then fade into others in the deep reaches of rem sleep some dreams we remember others we dont most of minethough often more vivid than lifeleave only fragmentary images behind like tattered pages from a picture book tonight will be different tonight im back in the rusted orange truck back on the island my grandfather is behind the wheel were rolling up the long sloping hill of the old pasture on the other side lies the pond where the cows drink their patties dot the grass like dried mud pies my grandfathers hair is black not silver the truck smells bad stale motor oil chewing tobacco mildew other odors i cant identify its going to rain the sky is leaden the air still we roll steadily up the shallow slope making for the crest terror has closed my throat but grandpapas face is calm he doesnt know whats on the other side of the hill i dont either but i know its bad ive dreamed this dream so often that i know im dreaming each time we make it a little closer to the crest but we never top the hill were getting close now thoughi know ill wake up soon only this time i dont this time grandpapa downshifts and steps on the gas pedal and the old pickup trundles right over the cows are waiting for us staring with dumb indifference beyond them lies the pond slate gray and smooth as glass i squeeze my hands so tightly into fists that my palms bleed theres something in the pond a man hes floating facedown in the water his arms outspread like jesus on the cross he has long hair like jesus too i want to scream but grandpapa doesnt seem to see the man mute with fear i point with my finger grandpapa squints and shakes his head goddamn rain he says they cant work on the island when it rains as the truck rolls down toward the pond grandpapa points to our right his prize bull has mounted a cow and is bouncing above her with violent jerks as he stares at the rutting animals i look back toward the pond the man isnt floating anymore hes getting to his feet my palms tingle with apprehension the man isnt in the pond but on it hes standing on its glassy surface as though on an ice rink but its almost a hundred degrees outside my heart pounds so loudly i can hear it over the sound of the truck the man standing on the surface of the pond is my father i recognize his jeans and his work shirt and behind the long hair his deepset brown eyes as i stare he starts walking across the water holding out his arms to me he wants to show me something grandpapa is mesmerized by the bull humping the cow i pull at his shirtsleeve but he wont look away daddy is walking on water like jesus in the bible but grandpapa wont look daddy i shout luke ferry nods at me but says nothing as he nears the edge of the pond he starts unbuttoning his shirt i see dark hair on his chest he undoes four buttons then pulls his shirt open i want to shut my eyes but i cant on the right side of his chest is a hole where the bullet went in there are other scars too the big sutured yincision of an autopsy as i stare in horror daddy puts two fingers into the bullet hole and starts to rip it open he wants me to watch but i dont want to see i cover my eyes with my hands then peer between my fingers something is pouring out of the wound like blood only its not blood its gray thats all i know and all i want to know look kitty cat he commands i want you to look i cant look when he calls my name again i shut my eyes and scream chapter wake up its michael youre dreaming michael wells is shaking my shoulders his eyes frantic cat its just a nightmare i nod as though in understanding but in my minds eye i see my father pushing his fingers into the bullet wound in his chest then pulling the skin apart cat i blink myself back to reality and grab michaels hands hes wearing a unc tshirt and plaid pajama bottoms im okay youre righta nightmare he nods in relief then stands and looks down at me the overhead light is bright behind his head but the bedroom window is dark do you want to talk about it i close my eyes is it one youve had before yes the truck the islandmy grandfather only this time we made it over the hill what did you see i shake my head its too crazy did i scream out loud he smiles you screamed but i wasnt sleeping ive been thinking about everything you told me have you ive come up with a couple of ideas if youre interested i sit up and prop myself against the headboard is it about the new orleans murders or my situation your situation i dont know anything about the murders dont feel left out neither does anyone else something you said stuck in my head that thing about your dad not being the breadwinner for your family id thought his sculpting earned a lot of money but if it didnt then your grandfather was that figure in your household absolutely and from what you told me about your father he wasnt a dominating man or even a strong personality he didnt try to control people is that right yes daddy just wanted his own space he hardly interacted with anyone except me and of course louise the woman on the island i dont know dr kirkland well but i would characterize him as a control freak oh yeah hes like a feudal lord michael nods slowly well what ive been thinking is this you grew up with one version of your fathers death you got that version from your grandfather its the same version he gave the police in now twentythree years later you discover some old blood in your childhood bedroom you decide to investigate it and you make no secret of the fact what happens your grandfather instantly begins revising the story you grew up with his original story by his own admission he told you the new versionsupposedly the real truthto stop you from investigating the scene further as a result you stop investigating the bedroom but you dont stop probing the events of that night and when you decide to bring in professionals to search the bedroom for more evidence dr kirkland changes his story yet again this time to a truth so horrifying that no onenot even youwould want to reveal it to anyone outside your family in that version he takes the blame for killing your father but he also does something else cat he lays the blame for your sexual abuse on your father i feel a strange buzzing in my head with it comes an almost frantic desire for alcohol go on are you sure you want me to i think you know where im going just talk michael quickly the only evidence you have that your father abused you is your grandfathers word if you discount that what evidence is there hearsay about your fathers extramarital love life some possible brutality in vietnam i swallow hard and wait for michael to continue you do have a long history of psychological symptoms and behavior consistent with patients whove suffered past sexual abuse you dont have direct evidence as to who abused you soim just asking a question cat why should you believe that your grandfathers latest version of the truth is any more true than his first story because it feels right i say softly i wish it didnt but it does its like i can almost see it in my mind the two men fighting over my bed in the dark im afraid that i did see that maybe your grandfather did kill your father as he said but maybe not for the reason he gave you i mean why take his word for it that he caught your father abusing you it could easily have been the other way around maybe your grandfather was the abuser theres something in my throat a hot tightness that wont let any more words pass but im just using logic michael says youre so close to the situation its hard to see past the emotion i dont think anyone could i concede that okay i dont want to believe that my father abused me im desperate to find hope that he didnt but the idea of grandpapa doing it just seems outrageous to me hes like the model of propriety in this town famous for being faithful to his wife you could be making my point for me kirkland didnt need affairs because he relieved his secret drives at home and abusers often appear as paragons of virtue to the community especially in affluent families ive seen that in practice what put this in your head michael was it just the things i told you tonight honestly no ive heard about your grandfather all my life and i cant say i like what ive heard all doctors want to make money but they say kirkland lived for the money the general opinion around here is that he only married your grandmother for her money and social position gossips always say that when a poor boy marries into a rich family and grandpapa doubled the family holdings through shrewd management particularly of the oil michael is filtering all this through some other knowledge i can tell in a neutral tone he says the old docs around here say he did a lot of questionable procedures in his day questionable in what sense i cant keep the defensiveness out of my voice as in unnecessary you know too many appendixes removed that turned out to be normal exploratory surgery for belly pain they say hed cut the gallbladder out of anybody who even looked like he had a stone and a ton of hysterectomies for fibromyomas he did one of those on my mother in fact remember this was the fifties and sixties a surgeon could do just about anything he wanted to back then but they still called your grandfather before a surgical review committee who told you all this i spoke to tom cage last night he stopped referring patients to kirkland for exactly that reason did dr cage say anything about my father yes apparently luke told him a lot about his war experiences tom served in korea so your dad probably felt he was a more sympathetic listener than most what did he tell him tom wouldnt go into specifics with me but he did say he thought your dad was a good soldier and a good man thats really what got me thinking if tom cage thought your dad was a good guy its hard for me to picture him as a child molester im not saying he couldnt have been dr cage may have looked at your dad seen a troubled veteran and blinded himself to other flaws but tom wants you to come talk to him i think you should hear what he has to say i want to god i wish it were morning already im not sleepy at all you wont have to wait long michael reaches out and flicks off the room light after a couple of seconds the window changes from black to blue youve been asleep for six hours dawn is breaking i cant believe it cat theres something else i think i should tell you what your grandfather could be telling the truth about your father abusing you but lying about killing him what do you mean there are other possibilities for the person who pulled the trigger for some reason it takes me a moment to grasp what michael is saying but then i have it my mother i whisper he nods easy to imagine she denies the abuse for several years but then one night she unexpectedly walks in on it maybe shes drunk or stoned on prescription meds they argue she grabs the gun from over the fireplace and kills him with me in the room we dont know that you were in there afterward your grandfather moves lukes body to the rose garden and invents the story of the intruder to protect his daughter if you ask me in that scenario your grandfathers a hero who else could have done it pearlie sure same psychological process as your mothers basically years of denialor maybe even years of conscious knowledgebut then she finally snaps and kills him your grandfather might carry lukes body out to the rose garden to protect a maid whod worked for his family for fifty years she was also your primary caregiver youre right god i understand why everybody freaked out when i started talking about doing a forensic investigation of that bedroom who knows what kind of evidence a team would find in there michael watches me as though he has something else to say but hes silent for some time at length he says i just think you should be aware of what you could find before you go tearing down this road after the truth like pearlie told yousome things its better not to know no i have to know the truth shall make you free thats what dr malik said last night michael shakes his head i wouldnt use malik as a guide for anything and remember those last possibilities only come into play if your father was your abuser if your grandfather was molesting you then your dad caught him in the act and kirkland murdered him to keep him quiet no other option i suddenly feel like i need ten more hours of sleep i have no idea what to do now you need to find out who was actually molesting you forgive the crudeness but my money is on your grandfather something in the tone of michaels voice pushes me to anger youve made your point okay but amateur detective work isnt going to cut it you say my grandfather loved money and did unnecessary surgery to get it thats unethical but what does it have to do with child abuse louise butler told me a story about grandpapa beating a horse half to death that makes me hate him but does it make him a child molester hitler loved animals my dad killed people you know during wartime michael says softly yes but his unit committed atrocities including rape and he had sex with a fifteen or sixteenyearold girl on the island the point is none of this is conclusive i need hard evidence what about your bedroom thats the source of all this it cant tell me what i need to know say i find grandpapas blood and daddys it cant confirm one story or the other what if theres something besides blood in there this gives me pause like semen michael nods wouldnt semen be conclusive if we could get viable dna after all this time yes but semen isnt as resilient as blood over so many years but its possible is the bed the same one you slept in as a child a strange coldness comes over me as i recall my conversation with my mother after i first arrived in natchez no mom had to get rid of the mattress because of urine stains she said i wet the bed a lot as a child but i dont remember that enuresis michael murmurs thats long been linked to sexual abuse sometimes its a cry for help he sits on the end of the bed you have no concrete memories of abuse a hysterical laugh bursts from my throat what does it matter dr malik suggested i have dissociative identity disorder i think kaiser believes that too were talking about multiple personalities for gods sake so what i think i know i may not and the real truth may be locked inside rooms in my head that i cant even get intonot as me michael shakes his head theres something like grief in his eyes is that how you feel that there are parts of your mind you cant reach sometimes but its not really like other rooms or a hidden personality yes i have blackouts yes there are blocks of time i cant account for but im certain thats the drinking not did its more like depth you know i feel that the truth is buried in my mind but its too damned deep its like free diving four hundred feet is the holy grail for a woman i want it so bad but it might as well be the mariana trench i just cant hold my breath that long cant swim that far down my true memories live at four hundred feet and im not strong enough to get there its not a question of strength michael says when you first spoke to me about repressed memories i didnt give much credence to the idea but the more ive read on the internet the more i believe it i was on medline earlier theres a lot of evidence that during severe trauma information is encoded in an entirely different way than at other times theyve found physiological changes in the amygdalae of people with severe ptsd apparently the neurotransmitters get all out of whack during that kind of trauma and memories get pushed down into holes and blind alleys they only make themselves known when that person finds himselfor herselfin a similar situation to the one in which the trauma occurred child abuse victims having sex as adults say or combat veterans walking near a car that backfires or under a news helicopter that flies too low those triggers bring back the emotions that were experienced during the trauma but not necessarily the memories themselves thats called body memory its fascinating really ive definitely experienced that especially during sex what was tonights nightmare about i close my eyes and the vision is there as though engraved on the backs of my eyelids i relate the dream of the truck the pond and daddy walking on water michael shakes his head im no expert on dream interpretation but walking on water is definitely a christ image does dr goldman interpret that kind of thing sometimes im sick of talking about all this michael i want to do something i know forgive my amateur detective work but im sorry about that im just really antsy im getting a little crazy just a couple of questions hurry what was your fathers childhood like they were country people he grew up out at cranfield his dad was a welder he got killed on an oil rig in the gulf of mexico i think daddy was nine when it happened he was raised by his mother for a while but she died of lung cancer when he was eleven one of his uncles took him in any other kids in that home i see where hes going now i think so yes siblings in the original home two older brothers they were split between a couple of uncles homes the brothers were never close later what about your grandfathers childhood i shake my head the stuff of legend both his parents were killed on the way to his baptism headon collision with a truck grandpapa was thrown clear he actually landed in a patch of clover not even a broken bone youre kidding he used to say that his mother saw what was going to happen and threw him out of the window before they hit the truck but thats bullshit who raised him his grandfather in east texas and grandmother i shake my head the grandfather was a widower michael nods thoughtfully any other children in that home one girl i think she was my grandfathers aunt but she wasnt much older than he was how did she turn out i dont know she died when i was young michael folds his arms and sits silently for a while did your mother ever remarry after your dad died no why not she was whatthirty twentynine she dated some but nobody was ever good enough whose opinion was that hers yours your grandfathers probably grandpapas every man in town was intimidated by him what about your aunt you said shes bipolar severely manicdepressive the whole package alcoholic shoplifting charges promiscuity three failed marriages a great role model for me all that could be a flag for sexual abuse in her past it could i say in a taut voice but bipolarity has a genetic component my grandfathers father was supposedly bipolar the one killed in the car wreck and im cyclothymic so all that could just be our genes not abuse michael is about to speak again when my cell phone begins vibrating on the nightstand he picks up the phone and shows me the screen its the same new orleans number that called last night i press send agent kaiser yes hello cat sorry to bother you so early why is he calling me he probably found out that it was malik i was talking to last night and not sean what is it now i have some information for you its probably going to be a shock so skip the vaseline okay what happened a couple of things first we learned last night that nathan malik didnt pay all his own bail on the murder charge i dont understand a milliondollar bail meant that malik had to come up with a hundred thousand in cash and the rest in collateral on paper he looked fairly wealthy so when he put up his house across lake pontchartrain we didnt look too closely at the cash but your friend sean had a talk with the bail bondsman last nightjust rechecking details turns out that most of the hundred thousand was paid by someone else who your aunt ann hilgard chapter i feel like im in a falling elevator the basement rushing up beneath my legs the idea that my aunt would pay nathan maliks bail seems utterly beyond belief you have to be wrong no mistake says kaiser ann hilgard n√£e kirkland resident of biloxi mississippi two hours from new orleans she brought the bail bondsman a briefcase filled with cash my mouth is open but i cant form words the implications of kaisers revelation are too enormous to grasp why didnt sean call me about this thats probably something you should ask him no thanks i only learned that she was your aunt a few minutes ago cat ann desalle kirkland daughter of william kirkland sister of gwendolyn desalle kirkland ferry maternal aunt of catherine desalle ferry forensic odontologist is your aunt a patient of dr maliks is that why you have a special relationship with him if she is i hadnt a clue until ten seconds ago shes definitely got the history for it confirmed bipolar disorder going back three decades a string of bad marriages my god i breathe no wonder malik knows things about me jesus christ were trying to locate your aunt kaiser says but were not having any luck shes apparently involved in a bitter divorce her husband says she hasnt been living at home for the past couple of weeks i saw her in natchez yesterday she was i trail off remembering the manic gleam in anns eye what kaiser asks she was what borrowing money from my grandfather bail money maybe talking to my mother about her marital problems you said you had a couple of things to tell me what else we just found one of nathan maliks patients in a coma on the floor of her apartment in metairie male or female kaiser answers softly female her name was margaret lavigne twentyseven years old she lives about three minutes away from you was it the same crime signature two gunshots with bite marks no this was a suicide attempt we only found her because wed got her name from the psychologist who referred her to malik you mean she wasnt on the patient list malik gave you exactly he never really obeyed the court order maliks voice sounds in my mind theyre part of a very special group an experimental group women only i formed it after years of watching conventional therapy approaches fail i chose patients who were at the stage where the eruption of delayed memories was beginning to destroy their lives my experimental group is called group x what kind of suicide attempt i ask trying to keep my voice even how did it happen we sent two agents over there to talk to her they saw lavigne through her bedroom window lying in a pool of vomit shed given herself a massive dose of insulin a lot of suicides try insulin because it offers hope of a painless death but usually all they manage to do is turn themselves into vegetables i researched and discounted this method long ago did she leave a note she did you ready for this come on damn it it reads may god forgive me an innocent man is dead please tell dr malik to stop it i couldnt reach him what do you make of that please tell dr malik to stop it im trying to put it together i had a head start on you i think your friend malik has been executing child molesters cat i think he listened to his patients recount their horrors for one too many years he finally snapped and decided to do something about it i cant say i blame him i snapped myself for almost the same reason but we cant let dr malik go around removing criminals from the planet without benefit of trial do you agree of course if youre right kaiser says nothing for a few moments the trouble with vigilante justice is that eventually an innocent person gets lynched ms lavignes note is telling us thats just what happened i wonder what malik will do when he hears that do you think hell turn himself in i dont know youre still speculating why did lavignes note say tell malik to stop it rather than simply stop well probably never know was margaret lavigne related to any of our victims not by blood but i think youll find this interesting ms lavignes biological father was arrested just before her suicide attempt and charged with multiple counts of distributing child pornography interesting timing no he broke down under questioning and confessed to several incidents of sexually abusing children then his daughter tried to kill herself im not sure i understand are you saying you think hes a potential target of our killer kaiser laughs drily he may be now but remember victim number three tracy nolan the cpa ill never forget him i had my first panic attack at the nolan crime scene tracy nolan was margaret lavignes stepfather holy god lavigne told someone her stepfather abused her and that person murdered him bingo says kaiser then it turns out that her real father was the molester jesus i think ms lavigne was sexually abused as a child kaiser says she repressed her memories of these events dr malik tried to help her recall those events and she did only she made a mistake about who the molester was i mean wouldnt most kids prefer to think their stepfather raped them rather than their father all i can think about is group x and maliks groundbreaking treatment protocols what the hell did malik do to those women or convince them to do cat are you there yes have you talked to dr malik since we last spoke i want to tell kaiser the truththat i talked to malik and that he denied committing the murdersbut until i know exactly how aunt ann is involved with him im not saying a word if i knew the identity of anyone in group x i would but i dont look i cant talk to you anymore right now ive got to find my aunt she could be in real danger help us find her cat well protect her if you need my help to find her you cant protect her shes bipolar john do you have any idea what that means shes tried to kill herself twice that i know about malik has obviously been manipulating her can you imagine what kind of stress she must be under she could be with malik now for all we know yes she could so listen to me those two patients of maliks who were related to the victimsrivieres daughter and legendres niece what about them ask them about something called group x group x whats that a therapy group i think they might have been part of it thats all i know that could help you right now i have to go wait how do you know that did malik tell you about it im sorry john i click end and almost leap out of bed startling michael to his feet chapter what happened michael asks you look like youre going to faint my aunt ann paid nathan maliks bail he shakes his head in disbelief she must be a patient of maliks thats how malik knows so much about me and my family michaels eyes are bright with excitement if your aunt is a patient of maliks hes almost certainly treating her for sexual abuse that means your grandfather is the one who molested you not necessarily malik also treats people for bipolar disorder exclusively or bipolar people whove also been sexually abused exclusively i think bipolarity ptsd and sexual abuse separate categories may i use your phone sure did your cell phone die no but i dont want the fbi to hear this call michael looks at me for several seconds in silence are you calling malik im going to leave him a message yes are you okay with that he goes out into the hall and brings back a cordless phone as long as you dont do anything to risk your life even as i nod i decide to tell michael nothing about margaret lavignes suicide attempt or her note when i dial the number malik gave me last night an automated voice instructs me to leave a message at the tone this is catherine ferry ive just learned that my aunt paid your bail im assuming shes a patient of yours youve been dishonest with me doctor id like to talk to you as soon as possible you can reach me at i look up at michael whats this number michael rattles off his number and i repeat it into the machine if you dont return my call within an hour im telling the fbi everything youve told me to date goodbye i hang up michaels phone pick up my cell and scroll through the digital phone book when i reach aunt ann i press send a recording says were sorry but the cingular customer youre trying to reach is unavailable or has traveled outside the service area you may leave a voice mail at the tone when the beep comes i say ann this is cat im sure a lot of people are trying to get hold of you right now im not trying to bother you your life is your own but i know about you and dr malik ive talked to him and i know why you like him i have no desire to hurt him or to help anyone else hurt him all im asking is for you to call me back you dont have to tell me anything you dont want to god knows if anyone can relate to how you feel right now its me mood swings are my life i promise i wont tell mom or grandpapa anything and i wont talk to the fbi in fact id like to talk to you about grandpapa also about daddy im trying to figure something out about my childhood and i have a feeling you can help me thanks please please call back michael is staring at me like a doctor now as though trying to decide whether i might be in a manic state myself im tempted to call my mother and ask if she knows where ann is but i know better all that would accomplish is to put my mother into a panic if ann wants to disappear no one in the family will be able to find her shes had too much practice what can i do asks michael you already did it you gave me a place to stay now i have to make some decisions how stable is your aunt two suicide attempts one in college and one in her late thirties if my mother called in the next five minutes and told me ann was dead i wouldnt be shocked jesus yeah she was obsessed with having a baby but she never could get pregnant outrageous mood swings her livers pickled in gin what was that other stuff this kaiser told you did they find another murder victim i hesitate i cant tell you about that no offense but the task force is obsessive about secrecy michael looks suspicious last night i clearly broke every possible rule of confidentiality in my discussions with him so why am i being cat before i can answer michaels phone rings the id reads unknown caller i show it to him may i answer it he nods this is dr ferry hello catherine i nod at michael and silently mouth malik what kind of fucking game have you been playing with me doctor youve been acting like you have esp diagnosing my problems and hinting things about my family the truth is you had the facts all along from ann didnt you he takes his time before answering yes and no oh for gods sake cut the shit will you such a potty mouth catherine what does dr goldman make of that my heart stutters did i tell ann the name of my therapist wheres my aunt doctor i have no idea is she with you no why did she pay your bail i asked her to i was short of cash and i knew she could get the money you are one unethical son of a bitch were you treating ann for problems related to sexual abuse or for bipolar disorder you know thats confidential bullshit you break the rules when you want to and hide behind them when you dont we need to talk catherine i dont have much time now we need to meet facetoface i close my eyes tell me about margaret lavigne margaret butwhat about her she tried to kill herself with a massive dose of insulin last night shes in a coma now but she left a note implicating you in the murders the silence on the line is absolute youre lying you know im not what did the note say something like god forgive me an innocent man is dead please tell dr malik to stop it oh my god his voice is a ragged whisper margarets biological father was arrested yesterday on child abuse charges stranger still her stepfather was one of our five victims in new orleans does any of this ring a bell maliks breathing fast and shallow do we still need to meet doctor or are you going to turn yourself in i cantthis is beyond belief we absolutely must meet i could never have imagined nathan malik sounding this agitated did you kill those men in new orleans doctor no i swear that to you but you know who did i cant tell you that you have to tell someone no i dont was my aunt in group x doctor i cant answer that is my grandfathers life in danger i cant talk to you about that not over the phone you expect me to meet you in person when you could be the killer you have nothing to fear from me catherine you know that for some reason i believe him but im not crazy will you turn yourself in if i meet you his breathing stops for several moments i can picture him standing somewhere utterly still if you promise to keep my film safe for me i will where do you want to meet it has to be new orleans im afraid are you in natchez yes where in new orleans i cant tell you this far ahead can you be here in four hours i could be call the number i gave you when youre five miles outside the city ill tell you where to go no matter what logic tells me i cant refuse him all right and cat yes if you bring the fbi with you youll regret it i dont want to threaten you but i have to protect myself im the only one who can tell you certain things about yourself and if i dont youll never know the truth goodbye wait i know youre nervous about meeting me but im not dangerous to you do you know why because i know the evil in myself when we were talking about abuse the other day i had to censor myself the fbi was listening after all the main thing i left out was the pleasure of it a cold tingle races along my back the pleasure yes maliks voice takes on a snakelike sibilance what we call sexual abuse is a very intense experience for both offender and victim the offender experiences absolute power over another human being while the victim experiences absolute surrender absolute submission the partners occupy the extremes of control and helplessness these experiences are imprinted for life catherine and the first thing a sexualized child wants to do when it grows in strength is to reverse those roles to experience control you know what im talking about dont you i dont answer but my mind has already filled with memories of my sexual past things i wanted to dosometimes did doto men and things i wanted done to me so often my fantasies were about control abandoning or possessing it all my pleasure was tied up in that your silence is enough malik says his voice hypnotic all my life ive had to fight that urge it took years to master but i know my enemy now its a poison that propagates through generations like a bad gene it lives within me as it does in all the others whove survived those experiences eradicating that poison is my obsession now my personal war ive got to go now catherine call me when youre five miles outside new orleans the phone clicks hes gone youre not meeting that guy alone michael says firmly maliks words and tone are still spinning in my head youre not coming with me michael if im not someone else is you should call the fbi right now and tell them everything and i mean everything thats not an option not yet malik knows things i have to know and if i bring in the fbi now i never will ill be this fuckedup for the rest of my life is that what you want his eyes bore into mine with startling intensity i want you alive not dead i nod slowly sean regan is that your married boyfriend yes but that has nothing to do with anything sean is trained for this kind of thing he can protect me and i can trust him to keep quiet about this michael looks sad but i cant take time to deal with his emotions now can i still use your expedition sure thanks i need to go to malmaison before i leave for new orleans michael reaches out and takes me by the shoulders his grip is amazingly strong do you promise to take sean with you to meet malik even as i make the promise i know its a lie but i dont need michael freaking out and calling the fbi about this meeting he could give them the plate number of his expedition and id never even reach new orleans whats at malmaison he asks i need some clothes another lie what i need from malmaison is something thats always been there in abundance a gun chapter dawn has only just broken but the ground floor of malmaison is lit up as though for a royal court party i saw the yellow dome of light as i jogged through the trees from michaels house in brookwood following the old trail i beat with my own feet so long ago pearlies lights are on too my audi is parked beside pearlies cadillac not far away stands a tall white pickup truck like the ones used on the islandthe kind that tried to run me over someone on the island must have found my car and brought it back but if thats the case why doesnt grandpapa have the police scouring the countryside for me or my corpse and why didnt someone call my cell phone after circling around to the yellowflooded front lawn i stop and check the phone the call log shows three calls from my grandfathers number with the phone set to vibrate only i slept through them and in my shock over the calls after i awakened i failed to notice the misses the last call probably came around the time i was having my nightmare i press and listen to the messages catherine this is grandpapa his voice is resonant even in the tinny cellphone speaker henry found your car across the channel from the island there was no sign of you louise butler says you set out on a bike for the bridge but no one knows whether you made it or not please call me if you get this if youre hurt or in trouble dont worry ive got the sheriffs departments on both sides of the river combing the banks and roads for you and jesses got a dozen men searching the island if youve had an accident help is coming quick call me please hearing the concern in my grandfathers voice almost brings tears to my eyes his next message says its me again if youre in any other kind of troublethat is if there are other people involvedthen let them hear this message this is dr william kirkland speaking if youre from anywhere around the part of the country where you found my granddaughter then you know my name and you know youve made a mistake if you release her immediately ill look no further into the matter but if you hurt that girlby god you wont live one day past the day i find you and i will find you you ask around youd rather have the hounds of hell on your trail than me and thats a fact my skin is crawling the voice that spoke to my unknown abductors was that of an avenging angel deathly cold and crackling with violence so certain of itself that nothing could stand against it its the voice of the man who hunted down the escaped convicts on the island all those years ago on his third call my grandfather left no message at all looking up at the floodlit face of malmaison im more sure than ever that i dont want to see anyone inside not grandpapa not even pearlie thats why i came on foot if i pulled up in michaels expedition id be seen and questioned by everyone at home my chances of discreetly getting a gun from my grandfathers safe would be greatly reduced but this way i trot to the far end of the mansions east wing where theres hardly any light most of these rooms are closed except during spring pilgrimage ive known since the eighth grade that the lock on one window here can be slipped with a credit card i used to sneak in this way to raid my grandfathers liquor cabinet today i have no credit cardi left my purse in my car on the islandbut michael lent me an expired drivers license to do the job judging by the picture on it he was about seventy pounds heavier when the license was issued i press the license steadily between the panels of the tall french windows they part slightly and the laminated license easily flips the lock as i climb through the heavy draperies i smell the scent of mothballs most of the furniture in this wing is covered with white slipcovers i feel as though im walking through a deserted museum in the hallway i smell bacon frying i move quickly to my grandfathers study the room patterned after napol√£ons library the door is standing open and the desk lamp is on but the room is empty the gun safe is quite large big enough to hold the architectural model he showed me the other day plus his collection of rifles shotguns and pistols the combination lock is easy to openits my birthday four clicks left eight clicks right seventythree left then turn the handle i freeze once as i turn the dial sure that i heard footsteps in the hall but no one appears when i turn the handle the heavy steel door opens the casino model is gone but the guns are there five rifles three shotguns and several handguns lying in holsters on the floor of the safe the scent of gun oil is strong but theres something else too burnt gunpowder one by one i pull the rifles from their slots and sniff the barrels the first two gleam in the light their barrels clean but the third has recently been fired holding the weapon in my hands i turn it in the light its a boltaction remington scarred from use but well maintained as i stare my pulse begins to race i killed a deer with this rifle when i was a girl but thats not why my heart is pounding im holding the rifle that killed my father as a child i asked my grandfather several times to get rid of this gun but he never did he saw no reason to get rid of a good gun for sentimental reasons knowing what i know now about what he did with this rifleor at least the story he told meit surprises me that he would keep it was it a trophy like the weatherby he used to bring down his bull elk in alaska but more important who fired it in the last couple of days i dont have time to speculate replacing the rifle i grab an automatic pistol from the bottom of the safe nothing big or fancy just a walther ppk we used for target practice on the island the black handgun looks wet and dangerous under the light ejecting the clip i see that its fully loaded id like some extra ammunition but i dont see any and i dont have time to look besides if six rounds isnt enough to get me out of whatever scrape i get into with malik another six probably wouldnt save me either closing the door to the safe it strikes me as odd that a man would leave so many guns accessible to a teenage girl who he knew suffered from depression grandpapa even used my birthday for the combination for gods sake what was he thinking but thengrandpapa never saw depression as an illness only a weakness maybe he figured that if i wasnt strong enough to resist the temptation to kill myself i didnt deserve to live back in the hall something stops me faint voices floating on the air grandpapa first then pearlie maybe billy neal though im not sure then a richer warmer voice chimes in it has a submissive tone like the voice of a laborer in his employers house the warm voice belongs to henry the black man who drove me across the bridge to the island yesterday hes talking about finding my audi this morning and how it threw him into a panic hes worried that i fell into the river and drowned like my grandmother grandpapa says i might die a lot of ways but drowning wont be one of them then he thanks henry for bringing back the car and bids him goodbye heavy footsteps sound on the hardwood a screen door slams someone speaks and i recognize the careless voice of billy neal for sure maybe she hitched a ride with somebody he says why the hell would she do that grandpapa snaps her goddamn car was sitting right there with a spare set of keys in a magnetic case under the bumper who do you think put those keys there the audi dealer maybe boy have you got an ounce of brains in your head catherine put those keys there thats the kind of girl she is maybe the car wouldnt start it started right up for henry this morning maybe shes still on the island then maybe the bridge got covered over before she left get the hell out of here bellows my grandfather dont come back till you start making some sense that girl knows how to take care of herself i want to know what happened down there ive got enough to worry about with the casino project government questioning every goddamn thing on the applications dna tests on threehundredyearold teeth jesus get out of here more footsteps and the door slams again what do you think pearlie asks grandpapa i move closer to the door close enough to hear pearlie sigh am i paid to think she asks i asked your opinion where is she wheres my grandbaby im afraid somebody done hurt that girl dr kirkland like you said she knows how to take care of herself and she wouldnt leave that car behind without a good reason she might if she went into one of her manic states what you call her spells last time i saw her says pearlie she looked more down than up to me no if louise put her on a bicycle then somebody followed her she never made it to that bridge who would do that asks grandpapa id ask that trash you got working for you where he was yesterday evening the silence stretches for some time you think billy followed her down there do you know where he was yesterday doing some business for me in baton rouge picking up some things for me way i remember it that island aint far off the highway to baton rouge more silence what would billy want with catherine youd know more about that than i would pearlies voice carries a sharp rebuke what does any man want with any woman grandpapa makes a rumbling noise ill talk to him the screen door bangs again i step into the kitchen pearlie is standing at the sink her back to me she lifts an iron skillet and turns on the tap then freezes slowly she turns and her eyes go wide dont say anything i whisper not a word she nods silently im leaving town pearlie are my extra keys in here she glances at the counter the springloaded audi key is lying on top of some mail i grab it and return to the doorway where you going girl pearlie asks i have to meet someone i want you to tell me something first though what somebody did some bad things to me when i was a little girl a man it was either daddy or grandpapa and i dont see how you could have taken care of me for so longyou did my mothers job reallywithout knowing about that i just dont pearlie glances at the outside door but her expression doesnt change you wont tell me i ask her face tightens in what looks like anger listen to me child what you doing running down to the island stirring things up what good you think you gonna do is any good gonna come from all this for you for your mama for anybody i dont have any choice i have to know how and why daddy died and i have to know why im the way i am you dont understand that she looks at the floor the lord works in mysterious ways thats what i understand theres a lot of pain in this worldespecially if you born a girlbut it aint for us to question all that we just got to deal with it as best we can do you really believe that pearlie her gaze returns to me her eyes more intense than ever i got to believe it thats the only thing got me this far what do you mean this far to this house this job working for my grandfather indignation comes into pearlies face she speaks in a quavering voice i work for this family not dr kirkland i came to work for old mr desalle in when i was seventeen years old your grandmama your mama youyoure all desalles i worked for all of you dr kirkland just the man who signs my check is that all he is pearlie isnt he the man who says what goes hasnt he always been she nods somberly theres always a man who says what goes thats what people mean when they talk about the man and round here dr kirkland be the man everybody knows that now you gonna tell him you all right or not you can tell him after im gone im about to turn and go when something michael said comes back to me accompanied by a fragmentary image from my dreamsthe black figure fighting over my bed with my father did you pull the trigger that night pearlie the whites of the old womans eyes grow large have you lost your mind child what you think youre saying did you kill my father thats what im asking you did you kill him to protect me from him she shakes her head slowly where you going in that car to find out the truth about this family where you gonna find that dont worry about it but when i find it ill let you know and then you can pretend you didnt know all along pearlie opens her mouth as if to speak but no sound emerges i shake my head then turn and run back up the hallway i expected to find billy neal and my grandfather talking behind the house but theres no sign of them glancing around the parking lot i move quickly to the audi flicking the electric unlock button as i go as i grab the door handle billy neal rises from behind pearlies cadillac hes wearing black jeans a green silk shirt and snakeskin cowboy boots his eyes are as dead as the snakes that adorn his boots but they lock onto mine with mechanical precision ill be damned he says a lot of people think youre dead is that what you thought a faint smile plays across his lips i gave it even money why do you hate me billy you dont even know me he walks up to the audi and stares at me over the roof oh i know you ive fucked girls just like you pampered princesses trust fund waiting never had to worry a day in their damn lives and still you blow half your money going to shrinks why do you care he lays his forearms on the roof and leans toward me cause you think your shit dont stink you look in my direction and you dont even see me in the daytime anyway but at night its a different story isnt it at night im just the guy youre looking for ive heard about you miss cat in the hat you like to party dont you people still remember you from high school the rich girl who loved to have fun they still remember your aunt too same story only worse exactly what do you do for my grandfather things hes too old to do himself now things other people are squeamish about billy lights a cigarette and blows smoke across the roof at me i aint squeamish ill bet have you fired the remington from the gun safe lately a bemused smile youre a sneaky little piece arent you suddenly ive had all i can take from this greaseslick urban cowboy you know what im tired of your act i think we ought to bring my grandfather into this conversation billys smile only broadens and i know ive made a mistake thats what i was thinking too youve been pissing him off quite a bit lately hes moving heaven and earth to save this town with that casino and youre busting your ass trying to smear the family name he doesnt appreciate that at all you could ruin the whole deal in fact so lets go talk to him i open the audis door i have to go somewhere first ill be back in twenty minutes before i can hit the lock button billy yanks open the passenger door and puts a boot on the seat not twenty minutes from now now without thinking about it i reach behind my back yank the walther from the waistband of my pants and aim it over the roof at his chest this isnt a pellet gun billy in case you were wondering his eyes focus on the barrel of the gun and his smile begins to fade billy neal probably carries a gun more often than not but i dont think he expected to find himself in this situation before seven in the morning now i say quietly take your fucking boot off my seat and back away from the car youre one crazy bitch he says laughing softly i heard you were but i didnt believe it until now or last night on the island the smile returns dont know what youre talking about oh i think you do you and me are gonna have some fun one of these days honey like i said i know about you incest is best right the blood drains from my face what does he know about me i want to ask but i know hell only torture me any way he can get away from my fucking car i yell brandishing the gun billy doesnt move you havent chambered a round theres already one in the pipe im only quoting jargon ive heard from sean but its enough to wipe the last of the smile from billys face his boot slides back across the seat and down to the gravel shut the door i order when he does i reach down with my free hand and hit the lock button then i climb in close the door and start the engine before i can pull away billy leans down to the passenger window he makes a peace sign with his fingers reverses it then lays the v over his lips and flicks his tongue up and down between his fingers my stomach does a slow roll id love to shoot him but id never make my meeting with malik if i did instead i put the car in gear and spray the asshole with gravel as i peel away from the slave quarters i once called home chapter my drive to new orleans isnt filled with thoughts of nathan malik but of my aunt ann though ive never spent much time with her she has left a deep impression ann is the beauty of the familyno small feat considering my mothers looksand she was an overachiever until her second year of college head cheerleader and valedictorian in high school winner of the local junior miss pageant full music scholarship to tulane named queen of the natchez confederate pageant in her sophomore year of college then she entered a profound depression and tried to kill herself with an overdose of pills grandpapa had her committed and when she was released two months later everyoneincluding annacted as though she had miraculously been healed she wasnt but that breakdown happened before i was born i knew ann as the life of every family gatheringthose she attended anyway though four years older than my mother ann always seemed a decade younger she knew clothes like nobody else her body was built for fashion she could make offtherack stuff look like haute couture in photos dating from the seventieswhen she was just out of high schoolshe has the athletic body of a sports illustrated swimsuit model but by the mideighties she was cadaverously thin and in snapshots from that period her eyes have the glaze i usually attribute to cocaine whatever the source of her energy ann was something no one else in the desalle family ever quite managed to becool she taught me how to dance how to dress how to wear makeup she caught me smoking my first cigarettestolen from her packand shared it with me she gave me pointers on french kissing and told me how to get rid of guys whose attention i didnt want she advised me always to have a guy waiting in the wingseven if i was marriedbecause the guy you were with could and probably would betray you keeping another guy on a string wasnt cheating on your steady beau she said it was just looking out for yourself and that i figured was the way cool girls worked it but coolness doesnt age well as i got older i overheard my mother getting calls at all hours of the night and sometimes leaving to drive hundreds of miles to rescue ann who by this timei later learnedhad been diagnosed with bipolar disorder riding the highs of manic episodes she would disappear for weeks at a time once the mexican police found her working as a waitress in a tijuana bar thanks to an international search my grandfather had initiated ive often wondered if waitress was a euphemism for what ann was really doing when they found her in that bar but what i remember most about ann was her obsession with having a baby at times this fixation seemed the root of her mental illness because i left home for college at sixteen i missed many of the travails of her quest for infertility treatment all i know is that nothing ever panned out and the fault lies with her not her first two husbands only a teenager on speed could keep up with her during her manic periods and no onenot even my mothercan stand to be with her when shes in the pit of depression its so unfair really i had no desire to become pregnant yet im carrying a child in my womb ann was desperate to conceive but it never happened what brought her to nathan maliks door was it bipolar disorder or emerging memories of sexual abuse if malik will stop playing games with me i could have my answer in ninety minutes the sign for angola penitentiary flashes past on my right i usually think of the island when i see that sign think of it and then shut the memories away but today the image that comes to me will not be banished its the oneroom clinic where grandpapa treats the black families who live on the island the clinic where tenyearold ann had her emergency appendectomy a legend in our family the story is always the same even in its details a storm washes away the bridge and the boatsann suddenly develops a hot appendixgrandpapa and ivy work by the light of a coleman lantern ann has a severe infection but she survives and the crowd of laborers standing watch outside cheers in jubilation yet today a new and terrible connection closes in my brain what if anns problem wasnt her appendix what if my grandfather had been molesting her could he have gotten her pregnant is it possible that the emergency appendectomy was actually an abortion my god if it was an abortionand he somehow botched the procedurecould that have been what ruined anns chances for conception in later life before speculating any further i dial michael wellss cell phone cat he says the sound of a car radio in the background yes can you hear me i have a medical question for you i hear you fine shoot how young can a girl get pregnant michael turns down his radio thats a pretty broad question pregnancy in twelveyearolds is relatively common in mississippi but whats the youngest a girl can conceive the youngest well im not an ob but pediatricians classify precocious puberty as secondary signsthats breast tissue and pubic hairappearing before age eight in africanamerican girls and nine in whites youre kidding no but they cant conceive at those ages im not saying its never happened why do you ask im wondering if my aunt ann could have gotten pregnant at age ten michael says nothing for a few moments youre thinking your grandfather impregnated her maybe and im thinking that emergency appendectomy on the island might not have been an appendectomy at all wow that would prove hes the one all right theres a pause then michael says when would this have happened i do some quick math like no way no pregnancy at ten years old the average age of onset of menses has been declining steadily for decades today maybe one in a million that young in forget it i see your line of reasoning but i think youre into the twilight zone with this theory i dont know whether i feel relieved or not im sure youre right my minds just spinning with all this ann hasnt called you back yet no how far are you from new orleans ninety miles youre taking sean with you to see malik right right dont worry michael really im going to worry until you call me and tell me the meeting is over and youre okay his concern brings a smile to my face ill definitely call you okay okay bye for now bye i take the audi off cruise control and accelerate to eightyfive faces swirl endlessly through my mind like a m√£bius stripmy grandfather ann my mother and father billy neal jesse and louisebut speculation as to their true relationships is meaningless in less than two hours ill be facetoface with the man who can tell me the exact nature of his relationship with my troubled aunt and probably the identity of the man who molested me at this point thats all i care about malik instructed me to telephone him when i was five miles outside new orleans but i didnt do it instead i pulled off i at williams boulevard one of the first exits at kennerthe westernmost suburb of new orleansand drove to a liquor store ive been inside once but i didnt buy anything i stood staring at the bottles of grey goose peering at the blueandwhite image of geese flying over the french alps i know that bottle like i know my own face the french flag the frosted glass the blue cap my right hand rose to a milliliter bottle as though commanded by a hypnotist but at the last moment i turned and hurried out of the store now im sitting in my parked car in front of the store my cell phone cradled in my shaking hands the cashier probably thinks im casing the place for a robbery or maybe shes seen her share of recovering alcoholics fighting the same impulse its not the physical withdrawal thats making me shake now its malik i promised michael i would take sean with me to the meeting but i havent called him i wont be seeing sean again i dont think i need him for this anyway the odds that dr malik wants to hurt me are very low and i am armed what has me shaking is the possibility of finally learning the truth about myself whatever malik knows it will irrevocably change my perception of myself but thats what you came for right says a voice in my head with a soft curse i get out walk to the pay phone beside the liquor store and punch in the number malik told me to call it rings four times but just as i think its going to click over to voice mail he answers catherine yes are you five miles out no im parked in front of a liquor store on williams boulevard are you near the airport yes good im in a motel a mile away from it the thibodeaux its a dump with an orange sign about a mile past the airport turn on the right do you think you can find it i think ive seen it before all the rooms are on the ground floor im in room eighteen should i just pull up to the room yes ill be watching for you i start to hang up but i sense that hes waiting for something dr malik yes do you know who abused me yes and no shit still playing games with me youre the one who knows that answer catherine remember what i told you about trauma the memory is repressed but intact its indelible its waiting for you to dredge it up and im going to help you today today in a few minutes im going to take you across the river lethe to the underworld then im going to lead you back to the world of light when you return youll be whole again youll have your soul back your memory too my palms are cold and coated with sweat maliks words have not lessened my anxiety but increased it dont be afraid catherine are you on your way yeah are you drinking stone fucking sober he chuckles softly ill see you when you get here the phone goes dead i take a last look at the door of the liquor storewe card everybodythen get back in my car and start the engine before i back out of the lot though i open my purse take out my bottle of valium and roll one yellow pill into my damp palm with my left hand on my tummy i whisper forgive me baby girl just one more and dryswallow the pill then i back out and join the stream of traffic headed toward the airport malik was right the thibodeaux motel is a dump a low strip of rooms with a sagging roof and a row of bright orange doors three vehicles in the parking lot all wrecks i park four doors down from room eighteen and get out the air stinks of aviation fuel and fast food theres plenty of traffic on williams but if i hold the walther along my right leg its almost invisible a roars low overhead as i walk toward the door raising my left hand to knock i hear the sound of rain sweeping toward me it can rain without a moments notice in new orleans but today the asphalt is baking in bright sunlight its my hallucination againrain on a tin roof the rattling sound is louder than the cars passing on the road thirty yards away screw it the end of that hallucination is on the other side of this door i chamber a round in the walther then knock hard on the orange door it moves inward a few inches with the force of my blow dr malik no reply now i wish id called sean this is where pride gets you bringing my gun to chest level i kick open the door and rush into the room checking the corners for threats the room looks just as i imagined it ratty green carpet two double beds a tv on a stand a lavatory beneath a mirror on the far wall no malik i cross the room and kick open the bathroom door the walther extended in front of me malik is lying in the bathtub hes fully clothedall in black of courseand the white tiles above his bald head are spattered with blood and brain matter my initial shock balloons into terror when i realize the blood is still running down the tile whoever killed malik could still be close by as i whirl back toward the room the gun in maliks right hand registers in my mind suicide i cant believe that but then i see the skull in his lap its a human skull entirely stripped of flesh boiled clean like the skulls used to teach orthopedics malik is cradling it in his hands as he might an infant springs and screws hold the mandible to the maxilla and the arteries and veins have been painted in red and blue across the white plates of bone the skull wears the slightly ironic grin of all its kind but this particular skull i sense is trying to tell me something theres a reason its here and it wants me to know it i look at maliks face for some clue but he cant even help himself now the psychiatrists once piercing eyes are as dead as those in a stuffed deer head as i stare searching in vain for some explanation maliks chest heaves violently and his head flies forward as if pulled on a string the walther jerks in my hand the bathroom booms like a bombtesting chamber everything goes white chapter im snowblind lost in a sea of white my head pounds incessantly from the cold far in the distance someone calls my name dr ferry catherine the voice is familiar but i cant see anyone the wind stings my face a flash of darkness spears through the white and then dirtyyellow light frames a blurry face dr ferry can you hear me yesover here cat its john kaiser special agent john kaiser it is its john kaiser his hazel eyes hover only inches over mine what happened i ask i dont know were hoping you can tell us blinking rapidly against the yellow light i try to see who we is and where i am i seem to be propped against a bathtub my hips beneath a commode my legs splayed out in an open doorway theres a paramedic behind kaiser and behind him i see the dark face of carmen piazza commander of the nopd homicide division piazza looks angry are you wounded kaiser asks they cant find any injuries but you were unconscious my head hurts how did you get here dont worry about that how did you get here i turn to make sure maliks corpse is still lying in the tub behind me it is dr malik wanted me to meet him here i came jesus mutters captain piazza did you hear that did you fucking hear that kaiser shakes his head did malik try to kill you cat no i almost say aloud but fortunately my common sense has survived whatever happened to me i want a lawyer kaiser looks disappointed do you need a lawyer i dont know can you promise not to arrest me he glances back at piazza then looks at me again you know i cant do that then i want a lawyer he stands and tells the paramedic to check me out while that happens i hear someone clearing people from the murder scene then i hear captain piazzas voice low and furious while kaiser tries to mollify her with a sonorous baritone can you walk asks kaiser hes standing in the door again i think so then walk with me i get to my feet and after a last look at malik and the skull in his lap follow agent kaiser into the parking lot that skull is bothering me but i dont have time to ponder it now the parking lot that was empty before is nearly full with nopd squad cars an ambulance a coroners wagon and unmarked detectives cars kaiser walks me about twenty yards along the row of rooms far enough so that no one will hear us listen to me cat i came to this scene directly from another one our unsub hit his sixth victim who was it you dont seem surprised we havent caught our killer yet why should he stop you didnt think malik was the killer i wouldnt have come here if i did kaiser studies me for some time i glance back at the room and see piazza talking to two detectives she gestures at me and the detectives both stare in my direction they look like a pair of pit bulls awaiting a command from their master same crime signature on victim six i ask yes two gunshots bite marks the same message on the wall my work is never done but while we were working the scene task force headquarters got a call telling us malik was hiding out here anonymous again yes your caller is your killer john kaiser looks at me like a stern father tell me about group x you didnt learn anything from the two patients you have we dont have them anymore both women disappeared this morning maybe last night i dont know what i dont get is how they knew to run i checked their phone records no one suspicious called them talk to everyone who called them i say realizing that ann may now be the only person who can tell us who the members of group x areother than the women themselves unless maliks documentary can be found could he have had it in the motel room with him were checking everybody kaiser says but you know more than youve told me you keep me out of jail well talk that might not be possible you need me to solve this case whos victim number six john he seems to debate whether to answer then he says a police officer thats all im going to tell you right now and i shouldnt have told you that so why did you because i need to know what you know about what happened here if you lawyer up because youre paranoid were going to lose time well never get back if you have nothing to hidenothing relevant to this case anywaythen you dont have anything to lose by talking to me i want to talk to him but i know that an fbi agent despite his best intentions cant prevent the nopd from arresting me for murder if they decide to do it on the other hand i can only benefit from kaisers support what did you want from malik he asks i came to find out what my aunts connection to malik was and also some things about my past did you talk to him he was dead when i got here why were you unconscious my head feels like somebody hit me your guns been fired the bullet went into maliks chest an icy spark shoots through me could i have killed malik by accident nohis death spasm in the tub comes back to me in a sickening rush if thats true he was already dead when i shot him or close to dead the autopsy should prove that he had a nerve spasm and it scared the shit out of me i fired by accident kaiser watches piazza over my shoulder for several seconds then he takes my arm and says listen to me listen like you never listened in your life and tell me the goddamned truth okay im listening if you had killed nathan malik would you know it a gauzelike film drops over my eyes a sense that im separated from kaiser by a distortion of perception his or mine im not sure what do you mean ive been thinking a lot about you in the past few days your panic attacks at the crime scenes your psychiatric historywhat i know of it anyway the crime signature which primarily consists of bite marks that could be staged something you would know how to do better than anyone else and the fact that you were sexually abused who told you that i cut in my voice quavering did sean tell you that yes son of a bitch im sorry cat but i think your ptsd and past sexual abuse is what drew you to malik and may have made you his patient even without you knowing it holy god do you really believe i could be killing these men without knowing it kaiser shrugs im raising a possibility one that others might raise carmen piazza for example she doesnt know everything i know but she doesnt like what she does ive listened to the tapes of your meeting with malik several times he told you about dissociative identity disorder and thats just multiple personality disorder under another name given the situation in which i just found you it would be irresponsible of me not to suspect it under the pressure of piazza and her pit bulls staring at me i can hardly summon the resources to defend myself john i didnt kill nathan malik nor did i kill or help him kill any of the six victims in your case now if i suffer from dissociative identity disorder i grant you i would not know i had done any of that id believe i was innocent but do you have any idea how rare that disorder is even among sexually abused people its one of those fascinating myths like amnesia thereve been more cases of it in hollywood movies in the past twenty years than in all of recorded human history kaiser is watching me like a bomber pilot deciding whether to flatten a suspected enemy village the slightest sign could tilt him either way if you let them put me in jail i tell him youll be losing your best chance to solve this case why dr malik told me i already know the truth about what happened to me that i just have to find a way to pull it out of my head i think the same is true about this case theyre connected somehow maybe malik was talking about some alternate identity inside you jesus would you get real youre talking to a woman whos pregnant by a married man im trying to quit drinking and i just found out i was sexually abused by someone in my family i dont have time to run around killing people for fun or profit okay theres a flash of something in kaisers eyes humanity maybe then he looks over my shoulder at piazza again kaiser is my only hope of staying free i talked to malik on the phone i admit he told me some things about the case you arrest me youll never find out what they are what things he asks his eyes narrowed did you find a box inside that room no what was in the box i shake my head kaiser grabs my wrist come with me as he pulls me toward the crown victoria i rode in the other day i glance over my shoulder the two nopd detectives are coming after me kaiser puts me in the backseat and climbs in after me closed into this small space with him i feel again the personal magnetism i felt in my house that afternoon with sean whats about to happen i ask his face is taut i dont know but it should be interesting one of the detectives knocks on the window dont get out of this car unless i tell you to kaiser says i wont kaiser gets out of the backseat and locks the door behind him a heated discussion begins outside but kaiser moves the detectives steadily away from the car so i only hear part of it words come to me out of an audio blur arrest conspiracy aiding and abetting a womans voice joins the fray captain piazza is talking about jurisdictional control and federal interference the word psycho reaches my ears kaiser must be speaking quietly because i cant hear anything hes saying yet after a couple of minutes its kaiser who returns to the car and gets inside with me are they going to arrest me they want to piazza thinks youve been lying to us from the start that youve been feeding malik information about the investigation shes suspending sean and she wants your hide nailed to the barn wall she wants to interrogate you herself great kaisers eyes bore into mine what was in the box you mentioned cat at this point that may be the only thing that could keep you out of jail a film i see connections happening at light speed behind kaisers eyes the video production equipment he says the stuff we found at maliks secret apartment thats what it was for bravo what kind of film is it maliks making a documentary about sexual abuse about an experimental therapy group he was working with group x ill be damned female patients only he said it was radical stuff it was his lifes work no way would malik have killed himself before he finished that film and he seemed to think a lot of people didnt want anyone to see it kaiser takes some time to process this did he tell you who any of the patients in group x were no was your aunt one of them he didnt tell me and i dont know have you spoken to your aunt no shit with malik dead we may never find out who was in group x not unless your aunt can tell us thats not all well never know i think with desolation the secret of my life may have died with malik unless ann knows it knows it and will tell me but the film shows the women in group x yes they supposedly relive their abuse in front of the camera i guess maliks killer took it i give kaiser a thin smile id say so he glances back toward the nopd detectives who are staring angrily at the car goddamn it tell me about that motel room cat i didnt know where malik was until five minutes before i got here he gave me a phone number to call when i arrived the door was open i went in and found him in the bathroom the blood on the wall was fresh then i saw the gun in his hand what if malik was the killer and he offed himself because his work was done after all after the sixth victim i mean i shake my head you know better john maliks work was his film not murder tell me about the sixth victim kaiser looks back at the motel piazza is standing with her detectives again his name was quentin baptiste he was an nopd homicide detective what shit yep it was probably baptiste who was feeding information to the killer knowingly or not thats one reason piazza would like to pin that on you how old was baptiste fortyone the youngest victim yet is sean at that crime scene he was on his way there when i left hes probably heard about this by now we need to get you out of here what about female relatives what have you checked out quentin baptistes female relatives one of them could have been a patient of maliks one of them could be in group x if he was only fortyone id check daughters stepdaughters and nieces also brothers or fathers of those women i was starting that when we got the tip to come here since baptiste was a cop it shouldnt be hard to kaisers face tightens shit a dark green saab screeches to a stop a few yards away from us as sean leaps out and races toward the motel kaiser lifts a walkietalkie to his lips richard get out here now dont tell detective regan where dr ferry is is sean living at home again i ask kaiser meets my eyes i think so yeah trying to reconcile with his wife make sure he knows im not hurt i will the front door of the crown vic opens and a graysuited fbi agent jumps behind the wheel as he starts the engine sean bursts from room eighteen and scans the parking lot our eyes lock he sprints toward the car but kaisers driver screeches onto williams boulevard before sean can reach us were three blocks away from the motel when a revelation hits me like a body blow turn around that would be a mistake kaiser says firmly for both of you its not sean its the skull i need to see that skull why i try to rein in my excitement the teeth in that skull made the bite marks on the victims id bet anything on it turn the car around kaiser orders richard gets us back to the thibodeaux in less than a minute seans saab is already gone captain piazza must have made it clear to him that following us could be a catastrophic career move summoned by kaiser via radio a female evidence technician walks out to our car carrying the skull in a large ziploc bag kaiser reaches across me rolls down my window and takes the skull from the tech then he sets it in my lap the polished skull stares up at me with the ironic grin i saw in the motel bathtub the bone has a slightly yellowish color probably from aging of the varnish someone put on it i need gloves give her your gloves kaiser orders the tech my heart pounds as i struggle to put on the technicians latex gloves which turned inside out when she removed them even without opening the skulls mouth i can see that its lateral incisors are slightly pegged as were those that wounded the flesh of our victims once the gloves are on i open the ziploc and remove the skull ive held many of these during my career some clinically spotless like this one others dredged out of mass graves in bosnia by a backhoe the ones like this you see in dentists and doctors offices theyre good for patient education and they lend a certain macabre severity to a medical office the jaw opens easily on the springs screwed to the interior surfaces of the zygoma and mandible doing bitemark comparisons can be long painstaking work but sometimes its a nobrainer this is one of those times the maxillary arch of the bite marks at the murder scenes is engraved upon my mind and the one in this skull matches it tooth for tooth well says kaiser its a perfect match chapter as we zoom along the shore of lake pontchartrain toward the fbi field office kaiser speaks on the phone to someone who obviously has a great deal of power my head is still pounding the pain focused behind my eyes the skull is riding up front on the passenger seat next to our driver at last kaiser hangs up and turns to me the chief of police is going batshit because i wouldnt let piazza arrest you now that i took you away from the scene hes calling my boss its going to be a bureaucratic shitstorm am i going to be arrested the field office is task force headquarters if youll remain there a while without making a fuss thats your best bet for staying out of jail look my showing up at that motel was just lagniappe for the killer it was the killer who tipped you where to find the murder weapon and the video equipment and the same person gave you the motel and the skull hes trying to frame malik my showing up was just a bonus if you figured out the suicide was staged i was right there to blame for staging it and with my experience id know just how to do it it plays says kaiser but i can think of a scenario that plays equally well not your multiple personality fantasy no the women in group x know malik is killing abusers and also that he killed an innocent man one of them is having a crisis of conscience like the woman who tried to kill herself margaret lavigne lavignes still in a coma yes i was actually thinking our caller might be your aunt was the voice female again yes i turn toward the lake and watch the gray waves in silence i suppose aunt ann could be making the calls but for some reason i doubt it if ann paid maliks bail what would so quickly turn her against him finding out that an innocent man had been murdered maybe but i doubt that would sway her loyalty were there bite marks on the face of the dead cop the worst yet these are personal attacks john and the bite marks are created antemortem like torture but the victims have to be immobilized before theyre bitten so the killers a woman ive suspected it from the start its probably one of the women in group x kaiser blows out a stream of air thats a possibility but a very remote one given the crime signature theres no history of a woman ever committing sexual homicides like this not alone five minutes ago you practically accused me of doing it youre a special case your past your forensic training and i suggested you were assisting malik a malefemaleteam scenario why not two women we dont know how many women there were in group x go on once we connected malik to those first two female patients the killer knew we were getting close even if we didnt know it so she planted the gun at maliks apartment and gave it to us we kept getting closer so she gave us malik and the skull wrapped up in a neat package our girl is probably feeling pretty safe right now kaiser is looking expectantly at me something is tugging at the back of my mind but i cant quite make it out did you get anything at all on quentin baptistes female relatives hang on he calls carmen piazza their conversation is short and to the point when he hangs up he says detective baptiste had six female relatives by blood a wife three nieces two daughters how old are the daughters piazza didnt have their ages but one works as a teacher the other is a day care worker one of the nieces just graduated from the police academy shed know how to shoot i think aloud so would the first victims daughter ill bet moreland an army brat daughter of a colonel weve been all over the moreland daughter because she was related to the first victim shes clean cat but ill get the task force on baptistes relatives right away stilla female killer is very long odds based on precedent there was no precedent for aileen wuornos either forget the past john look at the evidence in front of you a tall white sail appears on the horizon it soothes me to follow it with my eyes as my eyelids grow heavy i remember the valium i popped before going to the motel hows your head kaiser asks it hurts i didnt sleep well last night so i took a valium before i went to the motel you could have a concussion should we get you a cat scan just take me to the field office i need to lie down if you lie down im putting a nurse in the room with you do whatever you want im going to bed i lean against the window and close my eyes but my cell phone starts playing sunday bloody sunday i reach into my pocket its empty ive got it says kaiser holding my screen where i can see it you know this number no but thats a gulf coast area code it might be ann i left a message for her to call me kaiser thinks fast then hands me the phone whatever you do dont tell her malik is dead i nod and press send hello hey cat woman my heart thumps against my sternum its ann i nod quickly to kaiser and he tenses on the seat how you doing baby girl anns voice has the brittle quality ive learned to associate with her manic episodes how do i play her not so good right now actually i say in a tired voice you sound like you need a drink i wish im on the wagon ouch your message said you knew something about dr malik and me what exactly do you know i know you paid his bail the fbi knows too thats not against the law is it ricochetquick response definitely manic dr malik is mixed up in some murders ann a pause then a craftier voice comes through the phone mixed up is a pretty vague term baby girl nathan couldnt do the things they think he did i know men honey he doesnt have that in him ann knows men like an arsonist knows fire ive been talking to him quite a bit lately i tell her do you know where he is a hint of anxiety now yes i close my eyes hes been arrested again arrested the alarm in that one word is shocking where here in new orleans i think you should drive over and see him id like to talk to you too are you in biloxi no are you anywhere close another silence sorry baby girl i dont feel like i can tell you everything at this point you know how that is youve always kept some secrets yourself youre right but sometimes i wish i hadnt i wish all of us would have talked to each other more oh honeyme too i wish you could do a group with nathan hes worked miracles for me i wanted to i reply only half lying i just found out some things about my past that really messed me up id like to ask you some questions to see if some of the same things happened to you oh baby girl ann says in a breathy voice ive worried about you so much but you really should talk to nathan about this not me is she telling me she was abused why else would she worry about me why have you worried about me so much youre a lot like me cat gwen told me they diagnosed cyclothymia but thats just bipolarity under another name weve got it in the blood nathans the expert though im not in shape to give anyone advice kaiser is mouthing words to me it looks like hes saying group x dr malik told me about something called group x it sounded really cool he told me about the film everything were you part of that ann starts to reply then catches herself in the hiss of the open line i can feel her listening to me listening with the concentration of the manic mind in its focused state it makes my skin crawl i know the feeling of hyperconcentration you experience when your mind is on that plateau if you listen to the grass you can hear it growing catherine she says her voice so imperious that it could have come from my grandfather what are you not telling me what do you mean you know exactly what i mean kaiser is watching me anxiously i dont this is me youre talking to ann and this is a dangerous situation were in even dr malik knew that knew i grimace and kaiser curses silently you just used the past tense baby girl the crafty voice again well dr maliks in jail now and for murder this time i hear your voice cat youre afraid of something or someone or for someone no youre reading things into this i want to talk to nathan come to new orleans you can see him at the parish prison this time the silence drags forever i cant come there until you tell me the truth cat i grit my teeth and try to keep my voice even ive told you what i know im worried that you dont trust the hissing line takes on a deadness like a blanket dropped over my heart she hung up on me chapter the fbi field office is a fourstory brick fortress on the southern shore of lake pontchartrain between lakefront airport and the university of new orleans we stop at the heavyiron gate topped with fleurdelis so kaiser can show an armed guard his credentials once inside we park and hurry through an entrance adorned with flags black marble and the fbi motto fidelity bravery integrity theres red tape to be handled in the vestibule where a woman waits behind bulletproof polycarbonate glass afterward kaiser ushers me through a metal detector and were on our way to the fourth floor where the special agent in charge runs the field office and the fbi agents spread across louisiana when we get out of the elevator kaiser leads me down a hallway like those in every other corporate headquarters in america muted decor more doors more hallways kaiser knocks on a closed door then enters and beckons me inside beyond the door is an empty office with four cots in it two are bare but two are made up with sheets blankets and pillows best i can do im afraid its better than a cell in the parish prison kaiser gives me an obligatory chuckle i need to go straighten this mess out with the sac he may want to talk to you im good whatever good or not im going to send up a nurse her name is sandy ill be asleep before she gets here he nods then starts to leave may i have my cell phone back cant do that sorry nobodys read me my rights kaisers patience is straining at the seams cat youve obstructed justice and maybe acted as an accessory to multiple murder if i let you interfere in this case anymorewhich your cell phone would make it very easy for you to dothe sac will throw you out the front gate and give you to the nopd and there wont be a damn thing i can do about it okay fair enough but youll tell me if ann calls absolutely ill bring your phone in here and have you call her back he looks at me as if hes sure i have another question but i dont i do however have an idea ive been thinking about the skull john what about it from the very beginning i figured the bite marks could be staged did sean tell you my theory about the killer using dentures or an articulated model to make the marks a smile touches kaisers lips lets say he took partial credit for that par for the course well my theory proved out the killer was using the teeth from that skull to make the marks next question whose dna have we been testing where does the saliva come from we know its not maliks kaiser nods sure but until we have a suspect we have nothing to compare our samples to yeah but i was thinkingsaliva contains more than dna you know we need to know everything we can about that saliva like what what do you want to do some basic nineteenthcentury science everybody treats dna analysis as the beall and endall of forensics fine great but the average mouth contains strep bacteria and all kinds of other bugs lets take the fresh saliva out of quentin baptistes wounds put it in a petri dish and see what grows out maybe well get a strange germ that can tell us something sort of like the way we track where a corpse ate dinner by looking at its stomach contents impurities and things you know kaiser looks skeptical what could we really learn i dont know we might find our suspect suffers from a certain disease we should give it a shot right like sean calling that bail bondsman back and figuring out that ann paid maliks bail youre right ill tell the forensic team to do it tell them quick baptiste has the only viable saliva for this and cultures take time done he goes to the door then turns back to me and speaks in an apologetic voice hey are you really pregnant i nod silently seans yes he closes his eyes for a moment then looks at me again are you going to have it yes he doesnt blink good for you i never saw or heard a nurse come into my room the valium carried me away from the waking world like a gentle river of grey goose maybe my alcohol withdrawal has made me hypersensitive to drugs whatever the reason i slid down the bright coral wall into my dream ocean without interference and the myriad images of my subconscious surrounded me like children penned up in a house all day time flows forward and backward in my dreams not at my whim of course if intruders are chasing me and about to grab me from behind with clawed fingers i cant reverse time and save myself but events in my dreams dont always unroll in a forward sequence sometimes im getting younger as my dream life progressesor re gresses i supposeturning from nine to eight at a birthday party for example ive never gone back beyond eight though the age i was when my father died is like an obsidian wall an immutable fact of physics laid down by newton or einstein or even god the sign on that wall doesnt read beyond this point lie monsters like the legend on ancient maps it reads beyond this point lies nothing nothing does such a thing exist ive heard children ask this question isnt even nothing something space is something isnt it time exists there and gravity invisible things perhaps but theyre real enough to kill you i existed before i was eight even though i dont remember it i know that i existed then the way i know that doctors took out my tonsils while i was under anesthetic something happened even if i wasnt mentally present i have the scars to prove it my scars arent visible to the naked eye but theyre there if a child stops speaking for a year theres a reason something hurt me even if it was only something i saw what did i see eight years of lost images did they vanish down a well not all of them ive always had fragments of that history images of animals particularly have stuck with me a dog we had when i was very young a red fox that pearlie pointed out to me running low and fast under the trees at malmaison horses on the island galloping across the sand as if they meant to swim the river to freedom and i remember my father those images ive hoarded like gold smuggled out of a wartorn city my fatherluke ferry dancing to the sound of a car radio while he washed his beatup white volkswagen walking down the driveway of malmaison with his head down and his hands stuck in his pockets thinking hard about something screaming at my mother to stay out of the barn even as he pulled me inside with one hand watching him from the loft of the barn while he sculpted with a cutting torch bending the whitehot steel to his will from where i sat the fire from that torch looked brighter than the sun and the roar of it filled my ears the smell of hay closed around me in the loft a smell no amount of cleaning could get out of that building how many afternoons did i spend in that loft watching him wrestle beauty out of a pile of bars on the floor more than he wanted me to daddy didnt always know i was there sometimes i crawled up the ladder on the back side of the barn and slipped into the loft that way it reminded me of blackandwhite movies id seen about a little arab boy in the bazaar spying on people and having glorious adventures most times daddy heard mehis eardrums must have been like butterfly wingsbut other times he didnt when he knew i was there his head had a different tilt to it as though he were making sure i could see what he was doing with the torch i felt so privileged hed chosen me as his secret sharer the only one allowed to see how the magician did his tricks but some nights his head was hard down over his work and i saw only the sweat running down his neck and back soaking his white undershirt on those nights he worked with a fervor i couldnt begin to understand he worked like a man who hated the linear chunks of metal and was trying to destroy their essence by making them something abstractsomething without function yet meaningful i am back there now the loft with the hay smell and the wasp nests and the mosquitoes that buzzed in during the day to lie in wait for me at night i dont slap them because daddy will hear me i let them fasten to my skin and begin to fatten with blood and then i slowly mash them into a paste of black and red when the cutting torch dies the silence in the barn is absolute in the silence i hear the rain for the first time i forgot it was raining thats why he didnt hear me sneak in the drops rattle against the tin roof like a barrage of hail but the hypnotic roar of the torch was enough to drown them out daddy is walking around on the floor but i cant see him craning my neck i find him squatting on the floor beneath the loft hes beside one of the timbers that hold up the roof working some kind of tool under a floorboard after a moment he looks around then pulls the board up from the floor then another and another he pulls a bag from underneath the floor its dark green like the jeeps ive seen parked behind the national guard armory when i go to the flea market there ive never seen the bag before he takes something out of the bag but i cant see what a magazine maybe or a big picture then he stands and walks to one of his worktables his back is to me he lays the object on the table and reaches down to his middle like he needs to undo his pants to pee my face feels hot hes not peeing because theres no commode or even grass just the table on the wooden floor his right shoulder is flexing the way it does when hes working on metal like it will never stop the rain keeps hitting the roof close over my head and the sweat keeps running down his back then his head goes back like hes staring at the ceiling but somehow i know his eyes are closed im scared i want to run but my hands and feet are numb he turns sideways and then i see what hes doing and my heart swells into my throat i cant breathe his mouth is hanging slack and the way it looks makes my stomach flip when he groans and thrashes his head something breaks the chains holding my limbs and im suddenly running back to the ladder running to save my life my head slams into a board and i lose my footing and then im falling past the rungs of the ladder throwing out my arms but catching only raindrops look cat says grandpapa pointing at some trees look at that fawn over there when i turn my head im no longer falling out of the barn but sitting in my grandfathers orange pickup as it rumbles up the low hill toward the pond im back on the island fear is still stuffing my heart into my throat but the smells have changed the hay is gone replaced by motor oil mildew chewingtobacco juice and smoke from a handrolled cigarette it hasnt started to rain yet but the sky is filled with leaden clouds as heavy as a pregnant cows belly as we trundle over the crest of the hill grandpapa turns his head and watches his prize bull mount a cow pleasure lights his face why is he happy is he thinking of the money hell make from the calf to be conceived or does he just like watching the bull thrusting and heaving over the cow how many times must i watch this same movie ahead the cows by the pond watch us with dumb indifference beyond them the water lies smooth as glass except where my father floats facedown in it his arms outspread like jesus on the cross i squeeze my hands into fists i want to close my eyes but my eyelids dont work mute with fear i point with my finger grandpapa squints at the clouds and shakes his head goddamn rain he mutters as we roll down toward the pond my father gets to his feet and starts walking across its surface my heart pounds so loudly i can hear it above the sound of the truck daddy holds out his arms to me then begins unbuttoning his shirt theres dark hair on his chest i pull at my grandfathers shirtsleeve but hes mesmerized by the bull straining over the cow daddy dont i shout he pulls his shirt open in the middle of his chest is the big sutured yincision to the right of that the hole where the bullet went in he puts two fingers into the bullet hole and pulls it open again i cover my eyes with my hands then peer between my fingers something is pouring out of the wound like blood only its not blood its gray look kitty cat he commands i want you to look this time i obey the gray stuff isnt liquid its a bunch of pellets plastic pellets a stream of them pouring out of my daddys chest the way they poured out of my stuffed animals whenever i tore one open by accident louisiana rice creatures were really stuffed with rice in the beginning but later they switched to plastic pellets cheaper i guess or maybe the rice rotted after a while the pellets pour endlessly out of my fathers wound a hissing river of them hitting the water when daddy is sure i know what they are he pulls his chest open still wider then he reaches into his wound and pulls out a rice creature like a vet delivering a colt from a troubled mare its not just any rice creature though its my favorite lena the leopardess the one i put in daddys coffin before he was buried to keep him company in heaven i want to run to him and take lena from his hands but my door wont open as i stare daddy holds lena up so i can see her belly its messed up somehow as he nears the edge of the pond i see that lenas belly has a stitched yincision in it just like daddys chest with his eyes on mine he digs his fingers into the thread rips it apart then tears open lenas stomach i scream bright red blood pours out of lenas chest more blood than any doll could hold somehow i know its my daddys blood he turns pale as i stare then gray and then his feet begin sinking the water cant hold him up anymore daddy i shriek wait im coming he keeps sinking his face sadder than ive ever seen it i can save you daddy i jerk as hard as i can on the trucks door handle but it wont open i bang my fists on the window until my knuckles split but it does no good then someone with soft hands takes me by the wrists catherine wake up cat its time to wake up i open my eyes hannah goldman is leaning over my cot holding me by the wrists dr goldman has the kindest eyes in the world its hannah she says can you hear me cat yes i smile for her my best smile so shell know im okay its easy to be okay with hannah here even if it is only a dream ive come to speak to you about something important she says i nod understanding of course what is it agent kaiser asked me to come i think that was wise of him hes a wise man i agree a very wise man dr goldman looks almost as sad as my father cat you know i believe in honesty and frankness but life always finds a way to test our beliefs theres no easy way to tell you this i smile encouragement and pat her hand its okay im strong you know i can take it you are strong she smiles back you may be my strongest patient what i have to tell you is this your aunt ann is dead my smile broadens no shes not i talked to her today i know you did dear but that was yesterday afternoon youve been sleeping for quite a while and sometime last night your aunt drove to desalle island and killed herself by taking an overdose of morphine my smile freezes on my face its not dr goldmans somber voice or sad eyes that convince me its the morphine and the island chapter hannah goldman is about fifty with graying streaks in her hair and deep lines at the corners of her eyes her eyes are kind but the intelligence behind them is ruthless sitting under hannahs gaze you can feel like a child under the care of a loving mother or a lesser mammal being scrutinized by a scientist bent on dissection agent kaiser was probably right to bring her here but now that shes broken the news to me about ann i want kaiser psychiatry isnt going to solve my current matrix of problems i sit up on my cot and set my stockinged feet on the carpeted floor hannah i appreciate you coming here to give me this news but i need to ask agent kaiser some questions ill get him for you she says but i want you to promise me two things okay youll let me sit in while you talk to him of course and youll talk to me alone afterward this i dont especially want to do but it would be rude not to agree all right left in the silence of the empty office i enter a strange state where all the images in my mind spin wildly against each other foremost among them is my father bleeding plastic pellets from his chest then lena the leopardess pouring blood from her torn belly i dont know what that dream meant but i have to find out and to do that i need lena in my hands again only shes buried in my fathers coffin in natchez two hundred miles away i have to get out of this building the sound of the door opening and john kaisers voice merge into one startling mix bamcat what can i do for you i stand and face him squarely i want the details of my aunts suicide kaiser glances at dr goldman hannah says you dont have to treat her like shes not in the room with us cats used to dealing with stress he looks skeptical what do you want to know does my mother know about it yet yes shes enraged she thinks anns husband murdered her what apparently your aunt was in the middle of a bad divorce the husband wanted to keep her from getting any money i talked to the guy i dont think he even knew where desalle island was until i told him it feels like a suicide to me suicide i echo in some ways ann was already dead she had been for a long time what do you mean by that kaiser asks but hannah is nodding ill tell you in a minute i want to know exactly where ann was found who found her how she did it whether she left a note everything forget im related to her okay kaiser leans against the closed door a woman named louise butler found her in a oneroom building on desalle island i guess you know all about that island more than i ever wanted to apparently ms butler was looking for you your grandfathers search for you had been called off but louise was in the woods and never got the word she found your aunt instead despite the horror of this thought the face of my fathers mistress gives me a comforting feeling as it rises behind my eyes brown and still beautiful at fortysix im glad louise found ann and not jesse billups thinking of my last afternoon on the island a cold certainty comes to me did the building ann was found in have a tin roof kaisers eyes narrow how did you know that my hands suddenly feel clammy was she found in the building they call the clinic he nods slowly waiting for an explanation tell me how she looked when they found her kaiser glances at dr goldman but answers anyway she was naked lying on the floor by an examining table a deep ache begins in my heart a lot of suicides take off their clothes before killing themselves but anns nakedness wasnt a matter of fastidiousness or infantile regression did she leave a note no note doing it in the clinic was her note kaiser sneaks another glance at hannah and i know hes holding something back what is it i demand she didnt leave a note but she did leave something before she died she drew two skulls and crossbones on her lower abdomen about where her ovaries would be there was a sharpie marker lying beside her body for the first time i feel the sting of tears that means something to you kaiser asks ann was obsessed with having a baby she never could get pregnant at fiftysix she was obsessed with having a baby no but she never got over the failure my grandfather performed an emergency appendectomy on her in that clinic when she was ten years old he always said the infection she had then was what made her infertile that it blocked her fallopian tubes i think a dye test may have later proved that correct anyway when she finally gave up on having a baby she died inside kaiser doesnt know what to make of this i turn to hannah ive been wondering if that appendectomy might really have been an abortion hannah sits in silence her mind clicking through what she knows of my family ten is too young for pregnancy she says finally im sure its impossible sexual abuse again says kaiser thats why ann was a patient of maliks right we dont know that for sure i point out she could have been seeing him for her manicdepressive disorder well we need to know which i want an autopsy done on her as fast as we can get one would a botched abortion be detectable all these years later possibly hannah says that depends on what kind of mistake was made after forty years scarring from infection would be difficult to attribute to therapeutic abortion based on pathological findings alone theres also the complication of possible later abortions but this is an academic question if ann was ten years old she wasnt pregnant you need to talk to my mother i say softly when it comes to ann shes the only one who knows the private details hannah looks puzzled by something why she says deliberately was there enough morphine to kill someone in a oneroom clinic on a rural island i asked the same thing says kaiser you ever see a chain saw accident i ask theyre as bad as war wounds sometimes a chain saw can take off an arm or a leg in two seconds this seems to satisfy kaiser who served in combat in vietnam whats your next move i ask him wondering how i can get out of here rush your aunts autopsy if i can her body is already at the morgue in jackson mississippi i need to rule out murder she was too close to malik to discount that possibility i want to see her autopsy report im sure youll be here when i get it carmen piazza still wants you locked in a cell downtown this probably isnt the best time to ask if i can leave ill tell you what i want kaiser intones i want that film malik was making if we find that well find our killer film hannah asks nathan malik was making a film a documentary about sexual abuse and repressed memory i answer it shows a group of female patients reliving sexual abuse and some other things he wouldnt tell me about he said it would galvanize the nation on the issue of sexual abuse thats one film id like to see cat thinks the killer is a member of that group of women says kaiser malik called them group x i think ann hilgard may have been part of it group x echoes hannah strange with ann and dr malik dead only that film or surviving members of group x can tell us who the members are hannah looks oddly at kaiser i sense you have something to ask me i do is there any possibility that cat could have been a member of that group without being aware of it dr malik suggested that she might suffer from multiple personality disorder hannah looks briefly at me then back at kaiser ridiculous cat has certainly experienced dissociated states but the idea that she suffers from fullblown dissociative identity disorder is preposterous put that nonsense out of your mind agent kaiser nathan malik had flashes of genius but he was also a flake thats a fucking relief i say silently kaiser and hannah are lost in their own musings but something wont let me focus its not grief over ann im too numb to feel anything about that now its a sense of something missing theres something youre not telling me john he looks up and shakes his head why do you think that i dont know have you told me everything about anns death the scene did you leave anything out his brows wrinkle he looks like hes making an honest effort she injected the morphine into veins in both arms that tell you anything only that she was serious what else do you have photos from the scene he nods cautiously i had the west feliciana parish sheriffs department email me their crimescene stuff thats how i knew the building had a tin roof are you sure you want to see them yes he glances at dr goldman again hannah studies me for a few moments then says cats already in shock if it will help solve the murders i dont see any point in keeping them from her kaiser promises to be right back with the photos then leaves the room hannah looks up at me from the cot where shes sitting im worried about your affect cat you do know youre in shock i suppose so i feel numb and youre not drinking not for days now her eyes probe me like a metal instrument youre not taking your medication are you i hate to answer this no how long im not sure a week maybe she shakes her head i dislike mechanical analogies but today thats the only thing i can use watching you now is exactly like watching a machine all the biology is working but youre not present youve described yourself as being that way when you have sex i know but this isnt that im like this when i work always yes hannah looks over at the door as though she hears kaiser returning i was that way at times during medical school but something about you seems different and this isnt a normal case no matter what you tell yourself you cant pretend you werent related to ann you were you are in the faulknerian sense of the past never really being past faulkner said that if the past were truly past there would be no grief or sorrow ann was your blood relation cat and she took her own life something youve thought of doing yourself many times i have to find the truth hannah thats the only thing that will keep me sane now her gaze doesnt waver will it its my only hope the door opens and kaiser walks in carrying some eightbyten photos before second thoughts can stop me i take them from him and shuffle through the stack as i would photos from any crime scene hannah was right this is not just another case the mere sight of the clinic brings on a wave of nausea a small tinroofed building sitting in a sunscorched field of weeds a lone fig tree beside it i can feel splinters being pulled from my hands tetanus shots being stuck into my shoulder the next photo makes me thankful i havent eaten its not grossno blood and brain matter covering a dinner table no ejected shell casing lying in the blasted wreck of a human face its just my aunt my once glamorous aunt lying naked on a bare wooden floor her breasts and thighs sagging like pools of melted wax her mouth yaws open in the gape of sleep eternal sleep this time and cat hannah says softly are you all right yeah its a downwardangled shot it shows the legs of the examining table a pair of brown feet in sandalsprobably louisesand the molding at the bottom of a cabinet just behind anns head theres something rounded and dark but i cant make out what it is i slide the photo over and move it to the bottom of the pile and my heart stops in the next photoshot from a different anglea stuffed animal lies on the floor about three feet behind anns head its not just any animal its a turtle and his name is thomas thomas the timid turtle thomas i breathe what says kaiser i point at the turtle kaiser walks up to see is that turtle important thomas was anns favorite toy ever since she was a child i had no idea apparently there were several stuffed animals in the room we figured they were there to let kids hold while they got injections or something they were ivy always kept stuffed animals in the clinic she would hand you one as you came in but along with the feeling of comfort came a sense of betrayal because you knew pain was coming soon still you clung to the animal the pain wasnt his fault thomas didnt live at the clinic ann brought him there im surprised she wasnt holding him when she died she may have tried theres some indication that she started out on the examining table then fell to the floor after losing consciousness i dont know im crying until the tears fall onto the obscene photograph one of hundreds ive studied in the past few years i never want to see another one again cat says kaiser i shake my head and try to get control but the tears keep running down my face like theyre never going to stop chapter hannah gently takes the photographs from my hands and gives them back to kaiser i think thats enough for now no i say we have to keep going what does the turtle tell you asks kaiser i quickly summarize my recurring dream about the pickup truck the pond and my father pulling lena the leopardess out of his gunshot wound as i speak hannahs eyes focus on me with absolute concentration jesus kaiser says when i finish from the point of view of your life i think thats probably very important but its hard to see how it impacts this murder case it sounds to me like your aunt was molested as a childjust as you wereand this stuffedanimal angle is part of all that the only relevance to our case is that the sexual abuse is probably what brought ann into contact with malik i take a step toward kaiser i have to get out of here why i have things i need to do he glances at hannah such as i want to see the stuffed animal i buried with my father it was my grandfather who suggested that i put lena into his coffin to keep him from being lonely he said you want to exhume your fathers body to see a stuffed animal yes its too much coincidence ann kills herself with her favorite stuffed animal and my grandfatherafter killing my father because he supposedly abused metells me to bury my favorite stuffed animal in the coffin i want to get lena and thomas together and give them every test known to forensic science and i want a new autopsy done on my father you told me his original autopsy report was lost right yes says kaiser watching me as he might a psychotic patient but i cant let you leave here you know that because cat there are only two options for you stay here or let the nopd arrest you and put you in jail you could raise bail im sure but it might be tomorrow before you got free an engine is spinning in my chest building frantic energy that wont be discharged until i get out of this building and learn what i have to learn can you order the exhumation of my fathers body for a new autopsy kaiser glances at hannah again then looks pointedly at me im not sure what the law is in mississippi dont patronize me john is mississippi law really the point youre the fbi expediting your aunts autopsy is one thing cat she died under suspicious circumstances shes a material witness to maliks activities at the very least and at worst an accessory to murder your father on the other hand was murdered twentythree years ago and though his death intrigues me it has no clear tie to this case his military record also happens to be sealed for the next fifteen years if i tell the sac that my next big idea is exhuming luke ferry to look at a stuffed animal im not going to get a lot of traction i look to hannah for help but shes silent if you want to analyze lena the leopardess youre going to have to find a way to do it on your own after you get out of here okay the fbi isnt in the business of psychotherapy kaisers tone sounds official but something in his eyes is speaking to me in a different language right i say okay he moves to the door i only mentioned that mississippi law thing because sometimes its not that difficult to get a body exhumed by the family i mean he opens the door ive got a lot of balls in the air right now one of which is keeping you out of jail if i hear anything i think you need to know ill come tell you and im having some food sent up from the cafeteria you must be starving im not hungry but i tell him thanks anyway and then hes gone hannah takes my hand and pulls me down beside her on the cot then she puts an arm around me and hugs me like the sister i never had that was tough she says youre a tough cookie but i ask dreading the inevitable you want the truth yes i think youre very close to cracking i put my elbows on my knees its the same old dilemma fall off the cliff into depression or start flying into mania and i have no control over which it will be thats not what i meant hannah says gravely this time im afraid youll do neither this time you could really crack im talking about total psychological collapse a rubber room cat why why is this so different because losing your aunt isnt merely an echo of losing your father its more like losing yourself youve always been a sort of shadow of your aunt her illness was more extreme than yours but in essence the same hannahs right but what am i supposed to do about it i havent told you everything her eyes tell me she knows this already no patient ever reveals everything i recount the dream of seeing my father masturbating in the barn and the rain hitting the tin roof over my head she listens impassively until i fall silent seeing a father masturbating could be traumatic for a little girl she says but thats a normal activity depending on what he was looking at while he did it of course i wonder why i couldnt see that in my dream she shrugs dreams always bring more questions than answers so you still have the same riddle who abused me my father or someone else i have to know hannah i have to know whether my father was a hero who died trying to protect me or a pervert who never really loved me and the same for my grandfather on the surface he was the war hero and my father the weirdo but it might not be one or the other you know what do you mean it might have been both of them dear a fresh layer of fear settles over the dread at the bottom of my soul why do you say that hannah suddenly seems unsure whether to go on many abuse survivors have been molested by multiple offenders cat if your mother was abused by her father she may well have married a sexually abusive man it happens all the time i dont think i could take that hannah squeezes her arm tight around my shoulders i hope thats not the answer but if youre going down this road you should prepare for the worst to keep me from dwelling on this possibility she changes the subject do you think the green bag from your dream could still be hidden under the barn floor i dont see why not i never saw it anywhere but in that dream and the barn has apparently been locked up tight for some time why didnt you tell kaiser about that dream i dont know maybe i want to see whats in that bag before he does i take hannahs hand and squeeze it will you help me get out of here she smiles you dont need my help youre not under arrest even the fbi cant detain you without arresting you unless its on some trumpedup terrorism charge your problem is the nopd theyre not a problem if they cant find me hannahs smile vanishes you really want to go back to mississippi i have to and i got the feeling kaiser wants me to exhume my fathers body on my own did you sense that actually i did hes very good at nonverbal communication yeah hannah looks at me seriously for a moment then giggles like a schoolgirl ill bet hes good in bed i knew you were thinking that no you didnt but i think if you managed to slip out of here kaiser wouldnt look too hard for you but i cant just walk out with you there are cameras all over the place especially around the entrance youll have to help me how i need to use your cell phone she takes a silver motorola from her pocket and hands it to me before she can change her mind i dial michael wellss cell phone for a few moments i think hes not going to answer but then he does its cat christ its about time are you all right yes and no my aunt is dead and things are very crazy right now im in new orleans and i need to get back to natchez the police arent looking for me now but they will be soon would it be completely shameless of me to ask you for help again michael takes a moment to process all this where in new orleans are you fbi headquarters wheres that by the university of new orleans uno is by lakefront airport yes you can see the airport from the windows here not from the office im in of course but from the fourth floor if you can get to lakefront airport i can fly down and get you my pulse rate kicks up are you serious sure ive flown in there a dozen times last time i watched the dave matthews band at uno michaelare you sure you can get away what will the police do if they find you put me in jail on what charge murder did you kill anybody no then i can get away ill have to arrange for coverage though call my cell phone in an hour i should be airborne and on the way by then well take it from there if theres any problem with the phones just get your ass to lakefront and start watching the planes come in ill be in a blue and white cessna registry number nmd by the time i walk into the fourthfloor hallway hannah goldman has been gone for ten minutes she was to say her goodbyes to kaiser then slowly make her way down to her car in the parking lot my job is to get to the fbis motor pool without being seen by anyone who knows who i am occupying a large part of the buildings basement level the motor pool has huge garage doors that open into the parking lot ive been down there a couple of times before when i rolled out with the fbi forensic team on the serial case where i first met sean the elevator is only thirty feet down the hall and im nearly to it when i hear john kaisers voice cat where are you going i turn and give him a little wave hes standing by the office i just left a tall figure who looks more than anything like a concerned father i feel sick i need to get to the bathroom down past the elevator on the right he starts walking toward me did the food come did that make you sick someone did bring up a tray of sandwiches after hannah left but i didnt touch it no i was about to eat it when i got a wave of nausea that may be from the blow to your head i was coming to show you this kaiser has almost reached me hes holding something in his hand what is it early results on those cultures you asked for the saliva from the bite marks on quentin baptiste the dead homicide detectivevictim number six oh right what does it show he hands me the lab report you tell me i glance over the letters and numbers trying to pretend that my nerves arent shot and that my mind is on the piece of paper in my hand rather than on escaping this building what i see is a microbiological snapshot of an average human mouth except for one thing thats weird what asks kaiser maybe its a mistake what well twelve hours is early but we ought to at least see some streptococcus mutans growing you have that particular strep in abundance in any mouth with teeth in it s mutans thrives on hard surfaces it produces the acid that causes cavities and you dont have it there no well if its not a mistake what would that mean it could mean a couple of things the saliva may have come from someone taking a course of antibiotics that would disturb the normal flora of the mouth id look for penicillin or even more likely penicillin with gentamicin i try to concentrate on the lab report but all i can keep in my mind is hannah goldman waiting for me downstairs cat prompts kaiser im sorry i was thinking this saliva could also have come from an edentulous person whats that i shrug thinking the answer selfevident someone without teeth somebody who wears dentures no somebody who owns dentures but doesnt wear them dentures have hard surfaces with cracks and crevices that are ideal for bacterial colonization just like real teeth it might be someone who lives alone who doesnt feel the need to put in his teeth because no one ever sees him kaiser looks interested would he necessarily have to be old god no lots of people have teeth so bad they rot out by their thirties you might look for somebody who needs dentures but cant afford them a lot of convicts have their teeth pulled in prison kaiser reflects it makes positive identification harder in subsequent trials well maybe this culture will get us somewhere like i hoped you can check all the male relatives of the victims for infections prison records or for teeth period look i really need to get to the bathroom oh yeah sorry may i keep this report sure i stuff it into my back pocket lets see what grows out after another six hours when ill be long gone i pat kaiser on the arm then walk quickly up the hall to the bathroom as i push open the door i cut my eyes right hes no longer in the corridor backpedaling fast i dart to the elevator the fire stairs are tempting but this is probably one building where if you open a fire door all hell breaks loose before the elevator door closes a blonde woman wearing a blue skirt suit hurries in after me and smiles i smile back and press the button for the basement i sense her looking at my clothes they look pretty rough definitely not the uniform of female fbi agents are you okay she asks oh yes i offer my hand catherine ferry ive been working the nomurs case as a consultant for john kaiser im a forensic odontologist she looks impressed and interested i heard they found another victim yes a cop this time wow the elevator stops on the second floor this is me she says good luck the door opens onto a cube farm with men and women walking purposefully between partitions when the door closes i breathe a sigh of relief and sag against the wall in twenty seconds the elevator opens to the concretefloored motor pool about a dozen government sedans are parked diagonally against a wall on my left to my right are two big black suburbans the suvs used by the fbi forensic team thirty yards across the basement lot are the big overhead doors that can get me out of the building i dont see anyone but theres bound to be someone here something clangs in the emptiness the sound of a heavy tool being dropped on concrete praying that the careless mechanic is underneath a vehicle i walk briskly across the lot toward the doors as i near them i see a large white button not unlike those beside the doors in ers and surgical suites i should have a story ready in case someone asks what im doing down here but i dont if someone challenges me ill just have to wing it i hit the big button and an overhead chain drive lifts the big door in front of me with no more fuss than my garage door at home when its four feet off the ground i duck under it and walk quickly up the ramp to the outdoor parking lot hannah drives a white series bmw but i dont see it bearing right toward the main entrance of the field office i watch the lines of parked cars sure enough hannahs white beemer backs out of a space not far away then pulls forward and stops beside me her window is open glancing over the roofs of the parked cars i see the guard house at the main gate i dont know whether the guard is watching me but hes not going to let me ride out with hannah without checking upstairs first did you open your trunk i ask her through the window yes but im afraid youll suffocate i walk to the back of her car and lift the trunk lid as though retrieving something then i take a deep breath climb into the small space fold myself almost double and close the trunk lid over my head i have a few mental problems but claustrophobia isnt one of them i wouldnt be much of a free diver if i couldnt stand being closed into small spaces people dont think of the ocean as a small space but when youre three hundred feet beneath it with cold water trying to crush you into jelly you feel pretty closed in hannah has stopped at the gate shutting my eyes in the dark i send my mind to its secret haven the bright coral wall where i dive and dive until the blue turns black and rapture blurs my sense of separation from the water until my mind takes in the whole of creation if the guard discovers me in this trunk it wont be because he sensed my presence im not even here the bmw jerks forward pulling me out of my trance after a couple of bumps were rolling along at a good clip with each stop im sure hannah is going to get out and free me from the trunk but she doesnt for one irrational moment im terrified shes going to turn me over to the nopd but thats crazy shes just finding a safe place to let me out at last the car stops and doesnt start again i hear her door open and close then the trunk lid pops open and sunlight spears my retinas a backlit silhouette takes my hand and helps me out of the trunk the ligaments in my knees creak like horsehair ropes as i unfold them you are really something hannah says i feel like ingrid bergman were not at the airport were in the parking lot of a small upscale shopping center ive been here a few times shopping for clothes hannah notices my concern youll attract a lot less attention here than at lakefront airport thats not a busy place she stuffs some paper into my hand thats eighty dollars call a cab at the last minute to take you to the airport its less than ten minutes away i hug her hard then pull away get out of here ingrid youve done enough already hannah takes my right hand in both of hers and squeezes tight youre close to finding out the truth cat but dont expect a blinding flash of insight or instant peace in cases like yours getting the true facts is only the beginning many sexual abuse survivors never get the kind of resolution theyre looking for ive been lost for a long time hannah a beginning sounds pretty good to me she smiles sadly then gets into her car and drives away i look down at my watch and wonder if michael is airborne yet i need to find a pay phone chapter im five thousand feet over the mississippi river flying north at two hundred miles per hour michael wells is beside me piloting his cessna as if hed rather be doing this than anything else in the world natchez is thirty minutes ahead the shocks of the past twentyfour hours have pushed me to the point that flight in a small plane produces no airsickness at all what are you going to do now he asks his face somber what i should have done in the beginning find out who killed my father im going to exhume his body michael looks at me like ive taken leave of my senses what will you learn from that for one thing it will give me dna to compare against any body fluids i find on my bedroom floor im hoping ill find preserved semen are you going to work the bedroom yourself no im going to bring in a firststring team to do it no matter what my grandfather says im also going into the barn to see if my fathers green bag is still under the floor its padlocked but i shouldnt have much trouble breaking in do you think that green bag really exists absolutely technically the barn is kirklands property isnt it im not sure actually some of the old desalle holdings are held in trust for me i dont really know what grandpapa owns and what he manages for my mother and me its very complicated but if he tries to stop me ill go to the da and make it an official murder investigation its not my fathers body i really want though its lena michael looks away from the plexiglas windscreen long enough for me to see his confusion your stuffed leopard leopardess i dont know what shell tell me but i know shes important may i use your cell phone he unclips it from his belt and hands it to me my pride tells me not to do what im about to do but i have no choice i dial sean regans cell number detective sergeant regan he says its cat jesus theyve got a statewide manhunt going for you and you call my cell phone sorry to be an inconvenience shit its not that but karen wants to see copies of my cell phone bill from now on im sure piazza will be reviewing it too so the women in seans life finally got wise to him well im sorry this is a business call somehow i knew that i need you to do me a favor sean no questions asked what favor that sounded like a question in the silence that follows i sense him remembering what its like to deal with me on a daily basis okay cat whatever it is ill do it thanks you know my aunt committed suicide last night i heard im sorry theres going to be an autopsy today in jackson mississippi kaisers expediting it i need to see that report or at least know what the findings are didnt kaiser tell you ive been suspended from the department yes but i know youre still wired into the task force like knowing my aunt committed suicide youre already angling for a way back into this case and if you help me i might be able to give you one more silence you need an actual copy of the autopsy report whatever you can get im particularly interested in anything the pathologist finds out about anns reproductive organs scarring old operations anything like that uhhuh sean sounds anything but excited i need this as fast as you can get it like yesterday i cant give you what i dont have yet i know i just want you to understand cat what i snap realizing im trying to avoid any personal conversation whatever how are you doing i mean with the baby and all anger surges up from a well deep within me darker and more intense than i could have imagined fine i say in a taut voice you dont need to worry about me us whatever im not your problem anymore you never were a problem cut the cord orders the voice in my head we both know thats a lie lookgood luck piecing your life back together yeah hey ill get that report for you thanks i miss you cat not badly enough hurry sean i hang up and punch in my mothers cell phone number as it rings i feel sean touch my arm then i realize its not sean but michael wells for a moment i actually forgot i was sitting beside him in his plane youre crying michael says are you okay i dont think okay is something to be aspired to at a time like this i just have to keep moving forward he withdraws his hand and goes back to flying just as i expect to be kicked over to voice mail my mother answers in a sleepy voice that makes me think sedatives dr wells she says no its cat cat a brief pause i dont understand are you at dr wellss house no mom listen i know about ann well i figured you must have heard by now how are you doing fine i suppose considering im at work and its a very busy time for me which is good i guess at work she sounds like she just woke up from surgery i always knew this was a possibility with ann she says one of her doctors even told me to prepare for it he said that if this ever happened i should know ahead of time that there was nothing i could have done to prevent it but is that how you really feel she sighs heavily and in the background i hear the muzak she runs in her shop i dont know look i told you im really busy today i have to get out to dunlieth to show the owner some new drapery fabrics mom i need to talk to you will you be at home this afternoon that depends on how long dunlieth takes doesnt it please try to be home this is no day to be worrying about work life goes on cat i figured you of all people knew that what about the funeral arrangements your grandfathers taking care of all that of course nothing but the best for one of my daughters i dont mind talking to you she says but i dont want you to start trying to tell me how to feel about this i deal with my own feelings in my own way you know that or you dont deal with them chilly silence i may not wear my heart on my sleeve like some people but ive managed just fine so far have you mom has life really been fine all these years i think ive done a pretty good job considering the obstacles life put in my way god how is pearlie taking it i dont know shes gone to the island deserted me with barely a word this throws me the island pearlie hates the island well thats where she went right after she heard the news about ann ive got to go cat if i dont see you later make sure youre at that funeral ann would want you there like i would miss my aunts funeral mom why did i go riding in the orange truck with grandpapa on the island what do you mean ive been having this dream about riding in that old truck with him and its always raining ohhh she says her voice suddenly musical daddy always got so tense when it rained because no work could be done you were the only one who could calm him down hed ride around the island showing you the birds and cattle and deer and when he got back hed be tolerable to live with again i think children are the only thing that keep men from being altogether savage i just mom i cut in stopping what could become an endless flow try to come home this afternoon okay byebye darling i hang up and pass the phone back to michael more dazed than upset john kaiser described my mother as furious over anns death and suspicious that shed been murdered by her husband now mom sounds like shes on thorazine she often sounded that way when i was a child distracted bored out of it sedated for some reason i sense my grandfathers hand in this how easy it would be for him to give her a shot and remove the inconvenience of her emotions from his life cat im fine michael can you fly us over the island is it too far out of the way well the rivers just over the horizon to our left you said the island is opposite angola prison just south of it he banks the cessna in a wide arc to the west and almost immediately i see the silver line of the river ahead can you fly low sure we can buzz the treetops no thanks just low enough to make out cars and people michael laughs and begins descending soon the river is a great silver serpent slithering across a vast green floor on the near shore endless ranks of trees march over the hills on the far bank flat fields of cotton and soybeans stretch as far as the eye can see the river cuts through the land with implacable abandon bisecting the continent almost as an afterthought can you believe we were right down there the night before last i ask or all thats happened since then michael tilts the plane a little and looks down i cant believe you swam that river i mean shit do you see an island i see a half dozen of them this ones four miles long michael whistles low i think i was looking right at it without knowing it theres angola prison so that must be desalle island i cant see it from my side and michael quickly realizes this he banks and drops the nose and suddenly were boring in on the long humped mass of the island like a fighter plane on a strafing run how high are we im going to stay at four hundred feet you can see all you need to from there in a matter of seconds were roaring over the island ive seen it from the air before once long ago from the cockpit of a crop duster then later from the basket of a hotair balloon todays view reminds me of that first trip the landscape below flashing past at a hundred miles an hour i see the hunting camp the lake the lodge the pastures and the pond and then were banking left to avoid what might be restricted airspace over angola can you make another pass sure what are you looking for a car a blue cadillac ill climb to a thousand feet youll have a better view between the trees michael executes a degree turn climbing as he goes this time the island looks more like a satellite photo the chaos caused by proximity now softened into geometric patterns i see the road that runs the perimeter of the island and the branch that cuts south of the hunting camp widening into an open space near the cluster of cabins that house the workers four white pickups are parked by the cabins to the left of them a baby blue sedan stands gleaming in the sun pearlies cadillac okay i tell michael lets go home you saw the car i nod and point northward toward natchez i dont really feel like talking now i just want to know what drove pearlie washington to travel to the island where she was born a place where according to her she is no longer welcome one more mystery among many yet something tells me that if i could read pearlies mind all the other mysteries would be solved chapter the natchez airport is a tiny facility two runways and a brick administration building laid out near the origin of the natchez trace michael makes a perfect threepoint landing then transfers me to his expedition and within fifteen minutes were approaching the driveway of malmaison the sight of the oakbordered drive with its pink pilgrimage tour sign gives me a strange feeling of foreboding you want me to drive up to the house he asks i wave him past the opening in the trees lets go to your house and walk through the woods to the barn if billy neal and my grandfather are there id rather have some privacy for this michael pulls into brookwood and drives to the back of the subdivision where his house stands quietly under the trees do you have bolt cutters or anything he shakes his head i may have a hacksaw that could work what about an ax yeah we going to tear the place down be prepared werent you a boy scout michael actually blushes when he says no three minutes later were jogging through the trees toward malmaison im carrying the hacksaw he the ax when i sight the main house i bear right toward the lowlying land bordering the bayou at the back of the property the city of natchez is built on hills transected by bayous and deep gullies a secret network of waterways known by the children but forgotten by adults most adults anyway i still know them all we approach the barn from the side then circle around back so as to be shielded from anyone glancing down from the parking lot behind the slave quarters the wall boards are dry and weathered gray but the door still resists a stout pull i lay the hacksaw blade against the padlock and set to work when the sweat begins pouring off my face michael takes over the saw the cords and muscles in his forearms bulge as he works and it strikes me that michael is stronger than he looksdefinitely not the fat boy i remembered from high school there he says blowing metal shavings away from the cut give me the ax i pass it to him with the blunt side of the head he bashes the lock off the heavy hasp open sesame he says then he pulls open the door my indrawn breath remains locked in my chest inside the barn are more luke ferry sculptures than ive ever seen gathered in one place there must be twenty most of them taller than my head and some twenty feet high wow michael whispers its like a museum a private museum the sight of all that polished metal wrought into abstract yet beautiful forms by my fathers hands is almost more than i can bear when the smell hits methe scent of hay that daddy could never get out of the barnmy knees go weak even his tools are here his cutting torch with its big gas cylinders his metal saw cat are you okay i clutch michaels arm and take a step into the barn i didnt need to look at this stuff right now its too much you know yeah its powerful even for me and i didnt know the guy did you know all this was here not like this my grandfather must have lost his mind he never liked my fathers work now its like hes cornering the market do you still want to look for the bag hell yes thats why were here i quickly thread my way through the sculptures to the foot of the timber post that my father walked to in my dream its uncanny how certain i feel that im standing in the right place if that bag is beneath these boards my dream was just as nathan malik described a repressed memory buried deeply but intact and true the ax michael passes me the ax like a nurse passing a retractor to a surgeon with the head i press down on one end of the first board i saw my father touch in my dream when the other end of the board lifts a little my heartbeat stutters i catch that end of the board with my shoe hold it in place then reach down and pull the board out of the floor look at that michael whispers my hand tingles as i slip it into the darkness beneath the floor then it closes around dry rubbery fabric the bag as i pull on the neck of the bag two more floorboards come up with it exposing an olive drab sack that looks as if it holds nothing more than old laundry i think we just proved that repressed memories exist i say instead of poking blindly through the bag with my hand i carefully shake out its contents on the floor the first thing that falls out is a magazine playboy its dated and boasts the playmate of the year on its cover relief washes through me this must be what he was looking at in my dream what says michael you didnt say anything about a playboy magazine its nothing this is a good thing why its normal oh i get it a miniature photo album for storing snapshots follows the magazine out and my throat tightens a little then comes the sketchbook louise told me about next a small stack of envelopes held together with a yellow ribbon followed by a sheaf of maps some of them laminated the top envelope in the stack of letters is addressed to luke ferry and the return address is malmaison the canceled stamp is dated the bag feels empty now but when i shake it hard some rotten prunes strung together on a wire fall out on the floor a shieldshaped patch falls beside them the patch shows an eagles head and above that a scoped rifle with the word sniper monogrammed in yellow thread above it hundred and first airborne says michael what that eagle the screaming eagles thats what they call the hundred and first i saw that eagle emblem all the time on that hbo miniseries band of brothers was your dad in the airborne yeah i just found out the other day michael flips through the playboy as i go through the stack of letters most are from my mother to my father some written from natchez but most from university mississippi the post office of ole miss my mother went to school there while my dad was in the army but she didnt even manage a full year before he was wounded like what you see i ask michael whos still looking at the playboy its funny so dated the cameras and the cars yeah im sure thats what youre looking at well lola falana doesnt look too bad here i must admit lola falanas black right mmhm he holds up the magazine i see a short but wellshaped woman with an afro riding a horse tying the envelopes back together with the ribbon i glance at the rotten prunes desiccated wrinkled and black they look like something i might have brought home in my trickortreat bag in the days before halloween candy was storebought the book of pictures seems the next logical choice but im not ready for that yet passing over them i rummage through the maps the top one shows the vietnamesecambodian border west of saigon the next shows something called the a shau valley this map has handwritten names in english eagles nest berchtesgaden currahee hamburger hill there are elevations scrawled beside some of the names obj perry obj hoptown eagles nest below the english names are typed words in another language dong so ale ninh rao lao i have a feeling a lot of american boys died at those places and that maybe they werent supposed to be there sure enough as i study the map some more i realize im looking at the border area between vietnam and laos my god michael exclaims holding up the playboy an interview with tiny tim and a story by nelson algren this is bizarre maybe your dad did buy this for the articles youre a big help sorry i didnt think youd want me looking at that stuff until youd checked it out youre right im sorry im down to the sketchbook and the photo album im about to start working through the photos when michael speaks again this time in a voice i barely recognize cat when i look up his face is pale what is it he shakes his head then passes the magazine to me stuck between two pages are three photographs each one shows a different child two are boys aged about six or seven the third photo shows a darkhaired girl of about five all of the children are naked is that you michael asks my eyes are swimming in tears no the boy in one photo looks oblivious to the camera but the other boy looks scared hes holding his little penis as though hes about to urinate but i can almost see a man standing behind the camera ordering him to touch himself my stomach is trying to come up i want to stop it but i cant dropping the magazine on the floor i get to my feet run to a corner and puke my guts out as i come up for air spitting and dryheaving something touches my arm i whirl and lash out striking michael hard across the face he blinks in surprise but doesnt try to defend himself i draw back my arm again and swing at his face with all my strength something clamps around my wrist and pins it in midair michaels hand cat he says softly its me its michael a scream bursts from my throat with the force of an explosion from deeper than my chest really deeper even than my diaphragm the scream is what my fist would have been had it smashed into michaels face a bolt of rage and humiliation and other things i cant even name when the scream finally dies my hand still quivers an inch from his face i think we should get out of here he says we can talk about this stuff at my house i dont respond ill get the bag we should take it with us he pushes my fist down to my waist then lets it go and kneels on the floor he puts everything back into the bag then leads me by the wrist back through the sculptures toward the barn door i stop in my tracks hanging from a rafter above me is a sculpture i didnt see on my way in it was shielded from view by the floor of the loft but now i see it its a hanged man stylized but a hanged man all the same lifesize and ugly as death the face has the anonymous oval shape that the statue in louises house did but the body is fuller at first i think of suicide but something about the sculpture has a more official look as if the man was just hanged for some offense the steel rope around his neck rises in a perfect line that terminates in a hook which would allow it to be hung from almost anything ive never seen that before i thought id seen everything he ever did no says a voice in my head youd never seen the pieces in louises house either thats different i say is it apparently your father did a lot of things you never knew about or never remembered cat says michael are you talking to me what come on that scream was loud he drags me toward the door but my eyes remain locked on the hanged man chapter as michael pulls me through the trees toward brookwood i keep thinking of my father walking on water in my dream when i woke i felt certain that he was trying to tell me something to help me to send me the secret truth of his life and mine but maybe he wasnt maybe he was trying to apologize for something not literally of course i know hes not communicating to me from the dead or anything like that its my subconscious creating these images and yet im sorry i flipped out i say you dont have to stay with me dont be ridiculous says michael you have no business being alone right now were never going to reach brookwood my legs feel full of sand and the humidity hanging in the air makes it difficult to extract oxygen from it i need to talk to my mother why shes my fathers next of kin i cant see getting any kind of exhumation permit without her support cat you just looked at three polaroids and a sculpture and you freaked out now youre talking about looking at your fathers corpse after its been decomposing for over twenty years i shudder that will be easier to look at than those pictures cat what else can i do michael i have to keep digging until i uncover the truth if i dont ill go mad he stares at me with eyes full of pity and compassion i think you should talk to tom cage before you do anything else dr cage yes remember what he told me your dad confided in him quite a bit about the war and tom seemed to think a great deal of luke i think you need to hear what tom has to say nobodys going to confess to their family doctor that they molested their own daughter dont be so sure in the old days the family doctor was like a priest especially in the south he was the only person some people could legitimately unburden themselves to i stop walking and sag against the gray trunk of an oak tree whats the matter michael asks can you bring the car he studies me for several moments i see the doctors brain behind his eyes searching me for signs ofwhat do you promise to stay here until i get here of course what are you worried about im worried that all this stress will trigger a manic state if it does you wont know what youre doing and i think youll kill yourself one way or another i slide down the tree trunk and settle onto the soft ground the pain of the bark scraping my back is strangely welcome please michael ill be back in two minutes as soon as he disappears i dump the contents of my fathers bag on the ground in front of me the playboy the maps the letters the prunes the sniper patch the sketchbook the spiral album of snapshots i hold my breath as i open the album with its photos tucked into plastic sleeves for posterity ive never been more afraid to look at something in my life if i find more photographs of children ill simply keep holding my breath until i pass out ive failed at that before but today the first photograph shows a whitetailed deer in low light a buck with ten antler points relief almost makes me exhale but i dont every photo in this book is a potential horror the next picture shows a black bear cub the one after a cottonmouth moccasin coiled around a cypress tree my heart stutters in my chest the next photo shows a naked brown body but its not a child not a prepubescent one anyway its louise butler thirty years younger than when i talked to her in her little house on the island she cant possibly be eighteen in this picture shes standing on the edge of the river at sunset facing the camera without a trace of shame the grace and power of her nude body make lola falana on the pages of playboy seem common i flip the page louise again at rivers edge this time sitting in profile against the sunset in what looks like the lotus position my mouth goes dry at the next image in it my father stands with one arm around louises waist shes naked but hes wearing an old pair of denim cutoffs and nothing else bronzed by the sun he looks as fit and happy as i ever saw him in life the image is slightly offkilter as though he had set the camera on a log and shot the photo with a timer i never saw him look that happy when he was with my mother the next photo shows several black children playing in a dusty road but theyre all wearing clothes as i flip through the little binder the images blend into a montage of life on the island not the privileged life i knew as the granddaughter of dr and mrs kirkland but the daily life of the blacks who lived there yearround one photo shows daddy with a young black manjesse billups with a frositting on a porch playing box guitars bottles of cheap wine stand on the porch rail and a heavy black woman with pendulous breasts dances barefoot on the ground luke has a glass bottleneck on the third finger of his left hand i can almost hear the cutting wail of the notes as he draws the slide quivering along the strings the last photograph is of me im sitting on the floor of the barn with my legs crossed much like louise in her lotus photo my elbows are on my knees my chin in my hands and im staring into the lens with big round eyes that look exactly like my fathers i look more at peace in that picture than ive ever felt in my life i look about two years old what happened to me after that what took away the peace in those eyes who took it away the person who shot this picture with a long exhalation of relief i drop the album it falls beside the rotten prunes on the wire theres something revolting about keeping food stuffed in a bag beneath a floor the prunes have an especially nasty look as though they were being saved for some reason beyond the ken of normal human beings a necklace maybe like something a peasant would use to ward off vampires miss catherine that you over there a black man in greasestained khaki work clothes has appeared among the trees its mose the yardman after so many years at malmaison he moves among these trees like a ghost he and daddy must have run into each other many times on their solitary forays under the canopy of oaks its me mose you all right you fall down or something im just resting he moves closer but his advance is solicitous the way pearlie moves around houseguests who dont know her mose cant be much younger than my grandfather and time has worn him down to a bent nub like a tree that finally gives way to decades of wind and bugs and rain the scleras of his eyes are yellow and gray stubble grows high up his cheeks its hard to imagine that i once saw this man carry railroad ties across his shoulders what you got there mose asks you drawing pictures hes noticed the sketchbook the one artifact of the bag that i havent yet examined im just looking at some old pictures my father took he nods agreeably but then his eyes focus on something else whats that there hes pointing at the prunes some kind of rotten food i think its prunes mose bends and picks up the string of blackened fruit he studies one pinches it between his fingers then brings it to his nose and sniffs it mose youre a braver man than i he laughs you aint no man you a girl i always wondered if mose was simpleminded but ive never known for sure these aint prunes he places one of the blackened things between his front teeth and bites down testing its texture this here be hide hide skin some kind of animal skin chunks of something some kind of hunting trophy maybe mose shrugs something like that i reckon as he hands me the necklace the words of the grizzled vet from the vietnam veterans building come back to me a lot of hollywood movies dont show nothing but grunts cutting off ears and killing women and kids and some of that happened i wont lie i stuff the necklace quickly into the bag nausea rolling through my stomach miss catherine you sure you all right i nod and begin gathering the rest of my fathers things far behind mose i see michaels expedition carefully negotiating its way through the trees do you know anything about desalle island mose his face wrinkles in thought not no more i dont but you did well i was born down there wasnt i a current of excitement goes through me you were born on the island sho was i think everybody who ever worked up here for your family was born on the island dr kirkland always saying nobody knows how to work no more he about right too he say people from the island still do a days work for a days pay poverty wages probably do you like my grandfather mose oh yes maam dr kirkland been real good to me i think you know what i mean mose looks around as though someone might be eavesdropping you know your granddaddy miss catherine he a tough man and he know how to squeeze a nickel till the buffalo shitspardon my language i say nothing leaving a vacuum that mose feels compelled to fill dr kirkland be kind of like that story i heard a long time ago the plantation owner gives a slave a pint of whiskey another slave asks how he liked it and the first slave says well if itd been any better he wouldnt have give it to me and if itd been any worse i couldnt have drunk it mose isnt simpleminded at all dr kirkland takes care of the people on the island though he adds quickly they better off than a lot of black folks here in town what about my father mose he looks confused for a minute mr luke you mean yes he smiles broadly revealing tobaccostained teeth mr luke always had a good word for me when he passed sometimes he gave me a smoke off whatever he was smoking too if you know what i mean i do i liked old luke but i had to be careful around him dr kirkland didnt like him none at all michaels expedition is close now threading its way through the trees like a tank wary of land mines did you like the island mose he shrugs didnt know nothing else back then i wouldnt go back now though i like my tv in the evenings and i dont like that river too many people done died in that water did you know somebody who drowned i had a cousin drown in it sho did girl or boy boy name of enos but i believe a little girl drowned some years before that too do you think the island is a bad place mose squints at me as though trying to make out something far away what you mean miss catherine is there something bad there something you might not be able to explain but that you just feel i used to feel something like that there the yardman closes his eyes after a moment a little shudder goes through him then he opens his eyes and looks at me like a little boy when i was young the old folks used to say killers from the prison roamed the roads at night from angola you know like theyd slip out of the prison at night float over to the island and walk the roads looking for children all that seems like a fairy story now something they used to scare us but still a lot of kids wouldnt get near them roads anytime round dark and not even in the daytime by themselves why not he shrugs again thats just how it was youd have to ask somebody else the why of it but ill tell you thisi got me a lot of kin down there and i hardly been back there in forty years and now that you ask me i dont care if i never go back again as michaels expedition rumbles up beside mose the yardman gives me a wave and ambles off through the trees by the time michael rolls down his window mose has vanished like my father he is another ghost of malmaison i take up luke ferrys bag of secrets and climb into the suv chapter michael wells and i are sitting on a leather couch in the private office of dr tom cage a general practitioner in natchez for more than forty years bookshelves line all four walls some stuffed with medical treatises others with histories of the civil war theres a stack of medical charts a foot high on dr cages desk the bane of every physician a halfpainted lead soldier holding a musket stands in the shadow of the charts a bottle of gray paint beside him like us he seems to be waiting for the doctor to appear but what holds my attention now what ive hardly been able to take my eyes off since arriving is the polished white skull being used as a bookend in the shelf behind dr cages desk the empty eye sockets stare at me with what looks like mockery reminding me yet again that nathan malik is dead that the murders in new orleans remain unsolved and that i am still a suspect since finding the polaroids of the naked children in my fathers bag ive been unable to think clearly the voices that tormented me long ago have returned a susurrant undercurrent of vicious commentary that i cannot silence more disturbing something deep within me seems to have cracked leaving me broken in a way i cannot begin to mend what is broken i think is my faithmy desperate hope that despite what grandpapa told me my father could not have done such terrible things to me but pictures dont lie michael has done all he can to ease my anxiety though he believes it would be a mistake to exhume my fathers body he telephoned his attorney during the drive over and asked what was required to accomplish such a thing theres no law in mississippi governing the exhumation of bodies in fact not even a permit is required what is required is the presence of a funeral director as a witness however when michael phoned the funeral director he was told that the funeral home would oversee no exhumation without a court order michaels lawyer believes such an order can be obtained from the chancery judge ex partewithout a hearingbut to do so will require an affidavit stating the reason for the exhumation from the decedents next of kin my mother hi michael sorry to keep you two waiting a tall man with white hair and a white beard marches into the room and pumps michaels hand then he turns to me and smiles so youre catherine ferry i stand and offer dr cage my hand please call me cat he takes it and squeezes softly with arthritic fingers and im tom he moves behind his desk and takes a seat a big cigar and several tongue depressors protrude from his white lab coat and a red stethoscope hangs around his neck its clear that tom cage practices the kind of medicine my grandfather hasnt deigned to practice in many years dr cage takes a diet coke from a minifridge behind his desk pops it open and takes a long pull from the can after a long exhalation of satisfaction he sets the can on the desk and fixes his eyes on me luke ferry what do you want to know im not sure everything you remember i suppose thats a lot i treated luke as a boy treated his parents before they died and i treated the uncle who raised him off and on what are you most interested in i look at the floor where my fathers green bag rests between my feet vietnam i say softly the white tigers dr cages eyes flicker you already know more than i thought you would catyour father learned to shoot to put food on his familys table he shot better as a boy than most men could after a lifetime of practice but in the war they made him use that talent for another purpose they made him a sniper luke had mixed feelings about that job on one hand he was proud of his professionalism dr cage gestures at his bookshelves as you can see im a military history buff i also served in korea did you know that in vietnam the average number of rounds expended per dead enemy soldier was fifty thousand fifty thousand michael says beside me that cant be right it is says dr cage thats one reason we lost that war you want to guess how many rounds were expended by army and marine snipers during vietnam per dead enemy soldier michael shakes his head one one point three nine those boys were very good at their job but that kind of killing is much more difficult than returning fire at a man whos trying to kill you its done in cold blood looking through a scope at a man ten times lifesize you watch him smoke a cigarette or take a piss and then you blow his head into ragged chunks of gore and bone think of john kennedys head exploding in the zapruder film thats what you see every time you shoot once you have pictures like that in your head they never go away dr cage takes another sip of diet coke my point is luke was under great stress even before he was pressed into the white tigers and in that unit things changed for the worse and damn quick the tigers were essentially a terror unit sent into cambodia to harry and kill nva forces hiding in a neutral country these were covert operations carried out behind the lines under the command of officers who had cast aside the rules of organized warfare they took few prisoners when they did it was to torture them rape was used both as an intimidation tactic against the local populace and also as a reward for the troops they rarely distinguished between soldiers and noncombatants almost everyone they encountered was considered a target when luke protested against extreme acts of cruelty he was ridiculed by his fellow soldiers and looked on with suspicion by his superiors he soon learned that if he failed to go along with the prevailing authority hed wind up as dead as the rest of the people who came in contact with the white tigers while dr cage pauses to think i rummage through the bag until i find the wire string of rotten prunes fighting my revulsion i hold the string out to the doctor do you know what this is dr cage takes the string from my hands and lays it on his desk with a magnifying glass from his pocket he examines one of the blackened chunks ears he says what asks michael dr cage looks up at us its an ear necklace never seen one where did you get it daddy kept it hidden in a bag with some other things its a war trophy when some soldiers killed an enemy in vietnam they cut off one or both ears and strung them on a necklace much like indians taking scalps ive heard of that says michael but i guess it never seems real until dr cage shrugs they did it with foreskins too but thats nothing new they were taking foreskins as trophies back in the crusades war has always been barbaric only the tools have changed its hard for me to visualize the father i knew living in the world tom cage is describing so my father cut the ears off his victims victim isnt the proper word during wartime dr cage says though it may be fitting in cases like this but its difficult for me to imagine luke ferry stooping to mutilation there arent more than twenty ears on this necklace and luke had thirtysix confirmed kills as a sniper alone he probably killed many more without a spotter present to make it official no id be very surprised if this necklace belonged to luke why asks michael given all that youve told us because luke risked his life to bring the men whod done this kind of thing to justice as soon as he got back to vietnam from cambodia he went over the head of his co and reported what hed seen higher authority did exactly what they always do when someone ignores the chain of command within a week luke was back in action with the white tigers thats when he was woundedaccording to luke by his fellow soldiers its a miracle he got aboard a medevac chopper alive he said that if it hadnt been for one man hed have been left to bleed to death in a rice paddy what happened to him after that he was never the same the things hed witnessed had pushed him beyond his limit when he learned they were going to send him back to the tigers again he lost it he started yelling about everything hed seen and the next thing you know they were processing him out on some kind of special discharge they didnt give him a section eight but it amounted to the same thing his posttraumatic stress disorder kicked in even before he made it back to the states i could tell you about that but something tells me thats not what youre really here for michael was right tom cage is a perceptive man go ahead michael says tell him what do you know about childhood sexual abuse i ask dr cage looks surprised ive seen some in my time i havent treated children for years but in the beginning i did treated anybody who walked through the front door he takes a sip of diet coke and looks over at his bookshelves my fear is that ive seen a lot more sexual abuse than i realized at the time that there were kids i could have helped if id only had more courage or better eyes to see why more courage i ask i think we see what we want to see or maybe what we can afford to see when i started practice here there was no such thing as child protective services just the welfare department and in those days men had virtually absolute control over their families dr cages eyes have focused somewhere in the middle distance he might as well be alone in the room im about to clear my throat when he snaps out of it and looks up at me i was thinking of some particular cases particular children but that was a long time ago i hope they turned out all right theres an uncomfortable silence that no one seems inclined to break for some reason i feel i can trust this man reaching into the bag i remove the three polaroid snapshots and pass them across the desk i found these in the bag with the other stuff that daddy kept secret dr cage takes a long look at each polaroid then looks up at me whats really going on here cat what are you trying to figure out i think my father may have molested me do you have some reason other than these pictures to believe that yes im sorry he glances at the snapshots again these pictures look like damning evidence i know but taken by themselves theyre like the ear necklace merely possessing them seems like evidence of perversion but you dont know the circumstances by which luke came to have them why would he hide them if he had nothing to be ashamed of dr cage shrugs we may never know that have you gone through everything in that bag everything but this i reply holding up the sketchbook why did you pass over that i dont know an image of louise butler comes into my mind someone already told me what was in it sketches of desalle island stuff like that do you mind if i take a look i pass the sketchbook across the desk and he begins flipping through it looks like youre half right there are some sketches of a black woman heres some poetry a wildflower pressed between two pages wait look at this what its a typed note oh yes listen to this private ferry its come to our attention that youve been talking about the time you spent west of the mekong river we thought youd learned your lesson in sixtynine since you didnt heres a little reminder from your old friends who wore the tiger stripes keep talking and your ears will wind up on one of these we might even have to run a night op on that little girl of yours remember those you took an oath soldier never forget it dr cage sets the sketchbook on his desk well theres one answer for you how luke came by the necklace they threatened his life i say softly they really did luke was a stubborn boy dr cage says softly he tried a couple of times after the war to get an investigation started he made some headway but it never came to anything it wouldnt surprise me to learn that the intruder who killed him at malmaison was sent by the men who wrote this letter i wish he had been i say silently dr cage is watching me closely i can see theres more to this than what youve told me maybe a lot more i just hope ive helped you a little though theres really nothing else he can do to help i want to tell him more his opinion has become important to me if i asked you whether you think luke could have sexually abused me or not what would you say a deep sadness fills tom cages eyes id like to say no i really would but im too old a dog to be offering certainty on a subject like that the human sex drive is a powerful thing it dictates to us more than the other way around often without our realizing it freud spent his life trying to understand it and fell far short luke was a good boy but what he did in the dark of the nightor why he did iti wont pretend to know whatever he did probably had more to do with what was done to him as a child than anything else and that i dont know about you said you treated his parents dr cage turns up his hands they were good people but they died young i didnt much care for the uncle who took luke in he was a redneck loudmouth who spent most of his time trying to get social security disability benefits he didnt deserve of course that doesnt make him a child molester hes dead now lung cancer as i pack my fathers things back into the bag i say if i asked you the same question about my grandfatherwhether you think he could have molested mewhat would you say dr cages eyes lock onto mine with a curious intensity id have to give you the same answer i gave you about luke none of us really knows anybody and when it comes to sex anything is possible when i dont speak dr cage adds youre looking down a deep dark hole catherine a lot darker hole than i thought when i walked in that door he glances at michael at least youve got a good man helping you do it hes about to speak again when the door beside the couch opens and a nurse walks in the doctors face darkens i said i wasnt to be disturbed im sorry says the nurse but dale thompson just slid his motorcycle down a hundred yards of pavement hes bleeding all over the waiting room why didnt he go to the emergency room he said you patched him up after his last wreck and he wants you for this one looks like he needs about a hundred stitches all told dr cage shakes his head he needs some sense knocked into him put him in the surgery ill be right there the doctor comes around his desk and takes me by the hand im going to be honest with you cat i never liked your grandfather i respected his skill and his work for the city but thats about the only good thing i can say about bill kirkland as for what you asked about i can tell you this the mans nearly eighty years old and he takes as much viagra as any patient i treat i know that because he gets it free from one of the drug reps and so far as i know he doesnt see any women in town but then i dont know half of what goes on anymore so thats not evidence of anything as i get to my feet dr cage says hows your aunt ann i used to treat her on and off for depression when she was mad at her shrinks shes dead dr cage is visibly shaken dead how suicide last night jesus christ i hate to hear that did ann ever mention anything to you about sexual abuse he shakes his head she was obsessed with having a child thats what i remember most and she had a real lovehate relationship with your grandfather she depended on him for everything and hated herself for her dependence do you know anything about the appendectomy she had on the island dr cage laughs hell ive heard bill tell that story a dozen times he acts like he did a heart transplant with nothing but a pocketknife and some rubbing alcohol ann was ten when that happened do you think she could have been pregnant dr cages eyes narrow but after a while he shakes his head no in over forty years of practicing medicine ive seen one pregnant elevenyearold maybe two god almighty you are walking through the abyss arent you i nod it feels like it he looks at michael you take care of this girl shes tough but shes not as tough as she thinks she is i will dr cage shakes michaels hand and then hes gone you still want to exhume your fathers body michael asks more than ever he sighs and leads me toward the waiting room theres a trail of blood on the white tiles of the corridor and a bloody footprint near the waiting room door in an instant i flash back to the bloody prints on my bedroom floor the door ahead wavers in my vision and my knees go weak michael braces my arm and leads me past the staring faces in the waiting room im taking you to my office and running some tests he says i blink against the bright sunlight crazy images flashing in the glare my fathers tombstone myself as a little girl putting lena the leopardess into his coffin no if i stop i wont be able to start again we keep going chapter the natchez city cemetery is one of the most beautiful in the world but today it brings me no peace im driving my mothers car down one of its narrow asphalt lanes mom in the seat beside me looking as anxious as ive ever seen her she has aged visibly since anns death her skin is drawn and pale and her eyes look cloudy i dont know why you want to come here she says quietly well be here soon enough to bury ann i want to see daddys grave i want our family to be together when i talk to you the three of us what has gotten into you her eyes stare through the windshield youve got the fbi searching for you youve got daddy and pearlie in an uproar daddys got a very sensitive deal cooking to try and save the city and hes terrified youre going to ruin it by causing all this trouble i continue down the lane through a tunnel of oaks rolling between long wroughtiron fences and mausoleums hidden among the trees our family plot lies in the old section of the cemetery where the gnarled limbs of giant oaks reach to the ground and spanish moss drapes everything in shadow do you visit daddys grave very often i ask mom doesnt answer if michael hadnt stranded me at moms shopas i requestedi would never have gotten her to the cemetery but by offering to drive her home i got control of the car andfor now at leasther mom have you taken a sedative she cuts her eyes at me youve got a lot of nerve youve been drinking your sedative every day of your life yes but im clean today i have been for a week believe it or not mom says nothing i only ask because im curious did you take it on your own or did grandpapa give it to you a huff of anger where else would i get it i pull her maxima onto the grass beside a low brick wall the desalle family plot lies just beyond it no mausoleums for us just fine alabama marble behind wrought iron that dates to you cant see the river from herethat view is reserved for the relatives of those buried on jewish hillbut the air smells of cedar and sweet olive and the shade more than makes up for the panoramic view from the bluff a good portion of five generations of desalles lies behind this fence grandpapa would have preferred that luke ferry be interred elsewhere but my motherto her creditinsisted that he be buried here it may be the only time that she stood up to her father and won if i try to drag mom through the gate shell resist me so i simply walk through on my own and dont stop until im standing before my fathers simple black headstone before long i hear the gate creak then a shadow falls across mine on the ground why are we really here my mother asks softly i reach out and find her hand with mine momsomehow ive reached the age of thirtyone without you and me sharing much more than small talk i blame myself as much as you i want us to do better in the future but after today you may never want to talk to me again youre scaring me honey i wont say you shouldnt be i want to exhume daddys body her indrawn breath might as well have been an explosion i know the turmoil inside her is almost more than she can bear how did i raise this crazy woman beside me shes wondering before she can scream or burst into tears i push on i need a sample of his dna but i also want another autopsy done and i want lena out of the coffin that raggedy old stuffed animal yes her hand pulls out of mine catherine whats happened to you are you out of your mind no i think im close to not being out of my mind for the first time in my life i need your help to do this mom im asking you to help me shes looking at the gravestone not at me but why what are you trying to do im not sure you want to know if youre talking about digging up your father id better know what you think youre up to i step onto daddys grave then turn and face her mom i was sexually abused when i was a child she blinks several times quickly ann may have been molested too i dont know and i wont know until i see daddys body and get lena out of that coffin mom has begun to shake from her head to her toes shes shivering as though stranded on an arctic glacier even her fitted linen suit is shivering though the summer air is still as death oh dear lord she says her voice almost a whimper who put this nonsense in your head was it that psychiatrist ann was seeing the one who was murdered how do you know about him i spoke to the fbi dear an agent kaiser called me he was very personable and very concerned about you too a sense of threat brings the hair on the back of my neck erect when was this now cat theres nothing to be afraid of did you tell kaiser im in town i didnt tell anyone anything baby daddy said our family business is none of their business jesus did grandpapa talk to kaiser i think so yes mom theres so much to tell and not enough time to tell it my whole life ive had problems with sex with men with alcohollots of things she steps toward me relief evident in her face now i understand the problem she thinks thats not your fault honey anybody who lost their father the way you did was bound to have some problems no it wasnt that i always thought it was but it wasnt baby of course thats it you suffered so much pain mom please theres so much you dont know grandpapa tried to protect you the same way he tried to protect me only he didnt protect either of us the anxiety returns to her face what are you talking about i hoped i wouldnt have to tell you this but theres no other way mom the night daddy was shot there was no intruder at malmaison of course there was i told you no i say firmly you never saw one and there never was one grandpapa told me that himself he made up that prowler to keep from having to tell you what really happened what really happened she echoes her eyes as wary as a timid dogs yes grandpapa said he caught daddy molesting me in my bed that night they fought and grandpapa shot him the blood has drained from my mothers face shes so pale that i cant believe she hasnt fainted i know thats a shock mom but thats what he told me i dont believe you i shrug im telling you the truth only im not sure anymore that grandpapa was telling me the truth theres a chance it could have happened the other way aroundthat daddy caught grandpapa abusing me only daddy still got killed and thats what im trying to find out not who killed whom but who molested me if it was grandpapa he probably did the same to ann my mother has clapped her hands over her ears like a child but i keep talking ann killed herself in the clinic with thomas the turtle beside her did you know that did you know she had thomas there she did that because of her infertility mom says almost defiantly she blamed it on the appendectomy she had there daddy said as much several times as i recall that the infection might have made her sterile im not even sure that operation was an appendectomy mom im afraid ann might have been pregnant my mothers mouth is a cartoon o tenyearold girls dont get pregnant my god that alone should tell you how crazy this is maybe she wasnt pregnant i concede recalling the unanimous opinions of michael wells hannah goldman and tom cage but something very bad happened to ann in that clinic and somewhere deep inside you know that at last mom realizes how foolish she must look and she drops her hands to her sides as she stares at me in silence i cross the final unspeakable line mamahow could you not know how could you not know that was happening to me how could you let someone do that to me tears pool in the corners of her eyes then slide down her face you need help baby well find somebody somebody really good this time no i say my voice breaking you cant pawn me off anymore nobody can help me through this except you you mama i know youve had problems with sexjust like i haveonly theyre different problems i know there are things you cant do her mouth begins to quiver i spoke to louise mom she flinches as though from a blow take me home catherine dont say another word im begging you mom im standing here on daddys grave begging you to help me find the truth im afraid if i dont i may not live much longer dont do that to me she snaps angrily raising a forefinger dont put that on me ann did it too many times already take me home or im leaving you here i have the keys i whisper then ill walk chapter when i pull into the parking lot behind malmaison i see my grandfather seated in a foldout lawn chair by the entrance to the rose garden billy neal stands beside him a brown beer bottle in his hand grandpapa leans forward to peer through the windshield of the maxima when he sees both me and my mother inside he dismisses billy with a wave of his hand give me your cell phone mom she refused to speak on the way home from the cemetery but she passes me the phone then she gets out of the car her purse over her shoulder and waits for me as i dial seans number in new orleans billy neal walks through the arbor and disappears into the rose garden without looking back detective sergeant regan its me sean do you have my autopsy report not yet why not ill be honest with you cat i dont know if im going to be able to get it the fbi has closed ranks on this thing theyre not giving the task force crap its like the old days when the feds never shared anything grandpapa is saying something to mom but she hasnt moved away from the car i shut my eyes trying to press down a sense of grim futility sean you get me that fucking report i hang up id like to back out of the parking lot and drive straight to michael wellss house but i cant let mom face grandpapa alone not after what i told her at the cemetery as soon as i get out of the car grandpapa is up out of his chair and screaming at me his face is red his eyes blazing what the hell do you think youre doing catherine the sight of my grandfather angry still turns my insides to jelly but today i stand my ground what are you talking about you want to dig up your fathers goddamn corpse i cant believe it either michael lied to me when he said he didnt mention my name to his attorney or someone in the chancery judges office leaked word of my inquiries to my grandfather that has to be it i called the judges chambers during the ride from dr cages office to my mothers shop so that id have some idea of a time frame on exhumation when i discussed it with my mother but mom and i never got that far and now what i had planned as a discreet little operation has like everything else become known to my grandfather well he roars what do you have to say for yourself remarkably my mother interposes herself between grandpapa and me this may be a first dont shout at her daddy she pleads cats not herself right now what do you mean he bellows shes dealing with some problems he grits his teeth and nods angrily oh i know shes got problems shes had problems her whole life just like ann ive spent half my life cleaning up their problems but today it stops today im done today im doing some budnipping before this girl causes this whole town a problem it cant afford what are you talking about i ask the casino goddamn it im talking about the salvation of this city we are one hairsbreadth from federal certification of the natchez indian nation and theres not a damn thing the state gaming commission can do to stop it but you he jabs a thick forefinger in my directionyou could blow the whole thing right out of the water with your questions and theories and getting tied up in the middle of mass murder and now you want to dig up luke ferrys decomposed body for the whole town to read about in the newspaper well im telling you right now thats not going to happen unless its part of an official criminal investigation you need your mothers approval to dig that body up mom almost cowers when he glances in her direction and i know that shes not about to give me what i need but i will not cower im done with that i take a step toward my grandfather then i guess im going to have to make this a criminal investigation i didnt want to but youre not leaving me any choice ill get the natchez police out here and ill drag the fbi into it too before im done ill turn malmaison into a threering circus if thats what it takes to find out the truth the truth grandpapa echoes you think its the truth youre after thats all ive ever been after but all youve given me is lies every new story was just another lie to keep me from digging any deeper what are you afraid of grandpapa what cant you bear to have anyone find out about you he glances at my mother again then looks at the ground when he finally raises his head his eyes burn into mine its not myself ive been trying to protect its you the bottom of this damn mystery youre so keen to solve is something i prayed youd never have to know and ive done everything in my power to keep it from you but you wont let this go youll tear down this house this family everything ive built to get what you want youve proved that soyou want the truth a strange thrumming has started in the back of my head but theres no turning back now i do you want to know who killed your father yes you did the sound of rain is so vivid that i put up my hands to shield my face my mother and grandfather suddenly waver in my vision as though were all standing underwater i want to speak but theres nothing left to say with two simple words all my questions have been answered every piece in the chaotic puzzle of my life has finally fallen into place the long black train that plowed silently over me in the gleaming kitchen of arthur legendre has circled around again the great black face of its engine roars out of nowhere blotting out the scene before me people grass trees and sky in the last instant before impact searing images pass behind my eyes the new orleans murder victims naked and mutilated nathan malik lying dead in a motel bathtub a human skull in his lap ann sprawled on the floor of the clinic with two skullandcrossbones symbols drawn on her abdomen her stuffed turtle beside her but nowhere do i see my fathers face i try to summon it but all that appears is a necklace of ears a sculpture of a hanged man photographs of naked children and two black shadows fighting above me in the dark and then i see nothing at all chapter im running harder and faster than ive ever run in my life tree trunks flash past the way they used to when i rode horses on the island but its only my legs hurling me forward my feet flying from something too terrible to face you want to know who killed your father no i want to turn back time push back the days to the point before i began asking questionsquestions to which i thought i wanted answers now i know better some things its better not know pearlies voice michael wellss house appears between the distant trees the sight of it brings a strange feeling of hope the way a thief might feel sighting a church his sole chance at sanctuary i sprint harder and soon the shining blue rectangle of the hemmeters swimming pool appears but the hemmeters are gone now the pool like the house belongs to michael too many changes i stumble down to the concrete patio that surrounds the pool my eyes plumbing its blue depths part of me wants only to slip beneath the surface to lie on the bottom and hold my breath while my heartbeats get further and further apart stretching into ever increasing increments of time eventually reaching infinity but thats not the way it happens deprived of oxygen the heart will eventually beat harder and faster struggling to feed the starving tissues until at last it squirms frantically and uselessly in the chest i would kick to the surface then not even a death wish can suppress instinct honed over millions of years that takes coercion or a suicide method from which there is no turning back like intravenous morphine that probably plunged ann into blissful sleep so fast that any second thoughts quickly faded into oblivion but i doubt shed have turned back even if she could in some people the pain of living minute to minute simply grows so acute that they can finally stand to look into the face of death without blinkingeven look at death as a friendand cross that river dr malik talked about without a backward glance for me even though ive crawled right up to the black rim of suicide pain has always been preferable to the void until now theres a light on in michaels house that alone draws me past the pool and up to the french doors at the back of the house suddenly im banging on the glass banging hard and the pain shooting up to my elbow doesnt stop me but only reminds me that im alive i see movement inside and then michael is hurrying to the door his face all concern before he can speak i throw my arms around his neck stand on tiptoe and hug him as tightly as i can hey hey whats the matter he asks what happened did you and your mother have an argument i want to answer but my chest is heaving against him in great racking sobs that make my whole body shudder i killed my father i scream but nothing comes from my throat calm down michael says stroking my hair whatever it is we can deal with it i shake my head violently staring at him through a screen of tears youve got to tell me what happened cat this time my mouth forms the words but again no sound emerges then like a distraught child i manage to stammer out the truth michaels eyes go wide for an instant but then he pulls me tight against him your grandfather told you that i nod into his chest did he give you any proof i shake my head but i feel itthe minute he said it i felt id finally heard the truth only what asks michael i was eight years old could i really have shot my father michael sighs with deep sadness when i moved back to natchez it was autumn and one of the first things that struck me was all the pictures in the newspaper of seven and eightyearolds whod shot their first deer i close my eyes in desolation i thought about the possibility yesterday he says i told you that if it was your father who had molested you it could have been pearlie or your mother who shot him but yesit could have been you patricide is certainly the most convincing scenario for your retreat into silence what am i doing here i wonder standing in the house of a man i barely know shaking like an epileptic if that is what happened michael says if you did shoot your father it was a clear act of selfpreservation if an eightyearold girl was driven to the point where she had to shoot her father no one in the world would question the rightness of her actions i hear michaels words but they have no effect words cannot penetrate the wounded region of my soul he seems to sense this keeping one arm tight around me he leads me to the master bedroom pulls back the covers and sits me on the edge of the bed he kneels and removes my shoes then stretches me out on the bed and pulls the covers up to my neck dont move from this spot ill be back in a minute he vanishes leaving me in the cool dry darkness of his airconditioned bedroom i feel strangely at home here mr and mrs hemmeter slept in this room for more than thirty years they loved me like a daughter and something of their spirits must remain michael reappears beside the bed a glass of water in his hand this is a lorcet plus itll take the edge off i take the white pill from his hand and pop it into my mouth but as the glass touches my lips i realize im making a terrible mistake i spit out the pill and put it on the bedside table whats the matter michael asks i cant take this are you allergic to hydrocodone i look up into his concerned eyes wishing i didnt have to tell him the truth why has he done all this for me hes disrupted his entire life to help me theres got to be a reason for that but i cant lie to him anymore not even by omission im pregnant i tell him my eyes never leaving his he doesnt flinch the way my mother did when i mentioned my fathers mistress but something changes behind his eyes the warmth slowly dissipates into a cool and wary look whos the father the married detective yes he stares silently at me for a few moments ill make you some tea instead he says awkwardly decaf he turns and walks quickly to the door michael wait he turns and looks back his face pale his eyes confused i didnt want this i tell him it wasnt planned or anything but im not going to terminate it i should have told you before now i guess but i was so embarrassed i didnt want you to think badly of me but nowwith everything else you know its absurd to hold anything back my next words take more courage than swimming into the middle of the mississippi river if you want me to go ill understand he only stares at me his eyes unreadable ill get the tea he says finally i never got the tea i never took the lorcet either but exhaustion gave me that most precious of giftsdreamless sleep when michael woke me a few minutes ago the clock beside the bed read pm i felt neither rested nor tired i felt numb the room is all shadows now cast by the spill from the bathroom light michael has pulled a chair up beside the bed hes watching me as he might a patient in the icu at least he hasnt asked me how i feel what do you want to do he says i dont know what do you think i should do go back to sleep see how you feel in the morning ill stay in one of the guest rooms upstairs if you need me you can call my cell phone i dont want to be alone tonight he doesnt reply he doesnt even blink im not trying to make a pass or anything i tell him i just dont think i should be by myself right now you know he cocks one eyebrow at me thats the first time a woman ever threatened to kill herself if i didnt sleep with her id like to laugh but i cant theres nothing left in me i slide across the bed and pull back the comforter michael stares at the blank space in the bed then gets up and walks into his closet when he returns hes wearing a pair of blue gym shorts and an emory university tshirt he sits on the edge of the bed and sets the alarm clock then slides under the covers and pulls them up to his chest it seems a weird parody of married life both of us lying on our backs staring at the ceiling as though weve been together twenty years and said all there was to say long ago i expect him to talk to probe me with questions but he doesnt what does he think of me does he regret the moment that he walked into his backyard and picked up the net to rescue me from the bottom of his swimming pool tentatively i slide my hand over the cool sheet and take his hand in mine theres nothing sexual in the touch im holding his hand the way i must have held my fathers long agobefore he twisted our relationship into a perverted shadow of parental love it takes a while but michael squeezes my hand in return i may be mistaken but it feels as though hes shaking im sure he wouldnt want me to notice so i say nothing after a time another realization hits me michael is hard i know this without feeling his erection against me its something about the way hes lying a tension in his body this knowledge does something to me it always has i feel not only desire but a sense of compulsion even obligation in the same way a match exists to be struck or a loaded gun to be fired the erect penis is a potential waiting to be released ive seen a loaded rifle instantly transform a roomful of men from ennui to alertness the moment a bullet enters the chamber the inanimate weapon takes on an almost living presence dangerous and impossible to ignore for me in this moment michaels penis is the same i can help you with that i say softly what i nudge his hip with mine that how did you know i just do he keeps staring at the ceiling why would you do that i dont know because you need it you can kiss me if you want hes silent for a time then he says i dont want to kiss you right now not like this i cant help the other ive had a thing for you for a really long time but i dont want to be what other men have been to you i squeeze his hand we dont have to make love i can just use my hand orwhatever michael pulls his hand out of mine and i hear his breathing stop then he turns on his side and looks at me i can barely make out his eyes in the dark i dont want that he says okay thats not the way this is supposed to happen you may not know that but you need to learn now go to sleep ill talk to you in the morning i guess i know how he looks at me now i suppose i should be embarrassed but im not i should probably feel regret but i dont here i lie pregnant by a married man sleeping next to the first nice guy ive come to know in a very long time and i feel nothing at all when you dream the same dream over and over you begin to wonder whether like a hindu who has lived an immoral life your punishment is to be reincarnated again and again in the same body unable to rise up the chain of being until you learn the elusive lesson of your sin im back inside the rusted pickup truck my grandfather behind the wheel were rolling up the sloping hill of the old pasture i hate the stink inside the truck sometimes a river breeze blows it out of the cab but today the air hangs dead and still over the island as though trapped under the overturned bowl of steelgray clouds my grandfather grits his teeth as he drives he hasnt spoken since we left the house i might as well not be here but i am and soon we will crest the hillcrest it and sight the pond on the other side i dont want to see the pond i dont want to see my father walk across the water like jesus and pull open the bullet hole in his chest i already know what hes trying to tell me i already know that i killed him why wont he let me rest if i could apologize to him there might be some reason for this dream but i cant i cant speak at all goddamn rain grandpapa mutters he downshifts and steps on the gas and we trundle over the hill the cows are waiting for us as they always are their eyes glassy with indifference beyond them lies the pond a perfect silver mirror reflecting only sky to my right the prize bull mounts the cow and begins lunging forward grandpapa smiles dreading the sight of my father in the water i cover my eyes with my hands but sooner or later i will have to look i peer between my fingers and brace myself against the horror i know is to come but it doesnt come today the pond is empty my father isnt floating on its surface his arms splayed out like those of a man on a cross the perfect mirror remains undisturbed grandpapa brakes as we roll toward the pond then stops twenty yards from the waters edge i smell decay rotting plants and fish where is my father whats happened to my dream even something terrible is more comforting than the unknown i turn to grandpapa to ask a question but i dont know what the question is i couldnt ask it anyway fear is clawing around in my chest like a trapped animal trying to get out a new smell cuts through the decay of the pond something manmade its the tonic grandpapa uses on his hair lucky tiger goddamn rain he says again as i stare through the windshield a curtain of rain sweeps across my field of vision like a great gray shadow all the leaves trembling under its weight in seconds the glassy surface of the pond is sizzling like water thrown into a hot skillet pearlie told me once that a person is like a raindrop sent from heaven alone but destined to rejoin all the other drops at journeys end i cant remember heaven so i must have left it a long time ago yet i still have such a long way to fall all right now grandpapa says he reaches across the seat takes hold of my knees and turns me sideways like a man shifting a sack of seeds when he moves toward me i beseech him with my eyes he hesitates like a man who has forgotten his car keys then he reaches under the seat pulls out lena the leopardess and shoves her into my hands as i shut my eyes and press her soft fur against my cheek a feeling like warm water spreads through my body the rain sweeps over the truck as grandpapa pushes me back on the seat and the hard percussive patter of raindrops on a tin roof fills my ears when his big hands unsnap my jeans i dont feel them when his leather belt creaks and jingles i dont hear it lena and i are a million miles away padding through the jungle listening to the endless music of the rain and it begins when i wake to sunlight streaming through michaels bedroom i know like saul on the road to damascus the scales have been stripped from my eyes my recurring dream was no dream at all but a memory a memory trying to come back to me any way it could the business of my father walking on water was something grafted onto it a different message from my subconscious pointing me toward something ive yet to learn and today i will learn it where michael lay beside me in the bed i find a note on the pillow with a house key lying on top of it the note reads gone to work tried to wake you but you wouldnt budge youre welcome to stay as long as you need to call me at the office when you wake up michael i take michaels phone off the bedside table and dial seans cell number detective sergeant regan tell me you got the autopsy report cat i moved heaven and earth to get that fucking thing but its not to be had john kaisers sitting on it like national security depends on it if you want that report youre going to have to ask kaiser for it im sorry babe i tried my best i hesitate only a moment give me kaisers cell number shit are you sure the bureaus still looking for you if kaiser really wanted to find me id be in jail now yeah i guess youre right sean reads out the number i commit it to memory then hang up and dial it kaiser catches his breath when he hears my voice do you have something for me he asks no i need something from you thats not the answer i was looking for cat the only reason youre not in jail is because i thought you could help me solve this case i can but its a quid pro quo situation you help me with my problem ill help you with yours christ what do you want now if i seem too anxious to get the autopsy report kaiser might not give it to me tell me where you are with the murders first what about the saliva cultures any streptococcus mutans growth yet not yet the pathologist thinks its still early though that well see it by the thirtysixhour point no twentyfour hours is enough if its there the saliva in those wounds is either coming from someone without teeth or someone taking penicillin with gentamicin you havent found any victims relatives who fit that description weve got a couple of male relatives with dentures im going at them hard but they look clean to me talk to their families if they wear their dentures at all theyre not the source what about the antibiotic angle thats tough to nail down kaiser complains anybody could lie about that we cant take blood levels on every male relative of six murder victims why not the dna evidence proves the source is male and this is your only real lead the british police did blood tests on thousands of people in one town to solve a murder case this is america cat not england okay okay any sign of anaerobic spirochetes in the cultures bacteroides melaninogenicus anaerobic vibrios those are specific for teeth and we could rule out edentulous people shit im lookingi dont see anything like that its still early for those to show up and theyre difficult to culture anyway ill keep thinking about this angle what about the skull in maliks lap nothing the only fingerprints on it were maliks naturally what else kaiser blows out a stream of air in frustration were checking all filmprocessing labs in the hope that someones done work for malik it was video equipment we found in his apartment but im hoping for a break what else ive got the technical services guys trying to resurrect data off the drives we took from maliks office computers but theyve got nothing so far i think his film really is our only chance but if the killer got that when he killed malikwere fucked im sorry i havent been more help to you ive had my hands full here you just get me the names of the women in group x do that and ill keep your ass out of jail im trying john but i need your help too what do you need his voice is wary the same thing i asked you for yesterday the autopsy report on my aunt what are you looking for cause of death what you know what im looking for her reproductive organs anything out of the ordinary kaiser takes his time to answer i shouldnt give you this my throat tightens didnt you tell me that ann was obsessed with having children yes well that makes no sense at all cat why not because your aunt was sterile she had been for decades probably from the time she was a teenager what do you mean sterile how her tubes were tied something goes hollow inside me thats impossible the pathologist must have made a mistake you know better kaiser says wearily and the sterilization wasnt done by any normal procedure either thats how the pathologist knew it was done a long time ago how was it done apparently in a tubal ligation the procedure is done fairly low down the fallopian tube your aunts tubes were cut just below something called the fimbria a flowerlike opening of the tube just below the ovary they were tied off with silk sutures and the silk was still inside the scarred tissue at autopsy the pathologist said obs havent used silk for that procedure in decades a cloud of fog has descended in my mind i know this is giving you some ideas about your personal situation cat please try to stay calm okay maybe you should call dr goldman did the pathologist say anything else he said that an ob wouldnt cut off the fimbria that was something a general surgeon might do as a quick method of sterilizing somebody he thought it was damned odd my hands are shaking but not from fear this time its outrage i have to go john no he says quickly you cant just go ive given you a lot of rope to play with and im afraid youre going to hang us both ive got superiors to answer to like it or not and every hour youre on the street comes out of my credibility im looking for some help here michaels clock reads am give me eight hours john in that time ill have something to give you or ill come back to new orleans and let you throw me to the wolves the silence seems interminable what can you possibly learn in natchez that can help me he asks probably nothing but i dont really give a shit i just need you off my back eight hours he says softly cat if i havent heard from you by five oclock today ill have the natchez police pick you up on suspicion of murder if they can find me thanks john hey could you fax me the autopsy report another pause im a member of her family for gods sake please youre a pain in the ass is what you are do you want it sent to the same number where we sent you those files on malik perfect ill talk to you before five cat i hang up then get up and run for the bathroom my fathers body is coming out of the ground today and nothing is going to stop that if the judge needs an affidavit from my mother to issue a court order for exhumation hell get one there will be no more denial for the women of the desalle family denial is death chapter mom is sitting at her kitchen table in a sweatsoaked housecoat staring blankly into a mug of coffee she doesnt even look up at the sound of the door only when i sit down opposite her do her eyes rise to take me in has grandpapa been here i ask she shrugs ive already slipped into my grandfathers office and retrieved the autopsy report that kaiser faxed there i was lucky grandpapa wasnt in his office when it arrivedthough part of me wished he had beenbut my luck ended when i tried to borrow another pistol from his gun safe the combination had been changed i have some things to tell you mom they wont be easy to hear but you dont have a choice anymore you owe it to ann her eyes are shot with blood and the skin of the orbits gleams blueblack but her mind seems alert whatever drug she was on yesterday has been flushed from her system in a soft but deliberate voice i tell her what the pathologist discovered during anns autopsy that she was sterilized many years ago by an unorthodox procedure probably during her emergency appendectomy on the island mom listens like someone being told that her child has been tortured to death i have the sense that if i pricked her face with a needle she wouldnt flinch theres something else i add i had a dream last night its the recurring one about riding in the old pickup truck with grandpapa last night i saw the end of it he parked by the pond and thenmom he started touching me her eyes remain focused on the table and right before he took my pants down he pulled lena from under the seat and stuck her in my arms a trembling has begun in my mothers hands thats how they found ann i remind her with timid thomas beside her naked body i had a dream last night too mom says softly youyou did she lifts her coffee cup to her lips takes a sip then sets it rattling on the saucer something happened on the island when i was young she says in a voice ive never heard from her there is no affect no illusion nothing added for the benefit of the listener i was fourteen it was summer and id gotten to be friends with a boy there a negro boy he was a year older than i it was innocent mostly but toward the end of the summer we did some touching he touched me anyway she takes another sip of coffee the tremor in her hand so pronounced that i fear shell drop the cup wed meet by an old shack near the river nobody ever went there but one day a cousin of mine followed us and he saw jesse touching me the boys name was jesse i flash back to a black man speaking through burnscarred lips i knew your mama pretty well yes jesse billups at last her eyes focus on mine yes he was in love with me my godmom i talked to him the other day how did he look all right i guess he seemed to have a lot of anger in him im sure he does after what happened to him in the war he used to be handsome believe it or not i did what i could for him he has the best job on the island now jesus thats not saying much is it she shrugs as if it hardly matters now the day my cousin saw us he told his father and his father told my father a chill goes through me what happened daddy went down to jesses parents house that night dragged jesse outside and beat him within an inch of his life jesse billupss words come back to me with perfect clarity dr kirkland beat me once when i was a boy beat me bad but id have done the same thing in his place so were square enough on that tears are running down my mothers face i grab a paper towel from the counter and hand it to her mom she laughs strangely a note of hysteria in her voice i thought daddy did that because jesse was black you see and i was miserable afterward i was like you i wouldnt talk and daddy got madder and madder at me finally he demanded to know why i wouldnt say anything what did you tell him that hed beaten jesse like the boy had raped me or something but the truth was that id wanted jesse to touch me i try to imagine my grandfather hearing this from his daughter in what happened daddys face went white we were staying in a suite at the peabody in memphis he yanked me up from my chair and dragged me back to their bedroom he took off his belt and whipped me till i bled and then he kept on whipping me what was grandmama doing mom shakes her head as if genuinely curious i dont know she disappeared the way you disappeared when i was a girl and grandpapa was angry the thing is mom goes on the thing i forgot and didnt remember until my dream last night was that he stripped me naked before he did it he stripped me my own father threw me on the bed and tore my clothes off and while he hit me he yelled things vile things he called me a sluta dirty whore i didnt even know what those words meant but the worst part was his face his eyes what about them it wasnt just anger i saw in them cat a rush of terrifying images flashes through my mind wild unseeing eyes and a raging mouth what was it mom closes her eyes and shakes her head like some primitive woman afraid to name a demon mama what did you see in his eyes her answer is a fearful whisper jealousy a shudder passes through my body leaving fear in its wake but somewhere beneath the fear is a feeling of elation she knows i realize more than that she knows she knows do you have any memories of grandpapa touching you she shakes her head but you were right about what you said about my problems there are things i cant do i was such a disappointment to your father he was very understanding and i wanted to do the things he wantedthey were normal things but i just couldnt if luke got behind me my throat would close up and id feel like i had to go to the bathroom right that second urinate you mean she blushes deep red no and if he tried i felt terrible pain i dont want to talk about that all right i cant im not sure what im actually remembering and what i might be making up but one thing i do remember she crushes the paper towel into a wet ball and wipes her eyes but it wont stop the fresh tears the way ann looked at me in the evenings especially when mom was gone to play bridge ann would go into daddys study to keep him occupied and i would stay in my room i knew she hated going in there i knew she was afraid of him i was too down deep though i wouldnt have admitted that to anyone not even to myself how could i be afraid of my daddy he loved me and took care of me but whenever ann left me to spend time with him she looked at me the way youd look at something you were trying to protect moms chin is quivering like a little girls im not sure she can endure much more of this and now she says now i know thats exactly what she was doing protecting me from him she was only four years older butdear god i cant stand to think about it she crumples over the table sobbing uncontrollably i lean down over her and hug her as tight as i can i love you mom i love you so much i dont know howat least ann tried to protect me but i didnt protect youmy own baby you couldnt i whisper you couldnt even protect yourself she sits up and grits her teeth obviously furious at herself mom you didnt even know what had happened to you not consciously i dont think you knew until last night but how is that possible her eyes implore me for an answer ann knew why didnt i i think we all shut it out because to admit what he did to us would have been admitting that he didnt love us that he wasnt taking care of us for usbut for him to use mom takes my hand in hers and squeezes it in a clawlike grip what are you going to do cat im going to make him admit what he did she shakes her head her eyes filled with terror hell never do that hell have no choice im going to prove that he did it and then im going to see him punished for it hell kill you cat he will i start to deny it but mom is right grandpapa sterilized his tenyearold daughter so that he could continue to molest her after puberty without fear of pregnancy he murdered her future children for a few brief years of pleasure and in the end that drove her mad he murdered my father to protect himself he wouldnt hesitate to kill me for the same reason did he ever say anything like that to you i ask did he threaten to harm you no mom says her voice tiny but suddenly her eyes jerk in their sockets ill kill your mother she hisses ill send mama down the river and shell never come back just like the little niggers who disappeared mom is speaking in the half whisper of a terrified child and the sound leaves me cold i hug her again in reassurance i know youre afraid of him but im not the best protection we have is the truth and the truth is in daddys coffin her eyes flicker why do you think that what can lukes body tell you im not sure it may be that lena is the answer in my dream daddy was trying to tell me something about lena and i have to find out what it is do you really believe that that he was trying to reach you no i think i saw something on the night daddy died saw it and then blocked it out but i wont know what it was until they open that coffin and i look inside maybe not even then it might take a repeat autopsy but momi cant do any of this without your help she looks down at the table fear battling something else in her eyes luke was a sweet boy she murmurs whatever he went through overseas hurt him badly but it was our family that finished him off i wait for more but she doesnt speak again mom will you help me when her eyes finally rise to meet mine i see something i never saw in them as a child courage tell me what to do she says chapter the gravediggers have been at work for over two hours their sweatsoaked backs bent over shovels and spades in heat thats already blistering at am there are six of them elderly but muscular black men in khaki work suits they dig slowly but steadily like longdistance runners their forearms rippling in the sun and they take cigarette breaks every half hour they retire behind a wall to do this sharing their kools with the backhoe operator who sits on his yellow machine like an emperor waiting to move the casket the last few yards to the funeral homes van because it lies in the oldest most thickly wooded part of the cemetery our family plot poses problems for the backhoe but the gravediggers have got the coffin uncovered now its burnished lid gleams dully in the sun theyre widening the hole for their straps and soon a hoist will bring up what was meant to lie here for eternity it took ninety minutes of dedicated effort to set this process in motion first i drove my mother to the wall street office of michael wellss attorney whod left his breakfast to meet us to make out an affidavit then we walked across the street to the courthouse and filed the affidavit with the chancery judge who signed an ex parte court order authorizing exhumation for a repeat autopsy on luke ferry with the court order in hand i dropped mom by her shop and called the funeral director the cemetery superintendent and the medical examiner in jackson the medical examiners office was so agreeable that i suspected theyd received a call from special agent kaiser of the fbi as prescribed by custom in mississippi the funeral director is present as a witness a kind and florid man of seventy mr mcdonough has monopolized the white burial trade in natchez for fifty years he stands in the shade in his shirtsleeves his black suit jacket folded over a brick wall he discouraged my intention to view the remains as he put it i tried to allay mr mcdonoughs anxieties by telling him i have considerable experience with both death and autopsies but he only sighed and said no matter how much experience you have when its your own folks its different ill know in a few minutes my primary concern is the condition of my fathers body mr mcdonough checked his records this morning and learned that daddys coffin wasnt placed in a vault before burial which simplifies the exhumation process but also increases the chance that water has penetrated the casket my grandfatherwho handled the funeral arrangementsis apparently one of the few who knows the origin of the custom of using vaults in america in the last century to gain admission to medical school applicants were required to provide one cadaver this resulted in a great many thefts of corpses the coffin vault was adopted as a deterrent to body snatching because two or three strong men were required to lift the vault off a coffin most people today buy vaults believing that theyll prevent water from reaching their beloved and this is partly true but eternity is a very long time water carved the grand canyon and it can penetrate anything made by man given enough time grandpapa saw no reason to pay good money for a preventive measure that was only temporary he did however buy the finest bronze casket available probably to impress his friends and to appease my distraught mother that particular model had a gumrubber burp seal which allows gases from decomposition to escape the coffin but prevents the entry of moisture so theres a decent chance that i wont have to endure a horror show when they open the lid ive passed the morning by watching the mound of dark earth slowly grow beside the grave ive visited as often as i could over the years its less dirt than youd expect graves arent six feet deep anymore by law only twentyfour inches of earth are required above the casket lid just enough to keep dogs from uncovering the dead after the mourners have gone one of the gravediggers in the hole shouts for something called a crows foot a man with a red bandanna on his head brings a fivefootlong bar with a flat toe on one end to the edge of the grave i move closer to the hole and watch the first man insert the toe of the crows foot under the end of my fathers coffin you got to break the vacuum see says mr mcdonough whos now standing at my shoulder that coffin lies there all those years it really settles into the dirt but once you break that seal you can pull her right on up the coffin comes loose with a sucking sound like opening a tupperware dish with something old inside the gravediggers climb down into the hole and sling heavy straps under both ends of the coffin then set up a block and tackle with the combined efforts of man and machine the long bronze box is soon resting on the grass beside the hole though covered with brown dirt the casket still gleams like something brought up from a pharaohs tomb in egypt mr mcdonough signals the backhoe operator to move as close as he can to the obstructing wall as the driver cranks up the diesel engine i tell mcdonough to have him stand down something wrong miss ferry i want to open it mr mcdonough is obviously perturbed by my request out here in the sun its done routinely with exhumations for retrieving dna samples the funeral director is well practiced at looking unflappable but my aggressiveness with the dead is clearly not to his taste well ive never done one that way he says finally nevertheless he shrugs in surrender the family owns the body you can do what you want ill open her up for you thank you he takes a hexagonal key from his pocket bends over the foot of the casket and begins turning a recessed nut the tupperware sound returns this time magnified tenfold a long slow release of pressure that carries with it the chemical odor of embalming fluid i tried to prepare myself before i came by studying some old photographs of daddy but the dead never quite resemble our memory of the living the body changes quickly after death mostly through loss of water even if hes well preserved the man i see when they open the box might look like a stranger to me hell be wearing a suit which alone would make him a stranger in my eyes i never saw my father in a suit never saw him wear anything but faded levis and a tshirt i thought they should have buried him in that but the day before the funeral aunt ann showed up with an expensive black suit that i suspected belonged to one of her exhusbands mr mcdonough straightens up from the casket and looks at me with something like challenge in his eyes you want me to open it now please he turns and lifts the upper half of the coffin lid until the hinges stop then walks away without looking inside the gravediggers have moved away though whether to escape the sight or the smell i dont know it might be out of respect but i doubt it if i werent here they would be horsing around like men on any job ive seen it enough times to know the open coffin lid blocks my view ill have to walk around the casket to see inside my palms are sweating contrary to what most people believe embalming is designed to provide a wellpreserved corpse for viewing at the funeral home but not much longer if the embalmer does a poor job the corpse can quickly become something like a prop in a horror movie a ghoul floating in its own rotting fluids even if the embalmer does an excellent job anaerobic bacteria can survive in the body waiting only for the slightest bit of moisture to begin the process of decomposition mr mcdonough looks pointedly at his watch as i take my first step i force myself to recall my time in bosnia working with the war crimes commission when the un backhoes uncovered the long trench i saw three hundred men women and children in various stages of decomposition mothers holding infants toddlers riddled with machinegun bullets little girls clinging to dolls the last things they saw before their skulls were caved in by rifle butts whatever is in this casket cant compare with that in horror and yetthe funeral directors voice whispers in my mind when its your own folks its different i step around the casket and look down my first reaction is disbelief except for the black suit my father looks much as he did in life to a passerby he would appear to be a young man napping quietly after sunday dinner a whiskery black beard covers his cheeks and chin a beard he never wore in life this beard is not made of hairits moldbut compared to the terrible changes i could have seen a beard of mold is nothing would you look at that says mr mcdonough a certain pride in his voice he looks as good as medgar evers lena the leopardess lies cradled in the crook of my fathers arm the sight of her orangeandblackspotted fur is almost more than i can bear i slept with lena every night until my father was buried and except for my dreams i havent seen her in twentythree years they exhumed old medgar for james earl rays trial a few years back says mr mcdonough and he looked like theyd just buried him your daddys the same old jimmy white was doing my prep work back then you cant find help like that now could i have a few moments please oh yes maam mr mcdonough takes a few steps back i feel like a character in a disney fairy tale as though ive struggled on a long journey to get to this spot and now by simply bending over and kissing his cold lips i can wake my sleeping prince and live happily ever after but i cant the longer i look at my fathers face the more certain that becomes his cheeks have actually sunken in quite a bithis eyes too despite the plastic eye caps they put beneath the lids to maintain the illusion of normalcy with a quick motion like a bird pecking at something on the ground i bend and pluck lena from daddys arms close it up i say mr mcdonough closes the casket and signals his van to approach you saw me remove this stuffed animal correct i say yes maam i know i should wait but i cant mr mcdonough could you come with me to my car for a minute he glances at his watch again i really should be getting back to the home theres a service going on right now i meet his eyes and silently plead for chivalry something that almost always works with southern men well just for a minute he says could you bring your jacket he retrieves his jacket from the wall then follows me to my mothers maxima which is parked on the grass between two walled plots i open the trunk and remove the box of forensic chemicals i brought from new orleans to use in my bedroom the sight of the luminol bottle makes me think of little natriece and her saucer eyes on the day she spilled the fluid and found the bloody footprints this job is too sensitive for luminol which not only consumes the iron in hemoglobin as it reacts with it but also damages the genetic markers in the blood it detects making valid dna testing impossible today im going to use orthotolidine which will reveal any latent blood on lenas coat but also maintain the integrity of the genetic markers could you get inside with me i ask climbing into the drivers seat after a brief hesitation the funeral director gets into the passenger seat beside me whats in that bottle a chemical that detects hidden blood he purses his lips this some kind of criminal investigation yes could you hold up your jacket so that it covers my hands and the leopard i guess so youre not going to ruin it are you no sir as he unfolds his jacket i carefully examine lena parting the orangeandblack fur beneath her jaw i can still see the stitching where pearlie repaired her after the night my father died like this asks mr mcdonough making a tent of his jacket perfect i hold lena under the tent with my left hand and spray some orthotolidine on her coat with my right then i turn her in my hands and cover her other side with the chemical what happens now asks mr mcdonough we wait photographers once used suit jackets as portable darkrooms in the field the advent of digital photography has probably made that practice a thing of the past but on this day the knowledge serves me well can you turn on some ac mr mcdonough asks no we dont want this chemical blowing around the car is it toxic or something no i lie huh well whats supposed to happen if theres blood itll glow blue how long does it take a minute or two mr mcdonough looks interested can i see yes if we get anything i want you to witness it after two minutes pass i raise the tail of the jacket and peer into the darkness lenas head is glowing as though painted with bluedyed phosphorous my heart is pounding grandpapa never mentioned lena in any version of the story he told me of the night my father died but he definitely told me to put her into the coffin and soon i may know why what do you see asks the funeral director blood can i look he sounds like an excited fouryearold in a minute i carefully turn lena in my hands and examine her head though smeared quite a bitprobably from cleaning by pearliethe blood appears to have been deposited in small gouts theres also some fine spray that pearlie apparently missed with her cleaning rag most of the blood seems to have been deposited on lenas head while very little touched her body its almost as though her head was stuffed into a wound to try to stanch severe bleeding did daddy shove my favorite stuffed animal into his chest to try to save himself its certainly possible though with the large exit wound in his back that measure wouldnt have saved him youre looking right at the answer says a voice in my head looking but not seeing the blue glow is stronger now slowly i turn lenas head and examine it from every angle i study the stitches beneath her chin why was she torn there if daddy stuffed her head into a bullet wound what could have torn her cloth covering a smashed rib possibly as i turn lenas head to examine her nose the answer hits me like ice water thrown in my face on top of lenas snout is a perfect arch of glowing blue almost exactly the size of the maxillary arch in an adult human being theres not enough detail to make a comparison with individual teeth but i know without checking that the arch on lenas fur will perfectly match the arch of daddys upper teeth my father suffocated to death for the first time the reality of that night plays out in my minds eye exactly as it happened grandpapa shoved lena into daddys mouth possibly to muffle his screams of pain but more probably to finish the job of murdering him while daddy lay bleeding on the floor like a gutshot deer while pearlie ran down from the big house to the slave quarters my grandfather shoved my favorite companion down daddys throat and held his nose to finish him off to silence him forever but my father will be silent no longer like the blood of abel daddys blood is crying out from the ground and like abels murderer my grandfather will soon be marked marked and punished can i look now asks mr mcdonough i nod absently he lifts the jacket and stares into the darkness ill be damned just like csi just like that i murmur i need to see the body again sir he rolls down the window and cranes his neck to look around vans already carried it back to the home i need to see it before it goes to jackson youd better get going then the van from the medical examiners office could already be waiting there theyll just transfer the coffin between vehicles without ever taking it into the prep room i crank the engine back the car onto the asphalt lane and accelerate toward the cemetery gate four hundred yards away you got to drop me at my car remember says mr mcdonough i cant take the time ill bring you right back he glares at me you stop this car right now young lady this is a murder investigation sir an fbi matter please sit back in your seat i dont know if mr mcdonough believes me or not but he sits back and shuts up thank god for small favors chapter outside mcdonoughs funeral home cars are parked along the street for two blocks in all directions its a natchez tradition you see the parked cars along here and you know someone has died someone white blacks have their own funeral homes their own cemeteries too some things take a long time to change turn at the railroad tracks says mr mcdonough the prep rooms just inside the garage door i turn left then left again and pull into a long vehicle bay a tall black hearse stands gleaming in the sun with several expensive sedans parked behind it they probably belong to the family of the decedent having his service inside this way says mcdonough he walks into an enclosed garage past a dodge caravan fitted with rollers in the back beyond that stands the econoline van that was at the cemetery a teenager is washing mud out of it with a green garden hose man from jackson come yet mcdonough asks the boy no sir your lucky day he says over his shoulder past the garage door a short corridor lined with upended caskets wrapped in plastic leads to a door marked with a biohazard symbol mcdonough knocks but no one answers he pushes open the door my fathers coffin lies on the floor of the prep room the bronze has been wiped down probably to keep mud out of the prep room rather than from any gesture of respect this time i dont wait for mcdonough i go to the coffin and open the lid myself do you suture the gums shut i ask or do you use the needle injector system you know your business he says weve been using needle injectors since they come out steeling myself against the emotions boiling in my chest i don a pair of latex gloves from a box on the counter then bend over my father and touch the line of his mouth gentle pressure does not part his lips sometimes we have to use super glue says mcdonough to keep them closed other times vaseline does the trick trying not to tear the desiccated skin i pry a little harder the lips part the first thing i see is two lengths of silver wire twisted tightly together and folded back under the lips this is what keeps the teeth together during the viewing of the body small screws are fired into the bones of the upper and lower gums by a springloaded injector each screw has a fourinch length of wire attached using forceps a technician twists the two lengths together tightening them until the corpses teeth come together then the technician snips the leftover wire and tucks the twist out of sight wire cutters i ask mcdonough goes to a drawer and rummages noisily through it here you go careful not to damage my fathers teeth i fit the blades around the twisted wires and snip them in half the mandible sags immediately mocking the mindless gape of sleep you looking for something in his mouth asks the funeral director yes what im not sure i tilt my fathers head back a little then open his mouth wide and insert lenas head into it what the hell mutters the funeral director turn off the lights please he obeys a few moments after the lights go out my pupils dilate sufficiently to see the glow produced by the orthotolidine reacting with the blood on lenas fur as i suspected the glowing arch on her snout perfectly matches my fathers maxillary arch lights please i say trying to keep my voice steady i cant begin to name the feelings swirling through me its a nauseating combination of excitement and dread ive been hunting killers for a long time but it strikes me in this moment that ive been hunting only one killer all my life the knock on the prep room door makes me jump when mcdonough opens the door an elderly man stands there looking inside with obvious curiosity im from the medical examiners office he says mcdonough looks at me you finished i need three minutes he closes the door dont pay that fellow any mind the mes office pays retirees to drive for them they pay by the mile drivers dont know crap about the business flashlight mcdonough passes me a yellow penlight from the drawer with my heart racing i systematically probe my fathers mouth with a finger what am i hoping for a tuft of fur some trace evidence of another person as my finger slides between the upper gum and cheek i feel something small and hard like a kernel of corn i remove it with my thumb and forefinger its not corn its a plastic pelleta gray oneexactly like the ones that were pouring out of my fathers chest in my dream my god i breathe what is it asks mcdonough a plastic pellet its from inside this stuffed animal originally they were stuffed with rice to make them soft but after a while the company started using plastic is it important its evidence of murder do you have a ziploc bag mcdonough gets one and i place the pellet inside more probing reveals three more pellets one behind the cheek two in the throat you saw me locate these i say im replacing them exactly as i found them did you witness that yes maam and youll testify to that in court i hope it doesnt come to that but ill say what i saw as i pull off the gloves with a snap a worrisome thought occurs to me i should have searched my fathers mouth before inserting lenas head into it the stress is getting to me i pass mr mcdonough the stuffed animal please examine this and see if you can find any holes in her coat surprisingly he dons a pair of gloves and obliges me i dont see any id really like a few moments alone with my father but if im alone with the body that might cause legal problems later in full view of the funeral director i kneel beside the casket lay my hand over my fathers and kiss him softly on the lips a little mold isnt going to kill me i love you daddy i whisper i know you tried to save me my father says nothing im going to save myself now mama too if i can for a moment i think daddy is crying then i realize its my own tears running down his face the iron veneer of professionalism ive managed to maintain up to this point is cracking its no anonymous corpse lying in this box its my daddy and i dont want to lose him again i dont want him back in the ground i want him to sit up and hold me and tell me that he loves me miss ferry says mcdonough you all right no im not all right i get to my feet and wipe my eyes but im going to be for the first time in my life im going to be all right but somebody else isnt going to be somebody else is going to pay mcdonough looks embarrassed is it okay to close the casket now yes thank you for everything ill take you back to your car now dont worry about that ive got people who can do that thank you my knees are barely steady enough to carry me out of the prep room but they do as i enter the coffinlined corridor however a thought strikes me i turn around mr mcdonough yes maam have you spoken to my grandfather today the funeral director looks quickly at the floor and that is my answer mr mcdonough he called and asked me to let him know what you did at the cemetery i feel the grasp of my grandfather from miles away sir my grandfather is a powerful man i know you know that but youve just become involved in an fbi serial murder investigation my grandfather is also part of that investigation and not in a positive connection if you get my meaning if you interfere by communicating information on these matters to him the fbi will be crawling up your ass with a twofootlong halogen flashlight they will have osha down here doing inspections on a daily basis do i make myself clear mr mcdonough looks as if he wishes hed never set eyes on me aint none of this my business he says i wont be talking to nobody about it good when i step into the sun outside the garage i find myself facing several men wearing their sunday best they all have roses pinned to their lapels theyre pallbearers i realize and theyve just carried the deceased to the waiting hearse soon the family will emerge from the side exit behind me i walk quickly down the side of the building but i cant escape a woman about my age rounds the corner with an infant in her arms as i move aside her mouth drops open cat she says cat ferry yes its donna donna reynolds i blink in confusion used to be donna dunaway she says recognition comes like a thrown switch its like the day i met michael wells only donna hasnt lost weight in the intervening years like michael shes gained but somewhere in her plump rosy cheeks is the outline of a thinfaced girl i knew in junior high school is this your baby i ask she nods happily my third four months old my eyes fix on the babys round face as i search for something appropriate to say nothing comes my head is spinning from what ive just discovered in the prep room the baby has huge eyes a flat nose and a laughing smile whats his name donna britney she is wearing pink you know oh god im sorry donna isnt angry shes smiling are you here for the funeral i didnt know you knew uncle joe i dont i mean as my words fade into silence my gaze settles on the babys toothless smile a long string of drool drops from britneys mouth and the greatest epiphany of my life occurs theres no blast of trumpets or bolt of lightning from the heavensmerely a sudden and revelatory flash of absolute certainty i know who killed the men in new orleans chapter cat whats going on i gasp in relief im almost to malmaison and ive been trying to reach sean since i left the funeral home i know who the killer is sean whoa whoa which killer are you talking about your family stuff or the new orleans case new orleans how the hell could you know who the killer is how do i ever know something clicked in my head what clicked this time im tempted to tell him but if i do therell be no stopping the consequences and right now im not at all sure i want the killer arrested i cant tell you that sean not yet shit what are you up to cat im coming to new orleans this afternoon i want you to meet me at my house are you still suspended

not a him sean its a her i hear a quick rush of air cat dont do this to me its only a few hours i know its hard on you but youll understand when i get there i turn into the drive of malmaison and accelerate down the oakshaded lane the iron gate stands open i drive through it and take the sweeping curve toward the main house why did you call me sean asks in a strange voice why not kaiser because i trust you im lying i picked sean becauseto a certain extenti can control him okay call me thirty minutes before you get here be ready as i swing into the parking lot behind the slave quarters im shocked to find pearlies blue cadillac parked beside grandpapas lincoln shocked and glad i need one more favor sean what is it i know who killed my father too yeah who my grandfather hes the one who molested me not my father daddy caught my grandfather abusing me and grandpapa killed him to keep him quiet fuck in that one curse i hear two decades of homicide experience im sorry cat i

love me youll do it for me sean and for your own kids i have to go now wait if something happens to you how will i know who the killer down here is i think for a minute ill write it on a piece of paper and put it under the floor mat of my mothers car her name is gwen ferry she drives a gold nissan maxima good enough i hear him breathing i guess itll have to be i hang up my mothers cell phone then open the console and dig through it about the only piece of paper big enough is a grocery ticket from walmart on its long narrow back i scrawl the logical basis for my epiphany at the funeral home as i lift the floor mat beneath my feet to conceal the note i pray that sean doesnt have to drive to natchez to find it chapter pearlie doesnt answer my knock when i try to go in anyway i find the door locked this frightens me pearlies door is never locked at least it never was when i lived here one more sign of how things have changed shes drawn her curtains too after trying the front windows on the ground floor i go around back one window there is barely latched by jiggling the frame i get the latch loose then slide up the window pearlies bedroom is dark her bed empty a converted slave quarters like ours her house has no hallways i move quickly to the door and pass through to the kitchen like my mother this morning pearlie is sitting at her kitchen table without lights staring blankly ahead unlike my mother shes smoking a cigarette i havent seen pearlie smoke since i was a little girl an ashtray full of butts is beside her and a bottle of cheap whiskey stands beside her coffee cup pearlie i thought you was billy neal coming to get me she rasps why would he come get you cause of what i know her voice has a frightening note of fatalism in it what do you know same thing you do i reckon whats that a new alertness comes into her eyes dont play games with me tell me what you come here for im about to confront grandpapa i wanted to talk to you first she blinks once slowly how come because you know things i need to know and i want you to know what ive learned about him what you talking about grandpapa murdered daddy pearlie the orange eye of her cigarette glows bright you just think that or you can prove it i can prove it what i want to know is did you already know it pearlie exhales a long stream of smoke not to prove i didnt i didnt see him do it if thats what you mean thats not what i mean and you know it did you suspect it i had thoughts that night later on too but there wasnt nothing i could do about it i knew it you think grandpapas invulnerable pearlie but hes not im going to put him in jail ive got evidence now remember lena the leopardess a glint of memory passes behind her eyes the toy you buried with mr luke thats right grandpapa suggested i put her in the coffin with him do you know why he did that i know there was blood on her i know dr kirkland told me to throw that toy away when i told him it was your favorite he told me i could wash it off and sew the rip back together do you know how lena got torn she shakes her head grandpapa stuffed her into daddys mouth so he would suffocate before you got downstairs he wasnt dying quickly enough from the bullet pearlie winces lord jesus dont tell me that thats not the worst of it you remember the story about grandpapa cutting out anns appendix by lantern light on the island how he was the big hero for saving her life sure i do him and ivy both well he took out her appendix all right but he did a little something extra too he cut her fallopian tubes so she couldnt get pregnant pearlie bows her head and begins to pray softly why did you go to the island yesterday pearlie you hate that place dont want to talk about that youve got to start talking youve been silent too long she sips whiskey from her coffee cup then lights another cigarette and takes a deep drag i quit cigarettes twentythree years ago she says smoke floating out of her mouth with each word ive missed em every day like a pain that wont quit but when i heard miss ann was dead i had to have me one i aint stopped since i say nothing i come to work here in she says almost to herself i was seventeen miss ann was born that year but they was living in new orleans then dr kirkland was still training to be a doctor he and mrs catherine didnt move to natchez until and they didnt take over this place until sixtyfour when mr desalle died she looks at me as though making sure i understand thats why i missed it you see miss ann was sixteen when they moved in here the damage was already done but things still wasnt right not really any boy that come to call on ann dr kirkland frightened away even the nice ones lots of daddies will do that a little but dr kirkland never gave an inch he was jealous of that girl mrs catherine saw it too but she couldnt do nothing to change it if theyd been living in natchez since i reason surely you saw some other signs before they moved to malmaison the old woman chews her bottom lip i been thinking about that for two days now there was times when they left the girls here going on long trips and such sometimes dr kirkland would leave me medicine for ann she didnt seem sick cept she had to go to the bathroom too much and it stung when she went id give her the medicine and shed get all right but looking back she had too many of them problems no other doctor ever saw it though you see her daddy was her doctor oh i see he was my doctor too pearlie lays her hand over mine the skin papery over sinew and bone i know baby i knew something was wrong when ann was just a toddler i just didnt know what shed laugh at the right times but the laugh never touched her eyes those eyes were like glass shiny but empty at the same time lord how the boys liked her though ann was the most popular girl in town they couldnt see the pain hidden in her heart or maybe they could i say maybe they sensed it and thats what drew them maybe so pearlie murmurs nodding sadly what about mom she takes another sip of whiskey and grimaces as she swallows gwen was twelve when they moved in here she didnt have the same problems ann did she could smile and laugh and she seemed like a normal child but she married young as she could to get away from this house but then she didnt get away after all the war brought her back and the older she got the more problems she had looking back i think dr kirkland got to her too the damage got done when she was just a baby same as with ann just not as bad i think ann tried to protect her pearlie nods slowly ann tried to be everything to everybody to save everybody but she couldnt even save herself did grandmama catherine ever suspect anything she never said nothing to me but mrs catherine sure knew when to disappear and she let dr kirkland spend a lot of time with those girls alone i saw it when they stayed up here during christmas when the girls was little if dr kirkland was gonna be around the house during the day mrs catherine would find somewhere else to be it gave me a bad feeling but what could i say about it times was different back then a maid like me couldnt open her mouth about something like that all i could do was be there for those girls when they got upset try to ease their pain a little bit did you ever see anything yourself she shakes her head looking back i think dr kirkland made sure i didnt how did he do that hed walk this property all hours of the night just like your daddy i think thats one reason he didnt like mr luke he couldnt prowl around without being seen anymore the few times dr kirkland caught me out after nine he warned me to stay indoors said he might shoot me by accident thinking i was a burglar so i stayed right in this house unless i got called out by him or mrs catherine in hindsight it all seems so obvious whats missing is the historical context the idea that dr william kirkland respected surgeon and paragon of virtue could be tiptoeing around his antebellum mansion molesting his daughters was virtually unthinkable forty years ago what about the island i ask pearlie shifts uncomfortably in her chair what about it do you think he bothered any children there if he did nobody would tell me about it why not cause i left there and never went back i turned into a house nigger they think im dr kirklands slave bought and paid for why didnt you ever go back she looks at me with something like scorn why you think there was a man there i had to stay away from who my uncle why did you have to stay away from him she snorts why you think girl same kind of trouble as this sexual abuse they dont call it that on the island they call it getting broke in the men do leastways and some of the women too i got broke in by my uncle when i wasnt but twelve he wouldnt let me alone if he hadnt had to go to jail for a while id have wound up pregnant or worse so when i got a chance to get off the island i took it from somewhere in my mind a new image rises a small black girl walks along a gravel road out of the shimmering heat an orange pickup truck appears and then the man who pays her father and mother offers her a ride ivy never told you any stories i ask nothing that made you suspicious even ive heard things about the kids there being scared to walk the roads alone pearlie folds her hand on the table baby a man with a taste for that kind of thing dont stop doing it he takes what he needs whenever he can get it ill tell you something else i think the women down there know about it thats why they tell spook stories to keep their children off the roads but they dont tell their husbands nothing you can bank on that they dont want them going to the death house at angola for killing the boss man do you know that pearlie or just suspect it she shrugs does it make a difference in a court of law it makes all the difference in the world she spits out air in a rush of scorn you aint getting dr kirkland in no courtroom he too smart and too rich men like him dont go to jail you got to know that by now girl times have changed since you were young pearlie a parched laugh escapes her lips you believe that yes then you aint smart as i thought you was pearlies cynicism pisses me off if all women were like this wed still be chattels and not citizens on the other handi grew up in a much more privileged world than she did you never answered my question pearlie why did you go to the island yesterday the bow of her shoulders sags a couple of years ago a family moved off the island real quick i heard about it later they had one child a fouryearold girl they just packed up and left without a word i wanted to find out if that was because of dr kirkland did you she inhales from her cigarette as though drinking the nectar of the gods then holds the smoke in her lungs for as long as possible before letting it out in a long blue stream no she says finally nobody would talk about it they all scared was that the only reason you went down there she turns her dark gaze onto me and at last i feel the full power of her instinctive intelligence all her life pearlie has hidden her quick understanding thats what she was raised to do but the death of my auntone of her babieshas caused a tectonic shift in the old womans soul and pearlie washington is never going to be the same i dont think mrs catherine died by accident she says in a whisper i never did this statement shocks me to the core are you saying grandmama catherine was murdered she couldnt have been people saw her fall into the water did they pearlies eyes glint in the dark she was standing off by herself when she went in but did she fall did that sandbar really cave in mrs catherine practically grew up on desalle island you think shed stand on a weak sandbar like some city fool and not know it no child no more than mr luke would let somebody sneak up on him after he was in the war i think mrs catherine finally found out something so bad that she couldnt live with it if shed gone to the police shed have ruined her family name forever her children were already full growni think she just couldnt see what else to do but die i think she drowned herself in that river baby suicide a seventyfiveyearold woman what do you think she saw pearlie the old womans shoulders drop even lower a few years ago when i was cleaning dr kirklands study i found some pictures my breath catches in my throat what kind of pictures the kind you dont have to take to the drugstore to get developed polaroids she nods what were they of you and miss ann my face is burning doing what swimming in your birthday suits together no they must have been took twentyfive years apart neither of you was more than three in the pictures and nekkid as the day you was born both in a swimming pool somewhere if those pictures had been mixed up with a bunch of others i wouldnt have thought nothing of it pearlie holds up a bony finger the nail painted with red polish but just those twoand took so far apart it gave me a cold feeling like the devil walking over my grave you think grandmama found those pictures she found something the month before she died mrs catherine wouldnt hardly say a word to nobody had a faroff look in her eyes hopeless pearlie i found some pictures of naked children hidden in the barnin daddys things she looks stunned mr luke had pictures like that yes but knowing what i know now i think he did exactly what you did he found some of grandpapas pictures but he kept them ill bet he was going to confront grandpapa with them they might even have been what made him suspicious enough to check my room on the night he died i been looking for more pictures like that pearlie says but i aint found none yet lord the misery that man done caused hes sick thats what he is i get up and pull the curtains away from the kitchen window malmaison stands majestic and silent as a royal sepulchre hes not going to hurt any more children i say softly that stops today how you gonna stop him even the police afraid of dr kirkland lord this place cost more than all the houses of every cop in this town put together the mayors house too dr kirkland got friends all the way up to washington dc dont worry about it you just promise me that if you have to get up in front of a jury youll tell the truth about what you know they make you swear on the bible dont they yes well im too old to lie with my right hand on a bible but you be careful dr kirkland aint the only sick man around here that billy neal be just as bad and hes a lot younger and stronger younger maybe not stronger if you turned those two loose in the woods and only one could come out alive grandpapa would eat billys liver for supper pearlie stands unsteadily and walks to me then hugs me the way she used to when i was a little girl the way my mother never quite could you remember when i told you i quit smoking i think for a minute twentythree years ago you said thats when daddy died she nods her chin digging into my shoulder you know why i quit that year why because i knew cigarettes was poison and after mr luke died i knew you was gonna need me around to look after you im just sorry i didnt do more baby sorry i couldnt save you from all the pain you been through she pulls back and looks into my eyes youre the strongest of all my girls i always said that dr kirkland think you got that strength from him but i know better mr luke was a good man and tough when he had to be old mr desalle too maybeoh i dont know im just gonna pray for you whatever prayers is worth maybe with the lords help you can come through all right i kiss her gently on the cheek then unlock the door and walk out into the sunlight my grandfathers lincoln is still parked beside pearlies cadillac as i stare at the two cars i sense someone watching me turning to my right i see billy neal staring down at me from the rear gallery of malmaison hes smiling i turn toward him and start walking my strides long and resolute the closer i get the more his smile fades by the time im within speaking distance hes scowling at me hes also wearing a sport jacket in the dead of summer looking closer i see the butt of an automatic pistol protruding from a shoulder holster beneath the jacket what do you want he asks youve hitched your wagon to a falling star i say in a flat voice you should leave while you can he laughs what the fuck are you talking about follow me and find out chapter grandpapa is talking on the telephone at his rolltop desk his broad back clothed in a customtailored shirt of french blue silk his deep voice fills the room like a finely tuned bass viol hang up i say sharply he rotates his leather chair and his eyes fix upon me i know what you did i tell him just a minute he says into the phone he presses the mouthpiece against his shirt what is it catherine im very busy right now i know you murdered my father his only reaction is a slight narrowing of the eyes then he glances at billy neal whos standing by the door i told you what happened that night catherine you told me four different times a different story every time but i know the truth now evidence doesnt lie you murdered him and i can prove it grandpapa raises the phone to his lips again ill have to call you back first you shot him then you shoved my favorite stuffed animal into his mouth to keep him quiet then i figure you held his nose shut with your fingers while he suffocated in the time it takes grandpapa to hang up the telephone his eyes change from the benign blue of a loving grandfather to the cold slits of a wolf sensing threat the transformation chills my blood i have never seen this face before and yet i recognize it this is his real face the face of the man who put himself inside me when i was a baby are you wearing a microphone he asks i shake my head he doesnt believe me for some reason this sends a surge of anger through me you want me to strip for you i start to unbutton my top its not like you havent seen me naked before is it stop that he snaps then he waves his hand at billy neal the driver takes something from one of the shelves and walks toward me its a black metal wand like the ones they use in airports to check for concealed weapons he sweeps it up and down my body lingering in the crotch area shes clean he says finally he walks back to the door and stands beside it like a guard dog do you know anything about this grandpapa asks pointing at the far wall to my amazement dozens of books lie strewn about the floor as though someone ripped them off the shelves in a frantic search pearlies words replay inside my head i been looking for more pictures like thatbut i aint found none yet mice i say in a flat voice he starts to respond then discards the whole subject as not worthy of his attention all right i told you i was busy is there anything else i cant believe his arrogance didnt you hear me i can prove that you murdered my father i can also prove you sexually abused aunt ann and worse he dismisses this with a wave of his hand thats ridiculous i have evidence bloody footprints on a floor ive already explained that i have a lot more than that id like to tell him about pearlie but i cant put her at risk and im remembering more every day i know what you did to me grandpapas eyes narrow again remembered evidence it sounds to me like youve been taking your friend dr malik a little too seriously what the hell is going on here i had no idea that he even knew who malik was catherine socalled repressed memories count for exactly nothing in a court of law im surprised you dont know that anns body will count i say evenly for the first time i see a shadow of worry cross his face what are you talking about how could you do that to her grandpapa do what sterilize her you cut her fallopian tubes when she was ten years old jesus all your life youve acted like youre better than everyone else the best surgeon the best businessman the best hunter the best father youre none of that youre a fucking monster a freak his steely eyes are riveted on my face are you finished no youre going to pay for everything you did for ann for mom for me for the children on the island too the jaw muscles flex in his impassive face i know more than he thought possible and he doesnt like it im not going to pay for anything he says i have nothing to pay for do you deny what you did thats what child molesters do they scream theyre innocent all the way to the pen theyre probably still screaming that when it finally gets done to them in the prison shower your kind doesnt fare too well in parchman grandpapa william kirkland has never been talked to this way in his adult life but he only straightens in his chair and smiles coldly at me id fare well anywhere in the world catherine you know that but im not going to prison your socalled evidence is worthless a stuffed animal taken from a coffin thats been in the ground for twenty years you cant connect me to that i can identify the maxillary arch of daddys teeth in the latent blood on lenas coat he purses his lips in thought luke must have grabbed lena and bit down on her to fight against the pain after you shot him dont even try that i snap but i can see grandpapa selling that story to a jury as smoothly as hes sold himself all his life anns body proves that you sterilized her i say softly you never dreamed shed be autopsied did you not back in you shouldnt have used silk sutures grandpapa he rises calmly from his chair and shoots his cuffs catherine youre obviously delusional ann was obsessed with becoming pregnant everyone knows that she went to all sorts of quacks for fertility treatments she even went to mexico god knows what procedures she had done or what butchers performed them youll never prove i did anything more than remove her appendix even if you did whats the crime unnecessary surgery his eyes brim with confidence ive been accused of that before and i came out smelling like a rose i hate the smell of roses i have ever since i saw my father lying dead among them have you been taking your medication he asks in a condescending voice maybe i should review your drug regimen with your psychiatrist are you still on the depakote i was prepared for extreme reactions when i entered this roomrage denial rationalization even beggingbut supreme confidence wasnt one of them he hasnt even denied the abuse hes just shooting down my accusations as though he were playing games with a poorly prepared lawyer i want to shake that confidence i want to see the worm of fear work its way through his gut and up into that megalomaniacal mind im not the one you have to worry about i tell him its dr malik whos going to nail you grandpapa glances at billy neal again that would be quite a trick since the good doctor happens to be dead a dry chuckle from billy im starting to wonder if it was billy neal who faked maliks suicide in the thibodeaux motel dead or alive doesnt matter i say with confidence i dont quite feel hes going to speak from the grave youre going to be revealed for what you are on tv screens from coast to coast neither billy nor my grandfather is laughing now and i thank god for it if they were id be pretty sure that dr maliks film had already been destroyed but it hasntnot by them anyway they dont even know about it i see you dont know about dr maliks documentary on sexual abuse in seconds the threatened wolf is back i hear a creak to my left when i look that way billy neal is gone did grandpapa signal him to leave whether he did or not he takes billys exit as a cue to advance toward me six feet six inches of rage with blazing eyes and a voice like moses down from the mountaintop do you have any idea how much trouble youve caused me im sweating blood trying to save this town and youre working around the clock to sabotage everything ive achieved what the hell i accuse him of sexual abuse and hes screaming at me about a business deal federal certification of the natchez nation could come any day he roars the state gaming commission would love an excuse for a federal injunction to stop that i am deep into this deal catherine i have money on the table not other peoples money mine your inheritance if you give a goddamnwhich you probably dont youre right i say quietly i dont all i care about is what you did to this family thats all you should care about too but that was the problem all along wasnt it you didnt care we didnt exist except to pleasure you when the mood struck you he takes another step toward me but i dont back up i remember what you did its taken almost thirty years but its coming back the pondthe islandthe orange pickupthe rain something flickers in his eyes an emotion i cant read the fury he displayed only moments ago seems to have been discharged do you remember he asks his voice suddenly much softer do you remember how you felt you loved being my special girl my little angel you loved being better than your mother you gave me what the others couldnt catherine hes very close to me now the moment has an obscene intimacy that makes my bowels turn to water you do remember they all liked itbut not like you no one else responded the way you did youre just like me no i moan shut up grandpapa squares his broad shoulders and looks down at me has anyone made you feel the way i did ive watched you go from man to manalways searchingnone of them are man enough to handle you are they i was right not to give sean the identity of the killer in new orleans she and i are sisters if i had a gun in my hand i would open fire and keep firing until the gun was empty grandpapa folds his arms and looks down at me the way he used to look at his patients im going to speak frankly to you catherine whats the point of going through life with illusions mine were taken away when i was a little boy and im glad for it it made me strong it saved me a lot of heartache later on what are you talking about everything youve said today is true i had relations with ann gwen too i want to interrupt but my voice wont come great men have great appetites darling its that simple more hunger than one woman can satisfy your grandmother knew that she didnt like it but she understood liar i shout finding strength in my grief and outrage how do you convince yourself of this shit grandmama didnt understand she suspected you for years but she did everything she could not to validate her fears just like the rest of us because to believe it wed have to admit that you never loved us that you only kept us around to fuck us youre wrong about your grandmother no somewhere beneath all the lies you tell yourself you know the truth when she finally figured out what a monster shed married she drowned herself so she wouldnt have to live with what shed let happen to us grandpapas composure comes apart slowly like mud cracking in the sun you say she wasnt enough for you why didnt you divorce her then he walks away from me and stops before a painting of the battle of chancellorsville it was my destiny to manage the desalle fortune the fact that ive quadrupled it in size proves that take a mistress then why come to us your own children he shakes his head a mistress makes you vulnerable and having sex with your own children doesnt exactly when he looks back at me he reminds me of a math teacher puzzled by kids who cant grasp the simplest concept your grandmother didnt suspect what i was doing catherine she knew how could she not she knew i needed more than she could give me and she preferred that i get it at home rather than embarrass her in society a coldness unlike any ive ever known envelops me could he be right could pearlie be wrong i dont believe you he shrugs cling to your illusions if they make you feel better youre saying you had sex with us for utilitarian reasons and grandmama knew that exasperation tightens his features damn it girl you act like im the first man who ever did this the same thing happened to me when i was a boy my grandfather was a widower he used me for sex im not whining about it but the fact is that kind of sex does something to you it gives you a taste for something that nothing else can satisfy its like war you get a taste for killing and you have to keep doing it only this craving is stronger i know youve felt it too thats the way it works i shake my head in denial but im not so sure hes wrong he holds up his big hand and stabs a forefinger at me im going to tell you a hard fact of life catherine a woman is a lifesupport system for a pussy period i blink in disbelief you know im right youre a scientist but heredity has given you a chance to rise above that primitive function youve got brains and youve got will but youll never transcend your sex if you blind yourself to the realities of life youre insane am i he goes to a shelf and pulls out a large black volume then tosses it at my feet with a bang its a king james bible take a look at the book of leviticus there youll find all the biblical proscriptions against incest all the rules laid down for everyone to see a man is forbidden by god to have sex with his mother his wifes mother his sister his aunt with an animal with another man or with a woman having her period it even mentions the daughterinlaw but one relationship is specifically not mentioned i feel like im standing on the ledge of a skyscraper in a high wind which is that father and daughter old leviticus skimmed right over that one because he knew the reality of life which is my grandfathers eyes shine with the conviction of a zealot you came from my loins catherine your mother and ann too you are the issue of my blood you were mine to do with as i saw fit he walks to the gun safe quickly spins the dial and opens the heavy door from it he takes a rifle which he calmly loads with a cartridge from a box on the shelf as he walks toward me i recognize the remington that killed my father its still true he says his eyes locked on mine youre still mine he works the bolt and chambers the round what if this gun were to go off he brings the barrel within a foot of my face what if it blew your brains all over the wall what do you think would happen youd be convicted of murder he smiles would i i think not a woman with your psychiatric history documented bipolar disorder unstable past threats of suicide no if i really considered you a threat you wouldnt leave this room but youre not a threat are you catherine i should back down show submission live to fight another day but i cant ive done it all my life for him and i wont do it anymore oh im a threat im going to make sure you die in prison and you should know this if you kill me nowor before i get back to new orleanssomeones going to do the same to you he looks more interested than afraid you mean detective regan i feel the blood drain from my face theres a hint of humor in his eyes catherine do you honestly believe i dont know who you see down there i own sean regan do you think he would kill me in revenge when that would result in photographs of the two of you rutting like animals being sent to his wife and children nohe wouldnt if this malik film you spoke of really exists youd do well to get it for me or destroy it id hate to give you something to really be depressed about what are you talking about lifes little tragedies he smiles again you hate me for being this way but one day youll thank god that you have my blood flowing through your veins my genes determining your fate when my voice finally emerges its utterly devoid of emotion youre wrong i wish id never been born you dont know thisbut im pregnant and for the first time since i found out im wondering whether i should bring that child into this world i feel contaminated like i can never wash your poison out of me he lowers the rifle and steps closer his eyes glowing youre pregnant yes boy or girl i have no idea he reaches for my arm i jerk backward take it easy girl whos the father youll never know dont be that way youll come around youve got more of me in you than you think what do you mean a knowing smile now a man hoarding a secret i could be your father catherine do you realize that with these words whats left of my composure crumbles my very being is unraveling into nothingness my grandfathers face is red the way it gets when hes stalking game on the island luke spent all his time on the island he says chasing that nigger girl louise and your mother just lay sleeping in her room here halflooped on lukes medicine he nods slowly you see now the triumph in his face is absolute its the triumph of the hunter standing over his dying prey hes shoved the steel into my heart and broken off the handle he revels in the pain in my face just as he must have all those years ago the savage joy in his eyes brings me back to the world and in returning i feel a horror i never thought imaginable is that true i ask in a small voice he shrugs its certainly something to think about while youre making plans to talk to the district attorney im backing away from him reaching blindly for the doorknob and if youre thinking of pearlie testifying to anything forget it shell never do it my hand closes around the brass knob why not because she knows the order of things you might get her stirred up with a lot of nonsense but in the end she wont say a word against me pearlie knows her place cat same as the niggers on the island your ancestors taught them well and ive reinforced the lesson he goes to the sideboard and pours some scotch into a glass you know your place too honey deep down you do i drop my shaking hand from the knob then raise it and point a quivering finger at him no you were too strong for me when i was a baby but not anymore with a bemused look on his face he drinks off the scotch and wipes his mouth on his cuff i pull open the door stumble through it then run down the hallway toward the kitchen i dont know where im going only that i have to get away from this house sean expects me in new orleans but its hard to imagine functioning in any normal capacity simple linear thought seems beyond me now i crash through the kitchen door and race through the rose garden toward the parking lot behind the slave quarters moms maxima is parked where i left it a few yards away from the lincoln and the cadillac as i near the cars i hear a muted banging then the passenger door of pearlies cadillac opens and billy neal climbs out theres a pistol in his hand he aims the barrel at a spot between my breasts ive been waiting a long time for this he says lets take a ride whats that noise with a gleeful smile he opens the trunk of the cadillac come see i walk to the back of the car pearlie lies bound in the trunk her hands and face covered with blood her wig is gone a grayish white fuzz covers her narrow skull which is wedged against the spare tire ive never seen her eyes so filled with terror as i reach down to help her billys gun pokes the ribs under my left arm he slams the trunk shut then shoves me toward the drivers seat youre driving he says pushing me behind the wheel did you shoot her dont worry about that old bitch worry about the driving where are we going where do you think he grins so broadly that it makes my cheeks hurt the island chapter my last ride to the island is both dream and nightmare highway a narrow winding strip of asphalt following the mississippi river mythical american highway escape route for northbound refugees most of them black fleeing a place that held no hope but where their hearts remained nonetheless yearning for the bodys return i tried to use this highway as an escape route too only i never got away for thirtyone years ive driven up and down this road between two lovely sleepy cities but always the island lay between them a dreamworld shrouded in fog and memory waiting like an empty stage for my lifes final act today it will be played out the messenger of my fate is billy neal it seems wrong somehow i never really knew this man this blackhaired paleskinned dimestorehandsome vegas punk with snakeskin boots and a nightschool law degree what the hell is he doing in my life obligingly he answers me without being asked you still dont know who i am do you i grip the wheel harder and keep my eyes on the road man ive been waiting for this he says his gaze moving over me like a wet tongue youve had this coming a long time the nigger too if pearlie werent tied in the trunk id take my chances and ram the cadillac into a tree just to kill this bastard thats probably why he put her in there you dont know shit do you he says guess not look at me im driving he reaches out with his gun and pulls my face around he looks as angry as he does triumphant why i wonder my eyes lingering on his pistol its an automatic ugly and clean as a fresh scalpel itll do its job did my grandfather send you to do this billy smiles strangely a smart officer doesnt give orders like this but a good soldier knows what to do when trouble comes a good soldier doesnt have to be told soldier i know what kind of soldier you are the kind my father got stuck with in cambodia his eyes narrow what nothing you wouldnt understand billy kicks a snakeskin boot up onto the dash of the cadillac you think youre pretty smart dont you i dont answer you smart enough to know whats about to happen to you youre going to kill us he laughs you get the prize sweet thing but that was the easy part the question is why i know better than to take this bait the more interest i express the less hell tell me thats his nature hes never had much power so he takes it however he can get it well he presses do you pearlie bangs twice on the trunk lid it makes my heart hurt but at least shes still alive because youre in my way billy says in a reflective voice thats why what do you mean if you stay alive youll inherit my money this wasnt the answer i expected your money what are you talking about he laughs again this time almost a cackle kirklands my father you dumb cunt you havent figured that out yet after all ive heard today this revelation doesnt have much effect my mother worked for one of those desalle companies bookkeeping she did a lot of work at home dr kirkland would go by her house to check up on the figures i guess the main figure he was interested in was hers anyway he nailed her and i was the result you sound proud of it billy shrugs nothing to be ashamed of he paid her hush money nice and regular sent me to school got me out of a couple of scrapes thats how i wound up in the army the army or jail was it something like that he paid for law school too when i got out anyway that makes me your uncleor thats what i thought until today after hearing what he told you in the study it sounds like i may be your half brother too billy laughs again thats bullshit you wish it was he checks the safety on his pistol then flicks it on and off a couple of times the thing is i already got a piece of the gross of the indian casino i did a lot of work prepping that deal for him wet work you know what im saying but the thing is theres more money to be had a lot more my mamas got records of it theres money you probably dont even know about cayman islands liechtenstein all over and now that your pretty little aunt offed herself you and your mother are the only living heirs in the will you believe that i believe it grandpapa may have wanted sons but nothing would cause him to bequeath one dollar outside the legitimate family not even to charity not unless he got something in return hes been relying on me more and more lately billy says hes seen what i can do while youve been doing nothing but fucking up youre a pure liability to him now thats a fact when you disappear hell breathe a sigh of relief youre probably right billy looks at me in surprise but then he nods with satisfaction glad to have his intuition confirmed highway unrolls steadily ahead of us curving through the hardwood forest leading us ever southward a gray mass of clouds is gathering to the southeast if we went on toward baton rouge wed probably miss it but the bulk of the storm seems to be piling up over the river right about where the island faces angola prison only fitting i suppose that my last bit of thread should play out in the rain were ten miles down the angola road when the rain sweeps over us the sound of drops hitting the roof sends me halfway into the trance i learned to enter before i could even think for myself billy neal seems to think the rain a good omen smiling with contentment he tunes the radio to a country station you like the rain i ask today i do why today he turns to me and purses his lips as though debating whether to confide something because youre going to drown today sis this strikes me as so absurd that i almost laugh out loud hows that youre gonna drive off the bridge to desalle island i say nothing but in my mind i see brer rabbit crying please dont throw me in that briar patch is this the best that billy can come up with if he drives me into the old river channel in this car i can get myself and pearlie to shore without even breaking a sweat i see you thinking he says dont worry i know all about your free diving youre gonna be down at the bottom way too long to save yourself if you tie me up it wont look like an accident he smiles his secret smile again youre not the only one who can swim after youve been down there twenty minutes or so im going to go down and take the ropes off no muss no fuss a drunk manicdepressive runs herself and her nigger maid into the river in a storm openandshut case im not drunk you will be he opens the glove compartment and takes out a pint of taaka vodka found this in the slave quarters guess your mama likes vodka too he uncaps the bottle and shoves it at me drink no thanks not up to your standard he presses the barrel of his gun against my temple drink i cant im pregnant pregnant he laughs from deep in his belly shit youre going to be dead in an hour so you say the blow from the gun is so sudden and sharp that everything goes black for a moment i feel the car swerve but i manage to right it you fucking drink this he commands no hes tensing to hit me again when i see the turn for the island look go on he says take it just ahead a narrow dirt track leaves the road and heads into the deep woods how many times did i take this turn as a little girl terrified it would rain when i reached the island yet powerless to stop the journey thirty years later ive come full circle billy neal takes a swig from the vodka bottle then screws the cap back on and throws the bottle into the seat behind us youll drink it he says or ill beat that nigger to death right in front of you chapter billy watches me with visceral hatred as i navigate the cadillac down a road that is mostly mud the tail of the car keeps trying to come around on me forcing me to drive slowly still the road seems all too short when i sight the lowwater bridge leading to the island billy points into the trees on the right pull in there grounds hard enough theres a little clearing up ahead how do you know that i ask driving over the ground where i parked the audi on my last visit billy gives me a tight smile thats where i parked when i followed you out here the other day you chased me into the river who the fuck else do you think it was jesse billups that spade wouldnt get out on the river in a storm if his life depended on it did my grandfather send you to kill me that night billy stops smiling what does it matter pull up there and stop a clearing has opened ahead theres plenty of room for the cadillac between the tree trunks but the forest canopy protects us from the brunt of the rain billy reaches over and switches off the motor soon there is only the ticking of the engine and the soft drip of water on the hood and roof nice huh billy says i thought you were going to kill us on the bridge you in a hurry he points the gun at me turn and face the window put your hands behind you why he jams the gun barrel under my jawbone do it now you cant shoot me you want it to look like an accident youre right id rather not but i dont mind popping a cap in your smartass maid one bit nobodys going to make a fuss over that driedup old jig will he shoot pearlie yes but if i let him tie my hands what chance will i have to save us somebut if he ties them to the steering wheel im in trouble can he do that now he still has to get the car onto the bridge it may be the most foolish act of my life but i turn on the seat and face the window im expecting rope which i saw on pearlie in the trunk but theres a soft tinkle of metal then steel bands close tight around my wrists shit if i go into the water with handcuffs on im in trouble billy gets out of the car for a moment i think hes going to get pearlie out of the trunk but then he starts unbuttoning his jeans i turn away expecting to hear him urinate but what i hear instead is a swish of cloth against flesh then he leans back into the open door hey he says look here i turn hes wearing black bikini briefs and his eyes are shining what are you doing i ask what do you think a lurid smile i want a taste of what the boss man had he pulls off his underwear and climbs back into the car pulling at himself as he sits beside me the gun is still in his other hand you got an ass on you thats for sure and you wont have no more use for it after today might as well take it for one last spin right nobodyll know well keep it all in the family my heart flutters like a panicked bird beating its wings to pieces with a pair of handcuffs billy neal has turned me into the helpless little girl i was when my grandfather raped me straighten your legs out on the seat he says lets get those jeans off i shake my head the glaze in his eyes brightens im gonna get out and pump four bullets into that trunk youre going to kill her anyway true enough but laters better than sooner right i dont know what to do my synapses dont seem to be firing properly its human nature plain and simple billy says stroking himself to erection people will do anything they think will keep em alive for five more minutes the nazis knew that used it all the time to control people right up to the moment they slammed the door to the gas chambers you a big fan of the nazis he laughs straighten out your fucking legs billys right i want to live every second i can every second of life is another chance at escape the irony is exquisite all my life ive flirted with suicide yet here i sit desperately wanting a few more moments of air and sunlight im only alive now because this man wants to have sex with me and if i become too much trouble hell shoot me billys smile has a manic edge theres another option you may not have thought about i can shoot you first and fuck you after youll still be plenty warm my mouth goes dry id prefer it the other way around but its your choice at least if he shoots me first i wont know im being raped i wont feel it but suddenly it hits me i dont have to feel it anyway thats the one magic trick i learned as a child dissociation billy neal can do what he likes to me and i can watch it all from the balcony a disembodied observer guess you made your choice he says getting out of the car the nigger pays for your pride wait i cry extending my legs down the length of the front seat he leans back into the car reaches out with one hand and unsnaps my jeans then he unzips them digs his fingers into the open fly and yanks brutally until most of my legs are bare kick em off he says breathing hard from the effort as if his voice controls my limbs i obey he throws my jeans into the backseat then points his pistol at my face and tears off my panties its eerie how quickly i dissociate from whats happening im already watching myself the way i watch characters in a moviefascinated but at a critical remove ive actually asked lovers to act out this scenario with me rape as pleasure a lot of normal women have probably done the same ive asked men to tie me and choke me and slap me around and now that the real thing is happening its not much different from the play acting it should be i know it would be for a normal woman but its not for me would most women endure rape to live a little longer or would they fight to the last breath to keep their socalled honor fighting isnt going to stop billy neal its just going to make him hurt me more besides what is it for me to be raped once more its happened so many times already that one more violation has no meaning i see now that i was raped even as an adult even when i was saying yes something beyond my understanding was driving me to repeat the only kind of sexual union i knew i know about girls like you billy says pulling me across the seat until im facing forward like a passenger on a sunday drive girls who got broke in young they know how to please a man better than a thai hooker he kneels on the floor in front of me and transfers his gun to his left hand with his right hand he pumps his penis causing it to swell and grow red the sight is bizarre yet familiar a man i barely know is about to insert himself into me its happened more times than i let myself remember you wet he asks reaching out and checking me like a mechanic checking the oil in an engine shit he spits in his palm then slathers his organ with saliva then he spits again and puts his fingers inside me there you go he murmurs now youre getting there numbness spreads through me like a narcotic masking everything but the sudden fullness of penetration its nothing to me though only a reenactment a ritual a role i learned to play before i learned almost anything else only this time its different this man doesnt want merely to use me he wants to kill me like the men of my fathers unit the white tigers who kidnapped village girls as a reward then raped them all night and killed them to keep them quiet those girls are my dead sisters something metallic bangs behind me and for a moment im dragged back into the present my heart aching for the old woman lying terrified in the trunk but pearlie washington must bear her own burden now in some ways shes the lucky one yeah billy grunts thrusting his hips with the fury of an angry carpenter driving nails its good yeah good this is good ive heard this word before but it doesnt make sense how can this be good but he tells me its good that im good and more important that im special thats good i want to be special youre too far back he gasps lunging harder scoot up to the edge of the seat i obey pearlie keeps banging on the trunk lid a pitiful sound diminishing in strength like the struggles of someone freezing to death i imagine shes praying though why i dont know when i last left her she told me that with gods help i might just make it through but god isnt going to help me thats one thing ive always known water is falling on my face at first i think its rain leaking into the car but its not its billy neals sweat he pushes up my shirt and yanks down my bra exposing my breasts yeah he says in a ragged voice kneading them roughly fuck yeah his mouth is fixed in a grimace as though this act causes him physical pain his breath is bad enough to penetrate my trance i see the cause of it too his mouth is in bad shape he thrashes his hips wildly banging me against the seat back his neck muscles straining like hes lifting weights his external jugulars distended like two pipes ready to burst im not sure whether its the sight of those veins or the proximity of his teeth that awakens me but its one of the two because in the midst of this savage assault my mind begins to work very fast and with clinical precision the masseter muscle of the jaw is the strongest in the human body it can generate two hundred pounds per square inch of biting force nine pounds of force will tear off a human ear i learned that while working in the er when i was in medical school what could two hundred pounds per square inch of force driving a mouthful of sharp teeth do to a human neck its a matter of some interest to me now because billys neck is exposed directly above me his veins bulging from the exertion of violent intercourse a caveman could tell me the answer teeth and nails were the first edged weapons homo sapiens ever possessed i tell that to homicide detectives when i brief them on my forensic speciality i could bite straight through to billys jugulars no problem clamp down and whip my head back and forth like a pit bull until hes spewing blood that would scare the hell out of himand hurt like blazesbut it wouldnt kill him it might not even disable him badly enough to keep him from shooting me in the head a torn carotid would though a torn carotid artery would kill him it would also send him into instant panic not many people can watch their blood spurt three feet into the air and remain calm but the carotids are protected by many layers of tissue the jugular veins lie just beneath the skin billy has stopped thrashing hes settled into a steady rhythm now working over me like most men ive had sex with grunting and heaving eyes blank breath coming in quick ragged gasps his breath the trachea is a hollow tube of cartilaginous rings held together by the muscle and fibrous tissue that fills the spaces between the rings car accident victims frequently die when their tracheas are crushed by steering wheels would two hundred pounds of pressure crush a trachea my instinct and training tell me yes besides two hundred pounds per square inch is a round number eskimoswho feed on a much more robust diet than the rest of uscommonly generate twice that amount of biting force a woman trying to save her life ought to be able to match that already my gaze has moved from billys bulging jugulars to the exposed semicircle of his windpipe to get a firm purchase id have to turn my head sideways so that my bite was perpendicular to the tube thats the way a leopard takes down an antelope by biting the throat with its long canines and that takes a sideways grip not like a leopard i think like a leopardess like lena theres a mole at the base of billys neck dark brown with black hairs sprouting from it his neck muscles are flexed so hard that his adams apple is invisible but i know its there my target is just above it the smallest and softest stretch of the trachea unhh he grunts oh yeahgetting close the gun is in his left handnot his dominant one he could still shoot me with it though no question but i dont have time to wait for a miracle tilting my head as far to the side as possible i open my mouth and begin sucking his neck fuck yeah he gasps oh yeah i open my mouth wider exploring the soft geography of his neck with my tongue theres the left external jugularthe ridge of the sternothyroid muscle the buried larynx as billy approaches the pinnacle of his labors he throws back his head as some men are wont to do i open my jaws as wide as they will go and clamp my teeth down on his windpipe with every ounce of strength i can bring to bear cartilage crunches loudly between my teeth i feel like ive bitten through a chicken breast bones and all billys body goes rigid as blood fills my mouth in a hot rush all i can see in my mind is the gun coming up to my head blowing my brains all over the car but it doesnt happen billy flails his arms and legs like a man caught in a threshing machine but the harder he tries to pull away from me the more room i have to yank back my head with all my strength for a few moments were locked in savage combat and then my teeth tear free his hands fly to his throat and hope surges through me like a bolus of adrenaline hes not holding the gun frothy blood pours from a ragged wound in his throat but its not the blood that shocks me its the wheeze of air escaping from the hole with every respiration that wheeze is the sound of impending death and billy neal knows it chapter ive never seen panic like that in billy neals eyes but im not waiting around to enjoy it with a wild lunge i throw my body most of the way out of the car he makes a halfhearted grab for my feet but by kicking hard i manage to get clear scrambling to my feet i fight the urge to look back as i stagger into the trees one moment of hesitation might be all he needs to pick up the gun and kill me im still stumbling through the trees when i hear the engine start terrified for pearlie i turn and race back toward the car its hard to run with your hands cuffed behind you i fall several times and by the time i get back to the clearing the cadillac is gone i hear its motor accelerating up the dirt road naked from the waist down i struggle down to the old river channel and work my way along it toward the bridge its muddy by the water but theres a lot of sand in the soil so the going isnt too bad soon i am trotting herkyjerky across the bridge to the island like some armless woman running for charity on the far side of the bridge i see my grandfathers orange pickup rusting in the weeds this time it doesnt faze me because a hundred yards to the right of it a white pickup is rolling down the perimeter road heading for the bridge i cant wave my arms but i can scream with tears streaming down my face i shout for help again and again sucking in great lungfuls of air that billy neal only wishes he could inhale right now i dont know if its my screaming or my nakedness that draws the drivers attention but the truck turns onto the bridge and comes straight toward me for a moment i think he means to run me over but then the brakes squeal and the truck shudders to a stop a black man jumps down out of the cab his eyes wide his face is a mass of scar tissue sweet jesus cries jesse billups what happened to you get back in the truck ill tell you on the way where are we going pearlie washingtons hurt shes locked in the trunk of a car and the drivers going to kill her my aunt pearlie yes jesse isnt sure whats going on but he gets behind the wheel and throws the truck into gear when i climb up into the cab beside him he reaches behind the seat grabs a dirty windbreaker and ties it around my waist go for the angola road i shout i hurt him bad hes got to be trying to get to a hospital jesse steps on the gas and heads for the shore who you talking about who did you hurt bad billy neal jesse wrinkles his lips thats a nocount motherfucker right there you know him oh i know him he the one called me away from the island the night you disappeared you remember we was talking at the cabin and i got that call i remember he told me he needed to talk to me down in baton rouge said it was real important and for me not to tell you about it i drove down there to the hotel he said he was at but he was gone he never showed he tried to kill me that night jesse shakes his scarred head why aint you got no pants on billy tried to rape me the foreman gives me a quick onceover tried he was raping me okay he was going to kill me pearlie too howd you hurt him youll see if you catch him get this damn thing moving when we reach the dirt road jesse pushes the truck as fast as it will go in the mud which is bound to be faster than pearlies cadillac i remember the caddy sliding back and forth on the curves like a heavy boat navigating a bayou damn jesse mutters aint that aunt pearlies car there fifty yards ahead of us a baby blue cadillac is sitting nosefirst against a pecan tree steam rising from its hood the drivers door is open and a mans torso and head are lying out of it the mans face is covered with bright red blood hurry i shout pearlies in the trunk jesse skids to stop a few yards from the car billy neal isnt moving but that doesnt mean hes dead the blood on his face could be from nothing more serious than a broken nose do you have a gun i ask jesse reaches behind the seat and brings up a boltaction deer rifle cover billy while i get the trunk key how you gonna get the key out the ignition with them handcuffs on youre right you do both jesse gets out of the truck and chambers a bullet with a reassuring snick of metal i jump down awkwardly from the cab and walk close behind him as he approaches billy neal that fucker moves im wasting him jesse says fine by me he edges up to the cadillac with the rifle barrel extended toward billy the way he might approach a wounded rattlesnake as he gets closer i sense the tension in his body easing and then i see why both of billys hands are empty and the graying fingers are covered in blood in the red flag of blood that is his face two eyes stare skyward the life in them all but gone when i get close enough to touch him i hear a faint whistle tiny red bubbles are frothing from the hole in his throat how the fuck did he do that in a car wreck jesse asks he didnt i did it with what my teeth jesse leans down closer mother fucker get the keys jesse yes maam while jesse retrieves the key from the ignition i kneel beside billy his eyes widen in fear and then freeze that way the whistling has stopped ive killed a man ive killed a man and all i can think is that im glad i got my fathers teeth desalle teeth are small and round kirkland teeth are large and square but prone to decay ferry teeth are hard as stones the incisors square the canines sharp i remember my daddy popping the caps off coke bottles with his bottom teeth when i was little he said he learned it from his father as this memory passes through my mind an intoxicating current of elation flows through me i could not have ferry teeth if luke ferry werent my father its not as conclusive as a dna test but i know teeth like i know nothing else luke ferry was my father look at this shit jesse cries get up out of there aunt pearlie i jump up and go to the back of the cadillac having laid his rifle on the ground jesse is now lifting his aunt carefully out of the trunk pearlies face and hands are still bloody but compared with billy neals her eyes are full of life are you all right pearlie i ask she points at my naked legs beneath the windbreaker are you yes she closes her eyes and shakes her head i told youwith the lords help youd come through i dont even try to argue yes you did jesse sets her gently on her feet and holds her erect while she tests her legs then he leaves us alone without her wig pearlie looks a hundred years old but shes not she has a lot of life left in her what you gonna do now she asks looking down at billy neals corpse what dr kirkland gonna do i dont know i cant worry about that now i have to get to new orleans she looks shocked now right now how come because i have a killer to talk to and i need to beat everyone else to her if i dont the fbi is going to arrest me pearlie shakes her head well you do what you have to do then jesse can take me to the island you need a hospital pearlie she makes a scornful face a drink of whiskey is what i need jesse returns with a small silver key in his hand you want those handcuffs off i turn my back to him and he removes the cuffs rubbing my wrists to get the blood flowing i go to the car and retrieve my jeans from the backseat aunt pearlie said you need to get to new orleans jesse says walking up to me thats right how you plan to get there im going to take one of the island trucks he looks uncomfortable dr kirkland know about that no he dont pearlie snaps from behind him and he aint gonna know jesse turns toward his aunt shes standing with her hands on her hips arms akimbo glaring at him as she might at a recalcitrant boy of seven jesse ford billups she says you gonna serve the man who beat you bloody all them years ago or you gonna help this girl do whats right he sighs heavily shit aunt pearlie i dont know what what you say the old woman shakes her finger in jesses face you know better than to curse me boy if your mama was alive shed knock you nekkid you get your narrow ass in gear now jesse billups combat veteran and foreman of desalle island nods in surrender what about that one he asks jerking his thumb toward billy neal pearlie turns up her nose leave that trash for the buzzards they got to eat too chapter tell me again about the teeth says sean were sitting at the kitchen table of my house on lake pontchartrain just as weve done so many times before spread out in a row on the table before us are eleven photographs the women in the photos vary in age from nineteen to fortysixthe women we believe most likely to constitute group x we culled these from a group of thirtyseven women ranging in age from two to seventyeightall the female relatives of the victims of the nomurs killer we chose them while talking on the phone during my drive down from desalle island and lying in the middle of the row with five women on either side of her is the woman i believe killed the six victims the teeth sean prompts me are you awake cat i turn from the table to the dark blue square of my picture window night is falling fast we all have large numbers of bacteria in our mouths i murmur the primary one is streptococcus mutans which produces the acid that causes cavities sean taps a yellow highlighter against the tabletop and the culture of the saliva from the bite marks on quentin baptiste had none of this bacteria right at twentyfour hours no growth very unusual could someone have made a mistake taking the saliva sample it wasnt some flatfoot who swabbed those wounds sean it was the fbis forensic expert we have to assume he did his job right i dont like assuming anything i look back at sean and try to keep my voice even me either it was an assumption that kept me from figuring out who the killer was yesterday when kaiser first showed me that lab report the strep thing was a flag a couple of possibilities hit melike someone on antibioticsbut i was totally distracted at the time id just learned that my aunt had committed suicide and i was trying to escape the fbi building i knew the saliva might have come from someone without teeth but the possibility of it being a babyi just automatically ruled it out i mean were dealing with serial murders here the image of a sixmonthold just doesnt go with that i feel like an idiot now ive just been so out of it for the past few days alcohol withdrawal off my meds valium pregnant i add silently it took me seeing that drooling baby at the funeral home to put it together and this is what you came up with sean says tapping the photo at the center of the row it shows a darkhaired girl of twentytwo evangeline pitre its her sean evangeline pitre is the daughter of quentin baptiste the murdered homicide detectivevictim number six that random meeting at the funeral home associated saliva and babies in my mind after that it was simple elimination i knew that none of the victims female relatives had sons younger than eighteen months old but kaiser had told me one of baptistes daughters worked at a daycare center the only question was whether that day care handled any male children under six months old the age at which teeth erupt i confirmed it by phone after i left the island but i knew sean i just knew you cant convince me that this girl committed all six murders on her own sean says i study the photo searching for signs of homicidal abilityas if such things were visible evangeline pitres eyes are deep set and dark contrasting sharply with her pasty skin she has a certain prettiness but also a guardedness in her face like the look on a stray cat that expects a kick before a scrap of food her father was a homicide cop i point out theres no telling what kind of skills and knowledge she might have and you think this girl is killing everyones abusers for them punishing them it might be just that simple or it might not pitre could be killing them without anyone else in the group knowing what shes doing but thats not what my gut tells me sean makes a wry face my gut tells me that nathan malik developed the whole fucking plan pitre may have got the saliva to put into the bite marks she might even have pulled the trigger if she knows how to shoot but where did she get the idea to use a human skull to make the marks no this chick didnt come up with the crime signature weve been seeing hell she didnt even finish high school i agree okay but that doesnt mean malik was behind it it could be any one of the other women in the group one or all youre forgetting margaret lavignes suicide note sean reminds me may god forgive me an innocent man is dead please tell dr malik to stop it malik was controlling those women cat running them like robots using their emotions to drive them he probably knew what was happening i concede that doesnt mean he planned it or helped carry it out frustration tightens seans face why are you so hellbent on defending him because malik was doing all he could to help women in severe pain women that nobody else knows how to save sean sighs we can debate this all night what are we going to do i told you i want to talk to pitre you want to go see this woman alone and not alone with you without backup youre my backup he groans in exasperation you want to go in without backup and talk to a woman you think viciously murdered six men thats right we wont be in any danger shes only interested in killing child abusers not cops margaret lavignes stepfather didnt abuse anybody but hes just as dead as the other five victims that killing was obviously a mistake caused by a false memory recalled by margaret lavigne sean nods like im making his point for him yeah and who killed dr malik who set that skull on his lap the hair club for men im hoping evangeline pitre can tell us that sean doesnt reply hes staring at me intently but he no longer sees me what is it i ask knowing an idea has hit him what do you have maybe nothing hang on he picks up his cell phone and punches in a number hes calling the second district police station where quentin baptiste worked as a homicide detective he asks to speak to oneil denoux a detective ive never heard of whos that i whisper baptistes partner hello oneil sean regan i need to know something about quentin cop to copyeah i know im working with the task force but this isnt going to the bureau okaydid quentin carry a throwdown gunfuck man this is serious yeah sean nods at me his eyes wide what caliberthanks man i owe you i know you wont forget it he hangs up his face pale quentin baptiste sometimes carried a charter arms as a throwdown my cheeks are cold jesus i look down at the photo of evangeline pitre suddenly unwilling to accept what i know to be true she is the killer what do you have against bringing in the task force sean asks do you have to be the one who personally breaks this case open i look at him in disbelief can you say projection sean shit i dont want this case to break open at all why not because im not sure the person behind these killings should go to prison not yet anyway his mouth drops open youre shitting me im not six men are dead child molesters all but one the punishment for sexual abuse isnt the death penalty maybe it should be for repeat offenders anyway he slowly shakes his head thats for the legislature to decide and a judge and jury after that if it becomes the law the legislature doesnt understand the magnitude of this crime look i killed billy neal a few hours ago and you didnt have a problem with that thats totally different he was raping you and he was going to kill you granted but child molesters arent just committing rape sean theyre committing murder the victims keep walking and talking so we think theyre still alive but their souls are dead thats one thing dr malik had right sean leans over the table youre too close to this subject to make objective decisions yet again dr maliks words come from my mouth youre right this isnt something anyone should be objective about its the worst crime in the world thats what malik told me when i first met him and now i know hes right the victims are innocent children totally unable to protect themselves sean holds up the photo of evangeline pitre this isnt a helpless child shes twentytwo years old youre speaking in chronological terms still quoting malik you have no idea whats going on behind that girls eyes for all you know she may never have matured past the age of six not emotionally with a groan sean gets up and takes a beer from my refrigerator when i see the sweating bottle i crave alcohol for the first time in many hours ive almost shitcanned my career he says wiping his mouth on his sleeve over you and me cat if we do what you want now and we get caughtthats it for me i just stare at him you made your choices freely you broke the rules on your own i never asked you to do that im going to talk to evangeline pitre tonight with or without you but be warned sean if you try to go around me on thisif you call the task force before im satisfied that ive gotten the truth from pitrethen ill go to your wife and tell her everything we ever did and everything we ever planned to do he goes pale you wouldnt do that look at me sean i will he gazes at me as though seeing me for the first time you have no idea of the intensity of emotions were dealing with here i tell him i know what an abused woman is capable of okay and before we throw evangeline pitre to the wolves ive got to understand what happened he drains his beer in one long swallow then tosses the bottle in the trash no backup he says dumb as it gets a surge of relief goes through me hes going to come at least malik is dead i tell him getting to my feet if he was pitres accomplice as you believe you have one less threat to worry about sean slips his jacket on over his shoulder holster then he bends takes a small revolver from an ankle holster and checks the cylinder and if its one of these other women or all of them pitre lives alone its a weeknight she has to work tomorrow and shes not expecting anything we go in forcefully scare her then show her a way out and if someone else is there with her we take the photos with us if we recognize one of the other women we still go in you take your glock ill carry your throwdown in my purse well be fine how do i explain your presence the same way you always did when you took me on interviews sean shakes his head but a hint of a smile animates the corners of his mouth shit we were crazy werent we certifiable but we stopped some killers he nods yeah we did that were going to do it again tonight just not the way we used to this time its not about thrills or promotions or even personal satisfaction its about justice he raises one eyebrow you figure its up to you to mete out justice this time i do sean passes me his throwdown gun a smith amp wesson featherweight four in the cylinder an empty chamber under the hammer i nod but say nothing could you use that on pitre if you had to he asks as i feel the cold weight of the gun in my hand an image of billy neals bloody corpse rises behind my eyes i can still feel his hot blood spurting into my mouth could i do something like that to a woman cat its not going to come to that chapter evangeline pitre lives in a dilapidated white house on mirabeau street in gentilly a treeshaded workingclass neighborhood of onestory clapboards its full dark when sean parks his saab behind a beatup toyota corolla at the curb out fronta car that seans partner just told us belongs to our suspect sean hangs up his cell phone and surveys the house with a veteran cops eye joey talked to the detectives who interviewed pitre after her fathers murder they said theyd hardly asked anything when kaiser showed up and took over the interview that doesnt surprise me i say trying to keep the tension out of my voice you think kaiser sensed anything about her he was a profiler at quantico for a long time he may have sean looks across the street then back at the intersection behind us he already made two passes along the street looking for signs of surveillance he saw none were way off the reservation here cat farther than weve ever been if kaiser already suspects pitre we could fuck this case up bad he looks at me his eyes sincere you dont want to call him i give sean a hard look then get out of the car and hurry up the sidewalk to the screened porch i hear the fast clicking of heels as he catches up to me move out of the light he says while i stand in the darkness under the eaves sean makes a quick circuit of the house the main sound in this neighborhood is the steady hum of airconditioning units punctuated by the muted blare of televisions cant see shit sean says trotting up to me curtains closed all the way around before he can bring up more reasons to wait i walk up the three concrete steps and knock on the door quick footsteps sound inside then the curtain in the window to our left flips sideways and a dark silhouette peers out before i can get a closer look the curtain drops back into place who is it calls a muffled female voice police says sean all authority please open the door maam ive got identification after a few moments the doorknob clicks and the door opens to the length of a chain latch sean flips open his wallet and holds his badge up to the crack in the door detective sergeant sean regan maam nopd homicide are you evangeline pitre maybe i was a friend of your fathers i dont remember you what do you want you are evangeline pitre yes whats this about your fathers murder theres a pause i already talked to some detectives the fbi too im aware of that maam but we take the death of a fellow officer very seriously we need to speak to you again well the door closes but after a brief rattle it opens again revealing the face from the photograph i studied under the vanity light during the drive over evangeline pitre looks older than she did in the photo and though her name is cajun she looks like a blend of cajun and mountain blood dark hair and eyes mated with pale skin and thin to the point of emaciation her lank hair hangs as if it hasnt been washed in days and theres a purple suck mark on her neck sorry she says ive been paranoid ever since it happened how can i help you could we come inside sean asks is it going to take that long it could you do realize were dealing with a serial killer here thats what the papers say pitre looks doubtfully behind her as though unwilling for us to see the squalor in which she lives do you really need to come in wed prefer it you know how nosy neighbors can be a quick flash of hatred in the eyes evangeline pitre doesnt get along with her neighbors okay she says finally come on in she backs up giving us room to enter the front door opens into a den ive seen a lot of houses like this one in new orleans a door at the back of the den opens directly into the kitchen through it i can see glass doors that will open from the kitchen to a square cement patio outside to my right is a hallway that leads to a couple of bedroomsthree at mostand a bathroom at the end of the hall the den is furnished with a flowerprint sofaloveseat combination that looks like it was bought at a thrift store the sofa stands against the wall opposite the front door with a rectangular coffee table in front of it the love seat faces the left wall where an old television shows the home shopping network a lazboy recliner faces the tv and an old bureau of some kind stands against the wall behind me cigarette smoke hangs lazily in the air i trace it to a cigarette burning in an ashtray on the floor beside the lazboy evangeline pitre has not once turned her back to us she backed slowly into the den then folded her arms and continued moving backward to the sofa navigating around the coffee table without even looking down she either grew up in this house or has lived here a long time seat she offers thanks says sean he turns the lazboy around so that it faces the sofa and sits i perch on the love seat with my purse in my lap barely able to restrain my curiosity evangeline pitre bends her knees and alights on the edge of the sofa like a bird as though she might take flight at any moment ms pitre sean begins wed like to angie she cuts in call me angie sean gives her his charming smile but the official tone remains in his voice all right angie my colleague is a forensic expert we sometimes consult on cases like this she wants to ask you some questions about his words blend into a meaningless monotone in my ears hes following the script we worked out during the drive over but now that im here i think its a waste of time we dont need complex psychological tactics to get this woman to open up to us angie i say in a familiar voice detective regan isnt telling you the whole truth sean stares openmouthed at me i am a forensic expert but im not here to talk to you about forensics im here to tell you what we know about these murders pitre looks to sean as though for help she liked his officious fiction better than the frank tone of my truth but sean says nothing i set my purse on the floor thinking for an instant of the revolver inside then intertwine my fingers over my knees and give pitre my most confiding smile angie have you ever seen me before she shakes her head i was a close friend of dr nathan malik something has changed in her face what a tightening of the jaw a new rigidity in the neck whatever caused the change its so profound that i feel as though a second set of eyes has opened behind the ones i can see eyes glinting with a primitive awareness whose only objective is survival ive never met evangeline pitre in my life but i know her she is me i have that second set of eyes too the ones that watch in the quivering darkness waiting for him to come what is it angie asks youre looking at me funny angie my name is catherine ferry do you know that name she blinks once slowly like a cat feigning boredom to a passing mouse no i think you do she swallows i know your father was a bad man angie other people thought he was good but i know what he really was her eyes have taken on a dull glaze i know he touched you angie i know he came to your bed in the dark he probably hurt other children too thats why he had to die isnt it for the briefest instant her eyes dart toward the back hall is she looking for escape or for help sean stands quickly do you mind if i take a look around the house i expect angie to bound to her feet in protest but instead she settles back against the flowered fabric of the couch sure she says whatever sean moves into the hallway drawing his gun from beneath his jacket as he goes to keep the girl from panicking i engage her in conversation were you one of the original members of group x angie a faint smile touches her lips youre afraid to trust me but you dont have to be i know about dr maliks movie he wanted to give me the tapes for safekeeping but i couldnt take them the fbi was after me then theyre still after me now why would they be after you they think im involved with the murders i dont mind that they dont have any real evidence i also killed a man about four hours ago he was trying to rape me and i killed him the hidden eyes probe me for deception but they find none i dont get it she says youre with a cop seans not a regular cop hes my boyfriend i was molested just like you angie i know how it feels to go through that and im not here to hurt you im here to help her eyes narrow in suspicion i can only imagine what has been done to this girl by people who promised to help her but for me to help you youre going to have to tell me the truth what about how it started i know those six men were punished for what they did but i need to know how it started angies face is as blank as the head of a mannequin did you ever meet a woman named ann hilgard for the first time i see fear in her eyes why should the mention of my aunts name generate fear in this girl angie if you dont talk to me tonight sean is going to have to tell the task force what i figured out about these murders about how youre involved and i wont be able to help you after that the fear ratchets up a notch what are you talking about what did you figure out here goes i know youre taking saliva from a baby at the daycare center where you work and putting it into the bite marks on the dead men pitres eyes widen and her bottom lip quivers like a fiveyearolds what i need to know is have you done all this on your own or is somebody helping you was dr malik helping you i know he knew about the killings he told me that he was going to talk about them in the movie wasnt he angies hands are shaking now and her left leg is bouncing up and down shes like a machine that has run reliably for twentytwo years but is now about to vibrate to pieces sean was right angie pitre couldnt have committed the murders alone did you videotape the killings for dr malik angie she stands so suddenly that i jerk back in my chair this isnt right she cries jabbing her sinewy arm at me youre not supposed to talk to me like this you dont have proof of nothing sean races back into the den gun in hand whats the matter nothing i motion for him to put the gun away he doesnt bathtubs full of hot water he says to angie why i was about to take a bath he points at the cigarette burning in the ashtray by the recliner looks like you were watching tv to me i was waiting to buy some earrings he studies her for a few moments then holsters his gun and takes his seat in the lazboy what did i miss he asks glancing at the hall angie was about to tell me whos helping her punish those men what will happen to me if i talk to you she asks sean he gives me a pointed look that i have no trouble reading its time to mirandize this girl and put her in front of a video camera that depends on what you tell us he says angie i say softly i know its hard for you to trust people its hard for me too thats one of the problems women like us have but you need to listen to me now because i dont want to put you in jail okay i am the best friend youre ever going to have the guarded look doesnt lessen in vigilance but theres confusion in her eyes shes wavering take a deep breath angie take a deep breath and get it off your chest slowly angie pitre sits back down on the sofa whose idea was it i ask who first said we cant just sit around and bitch about this we have to do something her eyes flick back and forth like those of a crack addict then she says thats hard to say you know it wasnt really like that my heart thuds in my chest i force myself not to look at sean was it dr malik she draws up her shoulders and hugs herself like a sullen child sort of i mean he was always talking about how the men who do it never stop you know how none of the treatments work except maybe castration he said only death or prison ever really stop them from doing it by it you mean sexually abusing children yeah dr malik didnt think any of the old ways worked for victims either they didnt make you well it was all a lot of feelgood talk he said when you got back out in the world it couldnt stop you from doing the bad things caused by what happened when you were a kid you know sleeping around or dope or cutting yourselfwhatever numbing behavior he called it i nod understanding ive been an alcoholic since i was a teenager there you go so thats why dr malik started group x to try something new it was like exploring a new world he said the dark world inside our heads how many women were in the group she shakes her head the survivors eyes glinting again but all the members of group x were repressedmemory cases yeah our lives were all fuckedup and we didnt know why i only got in because i was seeing this lady down at the mental health center and she referred me i dont have no money or nothing i understand sogroup x yeah what was different was that dr malik did the delayedmemory work right there with all of us in the same room and it was intense man if we werent reliving what had happened to us we were hearing somebody else relive what happened to them and the way dr malik did it you couldnt hardly stand to hear it when youre the patient he makes you like become the kid you were when it happened to you you talk in a little girls voice and everything its scary to hear i mean some of the stuff i heard was really sick some people couldnt take it two or three times people peed in their chairs seriously man and i think what happened came out of that the decision to kill an abuser she nods with sudden solemnity see even though the bad stuff had happened to most of us years ago in group x it was like it was happening right then all the terror and rage you couldnt express back then comes blasting out of you like an explosion or something and it makes you mad all of us felt that way even dr malik you could see it in his face he wanted to hurt those men the way theyd hurt us did he suggest that you do that angie shakes her head no see as intense as all that was it wasnt what started theyou know it was that we got to talking afterward we got to be friends see all of us we werent supposed to but we started meeting outside dr maliks office after group on wednesdays wed go to somebodys apartment or whatever and drink cokes and stuff and talk and it was there that we figured out the really scary thing i glance at sean hes hypnotized by pitres story what was that angie what was the really scary thing that the guys who had done this to us were probably still doing it she bites her bottom lip and nods as though talking silently to herself not to us but to other kids you know so we started watching them trying to figure out what to do but its hard to tell right unless you live in the house with themand most of us had jobs or whatever of course but i knew okay theres this kid on my dads block hes home alone all day angie shakes her head with sudden violence anyway thats what it came out of it wasnt just to punish them i mean that was part of itto make them admit what they did because none of them will you know you get up your nerve for this big blowout and then they just deny it all of it dr malik had seen it a million times they look at you like youre the crazy one and then they tell you how much they love you and shit its sick it makes you think maybe you are crazy youre not crazy angie i know that sean is staring at me again trying to get my attention hes ready to make this official right now but im not ready to call kaiser yet so basically you all agreed about what you were going to do angie nods slowly at me shes transferred her allegiance away from sean how many of you were there angie six and now six men are dead she nods again so youre finished yep she gives me a little smile did all of you help commit the crimes she doesnt respond my work is never done i quote recalling the letters boldly drawn in blood who came up with that she gives me a conspiratorial smile then shakes her head i cant tell on anybody else but your work is done thats what youre telling me yep all done somehow i knew this before i ever got here thats why i didnt let sean call in the task force who killed dr malik angie her smile vanishes replaced by a profound fear i dont know nobody knows what to do now is she lying this is very important angie who decided to make the crimes look like serial murders why didnt you just kill the men with one shot and make their deaths look like muggings or something something simple that was cool huh sean clears his throat loudly but i dont look at him a strange light has come into angies eyes you want to see one she asks one what you know what we did my pulse begins to race a murder you mean we didnt call it that we called it a sentence carrying out a sentence now i glance at sean he looks like hes about to have a stroke do you have a videotape here angie she points into the corner near the television where a cardboard box stands under a small round table jesus sean intones is that dr maliks box i ask feeling sweat in my palms the one with the stuff for the film in it angie nods then goes to the box and pulls out a videotape this is one of the only ones on vhs most of them are on those little tapes those digital things minidvs or whatever cat sean whispers i feel a familiar buzzing in the back of my head the tapes in that box could put my grandfather in jail for the rest of his life put it in the player angie i want to see chapter like a child about to show me a tape of her ballet recital angie pitre pushes the tape into the vcr and waits expectantly sean motions for me to walk over to him his face taut with anxiety by any legal standard its time to arrest evangeline pitre but im not here as an agent of the law im here to understand only then will i know what to do it can only be my threat to tell seans wife about our affair thats keeping him from calling john kaiser the tv screen goes blue then some numbers start turning quickly in the bottom left corner of the screen i go to the box in the corner of the room and look down three rows of minidv tapes lie at the bottom of the box the tapes are labeled with womens names in red magic marker one reads ann hilgard i reach down and pluck it from the box then slip it into my pocket look says sean a dark jerky image has filled the tv screen an exterior door someone is breathing rapidly almost hyperventilating a hand inside a clear plastic sleeve reaches out and inserts a key into the knob turns it whats that plastic i whisper a hazmat suit angie says her eyes locked on the screen weird huh the door opens and light floods into the lens the camera moves so quickly through the house that i feel like im watching an episode of cops a drug raid maybe but theres something familiar about it ive seen this house before its one of the nomurs crime scenes the second one holy shit says sean holy shit is that the riviere house i ask in a stunned voice yeah says angie the camera stops at an open bedroom door a paunchy grayhaired man wearing white boxer shorts looks over from his dresser andrus riviere retired pharmacist age sixtysix whatever he sees in the door terrifies him turn around orders a muffled voice it sounds female they cant hear you good in the suit angie says but it keeps you from leaving hair and stuff in the house cat says sean cat we face the wall shouts the voice put up your hands andrus riviere turns his back to the camera and lifts his flabby arms into the air take whatever you want he says in a shaky voice moneyyou want money a bright red flower blooms in the back of his undershirt shit cries sean riviere crumples to the floor like a spineshot deer my heart pounds as the camera moves jerkily across the bedroom for a moment i see only the ceiling then i see riviere again hes lying on his back his face almost bloodless from fear he tries to move screams in agony what did you do to carol asks the muffled voice i cant move my legs riviere wails oh god say what you did to carol what your daughter carol lantana did you have sex with carol when she was a little girl rivieres eyes bulge until i fear theyll burst from their sockets for andrus riviere the women in the hazmat suits are hell incarnate carol he echoes no no no did you rape carol insists the voice no thats crazy i never did anything like that the camera backs off then a plasticencased hand holds the barrel of a revolver to rivieres forehead make peace with god admit what you did the old pharmacist is blubbering saliva running down his chin carol is that you in there admit what you did screams the voice definitely female riviere shakes his head violently on the screen a second figure wearing a hazmat kneels beside riviere and opens the jaws of the skull i found in dr maliks lap at the motel the hand presses the open mouth to rivieres chest and clamps the teeth down on pale flesh riviere shrieks in pain jesus breathes sean the figure is obviously using all its strength to drive the teeth together riviere screams again and then the skull is withdrawn rivieres weeping now and panting as if he cant breathe bite him again shouts the voice no all rightall right i couldnt help itcouldnt stop you already know that dont you rivieres face contorts in pain i need a doctor please how old was carol when you did it riviere closes his eyes and shakes his head i dont knowdont know the gun barrel cracks the bridge of his nose three he wails four i dont know do you repent the eyes bulge again the fear in them absolute the muffled voice is relentless doyourepent riviere nods with sudden penitence a desperate sinner seeing a way to redemption yes i repenti do i know it was wrong i need help please help me im here to help you the hand presses the gun barrel flush against andrus rivieres forehead and blows his brains out the back of his head i jerk in shock unable to comprehend that im witnessing the actual events i tried to reconstruct from evidence at the crime scene no reconstruction could ever capture the brutality of this execution and i know suddenly and beyond doubt that my idea of forcing these women to stop but not giving their names to the fbi was a fantasy born of my own pain and na√£vet√£ its true that andrus riviere will never molest another child but what guarantee do i have that the woman who pulled that trigger wont decide tomorrow that someone less guilty than riviere deserves a death sentence margaret lavignes stepfather already became an innocent victim cat its time to make some calls sean says quietly hes right cat i have to a muted thud cuts off sean in midsentence when i turn i see a naked woman with blonde hair holding a green plastic barbell in one hand and a butcher knife in the other half an hour ago i was studying her picture on my kitchen table shes stacey lorio age thirtysix registered nurse and the daughter of colonel frank moreland our first victim shes knocked sean unconscious with a single blow from a barbell as i stare in shock she kneels and yanks his glock from his shoulder holster then points it at my chest i hid under the dirty clothes in the closet she says to angie panting from excitement for a minute i thought he saw me why did you hit him i ask trying not to glance at my purse beside the love seat shut up lorio snaps straightening up shes not much taller than angie pitre but her rawboned body is mostly muscle she has stretch marks and sagging breasts but beyond that she looks as hard as a frozen ham we didnt come here to arrest anybody stacey she laughs then glances at angie i know better than that you rich cunt her face is bright red her chest blotchy with scarlet marks do you know me stacey what do you think your aunt was the bitch who screwed up my life what yeah she came along with her perfect teeth her thousanddollar shoes and her southern belle voice and he didnt know which way was up anymore who christ who do you think suddenly everything is clear this woman was romantically involved with nathan malik until my aunt took him away from her why should i be surprised ann had been seduced by one of her shrinks before and when i spoke to her on the telephone about paying maliks bail shed acted as if it were the most natural thing in the world you killed dr malik i think aloud youre the one who knocked me out in the motel he left me no choice she says he was going to give us up to the police why would he do that to save himself from going to jail says angie pitre dr malik wasnt in any danger of being convicted for murder you dont know that says lorio but all he really cared about was his personal crusade his master plan he wanted us to go to trial he wanted the world to see what sexual abuse had driven us to do i dont care who knows angie says suddenly upset we did what we had to do god only knows how many kids we saved lorio looks at angie like a protective older sister thats right ang but theres no need for you to waste your life in jail not to make old nathan famous the worlds not going to understand what we did and a lot of men would try to make sure we got the death penalty i think youre wrong stacey i say in the most submissive voice i can muster i think a lot of people would understand she laughs thats easy to say but im not spending my life in prison just to be the flavor of the week on oprah we accomplished what we set out to do its over now is it what about me i look down at sean who hasnt moved once what about him you two stuck your noses in where they didnt belong i cant help that are you going to kill me im just like you stacey i was molested just like you youre like me her eyes are cold youre nothing like me are you that blind stacey you think being raised with money can protect you from your own father or your grandfather angie pitre is wringing her hands stacey this isnt what we said you know nobody else would go along with this lorio looks sharply at angie nobody else had the nerve to go through with any of it did they they sat back while we did their dirty work for them they watched the people who hurt them beg for forgiveness on tv but did they lift one fucking finger did they get their hands bloody angie shakes her head i know i know but still still what shes like us stacey lorio jerks the gun toward sean and him hes a cop a homicide detective he wants to send you to the death house you heard what he said its time to make some calls do you want to ride the needle ang shit you cant even give blood without puking i know butgod i dont know lorios lips tighten into a white line i know baby you just go in the kitchen while mama takes care of business stacey lorio pulls a cushion off the sofa with her free hand and i know then that im living the last moments of my life i got away from billy neal i wont be so lucky again my eyes go to my purse on the floor but it might as well be a mile away lorio takes a step toward me puts the gun behind the cushion and fires everything registers out of order a horse kicks me in the belly tiny fragments of foam rubber fill the air wet red blood washes down my stomach and a muffled boom sounds in my ears then a woman screams what i ask walking backward trying to stay on my feet stacey no lorio is following me with the cushion the black barrel of seans glock protruding through the foam padding shes two feet away when angie pitre jumps on her back and yanks back both arms they go down in a pile of flailing limbs i want to help angie but instead i sit down hard on the love seat oh god somebody moans its me the blood has run down my front and begun soaking my crotch the gun explodes again and somebody shrieks but the women keep fighting i can see my purse on the floor but i cant bend to reach it stacey lorio is sitting on angies chest now screaming at her to stop fighting but angie keeps flailing like a crazed little girl with a loud curse lorio turns the gun in her hand and smacks angie across the face with its butt angie pitre stops fighting stacey is climbing off her when seans hand rises from the floor and grips her elbow he must be only halfconscious because lorio laughs and shucks his grip as easily as the hand of a little boy walking with calm assurance she lifts the other cushion off the couch and lays it over seans face i look down at my purse willing myself to bend at the waist stacey presses the barrel of seans gun over the cushion right about where seans forehead would be and fires as i scream in rage a tiny hole appears between staceys breasts it looks almost painted on but within seconds she is sucking for air as though steel bands have been locked around her chest seans featherweight smith amp wesson is shaking in my hand stacey opens her mouth to speak but a geyser of blood erupts from her throat angie screams stacey knees buckle and she falls into a kneeling position beside sean she looks down at him raises the gun over the cushion then keeps raising it trying to bring it to bear on me dont i whisper but the gun keeps rising i shoot her in the face blowing a fine red mist into the air behind her as stacey lorio falls all i can think of is the terrible irony that it was my grandfather who taught me how to shoot a handgun then everything goes black chapter i spent much of the week after i was shot going to funerals two were expected one was not two were postponed until i was discharged from tulane university hospital and thanks to stacey lorio i had to ride in a wheelchair to all of them the bullet she fired from seans gun tore through my stomach and lodged in a muscle in my back i lost a lot of blood and also my spleen but i didnt lose my baby sean nearly drowned in his own blood his head had been turned sideways beneath the couch cushion when lorio fired so instead of drilling through his foreheadas she had intended for it to dothe bullet punched through his right cheek a couple of inches anterior to his ear it smashed five teeth shattered his hard palate and pulped part of his maxillary sinuses sean owes his life to angie pitre who instead of fleeing the scene called and stayed with us until paramedics and police arrived stacey lorio died instantly from my second bullet i feel a deep sadness at the childhood trauma that created the hatefilled adult she had become but i feel no guilt over killing her she meant to murder both sean and me in cold blood sean blamed himself for not cracking lorios rock solid alibis for the murders but no one else had either it turned out that her exhusband was a drug addict because stacey kept him supplied with pills from the clinic where she worked he would have given her alibis for a dozen more murders and sworn to them all under oath lorios other alibis had been provided by two women later identified as members of group x with hindsight all seems obvious special agent kaiser spent a lot of time in my hospital room the doctors tried to keep him out but kaiser can be pretty pushy when he wants to be he demanded to know every detail of what had happened to me during the case and of how i had solved the riddle of who was doing the killing he was obsessed with determining once and for all whether the six murders in new orleans had any connection to the events in natchez and on desalle island given the link between ann and dr malikand in a way malik and meit seemed inconceivable that they were not causally related but they werent not really dr hannah goldman put it best when she dropped by to see me and found kaiser at my bedside she patiently laid out the connections by drawing a line diagram on the back of a hospital cafeteria menu the primary link between natchez and new orleans was sexual abuse nathan malik first noticed me in jackson mississippi because i was sleeping with a man twentyfive years my senior that relationshipa symptom of my childhood abusealso resulted in my being expelled from medical school which led me into dentistry and ultimately into forensic odontology maliks childhood abuse led him slowly but surely into work with sexual abuse victims he became the natural end point of my aunt anns quest to find a therapist who could control the terrible fallout of her childhood sexual abuse given anns historyand nathan maliks sexual predilectionssexual involvement between the two of them was almost inevitable maliks childhood abuse also made him ripe for the countertransference that caused him to encourage vigilante justice among the patients in group x the murders committed by stacey lorio and angie pitreand the decision by those women to use bite marks to mask the true nature of the crimesresulted in my being called into the case the fbis search of stacey lorios apartment turned up a huge collection of truecrime paperbacks filled with underlined sections about forensics and the psychology of sexual homicide as soon as dr malik became aware of my involvement in the investigation he became obsessed with communicating with me given his knowledge of my familys secret historyand what ann had probably told him about mehe felt that my appearance represented some sort of meaningful synchronicity and he could not ignore it the simple answer dr goldman concluded is that sick people attract other sick people psychologically speaking of course according to hannah though my recent wave of nightmares about my grandfather and the truck had nothing to do with the murders in new orleans those she insisted were the result of my pregnancy the moment my brain knew that i was going to have a child my subconscious realized that to protect my baby i needed to remember my childhood abuse evolution at work hannah said carrying on the species is the highest priority of any organism your brain decided that protecting your child was more important than protecting you from the trauma of your own past thus the flood of nightmares and flashbacks you were going to remember what your grandfather did to you whether anyone got killed here in new orleans or not take my word for that but not even hannah could explain what it was about the murder scenes that had clued me in on the true nature of the crimes like the fbi i had been presented with classic evidence of a male sexual predator at work and i had looked at similar scenes many times before so what caused my panic attacks what told me that i was looking at violence that was somehow related to sexual abuse similar to my own hannah thought it might have been the sight of naked old men but in the end i decided it was the smallest of clues my first attack happened at the murder scene of the third victim eleven days before at the home of the second victimandrus rivierei had seen a little girl who stuck in my mind her grandfather had just died violently yet she seemed almost wild with joyous energy she was racing around the house as if her birthday party were about to start and knowing what i know now i believe that it was andrus rivieres murder had released that little girl from a living hell and something about her facesomething in her toowise eyes i think nowsent me a message without my knowing it as pearlie had known subconsciously about anns abuse when she was a child i knew subconsciously that something was wrong in the riviere house something that death had remedied kaiser stunned me by telling me that dr malik had willed all the videotapes and other raw materials for his documentary film project to me these included his patient records which were found in biloxi mississippi cached in the home of my aunts third husband as soon as these materials are released from the nopd evidence room they will be delivered to me at some point i intend to review them all and begin working to finish maliks film i will include no footage of the murders but i will do all i can to explain their motivation the day i was to be discharged from the tulane hospital i learned that margaret lavigne was also a patient there i had an orderly wheel me down to her floor and leave me alone in her room margaret lay comatose beneath a white sheet connected to an assortment of monitors and tubes the insulin shed injected into her veins had turned her brain into a useless gray lump john kaiser had told me that lavignes mother was likely to authorize the withdrawal of life support later in the week i held margarets hand for a while thinking quietly about the suicide note shed left behind and of the horror she must have felt when she realized shed condemned an innocent man to death like me she had been unable to believe that her father had raped her she erroneously blamed her stepfather instead im thankful that in my own case i was right but i could so easily have been wrong the first funeral i attended was nathan maliks the psychiatrist had elected to be cremated so it was a memorial service held in a new orleans park about fifty people attended most of them women there were a few men too some of them obviously vietnam veterans a buddhist monk chanted and said some prayers and everyone laid flowers by the urn the second funeral was anns and it was held in natchez michael wells drove me to mcdonoughs funeral home helped me into my wheelchair and even drove me out to the cemetery afterward for the burial while the minister gave a generic eulogy i sat in the pews reserved for family and thought of the tape ann had made for nathan malik the minidv cassette i stole from the box at angie pitres house had made it all the way to the hospital in my purse i borrowed a camcorder to watch it but i could only endure about ten minutes before i was overwhelmed ann had suffered far more than the rest of us for whatever reason she had not dissociated during her abuse she had felt and processed and remembered every agonizing detail her primary concern had been protecting her younger sistermy mother and though she failed in that goal she tried her best she did this by luring my grandfather to her room whenever she sensed his attention wandering to her sister but ann wasnt trying to protect only gwen the reason for her silence over the years was simple grandpapa had threatened that if she ever revealed what he was doing to her he would kill both her sister and her mother ann had no doubt that he would carry out his threat she knew better than any of us that he was capable of murder the third funeralthe unexpected onewas held one day after anns today i didnt go to the funeral home i had michael drive me out to the cemetery to sit beside anns freshly covered grave i stared at the mound of wet brown earth on the grass and wondered if i could somehow have prevented her suicide michael assured me that i could not and im trying my best to believe him a few minutes before the mourners were to arrive michael wheeled me up the lane to a vantage point from which i could watch the burial service without being bothered and here i sit the line of luxury cars behind the black hearse seems to go on forever like the cortege of a slain president i shouldnt be surprised dr william kirkland was a wealthy powerful and respected man a pillar of the community my mother tried to keep the funeral simple but in the end she gave in to the wellintentioned friends who insisted on a large production including eulogies delivered by the mayor the attorney general and the governor of mississippi everyone seems content to pretend that my grandfathers death was an accident that he drove off the edge of the bridge to desalle island in bright sunlight at midday seems to escape everyones attention a few people have mentioned his recent strokewhich happened a year agoand recalled his doctor forbidding him to drive in fact they say it was the untimely death of his driverbilly nealthat caused my grandfather to drive down to the island alone to deal with some urgent business matters the truth is much simpler my grandfather killed himself he knew that his lifes foul secret was about to be exposed that all of his power and money would be insufficient to stop one of his victimsmefrom finally revealing his depravity to the world and his pride could not abide that he probably saw himself as choosing a manly death even a noble one but i know him for what he was he was what he once called my father in front of me when i was a little girl yellow when all was said and done william kirkland md was a stinking coward im here today because i want to see him lowered into the ground i need that closure when youve lived with a demon all your life and you somehow escape him its important to see him buried if old mr mcdonough would have let me id have walked into the prep room and driven a stake through my grandfathers heart and yethe didnt begin life as a monster he began it as an innocent little boy who lost his parents in a car wreck on the way to his baptism it was only laterill never know whenthat the poison with which he infected me was passed into him decades ago on some dark and silent country night his innocence was stolen and a transformation began that would transform the lives of countless others including mine one mystery that will probably remain unsolved is why grandpapa was buying up my fathers sculptures was he driven by guilt over the life he had stolen so long ago or was he on some halfmad quest to understand the creative spark that he had snuffed out creativity being the one talent he had never really possessed perhaps time or some asyetundiscovered document will give me an answer someday the burial service is mercifully brief as the sky is threatening rain the mourners quickly return to their cars and the long line begins to leave the cemetery when all of them have gone a solitary figure remains beside the grave pearlie washington shes wearing a black dress and a huge black hat but i know her bony figure as well as i know my mothers probably better has she stayed behind to mourn my grandfather alone or ann or has she stayed because she knows whats about to happen in the desalle family plot as michael wheels me down the hill pearlie stands motionless looking down at grandpapas grave as we near her a white dodge caravan with ornate silver trim appears in the lane and rolls slowly to a stop near the low wall two men in dark suits get out walk to the back of the van and unload a bronze casket they settle it onto a collapsible gurney then work the gurney across the grass to the corner of the plot where a green tarp is staked out over a long hole in the ground the headstone above the tarp reads luke ferry as michael rolls me through the gate pearlie walks over to me and touches my hand they doing what i think theyre doing yes i see pain in her eyes why you didnt tell me about it i loved that boy too i wanted to be alone with him im sorry pearlie you want me to go no the old woman watches the men strip the tarp from the ground as they fold it up soft rain begins to fall wheres your mama pearlie asks she said she couldnt stand to bury her husband a second time pearlie sighs heavily shes probably right michael touches my elbow and leans down to my ear im going to give you a few minutes i take his hand and squeeze it thanks i wont be long take your time as he walks away pearlie turns and watches him leave the family plot he seems like a good man he is does he know you carrying another mans child i look up at the curious brown eyes yes and he still wants to see you yes she shakes her head as though at some rare and wonderful sight thats a man you need to stick with right there i feel my mouth smile i think youre right pearlie takes my hand in hers and squeezes tight lord its about time you settled down we been needing some babies around that old place i take a deep breath and look toward grandpapas grave i think i was waiting for him to go first pearlie nods lord knows thats right daddys casket lies beside the open grave now the rain pattering against its burnished lid strangely the sound doesnt bother me at all could you open it for me now please i ask one of the men from the funeral home takes a hex key from his pocket and begins unsealing the casket what pearlie gasps her eyes filled with horror what you doing girl thats bad luck doing something like that i shake my head no its not as the man from the funeral home lifts the coffin lid i reach beneath my wheelchair to the luggage pocket beneath i feel soft fur in my palm using all my strength i stand and walk slowly to the coffin my father looks just as he did the other day like a young man sleeping on the couch after a sunday dinner gritting my teeth against pain i bend at the waist and lay lena the leopardess in the crook of daddys elbow then i straighten up again so you wont be lonely i say softly before i turn away i take a folded piece of paper from my pocket and drop it in the casket near my fathers knee its one of the drawings from the sketchbook he kept in the green bag in the barn a charcoal rendering of louise butler smiling at him with unbounded love in her eyes perhaps i should feel guilty for this but i dont louise probably relieved luke ferry of more pain than any of us in those last years she accepted him for what he wasa profoundly wounded man goodbye daddy i murmur thank you for trying i turn from the casket and walk back to the wheelchair signaling michael as i go he comes quickly i want to see the river i tell him will you wheel me up to jewish hill towering three hundred feet above the mississippi jewish hill offers the most commanding view of the river ive ever seen michael cant hide his dismay its raining cat i know i like it will you come with me pearlie all right baby can you make it michael asks her pearlie snorts indignantly i may be over seventy years old but i can still walk from red lick to rodney and have strength left over for a days work michael laughs apparently recognizing the names of two tiny mississippi towns over twenty miles apart he pushes me up the hill at a steady pace and before long we are staring over the milewide tide of river at the vast plains of the louisiana delta thats too big to look at pearlie says i love it i say softly i used to come here whenever i felt trapped in this town i think you always been trapped here until your granddaddy died you know he killed himself i murmur theres a long silence then pearlie says i dont know any such thing i look up at her come on you dont really think he went off that bridge by accident she looks at michael then back at me no i dont a low humming has started in my head what is it pearlie what do you know she looks as serious as ive ever seen her i know everything how much do you want to know same as you she looks doubtfully at michael some things its best not to know doctor why dont you go get the car michael looks down at me and i nod as he walks away pearlie steps in front of the wheelchair and fixes me in her gaze with an old womans severity after you left me on the island i stayed with louise butler awhile but i was nervous as a cat i couldnt rest so i took me a walk i wound up on the other side of the lake at the big house shes talking about my grandfathers lodge the showplace designed by a hays town before i knew what i was doing i was tearing that place apart i was still looking for the pictures see i knew they had to be somewhere she sighs and looks at the ground well i found em they was inside a hollow book just one out of hundreds in that library down there and they were bad baby lots worse than the two of you and ann in the swimming pool what did they show pearlie wrinkles her nose as though smelling rotten meat everything it made me sick to look at them i went to use the bathroom and i was crying so bad i couldnt stop and then i heard something grandpapa no jesse jesse billups he saw the pictures pearlie nods her face filled with anxiety and they wasnt just pictures of any old children some of them were from the island jesse recognized them some of them belonged to people still living down there my god what did he do he cursed me then he took the pictures and left with them what happened pearlie what did he do with them he showed them to some other men down there some of the daddies of them children see the women had known about dr kirkland just like i guessed some of them anyway but they never let their menfolk know but now the men knew and they was killing mad just like the women worried they would be well jesse called dr kirkland and told him somebody had busted into the big house and tore everything up said dr kirkland ought to come right away i close my eyes almost afraid to hear the end of the story you sure you want to hear this baby yes when dr kirkland got there jesse and the other men put him in a truck and carried him round to big leons house whos big leon one of the men on the island he spent twenty years on angola farm jesse showed leon the pictures and told him what dr kirkland had done then he told leon you can have him for two hours just dont mark him up none oh my god as pearlie nods her eyes glow with fierce knowledge two hours later they went back and got him then they did what that billy neal was gonna do to you and me what tied him to the steering wheel of his car and ran it off the bridge jesus after a while one of them swum down and took the rope off dr kirklands hands pearlie is watching me closely waiting to see my reaction you said you wanted to know did you see grandpapa at all during any of this no all i know is what jesse told me my mind is filled with one question did he beg for his life at the end no baby he cursed them till his head went under the water wasnt nothing gentle left in that old man hell curse the devil hisself when he gets to hell i suddenly feel exhausted what you gonna do now pearlie asks i dont know wait for my wound to heal i guess the bullet wound i mean the other could take my whole life i meant about the house malmaison what do you mean pearlie shrugs well its gonna be yours now what i thought you knew dr kirkland always said miss gwen couldnt take care of her own self much less the wealth she was born into thats why billy neal hated you so bad you gonna get just about everything her words take some time to register i have no idea what might be included in my grandfathers estate but its bound to be enormous so what you gonna do sell it all i say pearlie makes an uncertain sound the island too why not i dont ever want to see it again if you sell that island the people down there wont have nowhere to go you own it all the houses and everything they just rent for a few moments images of the island rush through my head but the pain that comes with them is too much to bear they can have it pearlie the whole damn thing its theirs anyway do you mean that that islands worth a piece of money i couldnt care less ill have the lawyers draw up papers first thing you and jesse work out fair shares for everybody except for louise butler pearlies back stiffens what about her louise gets the lodge pearlie gasps the big house youre not serious those women down there hate louise its her house pearlie as of today the old woman makes several noises i cannot interpret then she says i guess you know what youre doing for the first time i think i do do you see michael im ready to go we dont need no michael i can push this chair good as any man she steps behind the wheelchair and takes the handles in her firm grip as she turns me around i catch a last glimpse of the river vast and majestic under the shadows of the rain the water down there will soon flow past desalle island baton rouge new orleans and finally into the gulf of mexico where ill be then i dont know but the chain of misery forged through the generations of my family has finally been broken by me thats about as good a start as i can imagine pearlie pushes me back toward the lane where michaels expedition waits as we approach michael gets out and waves i lay one hand on my stomach and close my eyes im not touching the wounded place but a spot lower down i dont need a drink now i dont need anything but for the first time in my life i feel truly free to choose what i want its going to be different for you i whisper rubbing my tummy in a slow circle your mama knows what love is acknowledgments first and foremost i thank the women and men who spoke frankly to me about private matters for obvious reasons i will not name them here accounts of childhood sexual abuse are difficult to deal with even on the written page to recount personal experiences is nothing short of heroic few crime victims face the battles that those who as adults begin to recall childhood sexual abuse must fight far too often family members and the general public refuse to believe their claims even in the face of corroborative evidence none of us wants to think about the harrowing crimes that innocent children suffer in
