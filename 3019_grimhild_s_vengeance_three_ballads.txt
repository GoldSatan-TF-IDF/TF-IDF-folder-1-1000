introduction borrow and the kjæmpeviser the modern poetical literature of denmark opens with a collection of epical and lyrical poems from the middle ages which are loosely connected under the title of kjæmpeviser or heroic ballads of these the latest scholarship recognises nearly but in the time of borrow the number did not much exceed these ballads deal with halfhistoric events which are so completely masked by fantastic supernatural and incoherent imagery that their positive relation to history can rarely be discovered nevertheless they throw a very valuable light upon the manners of mediaeval society in scandinavia and they are often of high poetical beauty no conjecture can be formed as to the authors of these ballads and even the centuries in which they were composed are uncertain grimm believed them to be uralt and attributed them to the th and th centuries but on linguistic grounds this extreme antiquity cannot be maintained it is now supposed that they were composed at various times between and and that in their present form they bear the stamp of the period when they were first collected by the danish antiquaries of the sixteenth century the circumstances in which this famous collection of folksongs came into public notice were of a romantic nature sophia queen of denmark when sailing across the sound in the year was driven by stress of weather to take shelter in the little islandharbour of hveen where the famous observatory stood close by the house of the astronomer tycho brahe it so happened that at that very time brahe was entertaining as a guest the most eminent danish man of letters of that age anders sörensen vedel vedel whose labours were encyclopædic was engaged in preserving all the monuments of danish mediaeval history and learning which he could discover in the monasteries and libraries of denmark he had been much encouraged in this work by the monk of roeskilde peder olufsen who on his deathbed about had placed in vedels hands all the mss which he had collected queen sophia cloistered in the ouranienborg with her antiquary and her astronomer and waiting for the tempest to moderate desired to be amused with stories of her national history vedel ventured to read to her some of the legendary poems which still lingered among the people and she was so enchanted with them that she commanded him when he returned to the mainland to make a collection of these ballads and publish them accordingly in vedel issued from the private printingpress in his house called liljeborg at ribe in jutland a selection of mediaeval ballads under the title of et hundred udvalgte danske viser this volume is one of the landmarks of scandinavian and indeed of european literary history vedel made another collection this time of ancient loveballads which he called tragica it was not published until long after his death but the volume of is the fountainhead of all that has since been written about the heroic ballads of the north and it is impossible to overrate the services of vedel in preserving what was even then ready to disappear it seems moreover that he was careful of the text and later scholarship has come more and more to place confidence in his transcripts this was unfortunately not the case with the next pioneer in the same field although he deserves great credit also peter petersen syv was a very able philologist who was also a minor poet of ambition in he reprinted and edited vedels text adding more kjæmpeviser which had been unknown to vedel but his work was not so well done syv was something of a pedant and unfortunately either too critical or not critical enough he venturedto correct the irregularities of the ballads and not seldom has spoiled them he bore the proud title of philologer royal of denmark and he was above all things else a grammarian but he added to our store of ballads no one during the eighteenth century advanced on the labours of vedel and syv and their treasuries of beautiful anonymous poetry seem to have attracted no attention in the rest of europe but in the first decade of the nineteenth century in consequence of what we call the romantic revival poets and scholars in many countries turned simultaneously to the treasurehouse of danish balladry jamiesons work to which i shall presently return dates from about the same time herder translated one or two kjæmpeviser in his stimmen der völker and in wilhelm carl grimm started his full translation under the title of altdänische heldenlieder balladen and märchen which appeared in but it appears that grimm had heard and perhaps even seen the proofs of a danish edition of the very highest importance the udvalgte danske viser fra middlealderen the first volume of which was brought out by abrahamson nyerup and rahbek in abrahamson dropped out but the work was completed by the others the fifth and last volume appearing in borrows relation to these texts must now be considered and it offers some difficulty in he published a volume of verse entitled romantic ballads translated from the danish and in the preface he uses these wordsi expect shortly to lay before the public a complete translation of the kiæmpé viser made by me some years ago it is necessary to bear in mind that there are these two collections of borrows translations from the kjæmpeviser the second of which as we shall see he did not contrive to publish no doubt he was anxious to emphasise the novelty and rarity of his literary adventures but his attitude to jamieson is very strange as early as robert jamieson had published a volume of popular ballads in which he had translated several of the kjæmpeviser and had pointed out their value in relation to the ancient scottish poems of a similar kind sir walter scott paid much flattering attention to jamiesons work which also attracted a good deal of notice in denmark and germany and inspired the drei altschottische lieder of g d gräter it is scarcely possible that borrow was not aware of all this yet he never mentions the name of jamieson and in he spoke boldly of himself as breaking into unknown and untrodden paths it is not impossible that sir walter scotts patronage of jamieson had something to do with the ungenerous petulance of borrows references to the great novelist in lavengro but borrows attitude to the contemporary scholars of denmark is still more surprising without saying so in exact words he gives us to understand that he translated all the kjæmpeviser from the original edition of vedel it would be rash to say that borrow was not acquainted with the danske viser of for he does in one place quote whether at firsthand or not from vedels preface but it requires great faith to accept his own account of his approach to the poems in lavengro at a point which knapp has dated borrow tells with brilliant picturesqueness how he purchased by permitting the wife of an elderly yeoman to kiss his cheek a strange and uncouthlooking volume which had formed part of the kit of some redhaired fishermen who were wrecked on the norfolk coast it was not very large but instead of the usual covering was bound in wood and was compassed with strong iron clasps it was a printed book but the pages were not of paper but vellum and the characters were black and resembled those generally termed gothic and now i had in my possession a danish book which from its appearance might be supposed to have belonged to the very old danes indeed but how was i to turn it to any account i had the book it is true but i did not understand the language and how was i to overcome that difficulty hardly by poring over the book yet i did pore over the book again but with all my poring i could not understand it and then i became angry and i bit my lips till the blood came and i occasionally tore a handful from my hair and flung it upon the floor but that did not mend the matter for still i did not understand the book which however i began to see was written in rhyme for the book was a book of ballads about the deeds of knights and champions and men of huge stature collected by one anders vedel this story of a vellum copy of the rare edition of thrown up on the shore of norfolk with a common sailors effects is told in borrows best style but how far is it true whether it is entirely or only partly romance the inference that borrow translated the kjæmpeviser by the light of nature from this gothic text must be abandoned he may or may not have handled a copy of vedel but he made his translations as internal evidence amply proves from the five volumes of abrahamson nyerup and rahbek published between and this was a cheap and highly accessible edition and was in the hands of the booksellers complete at least six years before borrow began to read danish he accepted the text of these scholars and their arrangement he translated their notes word for wordand gave them out as his own his volume of and the privately printed later ballads are wholly founded upon abrahamson nyerup and rahbek and yet so far as i can discover he never mentions their names in any part of his writings he professed that the public should believe his knowledge to be wholly derived from a mysterious blackletter volume washed up on the sands of his native county and read by him with agonies of labour by the pure light of divination in january a prospectus was put forth in which the songs of scandinavia translated by dr bowring and mr borrow was offered to subscribers at the price of a guinea this was an attempt on the part of borrow languidly assented to by bowring to give publicity to some kjæmpeviser which the former had translated since the publicationof his romantic ballads of i am terribly afraid writes borrow of being forestalled in the kæmpe viser by some of those scotch blackguards a hit no doubt at jamieson he was working hard at his translations and he was further stimulated by meeting in london with the danish theologian and poetical student nikolai frederik severin grundtvig who had done much to popularise the kjæmpeviser in his native country but bowring proved a broken reed and borrow suffered once again one of those disappointments which so naturally embittered him it was not until however some seven years before his death that he finally gave up all hope the mss of his translations of the kjæmpeviser passed into the hands of mrs macoubrey the ballad of grimhilds vengeance grimhilds hevn is given in three versions by abrahamson nyerup and rahbek borrow has closely followed the editors of and has translated each of the versions he added a number of notes the ms of which is mutilated but not so much so as to prevent us from observing that these are translated word for word from the appendix of abrahamson nyerup and rahbek but so far as can be discerned from the fragmentary and mutilated manuscripts at our disposal without a sign of acknowledgment edmund gosse grimhilds vengeance song the first it was the proud dame grimhild prepares the mead and beer and unto her the valiant knights she bids from far and near she bade them come and not delay to tournament and strife it was the hero hogen who lost his youthful life it was the hero hogen along the shore went he and there he found upon the sand the maiden of the sea now hail thou maiden of the
